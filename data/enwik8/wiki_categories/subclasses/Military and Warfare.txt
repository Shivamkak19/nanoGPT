==Civil War and reconstruction==
===Conducting the war effort===
The war was a source of constant frustration for the president, and it occupied nearly all of his time. Lincoln had a contentious relationship with General [[George B. McClellan]], who became general-in-chief of all the Union armies in the wake of the embarrassing Union defeat at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] and after the retirement of [[Winfield Scott]] in late 1861. Lincoln wished to take an active part in planning the war strategy despite his inexperience in military affairs. Lincoln's strategic priorities were two-fold: first, to ensure that Washington, D.C., was well-defended; and second, to conduct an aggressive war effort in hopes of ending the war quickly and appeasing the Northern public and press, who pushed for an offensive war. McClellan, a youthful [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] graduate and railroad executive called back to military service, took a more cautious approach. McClellan took several months to plan and execute his [[Peninsula Campaign]], which involved capturing [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] by moving the [[Army of the Potomac]] by boat to the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[James River (Virginia)|James]] and [[York River (Virginia)|York Rivers]]. McClellan's delay irritated Lincoln, as did McClellan's insistence that no troops were needed to defend Washington, D.C. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops to defend the capital, a decision McClellan blamed for the ultimate failure of his Peninsula Campaign.

McClellan, a lifelong [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who was temperamentally conservative, was relieved as general-in-chief after releasing his ''[[Harrison's Landing Letter]]'', where he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint fellow Republican [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]] as head of the new [[Army of Virginia]]. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire for the Union to move towards Richmond from the north, thus guarding Washington, D.C. However, Pope was soundly defeated at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] during the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac back into the defenses of Washington for a second time. Pope was sent to Minnesota to fight the [[Sioux]]. 

Panicked by Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s invasion of [[Maryland]], Lincoln restored McClellan to command of all forces around Washington in time for the [[Battle of Antietam]] in September 1862. It was the Union victory in that battle that allowed Lincoln to release his Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln relieved McClellan of command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed Republican [[Ambrose Burnside]] to head the Army of the Potomac, who promised to follow through on Lincoln's strategic vision for an aggressive offensive against Lee and Richmond. After Burnside was stunningly defeated at [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], [[Joseph Hooker]] was given command, despite his idle talk about becoming a military strong man. Hooker was routed by Lee at [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]] in May 1863 and also relieved of command.

After the Union victory at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], [[George G. Meade | Meade's]] failure to pursue Lee, and months of inactivity for the Army of the Potomac, Lincoln decided to bring in a western general: General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. He had a solid string of victories in the Western Theater, including [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] and [[Battle of Chattanooga III|Chattanooga]]. Earlier, reacting to criticism of Grant, Lincoln was quoted as saying, &quot;I cannot spare this man. He fights.&quot; Grant waged his bloody [[Overland Campaign]] in 1864, using a strategy of a [[war of attrition]], characterized by high Union losses at battles such as the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]] and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]], but by proportionately higher losses in the Confederate army. Grant's aggressive campaign would eventually bottle up Lee in the [[Siege of Petersburg]] and result in the Union taking Richmond and bringing the war to a close in the spring of 1865. 

Lincoln authorized Grant to use a [[scorched earth]] approach to destroy the South's morale and economic ability to continue the war. This allowed Generals [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] and [[Philip Sheridan]] to destroy farms and towns in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[South Carolina]]. The damage in [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] through Georgia totaled in excess of $100 million.

Lincoln had a star-crossed record as a military leader, possessing a keen understanding of strategic points (such as the [[Mississippi River]] and the fortress city of Vicksburg) and the importance of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing cities. However, he had little success in his efforts to motivate his generals to adopt his strategies. Eventually, he found in Grant a man who shared his vision of the war and was able to bring that vision to reality with his relentless pursuit of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters of war. 

Lincoln, perhaps reflecting his lack of military experience, developed a keen curiosity with military campaigning during the war. He spent hours at the [[United States War Department|War Department]] [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] office, reading dispatches from his generals through many a night. He frequently visited battle sites and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. During [[Jubal A. Early]]'s [[Battle of Fort Stevens|raid into Washington, D.C.]], in 1864, Lincoln had to be told to duck his head to avoid being shot while observing the scenes of battle.

===Homefront===
Lincoln was more successful in giving the war meaning to Northern civilians through his oratorical skills. Despite his meager education and &amp;#8220;backwoods&amp;#8221; upbringing, Lincoln possessed an extraordinary command of the English language, as evidenced by the [[Gettysburg Address]], a speech dedicating a cemetery of Union soldiers from the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] that he delivered on November 19, 1863. While the featured speaker, orator [[Edward Everett]], spoke for two hours, Lincoln's few choice words resonated across the nation and across history, defying Lincoln's own prediction that &quot;the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here.&quot; Lincoln's [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]] is also greatly admired and often quoted. In these speeches, Lincoln articulated better than any of his contemporaries the rationale behind the Union effort.

During the Civil War, Lincoln exercised powers no previous president had wielded; he proclaimed a [[blockade]], suspended the writ of [[habeas corpus]], spent money without [[Congress of the United States|congressional]] authorization, and imprisoned thousands of accused Confederate sympathizers without trial. There is a fragment of uncorraborated evidence that Lincoln made contingency plans to arrest [[Chief Justice]] [[Roger Brooke Taney]], though the allegation remains unresolved and controversial (see the [[Taney Arrest Warrant]] controversy). 

The long war and the issue of emancipation appeared to be severely hampering his prospects and pessimists warned that defeat appeared likely.  Lincoln ran under the Union party banner, composed of War Democrats and Republicans. General Grant was facing severe criticism for his conduct of the bloody [[Overland Campaign]] that summer and the seemingly endless [[Siege of Petersburg]]. However, the Union capture of the key railroad center of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] by Sherman's forces in September changed the situation dramatically and Lincoln was reelected.

===Reconstruction===
The [[reconstruction]] of the Union weighed heavy on the President's mind throughout the war effort. He was determined to take a course that would not permanently alienate the former Confederate states, and throughout the war Lincoln urged speedy elections under generous terms in areas behind Union lines. This irritated congressional Republicans, who urged a more stringent Reconstruction policy. One of Lincoln's few vetoes during his term was of the [[Wade-Davis Bil]]l, an effort by congressional Republicans to impose harsher Reconstruction terms on the Confederate areas. Republicans in Congress retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from [[Louisiana]], [[Arkansas]], and [[Tennessee]] during the war under Lincoln's generous terms.

&quot;Let 'em up easy,&quot; he told his assembled military leaders [[Ulysses S. Grant|Gen. Ulysses S. Grant]] (a future president), [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Gen. William T. Sherman]] and [[David Dixon Porter|Adm. David Dixon Porter]] in an 1865 meeting on the steamer ''River Queen''. When [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], the Confederate capital, was at long last captured, Lincoln went there to make a public gesture of sitting at [[Jefferson Davis]]'s own desk, symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the United States held authority over the entire land. He was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves, whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer's quote, &quot;I know I am free for I have seen the face of Father Abraham and have felt him.&quot;

On [[April 9]], [[1865]], Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]] surrendered at [[Appomattox Court House]] in [[Virginia]]. This left only [[Joseph Johnston]]'s forces in the East to deal with. Weeks later Johnston would defy Jefferson Davis and surrender his forces to Sherman. Of course, Lincoln would not survive to see the surrender of all Confederate forces; just five days after Lee surrendered, Lincoln was [[assassination|assassinated]]. He was the first President to be assassinated, and the third to die in office.

==Assassination==
[[Image:Lincolnassassination.jpg|right|thumbnail|250px|The assassination of Abraham Lincoln. From left to right: [[Henry Rathbone]], [[Clara Harris]], Mary Todd Lincoln, Lincoln, and Booth.]]

Lincoln had met frequently with Lt. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] as the war drew to a close. The two men planned matters of reconstruction, and it was evident to all that they held each other in high regard. During their last meeting, on [[April 14]], [[1865]] ([[Good Friday]]), Lincoln invited Grant to a social engagement that evening. Grant declined (Grant's wife, [[Julia Dent Grant]], is said to have strongly disliked [[Mary Todd Lincoln]]). The President's eldest son, [[Robert Todd Lincoln]], also turned down the invitation. 

[[John Wilkes Booth]], a well-known actor and Southern sympathizer from [[Maryland]], heard that the president and Mrs. Lincoln, along with the Grants, would be attending [[Ford's Theatre]]. Having failed in a plot to kidnap Lincoln earlier, Booth informed his co-conspirators of his intention to kill Lincoln.  Others were assigned to assassinate [[Vice-President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[Secretary of State]] [[William Seward]].

Without his [[bodyguard]] [[Ward Hill Lamon]], to whom he related his famous [[dream]] of his own assassination, the Lincolns left to attend the play at Ford's Theater. The play, ''[[Our American Cousin]]'', was a musical comedy by the British writer [[Tom Taylor]]. As Lincoln sat in his state box in the balcony, Booth crept up behind the President's box and waited for the funniest line of the play, hoping the laughter would cover the gunshot noise. On stage, actor Harry Hawk said the last words Lincoln would ever hear &quot;Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, old gal—you sockdologizing old man-trap...&quot;. When the laughter came Booth jumped into the box the president was in and aimed a single-shot, round-slug .44 [[caliber]] [[Deringer]] at his head, firing at point-blank range.  The bullet entered behind Lincoln's left ear and lodged behind his right eyeball. Major [[Henry Rathbone]], who was present in the Presidential Box, momentarily grappled with Booth but was severely stabbed and slashed by the assassin. It was believed that Booth then shouted &quot;''[[Sic semper tyrannis]]!''&quot; (Latin: &quot;Thus always to tyrants,&quot; the state motto of Virginia; some accounts say he added &quot;The South is avenged!&quot;) and jumped from the balcony to the stage below, breaking his leg. Despite his injury, Booth managed to limp to his horse and make his escape.

As Booth fled from the theater, a young physician, Dr. [[Charles Leale]], made his way through the audience to Lincoln's box. Leale quickly assessed the wound as mortal. The President was taken across the street from the theater to the [[Petersen House]], where he lay in a coma for nine hours before he expired. Several physicians attended Lincoln, including U.S. Army Surgeon General Joseph K. Barnes of the Army Medical Museum. Using a probe, Barnes located some fragments of Lincoln's skull and the ball lodged 6 inches inside his brain. Lincoln, who never regained consciousness, was officially pronounced dead at 7:22 A.M. the next morning, April 15, 1865. Upon his death, Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]] lamented &quot;now he belongs to the ages.&quot; After Lincoln's body was returned to the [[White House]], his body was prepared for his &quot;lying in state&quot; in the [[East Room]]. 

The Army Medical Museum, now named the National Museum of Health and Medicine, has retained in its collection since the time of Lincoln's death, several artifacts relating to the assassination. Currently on display in the museum are the bullet that was fired from the Deringer pistol, ending Lincoln's life, the probe used by Barnes, pieces of his skull and hair and the surgeon's cuff, stained with Lincoln's blood. The museum can be found at [http://www.nmhm.washingtondc.museum/exhibits/nationswounds/lincoln.html www.hmhm.washingtondc.museum]

[[Image:LincolnTrain.jpeg|right|thumbnail|250px|Lincoln's funeral train carried his remains, as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son William, 1,654 miles to Illinois.]]
Lincoln's body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to Illinois. The nation mourned a man whom many viewed as the savior of the United States. He was buried in [[Oak Ridge Cemetery]] in Springfield, where a 177 foot (54 m) tall granite tomb surmounted with several bronze statues of Lincoln was constructed by 1874. To prevent repeated attempts to steal Lincoln's body and hold it for ransom, Robert Todd Lincoln had Lincoln exhumed and reinterred in concrete several feet thick on [[September 26]], [[1901]].

==Presidential appointments==
===Administration and Cabinet===
Lincoln was known for appointing his enemies and political rivals to high positions in his Cabinet. Not only did he use great political skill in reducing potential political opposition, but he felt he was appointing the best qualified person for the good of the country.

==Legacy and memorials==
Lincoln's death made the President a [[martyr]] to many. Today he is perhaps America's second most famous and beloved President after [[George Washington]]. Repeated polls of historians have ranked Lincoln as among the [[historical rankings of U.S. Presidents|greatest presidents in U.S. history]]. Among contemporary admirers, Lincoln is usually seen as a figure who personifies [[Image:Lincoln_statue.jpg|thumbnail|200px|[[Daniel Chester French]]'s seated ''Lincoln'' faces the [[National Mall]] to the east.]]
[[Image:MtRushmore Abe close.JPG|thumbnail|100px|Lincoln's bust on Mt. Rushmore.]]classical values of honesty, integrity, as well as respect for individual and minority rights, and human freedom in general. Many American organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image, with interests ranging from the [[gay rights]] group [[Log Cabin Republicans]] to the [[insurance]] corporation [[Lincoln Financial Group|Lincoln Financial]]. The [[Lincoln automobile]] is also named after him.

Over the years Lincoln has been memorialized in many city names, notably the [[Lincoln, Nebraska|capital of Nebraska]]; with the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] (''pictured, right''); on the U.S. [[U.S. five dollar bill|$5 bill]] and the [[Penny (U.S. coin)|1 cent coin]] (Illinois is the primary opponent to the removal of the penny from circulation); and as part of the [[Mount Rushmore National Memorial]]. [[Lincoln's Tomb]], [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site]] in [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], [[New Salem (Menard County), Illinois|New Salem, Illinois]] (a reconstruction of Lincoln's early adult hometown), [[Ford's Theater]] and Petersen House are all preserved as museums. The [[List of U.S. state nicknames|state nickname]] for [[Illinois]] is ''Land of Lincoln''. 

[[Counties of the United States|Counties]] in 18 [[U.S. state]]s ([[Lincoln County, Arkansas|Arkansas]], [[Lincoln County, Colorado|Colorado]], [[Lincoln County, Idaho|Idaho]], [[Lincoln County, Kansas|Kansas]], [[Lincoln County, Minnesota|Minnesota]], [[Lincoln County, Mississippi|Mississippi]], [[Lincoln County, Montana|Montana]], [[Lincoln County, Nebraska|Nebraska]], [[Lincoln County, Nevada|Nevada]], [[Lincoln County, New Mexico|New Mexico]], [[Lincoln County, Oklahoma|Oklahoma]], [[Lincoln County, Oregon|Oregon]], [[Lincoln County, South Dakota|South Dakota]], [[Lincoln County, Tennessee|Tennessee]], [[Lincoln County, West Virginia|West Virginia]], [[Lincoln County, Washington|Washington]], [[Lincoln County, Wisconsin|Wisconsin]], and [[Lincoln County, Wyoming|Wyoming]]) are named after Lincoln.

On [[February 12]], [[1892]], Abraham Lincoln's birthday was declared to be a federal [[holiday]] in the United States, although in 1971 it was combined with Washington's birthday in the form of [[President's Day]]. February 12 is still observed as a separate legal holiday in many states, including Illinois.

Lincoln's birthplace and family home are national historic memorials: [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site]] in [[Hodgenville, Kentucky]] and [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site]] in [[Springfield, Illinois]]. The [[Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum]] is also in Springfield. The [[Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery]] is located in [[Elwood, Illinois]].

Statues of Lincoln can be found in other countries. In [[Ciudad Juárez]], [[Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]], is a 13-foot high bronze statue, a gift from the United States, dedicated in 1966 by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. The U.S. received a statue of [[Benito Juárez]] in exchange, which is in Washington, D.C. Juárez and Lincoln exchanged friendly letters, and Mexico remembers Lincoln's opposition to the [[Mexican-American War]]. There is also a statue in [[Tijuana]], Mexico, showing Lincoln standing and destroying the chains of slavery. There are at least three statues of Lincoln in the [[United Kingdom]]—one in [[London]] by [[Augustus St. Gaudens]],  one in [[Manchester]] by [[George Grey Barnard]] and another in [[Edinburgh]] by [[George Bissell (industrialist)|George Bissell]]. 

The [[ballistic missile]] [[submarine]] [[USS Abraham Lincoln (SSBN-602)|''Abraham Lincoln'' (SSBN-602)]] and the [[aircraft carrier]] [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|''Abraham Lincoln'' (CVN-72)]] were named in his honor. Also, the [[Liberty ship]], [[SS Nancy Hanks|SS ''Nancy Hanks'']] was named to honor his mother.

In a recent public vote entitled &quot;[[The Greatest American]],&quot; Lincoln placed second (placing first was [[Ronald Reagan]]).

==Trivia==
* Lincoln stood 6'3 3/4&quot; (192.4 cm) tall and thus was the tallest president in U.S. history, just edging out [[Lyndon Johnson]] at 6'3 1/2&quot; (191.8 cm).
* He was born on the same day as [[Charles Darwin]].
* The last surviving self-described witness to Lincoln's assassination was [[Samuel J. Seymour]] (~1860–[[April 14]], [[1956]]), who appeared two months before his death at age 96 on the [[CBS]]-TV [[quiz show]] ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''. He said that as a five-year-old he had thought at first that he, himself, had been shot because his nurse, trying to fix a torn place in his blouse, stuck him with a pin at the moment of the gun's discharge.
* According to legend, Lincoln was referred to as &quot;two-faced&quot; by his opponent in the 1858 [[Senate]] election, [[Stephen A. Douglas|Stephen Douglas]]. Upon hearing about this Lincoln jokingly replied, &quot;If I had another face to wear, do you really think I would be wearing this one?&quot;
* According to legend, Lincoln also said, as a young man, on his appearance one day when looking in the mirror: &quot;It's a fact, Abe! You are the ugliest man in the world. If ever I see a man uglier than you, I'm going to shoot him on the spot!&quot; It would no doubt, he thought, be an act of mercy.
* Based on written descriptions of Lincoln, including the observations that he was much taller than most men of his day aas]], which he considered his home. He was educated at [[Transylvania University]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky | Lexington]] and later secured an appointment to [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]. In [[1826]] he graduated eighth in his class from the [[United States Military Academy]] with a commission as a [[second lieutenant]] in the 2nd U.S. [[Infantry]]. He was assigned to posts in [[New York]] and [[Missouri]] and served in the [[Black Hawk War]] in [[1832]] as chief of staff to General Henry Atlinson. In [[1829]] he married Henrietta Preston. He resigned his commission in [[1834]] to return to Kentucky to care for his dying wife. They had one son, William Preston Johnston.

==Texas Army==
In April 1834, Johnston took up farming in [[Texas]], but enlisted as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the Texas Army during the [[Texas War of Independence]] against the Republic of [[Mexico]] in [[1836]]. One month later, Johnston was promoted to [[major]] and the position of [[aide-de-camp]] to General [[Sam Houston]]. He was named [[Adjutant General]] as a [[colonel]] in the [[Republic of Texas]] Army on [[August 5]], [[1836]]. On [[January 31]], [[1837]], he became Senior Brigadier General in command of the Texas Army.

On [[February 7]], [[1837]], he fought in a [[duel]] with Texas Brig. Gen. [[Felix Huston]], challenging each other for the command of the Texas Army; Johnston refused to fire on Huston and lost the position after he was wounded in the pelvis. The second president of the [[Republic of Texas]], [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]], appointed him Secretary of War on [[December 22]], [[1838]]. Johnston was to provide the defense of the Texas border against Mexican invasion, and in 1839 conducted a campaign against [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] in northern Texas. In February 1840, he resigned and returned to Kentucky, where he married [[Eliza Griffin]] in [[1843]]. They settled on a large [[plantation]] he named China Grove in [[Brazoria County, Texas]].

==U.S. Army==
Johnston returned to the Texas Army during the [[Mexican-American War]] under General [[Zachary Taylor]] as a [[colonel]] of the 1st Texas Rifle Volunteers.  The enlistments of his volunteers ran out just before the [[Battle of Monterrey]].  Johnston managed to convince a few volunteers to stay and fight as he himself served as the inspector general of volunteers and fought at the battles of Monterrey and [[Battle of Buena Vista|Buena Vista]]. Johnston remained on his plantation after the war until he was appointed by [[President of the United States | President]] [[Zachary Taylor]] to the U.S. Army as a [[major]] and was made a [[U.S. Army Paymaster | paymaster]] in December of [[1849]]. He served in that role for more than five years, making six tours, and traveling more than 4,000 miles annually on the Indian frontier of Texas. He served on the Texas frontier and elsewhere in the West. In [[1855]] President [[Franklin Pierce]] appointed him colonel of the 2nd (now 5th) Cavalry, a new regiment, which he organized. As a key figure in the [[Utah War]], he led U.S. troops who established a non-Mormon government in the formerly [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints|Mormon]] territory. He received a [[brevet (military) | brevet]] promotion to [[brigadier general]] in [[1857]] for his service in Utah. He spent [[1860]] in Kentucky until [[December 21]], when he sailed for California to take command of the Department of the Pacific.

==Civil War==
At the outbreak of the [[American Civil War | Civil War]], Johnston was the commander of the U.S. Army [[Department of the Pacific]] in [[California and the Civil War|California]]. He was approached by some Californians who urged him to take his forces east to join the [[Union army | Union]] against the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. He resigned his commission, [[April 9]], [[1861]], as soon as he heard of the [[secession]] of Texas. He remained in California until June. After a rapid march through the deserts of Arizona and Texas, he reached [[Richmond, Virginia]], on or about [[September 1]], [[1861]]. There Johnston was appointed a general by his friend, Jefferson Davis. On [[May 30]], [[1861]], Johnston became the second highest ranking Confederate General (after the little-known [[Samuel Cooper (general) | Samuel Cooper]]) as commander of the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War | Western Department]]. He raised the [[Army of Mississippi]] to defend Confederate lines from the [[Mississippi River]] to [[Kentucky]] and the [[Allegheny Mountains]].

Although the [[Confederate Army]] won a morale-boosting victory at [[First Bull Run]] in the East in [[1861]], matters in the West turned ugly by early [[1862]]. Johnston's subordinate generals lost [[Battle of Fort Henry | Fort Henry]] on [[February 6]], [[1862]], and [[Battle of Fort Donelson | Fort Donelson]] on [[February 16]], [[1862]], to [[Union army | Union]] [[Brigadier General | Brig. Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Johnston has been faulted for poor judgment in selecting Gens. [[Lloyd Tilghman | Tilghman]] and [[John B. Floyd | Floyd]] for those crucial positions and for not supervising adequate construction of the forts. And Union Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]] captured the vital city of [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Gen. [[P.G.T. Beauregard]] was sent west to join Johnston and they organized their forces at [[Corinth, Mississippi]], planning to ambush Grant's forces at [[Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee]].

==Shiloh==
Johnston concentrated many of his forces from around the theater and launched a massive surprise attack against Grant at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] on [[April 6]], [[1862]]. As the Confederate forces overran the Union camps, Johnston seemed to be everywhere, personally leading and rallying troops up and down the line. At about 2:30 p.m., while leading one of those charges, he was wounded, taking a bullet behind his right knee. He did not think the wound serious at the time, and sent his personal physician to attend to some wounded Union soldiers instead. The bullet had in fact clipped his [[popliteal artery]] and his boot was filling up with blood. Within a few minutes Johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fainting off of his horse, and asked him if he was wounded, to which he replied &quot;Yes, and I fear seriously.&quot; It is possible that Johnston's duel in [[1837]] had caused nerve damage or numbness to that leg and that he did not feel the wound to his leg as a result. Johnston was taken to a small ravine, where he bled to death in minutes.

Ironically, it is probable that a Confederate soldier fired the fatal round. No Union soldiers were observed to have ever gotten behind Johnston during the fatal charge, while it is known that many Confederates were firing at the Union lines while Johnston charged well in advance of his soldiers. He was the highest-ranking casualty of the war and his death was a strong blow to the morale of the Confederacy. Jefferson Davis considered him the best general in the country; this was two months before the emergence of [[Robert E. Lee]] as their pre-eminent general.

==Epitaph==
Johnston was buried in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. In [[1866]], a joint resolution of the [[Texas Legislature]] was passed to have his body reinterred to the [[Texas State Cemetery]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] (the re-interment occurred in [[1867]]). Four decades later, the state appointed [[Elisbet Ney]] to design a monument and sculpture of him to be erected at his gravesite.

The [[Texas Historical Commission]] has erected a historical marker near the entrance of what was once his [[plantation]]. An adjacent marker was erected by the San Jacinto Chapter of the [[Daughters of The Republic of Texas]] and the Lee, Roberts, and Davis Chapter of the [[United Daughters of the Confederate States of America]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Five oceans}}
The '''[[Arctic]] Ocean''', located mostly in the [[North Pole|north polar]] region, is the smallest of the world's five [[ocean]]s, and the shallowest.  Even though [[International Hydrographic Organization|IHO]] recognizes it as an ocean, [[oceanography|oceanographers]] may call it ''the Arctic Mediterranean Sea'' or simply ''the Arctic Sea'', classifying it as one of the [[mediterranean sea]]s of the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

==Geography==
[[Image:Arctic_Ocean.png|right|Arctic Ocean]]

The Arctic Ocean occupies a roughly circular basin and covers an area of about 14,090,000 km² (5,440,000 mi&amp;sup2;), slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the [[United States|US]].  The coastline length is 45,389 km.  Nearly landlocked, it is surrounded by the land masses of [[Eurasia]], [[North America]], [[Greenland]], and a number of islands.  It includes [[Baffin Bay]], [[Barents Sea]], [[Beaufort Sea]], [[Chukchi Sea]], [[East Siberian Sea]], [[Greenland Sea]], [[Hudson Bay]], [[Hudson Strait]], [[Kara Sea]], [[Laptev Sea]], [[White Sea]] and other tributary bodies of water.  It is connected to the Pacific Ocean by the [[Bering Strait]] and to the Atlantic Ocean through the Greenland Sea.

An underwater [[ocean ridge]], the [[Lomonosov Ridge]], divides the Arctic Ocean into two basins: the [[Eurasian Basin|Eurasian]], or [[Nansen Basin|Nansen]], Basin, which is between 4,000 and 4,500 m (13,000 and 15,000 ft) deep, and the [[North American Basin|North American]], or [[Hyperborean Basin|Hyperborean]], Basin, which is about 4,000 m deep. The [[topography]] of the ocean bottom is marked by [[fault-block ridge]]s, [[abyssal plain|plains of the abyssal zone]], ocean deeps, and basins. The average depth of the Arctic Ocean is 1,038 m (3,407 ft), in part due to the large extent of [[continental shelf]] extant on the Eurasian side [http://www.marianatrench.com/mariana_trench-oceanography.htm].

[[Image:Polar bears near north pole.jpg|thumb|The Arctic Ocean is used by both [[marine mammal]]s and nuclear [[submarine]]s.]]
The greatest inflow of water comes from the Atlantic by way of the [[Norwegian Current]], which then flows along the Eurasian coast. Water also enters from the Pacific via the Bering Strait. The [[East Greenland Current]] carries the major outflow. [[Temperature]] and [[salinity]] vary [[season]]ally as the ice cover melts and freezes. Ice covers most of the ocean surface year-round, causing subfreezing temperatures much of the time. The Arctic is a major source of very cold air that inevitably moves toward the [[equator]], meeting with warmer air in the middle [[latitude]]s and causing [[rain]] and [[snow]]. Little marine life exists where the ocean surface is covered with ice throughout the year. Marine life abounds in open areas, especially the more southerly waters. The ocean's major ports are the [[Russia]]n cities of [[Murmansk]] and [[Arkhangelsk]] (Archangel). The Arctic Ocean is important as the shortest air route between the Pacific coast of North America and Europe overflies it.

Major chokepoint is the southern Chukchi Sea (northern access to the Pacific Ocean via the Bering Strait); strategic location between North America and Russia; shortest marine link between the extremes of eastern and western Russia; floating research stations operated by the US and Russia; maximum snow cover in March or April about 20 to 50 centimeters over the frozen ocean; snow cover lasts about 10 months.

==Climate==
[[image:north pole september ice-pack 1978-2002.png|thumb|Extent of the Arctic ice-pack in September, 1978-2002]]
[[image:north pole february ice-pack 1978-2002.png|thumb|Extent of the Arctic ice-pack in February, 1978-2002]]
[[Polar climate]] characterized by persistent cold and relatively narrow annual temperature ranges; winters characterized by continuous darkness, cold and stable weather conditions, and clear skies; summers characterized by continuous daylight, damp and foggy weather, and weak cyclones with rain or snow.

There is considerable seasonal variation in how much [[pack ice]] covers the Arctic Ocean.



==Elevation extremes==
* ''lowest point:'' [[Fram Basin]] &amp;minus;4,665 m (according to [http://www.marianatrench.com/mariana_trench-oceanography.htm], the Arctic Ocean's Eurasian Basin deepest point is at &amp;minus;5,450 m (17,881 ft))
* ''highest point:'' sea level 0 m

==Natural resources==
Oil and gas fields, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules, sand and gravel aggregates, [[fish]], marine mammals ([[Seal (mammal)|seals]] and [[Whale|whales]]).

The political dead zone near the center of the sea is also at the center of a mounting dispute between the [[United States]], [[Russia]], [[Canada]], [[Norway]], and [[Denmark]]. It is considered significant because of its potential to contain as much as or more than a quarter of the world's oil and gas resources, the tapping of which could greatly alter the flow of the global energy market. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4354036.stm#map The Arctic's New Gold Rush - BBC]

==Natural hazards==
Ice islands occasionally break away from northern [[Ellesmere Island]]; icebergs calved from glaciers in western Greenland and extreme northeastern [[Canada]]; permafrost on islands; virtually ice locked from October to June; ships subject to superstructure icing from October to May.

==Environment - current issues==
Endangered marine species include [[Walrus|walruses]] and whales; fragile [[ecosystem]] slow to change and slow to recover from disruptions or damage; thinning polar icepack; seasonal hole in [[ozone layer]] over the [[North Pole]].

Reduction of the area of Arctic sea ice will have an effect on the planet's [[albedo]], thus possibly affecting [[global warming]].  Many scientists are presently concerned that warming temperatures in the Arctic may cause large amounts of fresh, Arctic Ocean meltwater to enter the North Atlantic, possibly disrupting global [[thermohaline circulation|ocean current patterns]]. Potentially severe changes in the Earth's climate might then ensue.

==Transportation - note==
Sparse network of air, ocean, river, and land routes; the [[Northwest Passage]] (North America) and [[Northern Sea Route]] ([[Eurasia]]) are important seasonal waterways.

==Exploration==
The first surface crossing of the Arctic Ocean was led by Wally Herbert in [[1969]], in a dogsled expedition from [[Alaska]] to [[Svalbard]] with air support. See also [[Northwest Passage]], [[Open Polar Sea]].

[[Image:Data2.jpg|thumbnail|200px|The android [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]], portrayed by [[Brent Spiner]], from the TV series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'']]An '''android''' is an [[artificial]]ly created [[robot]], an [[automaton]], that resembles a [[human]] being usually both in appearance and behavior.  The word derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''andr-'', &quot; meaning &quot;[[man]], male&quot;, and the suffix ''-eides'', used to mean &quot;of the [[species]]; alike&quot; (from ''eidos'' &quot;species&quot;).  The word ''[[droid]]'', a robot in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe, is derived from this meaning.

In the semantic sense the word &quot;android&quot; is a misnomer. The intended meaning is &quot;an artificial human being like being&quot;, while the literal translation is &quot;an artificial male being&quot;.  The word ''andros'' has definite meaning of &quot;male human being&quot; in Greek, while the word ''man'' can mean either &quot;male human being&quot; or &quot;human being in general&quot;.  The gender-neutral word for human being in Greek is ''anthropos'', and the correct word for an artificial human being-like automaton would be [[anthropoid]].

__TOC__
== Usage and distinctions ==
Unlike the terms ''[[robot]]'' (a &quot;[[mechanics|mechanical]]&quot; being) and ''[[cyborg]]'' (a being that is partly [[organic compound|organic]] and partly mechanical), the word ''android'' has been used in literature and other media to denote several different kinds of [[artificial life|artificially constructed beings]]:

* a robot that closely resembles a human
* a cyborg that closely resembles a human
* an artificially created, yet primarily organic, being that closely resembles a human

Although human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots, the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts: ''[[simulacra]]'' (devices that exhibit likeness) and ''[[automata]]'' (devices that have independence).

The term android was first used by the French author [[Mathias Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]] (1838-1889) in his work ''[[Tomorrow's Eve]]'', featuring an artificial human-like robot named Hadaly.  As said by the officer in the story, &quot;In this age of Realien advancement, who knows what goes on in the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls.&quot;

Although [[Karel Capek|Karel &amp;#268;apek]]'s robots in ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]'' (1921)&amp;mdash;the play that introduced the word &quot;robot&quot; to the world&amp;mdash;were organic artificial humans, the word ''robot'' has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans, animals, and other beings.  The term android can mean either one of these, while a [[cyborg]] (&quot;cybernetic organism&quot; or &quot;bionic man&quot;) would be a creature that is a combination of organic and mechanical parts.

== Ambiguity ==
Historically, [[science fiction]] [[authors]] have used &quot;android&quot; in a greater diversity of ways than the terms &quot;robot&quot; and &quot;cyborg&quot;.  In some fiction works, the primary difference between a robot and android is only skin-deep, with androids being made to look almost exactly like humans on the outside, but with internal mechanics exactly the same as that of robots.  In other stories, authors have defined android to indicate a wholly organic, yet artificial, creation.  Other definitions of android fall somewhere in between.

The character [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]], from the [[television series]] ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', is described as an android.  Data became [[intoxication|intoxicated]] in an early episode (&quot;[[The Naked Now (TNG episode)|The Naked Now]]&quot;) and is later referred to having &quot;bioplast sheeting&quot; for skin (&quot;[[The Most Toys (TNG episode)|The Most Toys]]&quot;), perhaps suggesting that he was initially intended by the writers to be at least partially organic.  Otherwise, Data was shown to be mechanical throughout and this often became a central plot theme.

The [[Replicant]]s from the movie ''[[Blade Runner]]'' were [[bioengineering|bioengineered]] organic beings.  While they were not referred to as either robots or androids in[1781]]. Greene proceeded to wear down his opponents in a series of battles ([[Battle of Guilford Court House|Guilford Court House]], [[Battle of Hobkirk's Hill|Hobkirk's Hill]], [[Battle of Ninety Six|Ninety Six]], and [[Battle of Eutaw Springs|Eutaw Springs]]), each of them tactically a victory for the British, but giving no strategic advantage to the victors. Greene summed up his approach in a motto that would become famous: &quot;We fight, get beat, rise, and fight again.&quot; Unable to capture or destroy Greene's army, Cornwallis moved north to to Virginia.

=== Virginia, 1775 to 1781 ===
Virginia had been under revolutionary control since Loyalist forces (including runaway slaves) under [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Governor Dunmore]] had been defeated at the [[Battle of Great Bridge]] on [[December 9]], [[1775]]. After the defeat, Dunmore and his troops took refuge on British ships off of [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], which Dunmore bombarded and burned on [[January 1]], [[1776]]. He was driven from an island in [[Chesapeake Bay]] that summer, never to return.

British forces raided Virginia sporadically during the war. In January 1781, the rebel capital of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] was put to the torch by none other than Benedict Arnold, now a turncoat, who had sold his services to the other side and was now a British general.

In March 1781, General Washington dispatched [[Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] to defend Virginia. The young Frenchman had 3,200 men at his command, but British troops in the state, now reinforced and commanded by Cornwallis, totaled 7,200. Lafayette skirmished with Cornwallis, avoiding a decisive battle while gathering reinforcements. &quot;The boy cannot escape me,&quot; Cornwallis is supposed to have said. However, Cornwallis was unable to trap Lafayette, and so he moved his forces to [[Yorktown, Virginia]] in July in order to link up with the British navy.

== War at sea ==
''Main article: [[Naval operations in the American Revolutionary War]]''

Meanwhile the co-operation of the French became active.  In July [[Comte de Rochambeau|Count Rochambeau]] arrived at Newport, Rhode Island.  That place had been occupied by the British from 1776 to the close of 1779.  An unsuccessful attempt was made to drive them out in 1778 by the Revolutionaries assisted by the French admiral [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|d'Estaing]] and a French corps.

===Gulf Coast===
After Spain declared war against Great Britain in June of 1779, Count [[Bernardo de Gálvez]], the Spanish governor of [[Louisiana]], seized three British [[Mississippi River]] outposts: [[Battle of Fort Bute|Manchac]], [[Battle of Baton Rouge|Baton Rouge]], and [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]]. Gálvez then captured [[Battle of Fort Charlotte|Mobile]] on [[March 14]], [[1780]], and, in May of 1781, [[Battle of Pensacola (1781)|forced the surrender]] of the British outpost at [[Pensacola, Florida]]. On [[May 8]], [[1782]], Gálvez captured the British naval base at New Providence in the Bahamas. Galvez also supplied  soldiers to George Rogers Clark and had been supplying substantial quantities of war supplies to the American rebels from as early as 1777.

===Caribbean===
The [[Battle of the Saintes]] took place in 1782, during the American War of Independence, and was a victory of a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] fleet under Admiral Sir [[George Rodney]] over a [[France|French]] fleet under the [[Comte de Grasse]].  The defeat dashed the hopes of France and Spain to take [[Jamaica]] and other colonies from the British.

===India===
The Franco-British war spilled over into [[India]] in 1780, in the form of the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]]. The two chief combatants were [[Tipu Sultan]], ruler of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] and a key French ally, and the British government of [[Madras Presidency|Madras]]. The Anglo-Mysore conflict was bloody but inconclusive, and ended in a draw at the [[Treaty of Mangalore]] in 1784.

===Netherlands===
Also in 1780, the British struck against the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] of the [[Netherlands]] in the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]] to preempt Dutch involvement in the [[League of Armed Neutrality]], directed primarily against the British Navy during the war. Agitation by Dutch radicals and a friendly attitude towards the United States by the Dutch government, both influenced by the American Revolution, also encouraged the British to attack.

The war lasted into 1784 and was disastrous to the Dutch mercantile economy.

===Mediterranean===
On [[February 5]], [[1782]], Spanish and French forces captured [[Minorca]], which had been under British control since the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713.  A further Franco-Spanish effort to recover [[Gibraltar]] was unsuccessful.  Minorca was ceded to Spain in the peace treaty.

=== Whitehaven ===
An interesting footnote to this war was the actual landing on [[Britain]] itself of a ship from the U.S. [[Navy]]. This occurred in 1778 when the port of [[Whitehaven]] in [[Cumberland]] was raided by [[John Paul Jones]]. The landing was a surprise attack, taken as an action of revenge by Jones, and was never intended as an invasion. Nevertheless, it caused hysteria in [[England]], with the attack showing a weakness that could be exploited by other states such as [[France]] or [[Spain]]. Its result was an intense period of fortification in British ports.

== War's end ==
The northern, southern, and naval theaters of the war converged at [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] in 1781. On [[September 5]], [[1781]], French naval forces defeated the British [[Royal Navy]] at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]], cutting off Cornwallis's supplies and transport. Washington hurriedly moved his troops from [[New York]], and a combined Franco-American force of 17,000 troops commenced the [[Battle of Yorktown (1781)|Battle of Yorktown]] on [[October 6]], [[1781]]. Cornwallis's position quickly became untenable, and on [[October 19]] his army surrendered. The war was all but over.

[[Image:Yorktown80.JPG|thumb|325px|''Surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown'' ([[John Trumbull]], 1797). On the right is the American flag, on the left is the French flag (white flag of the monarchy). Despite the painting's title, Cornwallis (claiming illness) was not present and is not depicted. [[George Washington|Washington]] is on horseback in the right background; because the British commander was absent, military protocol dictated that Washington have a subordinate—in this case [[Benjamin Lincoln]]—accept the surrender.]]

[[British Prime Minister]] [[Frederick North, 2nd Earl of Guilford|Lord North]] resigned soon after hearing the news from Yorktown. In April 1782, the [[British House of Commons]] voted to end the war in America. On [[November 30]], [[1782]] preliminary peace articles were signed in [[Paris]]; the formal end of the war did not occur until the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed on [[September 3]], [[1783]] and the United States Congress ratified the treaty on [[January 14]], [[1784]]. The last [[Evacuation Day (New York)|British troops left]] [[New York City]] on [[November 25]], [[1783]].

The reasons for Great Britain's misfortunes and defeat may be summarized as follows: Misconception by the home government of the temper and reserve strength of her colonists; disbelief at the outset in the probability of a protracted struggle covering the immense territory in America; consequent failure of the British to use their more efficient military strength effectively; the safe and [[Fabian Strategy|Fabian generalship]] of Washington; and perhaps most significantly, the French alliance and European combinations by which at the close of the conflict left Great Britain without a friend or ally on the continent.

Decisive victory eluded the United States on the western frontier. Great Britain negotiated the Paris peace treaty without consulting her Indian allies, however, and ceded much American Indian territory to the United States. Full of resentment, Native Americans reluctantly confirmed these land cessions with the United States in a series of treaties, but the result was essentially an armed truce—the fighting would be renewed in conflicts along the frontier, the largest being the [[Northwest Indian War]].

===Casualties===
The total loss of life resulting from the American Revolutionary War is unknown. As was typical in the wars of the era, disease claimed more lives than battle. The war took place in the context of a massive [[smallpox]] [[North American smallpox epidemic|epidemic]] in North America that probably killed more than 130,000 people. Historian [[Joseph J. Ellis]] suggests that Washington's decision to have his troops [[inoculation|inoculated]] may have been the commander-in-chief's most important strategic decision.{{ref|smallpox}}

Casualty figures for the American Revolutionaries have varied over the years; a recent scholarly estimate lists 6,824 killed and 8,445 wounded in action. The number of Revolutionary troop deaths from disease and other non-combat causes is estimated at about 18,500.{{ref|casualties}}

Approximately 1,200 Germans were killed in action and 6,354 died from illness or accident. About 16,000 of the remaining German troops returned home, but roughly 5,500 remained in the United States after the war for various reasons, many becoming American citizens. No reliable statistics exist for the number of casualties among other groups, including American Loyalists, British regulars, American Indians, French and Spanish troops, and civilians.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For the different meanings of [[Ampère]], see the disambiguation page.''
----

The '''ampere''' (symbol: A) is the [[SI base unit]] of [[electric current]] equal to one [[coulomb]] per second.  It is named after [[André-Marie Ampère]], one of the main discoverers of [[electromagnetism]].

==Definition==
The ampere is that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed 1 [[metre]] apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to 2{{e|–7}} [[newton]] per metre of length.

==Explanation==
Because it is a base unit, the definition of the ampere is not tied to any other electrical unit. The definition for the ampere is equivalent to fixing a value of the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] of vacuum to ''&amp;mu;''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 4&amp;pi;{{e|&amp;minus;7}} H/m. Prior to 1948, the so-called &quot;international ampere&quot; was used, defined in terms of the [[electrolysis|electrolytic]] deposition rate of [[silver]]. The older unit is equal to 0.999&amp;nbsp;85&amp;nbsp;A.

The ampere is most accurately realised using an [[ampere balance]], but is in practice maintained via [[Ohm's Law]] from the units of [[voltage]] and [[electrical resistance|resistance]], the [[volt]] and the [[ohm]], since the latter two can be tied to physical phenomena that are relatively easy to reproduce, the [[Josephson junction]] and the [[quantum Hall effect]], respectively.

The unit of [[electric charge]], the [[coulomb]], is defined in terms of the ampere: one coulomb is the amount of electric charge (formerly [[quantity of electricity]]) carried in a current of one ampere flowing for one [[second]]. [[Current (electricity)]], then, is the rate at which charge flows through a wire or surface. One ampere of current (I) is equal to a flow of one [[coulomb]] of charge (Q) per second of time (t):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{I=Q/t} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Since a coulomb is approximately equal to 6.24{{e|18}} elementary charges, one ampere is equivalent to 6.24{{e|18}} elementary charges, such as [[electron]]s, moving through a surface in one second. More precisely, using the SI definitions for the conventional values of the [[Josephson constant|Josephson]] and [[von Klitzing constant|von Klitzing]] constants, the ampere can be defined as exactly 6.241&amp;nbsp;509&amp;nbsp;629&amp;nbsp;152&amp;nbsp;65{{e|18}} elementary charges per second.

;''n''-''m'' defense:a defense with ''n'' down linemen and ''m'' linebackers, such as:

:;3-3: a defense with 3 lineman, 3 linebackers, and 5 defensive backs. Often called a '''3-3 stack.'''
:;3-4 defense:a [[defensive team | defensive]] formation with 3 [[lineman (football)|linemen]] and 4 linebackers. A professional derivative in the 1970's of the earlier [[University of Oklahoma|Oklahoma]] or '''&quot;50&quot; defense''', which had 5 linemen and 2 linebackers.  The 3-4 outside linebackers resemble &quot;stand-up ends&quot; in the older defense.
:;4-3 defense:a defensive formation with 4 linemen and 3 linebackers. Several variations are employed.  First used by coach [[Joe Kuharich]].
:;4-6 defense :(pronounced ''four-six defense'') a defense with four (4) down linemen and six (6) linebackers
;[[46 defense]] :(pronounced ''forty-six defense'') a formation of the 4-3 defense (four linemen and three linebackers) in which three defensive backs (the two cornerbacks and the strong safety) crowd the line of scrimmage. The remaining safety, which is the free safety, stays in the backfield. It is also known as the &quot;Bear&quot; defense because it was popularized by [[Buddy Ryan]] while coaching for the [[Chicago Bears]]. Not to be confused with the 4-6 (four-six) defense.
;50 defense  :a once popular college defense with 5 defensive linemen and 2 linebackers.

==A==
;audible: (from [[Latin]] ''aud&amp;#299;re'' = to hear, to listen to) a play called by the quarterback at the line of scrimmage to change the play that was called in the huddle.
;automatic :see [[#A|audible]]
;automatic first down: for several of the most severe penalties, including '''pass interference''' and all personal fouls, a first down is rewarded to the offensive team even if the yardage of that penalty is less than the yardage needed for a first down.

==B==
;back :A [[American and Canadian football position names|position]] behind the offensive line, or behind the linebackers on defense.
;[[blitz (American football)|blitz]] :a defensive maneuver in which one or more linebackers or defensive backs, who normally remain behind the line of scrimmage, instead charge into the opponents' backfield.  However, in the 3-4 defense, one linebacker typically rushes the passer with the three down linemen.  This is not considered a blitz.  If an additional linebacker is sent, bringing the total number of rushers to five, it is a blitz.
;[[blocking (American football)|blocking]] :when a player obstructs another player's path with his body.
;[[bootleg play|bootleg]] :an offensive play predicated upon misdirection in which the quarterback pretends to hand the ball to another player, and then carries the ball in the opposite direction of the supposed ballcarrier with the intent of either passing or running (sometimes the quarterback has the option of doing either).  A '''naked bootleg''' is a risky variation of this play when the quarterback has no blockers pulling out with him.  Contrast with '''scramble''', '''sneak''', and '''draw'''
;the box :an area on the defensive side of the ball, directly opposite the offensive linemen and about 5 yards deep; having 8 prom the Hellenic League. 

===Infantry===
[[Image:Macedonian battle formation.gif|right|thumb|330px|Macedonian battle formation, courtesy of The Department of History, United States Military Academy.]]
The main infantry corps was the [[Macedonian phalanx|phalanx]], composed of six regiments (''taxies'') numbering about 2000 phalangites each. Each soldier had a long [[pike]] called a ''[[sarissa]]'', which was up to 21 feet long, and a short [[sword]]. For protection, the soldier wore a [[Phrygian cap|Phrygian-style]] [[helmet]] and a [[shield]]. [[Arrian]] mentions large shields (the ''[[aspis]]''), but this is disputed, as it is difficult to wield both a large pike and a large shield at the same time. Many modern historians claim the [[phalanx]] used a smaller shield, called a ''[[pelta]]'', the shield used by [[peltast]]s. It is unclear whether the phalanx used body armor, but heavy body armor is mentioned in Arrian (1.28.7) and other ancient sources. Modern historians believe most of the phalangites did not wear heavy body armor at the time of Alexander.

Another important unit were the [[hypaspist]]s (shield bearers), arranged into three battalions (''[[lochoi]]'') of 1000 men each. One of the battalions was named the ''[[Agema]]'' and served as the King's bodyguards. Their armament is unknown and it is difficult to get a clear picture from ancient sources. Sometimes hypaspists are mentioned in the front line of the battle just between the phalanx and the heavy [[cavalry]]. Moreover, they seem to have acted as an extension of the phalanx fighting as heavy infantry while keeping a link between the heavily clad phalangites and the companion cavalry. They also accompanied Alexander on flanking marches and were capable of fighting on rough terrain like light troops so it seems they could perform dual functions.

In addition to the units mentioned above, the army included some 6000 Greek allied and mercenary [[hoplite]]s, also arranged in phalanxes. They carried a shorter [[spear]], a ''[[dora]]'', which was six or seven feet long and a large ''aspis''. 

Alexander also had light infantry units composed of [[peltast]]s, [[psiloi]] and others. Peltasts are considered to be light infantry, although they had a helmet and a small shield and were heavier than the ''psiloi''. The best peltasts were the [[Agrianians]] from [[Thrace]].

===Cavalry===
The heavy cavalry included the [[Companion cavalry]] raised from the Macedonian nobility, and the Thessalian cavalry. The Companion cavalry (''hetairoi'', friends) was divided into eight squadrons called ''ile'', 200 strong, except the Royal Squadron of 300. They were equipped with a 12 foot lance, the ''xyston'', and heavy body armor. The horses were partially clad in armor as well. The riders did not carry shields, as the xyston required both hands to wield. The organization of the Thessalian cavalry was similar to the Companion Cavalry, but they had a shorter spear and fought in a looser formation.

Of light cavalry, the ''prodromoi'' (forerunners) secured the wings of the army during battle and went on [[reconnaissance]] missions. Several hundred allied horses rounded out the cavalry.

==Death==
[[Image:Alexander the great 1.jpg|thumb|left|Contemporary [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Alexander the Great.]]

On the afternoon of [[June 10]] - [[June 11|11]], [[323 BC]], Alexander died of a mysterious illness in the palace of [[Nebuchadrezzar II|Nebuchadrezzar II of Babylon]]. He was just one month shy of attaining 33 years of age. Various theories have been proposed for the cause of his death which include [[poisoning]] by the sons of [[Antipater]] or others, sickness that followed a drinking party, or a relapse of the [[malaria]] he had contracted in [[336 BC]].

What is certain is that on May 29, Alexander participated in a banquet organized by his friend [[Medius of Larissa]]. After some heavy drinking, immediately or after a bath, he was forced to bed badly ill. The troops started rumors, more and more anxious, and on June 9, the generals decided to let the soldiers see their king alive one last time. They were admitted to his presence one at a time, while the king, too ill to speak, confined himself to move his hand. The day after, Alexander was dead.  

The poisoning theory derives from the story held in antiquity by Justin and Curtius. The original story stated that [[Cassander]], son of [[Antipater]], viceroy of Greece, brought the poison to Alexander in Babylon in a mule's hoof, and that Alexander's royal cupbearer, [[Iollas]], brother of Cassander, administered it. Many had powerful motivations for seeing Alexander gone, and were none the worse for it after his death. Deadly agents that could have killed Alexander in one or more doses include hellebore and [[strychnine]].  In [[Robin Lane Fox|R. Lane Fox]]'s opinion, the strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days had passed between the start of his illness and his death and in the ancient world, such long-acting poisons were probably not available (though this discounts the possibility of multiple doses). 

However, the warrior culture of Macedon favored the sword over strychnine, and many ancient historians, like [[Plutarch]] and [[Arrian]], maintained that Alexander was not poisoned, but died of natural causes.  Instead, it is likely that Alexander died of malaria or typhoid fever, which were rampant in ancient Babylon.  Other illnesses could have also been the culprit, including [[acute pancreatitis]] or the [[West Nile virus|West Nile]] virus. Recently, theories have been advanced stating that Alexander may have died from the treatment not the disease.  [[Hellebore]], believed to have been widely used as a medicine at the time but deadly in large doses, may have been overused by the impatient king to speed his recovery, with deadly results.  Disease-related theories often cite the fact that Alexander's health had fallen to dangerously low levels after years of heavy drinking and suffering several appalling wounds (including one in [[India]] that nearly claimed his life), and that it was only a matter of time before one sickness or another finally killed him.  

No story is conclusive. Alexander's death has been reinterpreted many times over the centuries, and each generation offers a new take on it. What is certain is that Alexander died of a high fever on June 10 or 11 of 323 BC. On his death bed, his marshals asked him to whom he bequeathed his kingdom. Since Alexander had only one heir, it was a question of vital importance. He answered famously, &quot;the strongest.&quot;  Before dying, his final words were &quot;I foresee a great funeral contest over me.&quot; Alexander's 'funeral games', where his marshals fought it out over control of his empire, lasted for nearly forty years.  

Alexander's death has been surrounded by as much controversy as many of the events of his life. Before long, accusations of foul play were being thrown about by his generals at one another, making it incredibly hard for a modern historian to sort out the propaganda and the half-truths from the actual events. No contemporary source can be fully trusted because of the incredible level of self-serving recording, and as a result what truly happened to Alexander the Great may never be known.

Alexander's body was placed in a gold anthropid [[sarcophagus]], which was in turn placed in a second gold casket and covered with a purple robe. Alexander's coffin was placed, together with his armor, in a gold carriage which had a vaulted roof supported by an Ionic peristyle. The decoration of the carriage was very rich and is described in great detail by Diodoros. 

According to legend, Alexander was preserved in a clay vessel full of [[honey]] (which acts as a preservative) and interred in a glass [[coffin]]. According to Aelian (''Varia Historia'' 12.64), [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] stole the body and brought it to [[Alexandria]], where it was on display until Late Antiquity. It was here that [[Ptolemy IX of Egypt|Ptolemy IX]], one of the last successors of Ptolemy I, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one, and melted the original down in order to strike emergency gold issues of his coinage. The citizens of Alexandria were outraged at this and soon after Ptolemy IX was killed. Its current whereabouts are unknown.

The so-called &quot;Alexander Sarcophagus,&quot; discovered near [[Sidon]] and now in the [[Istanbul Archaeological Museum]], is now generally thought to be that of [[Abdylonymus]], whom Hephaestion appointed as the king of Sidon by Alexander's order. The sarcophagus depicts Alexander and his companions hunting and in battle with the Persians.

==Legacy and division of the empire==
{{main|Diadochi}}
[[Image:Alexander Aramaic coin.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Coin of Alexander bearing an [[Aramaic language]] inscription.]]
After Alexander's death, his empire was divided among his officers, mostly with the pretense of first preserving a united kingdom. Later, his officers were focused on the explicit formation of rival monarchies and territorial states. 

Ultimately, the conflict was settled after the [[Battle of Ipsus]] in [[Phrygia]] in [[301 BC]]. Alexander's empire was divided at first into four major portions: Cassander ruled in [[Macedon]], [[Lysimachus]] in [[Thrace]], [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]] in [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Iran]], and [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] in the [[Levant]] and [[Egypt]]. [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]] ruled for a while in [[Asia Minor]] and [[Syria]] but was eventually defeated by the other generals at Ipsus ([[301 BC]]). Control over [[India]]n territory was short-lived when Seleucus was defeated by [[Chandragupta Maurya]], the first [[Mauryan]] emperor.

By [[270 BC]], [[Hellenistic]] states consolidated, with:
:*The [[Antigonid dynasty|Antigonid Empire]] centered on Macedon.
:*The [[Seleucid Empire]] in Asia
:*The [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic kingdom]] in Egypt, Palestine and [[Cyrenaica]] 

By the [[1st century BC]] though, most of the Hellenistic territories in the West had been absorbed by the [[Roman Republic]]. In the East, they had been dramatically reduced by the expansion of the [[Parthian Empire]] and the secession of the [[Greco-Bactrian]] kingdom.

Alexander's conquests also had long term [[cultural]] effects, with the flourishing of [[Hellenistic civilization]] throughout the [[Middle-East]] and [[Central Asia]], and the development of [[Greco-Buddhist art]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]].
===Influence on [[Ancient Rome]]===
[[Image:Mosaica.jpg|thumb|200px|A mural in [[Pompeii]], depicting the marriage of Alexander to Barsine (Stateira) in 324 BC. The couple are apparently dressed as Ares and Aphrodite.]]
Alexander and his exploits were admired by many Romans who wanted to associate themselves with his achievements, although very little is known about Roman-Macedonian diplomatic relations of that time. [[Julius Caesar]] wept in Spain at the mere sight of Alexander's statue and [[Pompey the Great]] rummaged through the closets of conquered nations for Alexander's 260-year-old cloak, which the Roman general then wore as the costume of greatness. However in his zeal to honor Alexander, [[Octavian Augustus]] accidentally broke the nose off the Macedonian's mummified corpse while laying a wreath at the hero's shrine in Alexandria, Egypt. The unbalanced emperor [[Caligula]] later took the dead king's armor from that tomb and donned it
for luck. The Macriani, a Roman family that rose to the imperial throne in the [[3rd century]] A.D., always kept images of Alexander on their persons, either stamped into their bracelets and rings or stitched into their garments. Even their dinnerware bore Alexander's face, with the story of the king's life displayed around the rims of special bowls[[#Notes|&amp;sup1;]].

In the summer of [[1995]] during the archaeological work of the season centered on excavating the remains of domestic architecture of early-Roman date a statue of Alexander was recovered from the structure, which was richly decorated with mosaic and marble pavements and probably was constructed in the 1st century A.D. and occupied until the 3rd century[[#Notes|&amp;sup2;]].

==Alexander's character==
{{npov-section}}

[[Image:Ac alexanderstatue.jpg|thumb|250px|Equestrian statue of [[Alexander the Great]], on the waterfront at [[Thessaloniki]], capital of [[Greek Macedonia]].]]

Modern opinion on Alexander has run the gamut from the idea that he believed he was on a divinely-inspired mission to unite the [[human race]], to the view that he was a [[Narcissism|megalomaniac]] bent on [[Global domination|world domination]]. Such views tend to be [[Anachronism|anachronistic]], however, and the sources allow for a variety of interpretations. Much about Alexander's personality and aims remains enigmatic.

Alexander is remembered as a legendary hero in [[Europe]] and much of both [[Southwest Asia]] and [[Central Asia]], where he is known as '''Iskander''' or '''Iskandar Zulkarnain'''. To [[Zoroastrians]], on the other hand, he is remembered as the destroyer of their first great empire and as the leveller of [[Persepolis]]. Ancient sources are generally written with an agenda of either glorifying or denigrating the man, making it difficult to evaluate his actual character. Most refer to a growing instability and megalomania in the years following Gaugamela, but it has been suggested that this simply reflects the Greek [[stereotype]] of an orientalizing king. The murder of his friend [[Clitus the Black|Clitus]], which Alexander deeply and immediately regretted, is often cited as a sign of his paranoia, as is his execution of Philotas and his general Parmenion for failure to pass along details of a plot against him. However, this may have been more prudence than paranoia.

Modern Alexandrists continue to debate these same issues, among others, in modern times. One unresolved topic involves whether Alexander was actually attempting to better the world by his conquests, or whether his purpose was primarily to rule the world.

Partially in response to the ubiquity of positive portrayals of Alexander, an alternate character is sometimes presented which emphasizes some of Alexander's negative aspects. Some proponents of this view cite the destructions of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Tyre]], [[Persepolis]], and [[Gaza]] as examples of atrocities, and argue that Alexander preferred to fight rather than negotiate. It is further claimed, in response to the view that Alexander was generally tolerant of the cultures of those whom he conquered, that his attempts at cultural fusion were severely practical and that he never actually admired Persian art or culture. To this way of thinking, Alexander was, first and foremost, a general rather than a statesman.

Alexander's character also suffers from the interpretation of historians who themselves are subject to the bias and idealisms of their own time. Good examples are [[W. W. Tarn]], who wrote during the late [[19th century]] and early [[20th century]], and who saw Alexander in an extremely good light, and [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]], who wrote after [[World War II]] and for whom Alexander did little that was not inherently selfish or ambition-driven. Tarn wrote in an age where world conquest and warrior-heroes were acceptable, even encouraged, whereas Green wrote with the backdrop of [[the Holocaust]] and [[nuclear weapon]]s. As a result, Alexander's character is skewed depending on which way the historian's own culture is, and further muddles the debate of who he truly was.

===Stories and legends===
According to one story, the philosopher [[Anaxarchus]] checked the vainglory of Alexander, when he aspired to the honors of divinity, by pointing to Alexander's wound, saying, &quot;See the blood of a mortal, not the [[ichor]] of a god.&quot; In another version, Alexander himself pointed out the difference in response to a [[sycophant]]ic soldier. A strong oral tradition, although not attested in any extant primary source, lists Alexander as having [[epilepsy]], known to the Greeks as the Sacred Disease and thought to be a mark of divine favor.

Alexander had a legendary horse named [[Bucephalus]] (meaning &quot;ox-headed&quot;), supposedly descended from the [[Mares of Diomedes]]. Alexander himself, while still a young boy, tamed this horse after experienced horse-trainers failed to do so.

There is an apocryphal tale, appearing in a redaction of the pseudo-historical [[Alexander Romance]], which details another end for the last true Pharaoh of Egypt. Soon after Alexander's divinity was confirmed by the Oracle of Zeus Ammon, a rumor was begun that [[Nectanebo II]] did not travel to [[Nubia]] but instead to the court of Philip II of Macedon in the guise of an Egyptian magician. He coupled with Phillip's wife [[Olympias]] and from his issue came Alexander. This myth would hold strong appeal for Egyptians who desired continuity in rule and harbored a strong dislike for foreign rule.

Another legend tells of Alexander's campaign down into the Syrian world toward Egypt. On the way, he planned to lay siege to the city of [[Jerusalem]]. As the victorious armies of the Greeks approached the city, word was brought to the Jews in Jerusalem that the armies were on their way. The high priest at that time, who was a godly old man by the name of Jaddua (mentioned also in the [[Bible]] [[book of Nehemiah]]) took the sacred writings of [[Daniel the prophet]] and, accompanied by a host of other priests dressed in white garments, went forth and met Alexander some distance outside the city.

All this is from the report of [[Josephus]], the Jewish historian, who tells us that Alexander left his army and hurried to meet this body of priests. When he met them, he told the high priest that he had had a vision the night before in which God had shown him an old man, robed in a white garment, who would show him something of great significance to himself, according to the account, the high priest then opened the prophecies of Daniel and read them to Alexander.

In the prophecies Alexander was able to see the predictions that he would become that notable goat with the horn in his forehead, who would come from the West and smash the power of Persia and conquer the world. He was so overwhelmed by the accuracy of this prophecy and, of course, by the fact that it spoke about him, that he promised that he would save Jerusalem from siege, and sent the high priest back with honors.

==Ancient sources==
The ancient sources for Alexander's life are, from the perspective of ancient history, relatively numerous. Alexander himself left only a few inscriptions and some letter-fragments of dubious authenticity, but a large number of his contemporaries wrote full accounts. The key contemporary historians are considered [[Callisthenes]], his general [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]], [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia|Aristobulus]], [[Nearchus]] and [[Onesicritus]]. Another influential account was penned by [[Cleitarchus]], who, while not a direct witness of Alexander's expedition, used the sources which had just been published. His work was to be the backbone of that of [[Timagenes]], who heavily influenced many surviving historians. Unfortunately, all these works were lost. Instead, the modern historian must rely on authors who used these and other early sources. 

The five main accounts are by Arrian, Curtius, Plutarch, Diodorus, and Justin.
* ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'' (''The Campaigns of Alexander'' in Greek) by the Greek historian [[Arrian]] of [[Nicomedia]], writing in the [[2nd century AD]], and based largely on Ptolemy and, to a lesser extent, Aristobulus and Nearchus. It is considered generally the most trustworthy source.
* ''Historiae Alexandri Magni'', a biography of Alexander in ten books, of which the last eight survive, by the Roman historian [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]], written in the [[1st century AD]], and based largely on Cleitarchus through the mediation of Timagenes, with some material probably from Ptolemy;
* ''Life of Alexander'' (see ''[[Parallel Lives]]'') and two orations ''On the Fortune or the Virtue of Alexander the Great'' (see ''[[Moralia]]''), by the Greek historian and biographer [[Plutarch]] of [[Chaeronea]] in the second century, based largely on Aristobulus and especially Cleitarchus.
* ''Bibliotheca historia'' (''Library of world history''), written in Greek by the [[Sicilian]] historian [[Diodorus Siculus]], from which Book 17 relates the conquests of Alexander, based almost entirely on Timagenes's work. The books immediately before and after, on Philip and Alexander's &quot;Successors,&quot; throw light on Alexander's reign.
* The ''Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus'' by [[Junianus Justinus|Justin]], which contains factual errors and is highly compressed. It is difficult in this case to understand the source, since we only have an epitome, but it is thought that also [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus|Pompeius Trogus]] may have limited himself to use Timagenes for his Latin history. To these five main sources some like to add the ''[[Metz Epitome]]'', an anonymous late Latin work that narrates Alexander's campaigns from [[Hyrcania]] to India. Much is also recounted incidentally in other authors, including [[Strabo]], [[Athenaeus]], [[Polyaenus]], [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], and others.

The &quot;problem of the sources&quot; is the main concern (and chief delight) of Alexander-historians. In effect, each presents a different &quot;Alexander,&quot; with details to suit. Arrian is mostly interested in the military aspects, while Curtius veers to a more private and darker Alexander. Plutarch can't resist a good story, light or dark. All, with the possible exception of Arrian, include a considerable level of fantasy, prompting Strabo to remark, &quot;All who wrote about Alexander preferred the marvellous to the true.&quot; Nevertheless, the sources tell us much, and leave much to our interpretation and imagination.

==Alexander's legend==
Alexander was a legend in his own time. His court historian Callisthenes portrayed the sea in [[Cilicia]] as drawing back from him in [[proskynesis]]. Writing after Alexander's death, another participant, [[Onesicritus]], went so far as to invent a [[tryst]] between Alexander and [[Thalestris]], queen of the mythical [[Amazons]]. When Onesicritus read this passage to his patron, Alexander's general and later King [[Lysimachus]], Lysimachus reportedly quipped &quot;I wonder where I was at the time.&quot; 

In the first centuries after Alexander's death, probably in [[Alexandria]], a quantity of the more legendary material coalesced into a text known as the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'', later falsely ascribed to the historian Callisthenes and therefore known as ''Pseudo-Callisthenes''. This text underwent numerous expansions and revisions throughout Antiquity and the [[Middle Ages]], exhibiting a plasticity unseen in &quot;higher&quot; literary forms. Latin and [[Syriac]] translations were made in Late Antiquity. From these, versions were developed in all the major languages of [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]], including [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Slavic languages|Slavonic]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[French language|French]]. The &quotwry's Bluff]], [[Battle of Fort Hindman | Arkansas Post]], and [[Battle of Mobile Bay | Mobile Bay]].

===Eastern Theater 1861&amp;ndash;1863===
{{see details|Eastern Theater of the American Civil War}}
Because of the fierce resistance of a few initial Confederate forces at [[Manassas, Virginia]], in July 1861, a march by Union troops under the command of Maj. Gen. [[Irvin McDowell]] on the Confederate forces there was halted in the [[First Battle of Bull Run]], or ''First Manassas'', whereupon they were forced back to [[Washington, D.C.]], by Confederate troops under the command of Generals [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and P.G.T. Beauregard. It was in this battle that Confederate General [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas Jackson]] received the name of &quot;Stonewall&quot; because he stood like a stone wall against Union troops. Alarmed at the loss, and in an attempt to prevent more slave states from leaving the Union, the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Crittenden-Johnson Resolution]] on [[July 25]] of that year, which stated that the war was being fought to preserve the Union and not to end [[slavery]].

Major General [[George B. McClellan]] took command of the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] on [[July 26]] (he was briefly general-in-chief of all the Union armies, but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj. Gen. [[Henry W. Halleck]]), and the war began in earnest in [[1862]].

Upon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan invaded Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] and [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], southeast of Richmond. Although McClellan's army reached the gates of Richmond in the [[Peninsula Campaign]], [[Joseph E. Johnston]] halted his advance at the [[Battle of Seven Pines]], then [[Robert E. Lee]] defeated him in the [[Seven Days Battles]] and forced his retreat. McClellan was stripped of many of his troops to reinforce [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]]'s Union [[Army of Virginia]]. Pope was beaten spectacularly by Lee in the [[Northern Virginia Campaign]] and the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] in August.

[[Image:conf_dead_chancellorsville.jpg|thumb|300px|Confederate dead behind the stone wall of Marye's Heights, Fredericksburg, Virginia, killed during the Battle of Chancellorsville, May 1863.]]

Emboldened by Second Bull Run, the Confederacy made its first invasion of the North, when General Lee led 55,000 men of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] across the [[Potomac River]] into [[Maryland]] on [[September 5]]. Lincoln then restored Pope's troops to McClellan. McClellan and Lee fought at the [[Battle of Antietam]] near [[Sharpsburg, Maryland]], on [[September 17]] [[1862]], the bloodiest single day in American history. Lee's army, checked at last, returned to Virginia before McClellan could destroy it. Antietam is considered a Union victory because it halted Lee's invasion of the North and provided justification for Lincoln to announce his [[Emancipation Proclamation]].

When the cautious McClellan failed to follow up on Antietam, he was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]]. Burnside suffered near-immediate defeat at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] on [[December 13]] [[1862]], when over ten thousand Union soldiers were killed or wounded. After the battle, Burnside was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker|Joseph &quot;Fighting Joe&quot; Hooker]]. Hooker, too, proved unable to defeat Lee's army; despite outnumbering the Confederates by more than two to one, he was humiliated in the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May 1863. He was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[George G. Meade]] during Lee's second invasion of the North, in June. Meade defeated Lee at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] ([[July 1]]&amp;ndash;[[July 3|3]], [[1863]]), the largest battle in North American history, which is sometimes considered the war's [[Turning point of the American Civil War|turning point]]. Lee's army suffered 28,000 casualties (versus Meade's 23,000), again forcing it to retreat to Virginia, never to launch a full-scale invasion of the North again. Lincoln was angry that Meade failed to intercept Lee's retreat, and decided to turn to the Western Theater for new leadership.

===Western Theater 1861&amp;ndash;1863===
{{see details|Western Theater of the American Civil War}}
While the Confederate forces had numerous successes in the Eastern theater, they crucially failed in the West. They were driven from Missouri early in the war as result of the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]]. [[Leonidas Polk]]'s invasion of [[Kentucky]] enraged the citizens there who previously had declared neutrality in the war, turning that state against the Confederacy.

[[Nashville, Tennessee]], fell to the Union early in 1862. Most of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] was opened with the taking of [[Battle of Island Number Ten|Island No. 10]] and [[New Madrid, Missouri]], and then [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], was captured in May 1862, allowing the Union forces to begin moving up the Mississippi as well. Only the fortress city of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], prevented unchallenged Union control of the entire river.

[[Braxton Bragg]]'s second Confederate invasion of Kentucky was repulsed by [[Don Carlos Buell]] at the confused and bloody [[Battle of Perryville]] and he was narrowly defeated by [[William S. Rosecrans]] at the [[Battle of Stones River]] in [[Tennessee]].

The one clear Confederate victory in the West was the [[Battle of Chickamauga]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], near the [[Tennessee]] border, where Bragg, reinforced by the corps of [[James Longstreet]] (from Lee's army in the east), defeated Rosecrans, despite the heroic defensive stand of [[George Henry Thomas]], and forced him to retreat to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], which Bragg then besieged.

The Union's key strategist and tactician in the west was Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]], who won victories at: Forts [[Battle of Fort Henry|Henry]] and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Donelson]], by which the Union seized control of the [[Tennessee River |Tennessee]] and [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] Rivers; [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]]; the [[Battle of Vicksburg]], cementing Union control of the Mississippi River and considered one of the [[Turning point of the American Civil War |turning points]] of the war; and the  [[Battle of Chattanooga III|Battle of Chattanooga, Tennessee]], driving Confederate forces out of Tennessee and opening an invasion route to [[Atlanta, Georgia |Atlanta]] and the heart of the Confederacy.

===Trans-Mississippi Theater 1861&amp;ndash;1865===
{{see details| Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War}}
Though geographically isolated from the battles to the east, a number of small-scale military actions took place west of the Mississippi River. Confederate incursions into Arizona and New Mexico were repulsed in 1862. Guerilla activity turned much of Missouri and Indian Territory (Oklahoma) into a battleground. Late in the war the Federal [[Red River Campaign]] was a failure. Texas remained in Confederate hands throughout the war, but was cut off after the capture of [[Vicksburg]] in 1863 gave the Union control of the Mississippi River.

===End of the War 1864&amp;ndash;1865===
[[Image:President-Jefferson-Davis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jefferson Davis]], first and only President of the Confederate States of America]]

At the beginning of 1864, Lincoln made Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant made his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac, and put Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in command of most of the western armies. Grant understood the concept of [[total war]] and believed, along with Lincoln and Sherman, that only the utter defeat of Confederate forces and their economic base would bring an end to the war.  He devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the heart of Confederacy from multiple directions: Generals Grant, Meade, and [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] would move against Lee near Richmond; General [[Franz Sigel]] (and later [[Philip Sheridan]]) would [[Valley Campaigns of 1864|invade the Shenandoah Valley]]; General Sherman would and capture [[Atlanta]] and march to the sea; Generals [[George Crook]] and [[William W. Averell]] would operate against railroad supply lines in [[West Virginia]]; and General [[Nathaniel Prentiss Banks|Nathaniel Banks]] would capture [[Mobile, Alabama]].

Union forces in the East attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles during that phase (&quot;Grant's [[Overland Campaign]]&quot;) of the Eastern campaign. An attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the [[Bermuda Hundred Campaign | Bermuda Hundred]] river bend. Grant was tenacious and, despite astonishing losses (over 66,000 casualties in six weeks), kept pressing Lee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. He pinned down the Confederate army in the [[Siege of Petersburg]], where the two armies engaged in [[trench warfare]] for over nine months.

Grant finally found a commander, General [[Philip Sheridan]], aggressive enough to prevail in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Sheridan proved to be more than a match for [[Jubal Anderson Early|Jubal Early]], and defeated him in a series of battles, including a final decisive defeat at [[Battle of Cedar Creek|Cedar Creek]], Sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the Valley, a strategy similar to the tactics Sherman would later employ in Georgia.

Meanwhile, Sherman marched from [[Chattanooga]] to Atlanta, defeating Confederate Generals [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and [[John B. Hood]]. The fall of Atlanta, on September 2, 1864, was a significant factor in the re-election of Abraham Lincoln, as President of the Union. Leaving Atlanta, and his base of supplies, Sherman's army marched with an unclear destination, laying waste to about 20% of the farms in Georgia in his celebrated &quot;[[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]&quot;, and reaching the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at [[Savannah, Georgia]] in December 1864. Burning plantations as they went, Sherman's army was followed by thousands of freed slaves.  When Sherman turned north through South Carolina and North Carolina to approach the Virginia lines from the south, it was the end for Lee and his men, and for the Confederacy.

Lee attempted to escape from the besieged Petersburg and link up with Johnston in [[North Carolina]], but he was overtaken by Grant. He surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia on [[April 9]], [[1865]], at [[Appomattox Court House]]. Johnston surrendered his troops to Sherman shortly thereafter at a [[Bennett Place|local family's farmhouse]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]]. The [[Battle of Palmito Ranch]], fought on [[May 13]], [[1865]], in the far south of [[Texas]], was the last Civil War land battle and ended, ironically, with a Confederate victory. All Confederate land forces surrendered by June 1865.

==Analysis of the outcome==
Why the Union prevailed (or why the Confederacy was defeated) in the Civil War has been a subject of extensive analysis and debate. 

Could the South have won? A significant number of scholars believe that the Union held an insurmountable advantage over the Confederacy in terms of industrial strength, population, and the determination to win. Confederate actions, they argue, could only delay defeat. Southern historian [[Shelby Foote]] expressed this view succinctly in Ken Burns's television series on the Civil War: &quot;I think that the North fought that war with one hand behind its back.... If there had been more Southern victories, and a lot more, the North simply would have brought that other hand out from behind its back. I don't think the South ever had a chance to win that War.&quot; [Ward 1990 p 272]

Other historians, however, suggest that the South had a chance to win its independence.  As James McPherson has observed, the Confederacy remained on the defensive, which required fewer military resources. The Union, committed to the strategic offensive, faced enormous manpower demands that it often had difficulty meeting.  War weariness among Union civilians mounted along with casualties, in the long years before Union advantages proved decisive. Thus, the inevitability of Union victory remains hotly contested among scholars.

The goals were not symmetric. To win independence the South had to convince the North it could not win, but it did not have to invade the North. To restore the Union the North had to conquer vast stretches of territory. In the short run (a matter of months) the two sides were evenly matched. But in the long run (a matter of years) the North had advantages that increasingly came into play.

Both sides had long-term advantages but the Union had more of them. The Union had to control the entire coastline, defeat all the main Confederate armies, seize Richmond, and control most of the population centers. As the occupying force they had to station hundreds of thousands of soldiers to control railroads, supply lines, and major towns and cites. The long-term advantages widely credited by historians to have contributed to the Union's success include:
[[Image:Advantages.jpg|right|350px|US economic advantages over CSA]]
*The more industrialized economy of the North, which aided in the production of arms, munitions and supplies, as well as finances, and transportation. The graph shows the relative advantage of the USA over the CSA.
*A [[Second Party System| party system]] that enabled the Republicans to mobilize soldiers and support at the grass roots, even when the war became unpopular. The Confederacy deliberately did not use parties.
*The Union population was 22 million and the South 9 million in 1861; the disparity grew as the Union controlled more and more southern territory with garrisons, and cut off the trans-Mississippi part of the Confederacy. 
*Excellent railroad links between Union cities, which allowed for the quick and cheap movement of troops and supplies. Transportation was much slower and more difficult in the South which was unable to augment its much smaller system or repair damage, or even perform routine maintenance. 
*The Union devoted much more of its resources to medical needs, thereby overcoming the unhealthy disease environment that sickened (and killed) more soldiers than combat did.
*The Union at the start controlled over 80% of the shipyards, steamships, river boats, and the Navy. It augmented these by a massive shipbuilding program. This enabled the Union to control the river systems and to blockade the entire southern coastline. 
*The Union's more established government, particularly a mature executive branch which accumulated even greater power during wartime, may have resulted in less regional infighting and a more streamlined conduct of the war. Failure of Davis to maintain positive and productive relationships with state governors damaged the Confederate president's ability to draw on regional resources.
*The Confederacy's tactic of engaging in major battles at the cost of heavy manpower losses, when it could not easily replace its losses.  
*The Confederacy's [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0HZY/is_1_14/ai_78397581 failure] to fully use its advantages in guerrilla warfare against Union communication and transportation infrastructure.  However, as Lee warned, such warfare would prove devastating to the South, and (with the exception of Confederate partisans in Missouri) Confederate leaders shrank from it.
*Despite the Union's many tactical blunders like the [[Seven Days Battle]], those commited by Confederate generals, such as Lee's miscalculations at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] and [[Battle of Antietam]], were far more serious&amp;mdash;if for no other reason than that the Confederates could so little afford the losses.  
*Lincoln proved more adept than Davis in replacing unsuccessful generals with better ones. 
*Strategically the location of the capital Richmond tied Lee to a highly exposed position at the end of supply lines. (Loss of Richmond, everyone realized, meant loss of the war.) 
*Lincoln grew as a grand strategist, in contrast to Davis. The Confederacy never developed an overall strategy. It never had a plan to deal with the blockade. Davis failed to respond in a coordinated fashion to serious threats, such as Grant's campaign against Vicksburg in 1863 (in the face of which, he allowed Lee to invade Pennsylvania).
*The Confederacy's failure to win diplomatic or military support from any foreign powers. Its [[King Cotton]] misperception of the world economy led to bad diplomacy, such as the refusal to ship cotton before the blockade started. 
* Most important, the Union had the will to win, and leaders like Lincoln, Seward, Stanton, Grant, and Sherman would do whatever it took to achieve victory. The Confederacy, as Beringer et al (1986) argue, may have lacked the total commitment needed to win. It took time, however, for leaders such as Grant, Sherman, and Sheridan to emerge; in the meantime, Union public opinion wavered, and Lincoln worried about losing the election of 1864, until victories in the Shenandoah Valley and Atlanta made victory seem likely.

==Major land battles==
There were as many as 10,000 hostile engagements during the war. The costliest and most significant are listed in [[Battles of the American Civil War]].

==Civil War leaders and soldiers==
[[Image:Lincoln and Davis Statue.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Statues of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Jefferson Davis]] at [[Vicksburg National Military Park]].]]

One of the reasons that the U.S. Civil War wore on as long as it did and the battles were so fierce was that most important generals on both sides had formerly served in the [[United States Army]]&amp;mdash;some, including [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[Robert E. Lee]], during the [[Mexican-American War]] between 1846 and 1848. Most were graduates of the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point.
Southern military commanders and strategists included [[Jefferson Davis]], [[Robert E. Lee]], [[Joseph E. Johnston]], [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson]], [[James Longstreet]], [[P.G.T. Beauregard]], [[John Mosby]], [[Braxton Bragg]], [[John Bell Hood]], [[JEB Stuart|James Ewell Brown (JEB) Stuart]], [[William Mahone]], [[Judah P. Benjamin]], [[Jubal Anderson Early|Jubal Early]], and [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]].

Northern military commanders and strategists included [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Edwin M. Stanton]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], [[George H. Thomas]], [[George B. McClellan]], [[Henry W. Halleck]], [[Joseph Hooker]], [[Ambrose Burnside]], [[Irvin McDowell]], [[Winfield Scott]], [[Philip Sheridan]], [[George Crook]], [[George Armstrong Custer]], [[George G. Meade]], and [[Winfield Hancock]]

After 1980, scholarly attention turned to ordinary soldiers, and to women and African Americans involved with the War. As James McPherson observed &quot;The profound irony of the Civil War was that Confederate and Union soldiers ... interpreted the heritage of 1776 in opposite ways. Confederates fought for liberty and independence from what they regarded as a tyrannical government; Unionists fought to preserve the nation created by the founders from dismemberment and destruction.&quot;(McPherson 1994 p 24)

==The Question of Slavery==
Given the painfulness of the historical memory of slavery for many Americans, its role in the war remains controversial to this day. To understand its place in the conflict, it is necessary to divide the issue in two: slavery as a motivation for secession, and abolition as a Union war aim.

In the weeks and months preceding the secession of the Confederate states, Southern leaders spoke openly about their desire to preserve slavery, and their fears for the &quot;peculiar institution&quot; if the South remained within the Union. Almost all of the ordinances of secession cited the preservation of slavery as a primary, even the foremost, reason for departure from the Union. And yet many individual Southern soldiers fought for reasons quite apart from the defense of slavery: to protect their families and communities, to defend their home states, and out of a nascent sense of nationality. 

On the Union side, Lincoln initially declared his purpose in prosecuting the war to be the preservation of the Union, not emancipation. He had no wish to alienate the thousands of slaveholders in the Union border states. The long war, however, had a radicalizing effect on federal policies. With the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], announced in September 1862 and put into effect four months later, Lincoln adopted the abolition of the [[Slave Power]] as a second mission&amp;mdash;that is slaves owned by rebels had to be taken away from them and freed. One goal was to destroy the economic basis of the Confederate leadership class, and another goal was to actually liberate the 4 million slaves, which was accomplished by 1865.

The Emancipation Proclamation declared all slaves held in territory then under Confederate control  to be &quot;then, thenceforth, and forever free,&quot; but did not affect slaves in areas under Union control. It did, however, show the Union that slavery's days were numbered, increasing abolitionist support in the North. The border states (except Kentucky) abolished slavery on their own.

==Foreign diplomacy==
Because of the Confederacy's attempt to create a new state, recognition and support from the European powers were critical to its prospects. The Union, under [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William Henry Seward]] attempted to block the Confederacy's efforts in this sphere. The Confederates hoped that the importance of the cotton trade to Europe (the idea of [[cotton diplomacy]]) and shortages caused by the war, along with early military victories, would enable them to gather increasing European support and force a turn away from neutrality.

President Lincoln's decision to announce a [[Union blockade|blockade of the Confederacy]], a clear act of war, enabled Britain, followed by other European powers, to announce their neutrality in the dispute. This enabled the Confederacy to begin to attempt to gain support and funds in Europe. President Jefferson Davis had picked [[Robert Toombs]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as his first Secretary of State. Toombs, having little knowledge in foreign affairs, was replaced several months later by [[Robert M. T. Hunter]] of [[Virginia]], another choice with little suitability. Ultimately, on [[March 17]], [[1862]], Davis selected [[Judah P. Benjamin]] of [[Louisiana]] as Secretary of State, who although having more international knowledge and legal experience with international slavery disputes still failed in the end to create a dynamic foreign policy for the Confederacy.

The first attempts to achieve European recognition of the Confederacy were dispatched on [[February 25]], [[1861]] and led by [[William Lowndes Yancey]], [[Pierre A. Rost]], and [[Ambrose Dudley Mann]]. The British foreign minister [[Lord John Russell]] met with them, and the French foreign minister [[Edouard Thouvenel]] received the group unofficially. However, at this point, the two countries had agreed to coordinate and cooperate and would not make any rash moves.

[[Charles Francis Adams]] proved particularly adept as ambassador to Britain for the Union, and Britain was reluctant to boldly challenge the Union's blockade. The Confederacy also attempted to initiate propaganda in Europe through journalists [[Henry Hotze]] and [[Edwin De Leon]] in [[Paris]] and [[London]]. However, public opinion against slavery created a political liability n [[July 20 Plot|July 20, 1944]]. Canaris even employed [[Jew]]s in the Abwehr and used the agency to help a small number of Jews to escape from Germany into [[Switzerland]]. But perhaps the biggest reason was that Canaris himself sought to undermine the Nazi cause. 

Despite the Abwehr's many intelligence coups, its effectiveness was more than negated by agents who — with Canaris's blessing — aided the Allies in whatever covert means were necessary. He personally gave false information which discouraged Hitler from invading [[Switzerland]]. He also persuaded [[Francisco Franco]] not to allow German forces to pass through Spain to invade [[Gibraltar]]. He even provided intelligence to the Allies on German intentions as well. 

The SS continually undermined the Abwehr by putting several Abwehr officers under investigation, believing them (correctly) to be involved in anti-Hitler plots.  The SS also accused Canaris of being defeatist in his intelligence assessments, especially on the Russian campaign. One such briefing reportedly resulting in Hitler seizing Canaris by the lapels, and demanding to know whether the intelligence chief was insinuating that Germany would lose the war.

===The Frau Solf Tea Party and the End of the Abwehr===
{{main|Frau Solf Tea Party}}
The incident which eventually resulted in the dissolution of the Abwehr came to be known as the &quot;[[Frau Solf Tea Party]]&quot;, which took place on [[September 10]], [[1943]].

Frau Johanna (or Hanna) Solf, the widow of Dr. [[Wilhelm Solf]], a former Colonial Minister under [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] and ex-[[Ambassador]] to [[Japan]], had long been involved in the anti-Nazi intellectual movement in Berlin. At a tea party hosted by her, a new member was included in the circle, an attractive young Swiss doctor named Reckse. It turned out that Dr. Reckse was an agent of the [[Gestapo]], to which he reported on the tea party and turned over several incriminating documents. 

The Solf circle was tipped off and had to flee for their lives, but they were all rounded up on [[January 12]], [[1944]]. Eventually everyone who was involved in the Solf Circle except Frau Solf and her daughter, the Countess [[Lagi Gräfin von Ballestrem]], were executed.

One of those executed was Otto Kiep, an official in the Foreign Office, who had friends in the Abwehr, among whom were [[Erich Vermehren]] and his wife, the former [[Countess Elizabeth von Plettenberg]], who were stationed as agents in [[Istanbul]]. Both were summoned to Berlin by the Gestapo in connection with the Kiep case. Fearing for their lives, they contacted the British and defected.

It was mistakenly believed in Berlin that the Vermehrens absconded with the Abwehr's secret codes and turned them over to the British. That proved to be the last straw for Hitler. Despite the efforts of the Abwehr to shift the blame to the SS or even to the Foreign Ministry, Hitler had had enough of Canaris and he told [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] so twice. He summoned the chief of the Abwehr for a final interview and accused him of allowing the Abwehr to &quot;fall into bits&quot;. Canaris quietly agreed that it was &quot;not surprising&quot;, as Germany was already losing the war.

Hitler fired Canaris on the spot, and on [[February 18]], [[1944]], Hitler signed a decree that abolished the Abwehr. Its functions were taken over by the [[RSHA]]. This action deprived the armed forces (and the anti-Nazi conspirators) of an intelligence service of its own and strengthened Himmler's control over the generals.

Canaris, by this time a [[vice admiral]], was cashiered and given the empty position of chief of the Office of Commercial and Economic Warfare. He was arrested on [[July 23]], [[1944]] in the aftermath of the [[July 20 Plot]] against Hitler and executed shortly before the end of the war, along with Oster his deputy.  The functions of the Abwehr were then totally absorbed by the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'', a sub-office of the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) security command, the [[RSHA]].

'''Ancient Pueblo People''', or '''Ancestral Puebloans''' is a preferred term for the cultural group of people often known as '''Anasazi''' who are the ancestors of the modern [[Pueblo people]]s.  The ancestral Puebloans were a [[prehistoric]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] civilization centered around the present-day [[Four Corners (United States)|Four Corners]] area of the [[Southwest United States]].  [[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] still debate when a distinct [[culture]] emerged, but the current consensus, based on terminology defined by the [[Pecos Classification]], suggests their emergence around [[12th century BC|1200 B.C.]], the [[Pecos Classification#Early Basketmaker II Era|Basketmaker II Era]].

The civilization is perhaps best-known for the [[jacal]], [[adobe]] and [[sandstone]] dwellings that they built along cliff walls, particularly during the [[Pecos Classification#Pueblo II Era|Pueblo II]] and [[Pecos Classification#Pueblo III Era|Pueblo III]] eras. The best-preserved examples of those dwellings are in [[National parks (United States)|parks]] such as [[Chaco Canyon|Chaco Culture National Historical Park]], [[Mesa Verde National Park]], [[Hovenweep National Monument]], [[Bandelier National Monument]], and [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument]].  These [[village]]s, called [[pueblo]]s by [[Mexico|Mexican]] settlers, were often only accessible by rope or through [[rock climbing]].

The Ancestral Puebloans are also known for their unique style of [[pottery]], today considered valuable for their rarity.  They also created many [[petroglyph]]s and [[pictograph]]s.

The Ancestral Puebloans migrated from their ancient homeland for several complex reasons.  These may include pressure from [[Numic]]-speaking peoples moving onto the Colorado Plateau as well as climate change which resulted in [[agriculture|agricultural]] failures.   Confirming evidence for climatic change in North America is found in excavations of western regions in the Mississippi Valley between A.D. 1150 and 1350 which show long lasting patterns of warmer, wetter winters and cooler, dryer summers.  Most modern Pueblo peoples (whether Keresans, Hopi, or Tanoans) and historians like James W. Loewen, in his book ''Lies Across America'', assert these people did not &quot;vanish,&quot; as is commonly portrayed, but merged into the various pueblo peoples whose descendants still live in [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]].  This perspective is not new and was also presented in reports from early 20th century anthropologists, including [[Frank Hamilton Cushing]], [[J. Walter Fewkes]] and [[Alfred V. Kidder]]. Many modern Pueblo tribes trace their lineage from settlements in the Anasazi area and areas inhabited by their cultural neighbors, the [[Mogollon]].  For example, the San Ildefonso [[Pueblo people]] believe that their ancestors lived in both the [[Mesa Verde]] area and the current [[Bandelier National Monument|Bandelier]].
  
==Anasazi as a cultural label==
The term &quot;Anasazi&quot; was established in archaeological terminology through the Pecos Classification system in 1927.  Archaeologist Linda Cordell discussed the word's etymology and use:  
:&quot;''The name &quot;Anasazi&quot; has come to mean &quot;ancient people,&quot; although the word itself is [[Navajo language|Navajo]],  meaning &quot;enemy ancestors.&quot;'' [The Navajo word is ''anaasází'' (&lt;''anaa-'' &quot;enemy&quot;, ''sází'' &quot;ancestor&quot;).] ''It is unfortunate that a non-Pueblo word has come to stand for a tradition that is certainly ancestral Pueblo. The term was first applied to ruins of the Mesa Verde by [[Richard Wetherill]], a rancher and trader who, in 1888-1889, was the first Anglo-American to explore the sites in that area. Wetherill knew and worked with Navajos and understood what the word meant. The name was further sanctioned in archaeology when it was adopted by Alfred V. Kidder, the acknowledged dean of Southwestern Archaeology. Kidder felt that is was less cumbersome than a more technical term he might have used. Subsequently some archaeologists who would try to change the term have worried that because the Pueblos speak different languages, there are different words for &quot;ancestor,&quot; and using one might be offensive to people speaking other languages.''

Some modern Pueblo peoples object to the use of the term ''Anasazi'', although there is still controversy among them on a native alternative. The modern Hopi use the word &quot;''Hisatsinom''&quot; in preference to Anasazi.  However, Navajo Nation Historic Preservation Department (NNHPD) spokeman Ronald Maldonado has indicated the Navajo do not favor use of the term &quot;Ancestral Puebloan.&quot; In fact, reports submitted for review by NNHPD are rejected if they include use of the term.

==Cultural divisions==
Archaeological cultural units such as &quot;Anasazi&quot;, [[Hohokam]], [[Patayan]] or Mogollon are used by [[archaeologists]] to define material culture similarities and differences that may identify prehistoric socio-cultural units which may be understood as equivalent to modern tribes, societies or peoples. The names and divisions are classificatory devices based on theoretical perspectives, analytical methods and data available at the time of analysis and publication.  They are subject to change, not only on the basis of new information and discoveries, but also as attitudes and perspectives change within the scientific community.  It should not be assumed that an archaeological division or culture unit corresponds to a particular language group or to a socio-political entity such as a ''tribe''. 

When making use of modern cultural divisions in the American Southwest, it is important to understand three limitations in the current conventions:
*Archaeological research focuses on items left behind during people&amp;#8217;s activities; fragments of pottery vessels, human remains, stone tools or evidence left from the construction of dwellings.  However, many other aspects of the culture of prehistoric peoples are not tangible.  [[Language]]s spoken by these people and their beliefs and behavior are difficult to decipher from physical materials.  Cultural divisions are tools of the modern scientist, and so should not be considered similar to divisions or relationships the ancient residents may have recognized.  Modern cultures in this region, many of whom claim some of these ancient people as ancestors, contain a striking range of diversity in lifestyles, social organization, language and religious beliefs.  This suggests the ancient people were also more diverse than their material remains may suggest.

*The modern term &amp;#8220;style&amp;#8221; has a bearing on how material items such as pottery or [[architecture]] can be interpreted.  Within a people, different means to accomplish the same goal can be adopted by subsets of the larger group.  For example, in modern Western cultures, there are alternative styles of [[clothing]] that characterized older and younger generations.  Some cultural differences may be based on linear traditions, on teaching from one generation or &amp;#8220;school&amp;#8221; to another.  Other varieties in style may have distinguished between arbitrary groups within a culture, perhaps defining [[status]], [[gender]], [[clan]] or [[guild]] affiliation, religious belief or cultural alliances. Variations may also simply reflect the different resources available in a given time or area.
 
*Defining cultural groups, such as the Ancient Pueblo peoples, tends to create an image of territories separated by clear-cut boundaries, like modern state lines.  These simply did not exist. ''Prehistoric people traded, worshipped and collaborated most often with other nearby groups.  Cultural differences should therefore be understood as ''“clinal”'', &quot;increasing gradually as the distance separating groups also increases.&quot;'' (Plog, p. 72.)  Departures from the expected pattern may occur because of unidentified social or political situations or because of geographic barriers.  In the Southwest, mountain ranges, rivers and, most obviously, the [[Grand Canyon]] can be significant barriers for human communities, likely reducing the frequency of contact with other groups.  Current opinion holds that the closer cultural similarity between the Mogollon and Ancient Pueblos and their greater differences from the [[Hohokam]] and [[Patayan]] is due to both the geography and the variety of climate zones in the Southwest.

'''Aalborg''' is a municipality ([[Danish language|Danish]], ''[[Commune (subnational entity)|kommune]]'') in [[North Jutland County]] on the [[Jutland]] peninsula in northern [[Denmark]].  The municipality straddles the [[Limfjord]], the waterway which connects the [[North Sea]] and the [[Kattegat]] east-to-west, and which separates the main body of the Jutland peninsula from the island of [[Vendsyssel-Thy]] north-to-south.  

It is also the name of the municipality's main city and the site of its municipal council, as well as the name of a [[seaport]].  

The municipality and the town have chosen to retain the traditional spelling of the name as ''Aalborg'', although the new spelling ''Ålborg'' is used in other contexts, such as Ålborg Bay (''Ålborg Bugt''), the body of water which lies to the east of the Jutland peninsula.

The municipality, which includes the island of [[Egholm]], covers an area of 560 [[square kilometre|km²]], and has a total population of 192,353 (2005).  The mayor of the municipality is Henning G. Jensen, a member of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] (''Socialdemokraterne'') [[Politics of Denmark|political party]].

Neighboring municipalities are [[Sejlflod]] and [[Hals]] to the east, [[Dronninglund]] and [[Brønderslev]] to the north, [[Aabybro]] and [[Nibe]] to the west, and [[Støvring]] and [[Skørping]] to the south.  The waters splitting the municipality are called ''Langerak'' to the east and ''Gjøl Bredning'' to the west.  The island of Egholm is located in ''Gjøl Bredning'', and is connected by [[ferry]] to the city of Aalborg at its southern shore. 

By [[January 1]], [[2007]] Aalborg municipality will, as the result of [[Municipalities of Denmark#Municipality Reform 2007|''Kommunalreformen'' (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007)]], be merged with existing [[Hals]], [[Nibe]], and [[Sejlflod]] municipalities to form the new Aalborg municipality.  This will create a municipality with an area of 1,171 [[square kilometre|km²]].  The new municipality will belong to the new [[Region Nordjylland]] (&quot;North Jutland Region&quot;).

==Surroundings==
The area is typical for the north of Jutland.  To the west the Limfjord broadens into an irregular lake (salt water), with low, marshy shores and many islands.  Northwest is [[Store Vildmose]] (&quot;Greater Wild bog&quot;), a swamp where a mirage is sometimes seen in summer. Southeast lies the similar [[Lille Vildmose]] (&quot;Lesser Wild bog&quot;).  Store Vildmose was drained and farmed in the beginning of the 20th century, and Lille Vildmose is now the largest [[Bog|moor]] in Denmark.

==The city of Aalborg==
The city of Aalborg is the fourth largest city in Denmark— after [[Copenhagen]], [[Aarhus]] and [[Odense]].  It is the location of [[Aalborg Air Base]], an important base of the [[Danish Air Force|Danish air force]], and is the seat of a [[Lutheran]] [[bishop]]. 

Railway connects Aalborg with [[Hjørring]], [[Frederikshavn]], and [[Skagen]] to the north, and with [[Aarhus]] and the lines from [[Germany]] to the south, as well as to [[Copenhagen]] in the east over the island of [[Funen]].

The harbour is good and safe, though fairly difficult to access.

===History===
Aalborg traces its history back over 1000 years.  It was originally settled as a trading post, because of its position on the Limfjord. The sites of what were two settlements and a visible burial ground can be seen on [[Lindholm Høje]], a hill overlooking the city.  The size of these settlements emphasise the significance of this place as a crossroads.

The first mention of Aalborg under its original name ''Alabu'', is found on a coin dated to 1040. 

During the [[Middle Ages]], Aalborg prospered and became one of the largest cities in Denmark.  This prosperity was further enhanced when in [[1516]] Aalborg was granted a [[monopoly]] in salt herring. 

Aalborg received town privileges in [[1342]] and the bishopric dates from [[1554]].

During the German invasion of Denmark in 1940, the Aalborg Aerodrome was captured by Nazi paratroopers very early in the action.

===Industry===
Aalborg is a growing industrial and commercial centre, exporting grain, cement and fish. 

It is home to [[De Danske Spritfabrikker]]'s (&quot;Danish Distillers&quot;) [[akvavit|aquavit]] [[snaps]], production facility for the distillation of the Aalborg family of akvavits consisting of 17 different brands.  Danish Distillers is Scandinavia's largest producer and supplier of spirits for consumption, and is the world's largest producer and exporter of aquavit, supplying over 140 geographic markets.

It is also the centre of a growing telecomunications industry originating from the [[University of Aalborg|Aalborg University]].

[[Image:Aalborg NyTorv 2004 ubt.jpeg|thumb|300px|left|Nytorv, next to [[Limfjord]].]]

===Carnival in Aalborg===
The annual carnival takes place the last weekend in May.

During the carnival, Aalborg receives about 100,000 people. Friday “The Battle of Carnival Bands” is an exciting and colourful evening with processions through the city when all the participating groups compete to be the leading carnival group. 

The carnival itself is the following Saturday – on this day the city centre is full of life. The streets are filled with gaily dressed people who are in a real spring mood. In Kilde Park concerts are given from various stages all day to midnight. The Carnival ends with a grand firework display on the harbour.

===Architecture and tourist attractions===
The old castle [[Aalborghus Castle]] (''Aalborghus Slot'') and some picturesque houses of the [[17th century]] remain in the center of the town. The [[Timber framing|half-timbered]] (''bindingsværk'')  castle was built in 1550 by King [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]], and was converted to government administration offices in the 1950s.

[[Budolfi Church]] cathedral dates mostly from the middle of the [[18th century]], while ''Vor Frue Kirke'' (Church of Our Lady) was partially burnt in [[1894]].  The foundations of both churches are from the [[14th century]] or earlier.  

There are also an ancient hospital and a museum of art and antiquities.  

On the north side of the Limfjord is [[Nørresundby]], which is connected to Aalborg by a road bridge, an iron railway bridge, as well as a motorway tunnel running under the Limfjord.  Nørresundby is the site of the Lindholm Høje settlement and burial ground from the Germanic Iron Age and [[Viking]] times. There is also a museum on the site.

[[Aalborgtårnet]]. A tripod tower erected in 1933. The tower still gives an exquisite view over the
fjord and the city from its 105 m rise over the sea level. 

&lt;!--==Famous residents of the municipality==--&gt;
==Twinning==
Aalborg maintains cultural, economic and educational ties with some 25 cities around the globe, among others [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]. Thus, Aalborg has the most twin cities in Denmark. Every five years Aalborg gathers youth from the majority of its twin cities for a week of sports games, known as Ungdomslegene (The Youth Games).

==Other information==
The city has a [[football (soccer)|football]] team playing in the Danish Superleague, [[Aalborg Boldspilklub]], which is known as AaB.

The city has the highest number of [[hairdresser]] shops, [[tattoo]] shops, bars, night clubs, pubs and [[solariums]] per inhabitant in [[Denmark]].

* [http://www.interaalborg.dk/ InterAalborg.dk An independent guide and information o the affairs of [[Poland]], if it is a question of its restoration.&quot; 

The treaty of Vienna, which added largely to the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], he complained had &quot;ill requited him for his loyalty,&quot; and he was only mollified for the time by Napoleon's public declaration that he had no intention of restoring Poland, and by a convention, signed on the [[4 January]], [[1810]] but not ratified, abolishing the Polish name and orders of [[chivalry]].

But if Alexander suspected Napoleon, Napoleon was no less suspicious of Alexander; and, partly to test his sincerity, he sent an almost peremptory request for the hand of the [[Grand Duchess]] Anne, the younger sister of the Tsar.  After some little delay Alexander returned a polite refusal, on the plea of the tender age of the [[Princess]] and the objection of the [[Empress dowager]] [[Sophie Marie Dorothea of Württemberg|Maria Fyodorovna]] to the marriage.  Napoleon's answer was to refuse to ratify the convention of the [[4 January]], [[1810]] and to announce his engagement to the [[Archduke |Archduchess]] [[Marie Louise of Austria|Marie Louise]] in such a way as to lead Alexander to suppose that the two marriage treaties had been negotiated simultaneously.  From this time the relation between the two emperors gradually became more and more strained.

The annexation of [[Oldenburg (state) | Oldenburg]], of which the [[Peter Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Oldenburg|Duke of Oldenburg]] ([[January 3]], [[1754]]&amp;ndash;[[July 2]], [[1823]]) was the Tsar's uncle, to [[France]] in December, [[1810]], added another to the personal grievances of Alexander against Napoleon; while the ruinous reaction of &quot;the continental system&quot; on Russian trade made it impossible for the Tsar to maintain a policy which was Napoleon's chief motive for the alliance.  An acid correspondence followed, and ill-concealed armaments, which culminated in the [[Summer]] of [[1812]] in Napoleon's invasion of Russia.  Yet, even after the French had passed the frontier, Alexander still protested that his personal sentiments towards the Emperor were unaltered; &quot;but,&quot; he added, &quot;[[God]] Himself cannot undo the past.&quot; It was the occupation of [[Moscow]] and the desecration of the [[Kremlin]], the sacred centre of Holy Russia, that changed his sentiment for Napoleon into passionate hatred.  In vain the French Emperor, within eight days of his entry into Moscow, wrote to the Tsar a letter, which was  one long cry of distress, revealing the desperate straits of the [[Grand Army]], and appealed to &quot;any remnant of his former sentiments.&quot; Alexander returned no answer to these 
&quot;fanfaronnades.&quot; &quot;No more peace with Napoleon!&quot; he cried, &quot;He or I, I or He: we cannot longer reign together!&quot;

===The campaign of 1812===
[[Image:Russparis.jpg|thumb|350px|''Russian army enters [[Paris]] in [[1814]]''.]]
The campaign of [[1812]] was the turning-point of Alexander's life; and its horrors, for which his sensitive nature felt much of the responsibility, overset still more a mind never too well balanced. When Napoleon crossed the Russian border with his [[Grand Army]], Alexander I was quite unprepared for the war, trusting the Francophile chancellor [[Rumyantsev|Nikolay Rumyantsev]] more than his French ambassador [[Alexander Kurakin]], who had warned him about Napoleon's bellicose plans. Russia proclaimed a [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|Patriotic War]] in defence of the Motherland. At the burning of [[Moscow]], he declared afterwards, his own [[soul]] had found illumination, and he had realized once for all the divine revelation to him of his mission as the peacemaker of Europe.  He tried to calm the unrest of his conscience by correspondence with the leaders of the [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] revival on the [[continent]], and sought for [[omen]]s and [[supernatural]] guidance in texts and passages of [[scripture]].  It was not, however, according to his own account, till he met the [[Barbara Juliana, Baroness von Krudener|Baroness de Krüdener]] &amp;mdash; a religious adventuress who made the conversion of princes her special mission&amp;mdash;at [[Basel]], in the [[Autumn]] of [[1813]], that his soul found peace.  From this time a [[mystic]] [[pietism]] became the avowed force of his political, as of his private actions.  Madame de Krüdener, and her colleague, the evangelist Empaytaz, became the confidants of the Emperor's most secret thoughts; and during the campaign that ended in the occupation of [[Paris]] the imperial [[prayer]]-meetings were the [[oracle]] on whose revelations hung the fate of the world.

==Liberal political views==
From the end of the year [[1818]] Alexander's views began to change.  A [[revolution]]ary [[conspiracy]] among the officers of the guard, and a foolish plot to kidnap him on his way to the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)|Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle]], are said to have shaken the foundations of his [[Liberalism]].  At Aix he came for the first time into intimate contact with Metternich, and the astute Austrian was swift to take advantage of the psychological moment.  From this time dates the ascendancy of Metternich over the mind of the Russian Emperor and in the councils of Europe.  It was, however, no case of sudden conversion.  Though alarmed by the revolutionary agitation in Germany, which culminated in the murder of his agent, the dramatist [[August von Kotzebue]] ([[March 23]], [[1819]]), Alexander approved of Castlereagh's protest against Metternich's policy of &quot;the governments contracting an alliance against the peoples,&quot; as formulated in the [[Carlsbad Decrees]] of July, [[1819]], and deprecated any intervention of Europe to support &quot;a league of which the sole object is the absurd pretensions of absolute power.&quot;

He still declared his belief in &quot;free institutions, though not in such as age forced from feebleness, nor contracts ordered by popular leaders from their sovereigns, nor constitutions granted in difficult circumstances to tide over a crisis. &quot;Liberty,&quot; he maintained, &quot;should be confined within just limits.  And the limits of liberty are the principles of order&quot;.

It was the apparent triumph of the principles of disorder in the revolutions of [[Naples]] and [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]], combined with increasingly disquieting symptoms of discontent in France, Germany, and among his own people, that completed Alexander's conversion.  In the seclusion of the little town of [[Troppau]], where in October of [[1820]] the powers met in conference, Metternich found an opportunity for cementing his influence over Alexander, which had been wanting amid the turmoil and feminine intrigues of Vienna and Aix. Here, in confidence begotten of friendly chats over afternoon tea, the disillusioned autocrat confessed his mistake. &quot;You have nothing to regret,&quot; he said sadly to the exultant chancellor, &quot;but I have!&quot;

The issue was momentous. In January Alexander had still upheld the ideal of a free confederation of the European states, symbolized by the Holy Alliance, against the policy of a dictatorship of the great powers, symbolized by the Quadruple Treaty; he had still protested against the claims of collective Europe to interfere in the internal concerns of the sovereign states.  On [[19 November]] he signed the [[Troppau Protocol]], which consecrated the principle of intervention and wrecked the harmony of the concert.

==The revolt of the Greeks==
At [[Congress of Laibach]], whither in the [[Spring (season)|Spring]] of [[1821]] the congress had been adjourned, Alexander first heard of the [[Greek War of Independence | Revolt of the Greeks]].  From this time until his death his mind was torn between his anxiety to realize his dream of a confederation of Europe and his traditional mission as leader of the Orthodox crusade against the [[Ottoman Empire]].  At first, under the careful nursing of Metternich, the former motive prevailed.

He struck the name of [[Alexander Ypsilanti (1792-1828)|Alexander Ypsilanti]] from the Russian army list, and directed his foreign minister, [[John Capodistria | Giovanni, Count Capo d'Istria]], himself a Greek, to disavow all sympathy of [[Russia]] with his enterprise; and, next year, a deputation of the [[Morea]] Greeks on its way to the [[Congress of Verona]] was turned back by his orders on the road.

He made, indeed, some effort to reconcile the principles at conflict in his mind.  He offered to surrender the claim, successfully asserted when the [[Ottoman Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]] had been excluded from the Holy Alliance and the affairs of the [[Ottoman empire]] from the deliberations of Vienna, that the affairs of the East were the &quot;domestic concerns of Russia,&quot; and to march into the [[Ottoman Empire]], as Austria had marched into [[Naples]], &quot;as the mandatory of Europe.&quot;

Metternich's opposition to this, illogical, but natural from the Austrian point of view, first opened his eyes to the true character of Austria's attitude towards his ideals.  Once more in Russia, far from the fascination of Metternich's personality, the immemorial spirit of his people drew him back into itself; and when, in the Autumn of [[1825]], he took his dying Empress [[Louise of Baden]] ([[January 24]], [[1779]]&amp;ndash;[[May 26]], [[1826]]) for change of air to the south of Russia, in order&amp;mdash;as all Europe supposed&amp;mdash;to place himself at the head of the great army concentrated near the Ottoman frontiers, his language was no longer that of &quot;the peace-maker of Europe,&quot; but of the Orthodox Tsar determined to take the interests of his people and of his religion &quot;into his own hands&quot;. Before the momentous issue could be decided, however, Alexander died in [[Taganrog]] on [[1 December]] ([[November 18]], [[Julian calendar | O.S.]]) [[1825]], &quot;crushed&quot;, to use his own words, &quot;beneath the terrible burden of a crown&quot; which he had more than once declared his intention of resigning.  A report, current at the time and often revived, affirmed that he did not in fact die.  By some it is supposed that a mysterious hermit named Fomich, who lived at Tomsk until [[1870]] and was treated with peculiar deference by successive Tsars [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] and [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], was none other than Alexander.

==A tragic figure==
Modern history knows no more tragic figure than that of Alexander.  The brilliant promise of his early years; the haunting memory of the [[crime]] by which he had obtained the power to realize his ideals; and, in the end, the terrible legacy he left to Russia: a principle of government which, under lofty pretensions, veiled a tyranny supported by [[spies]] and [[secret police]]; an uncertain succession; an army permeated by organized disaffection; an armed Poland, whose hunger for liberty the tsar had whetted but not satisfied; the quarrel with the [[Ottoman Empire]], with its alternative of war or humiliation for Russia; an educational system rotten with official hypocrisy; a Church in which conduct counted for nothing, [[Orthodoxy]] and ceremonial observance for everything; economical and financial conditions scarce recovering from the verge of ruin; and lastly, that curse of Russia&amp;mdash;[[serfdom]].

==Private life==
In private life Alexander displayed many lovable qualities.  All authorities combine in praising his handsome presence and the affability and charm of his address, together with a certain simplicity of personal tastes, which led him in his intercourse with his friends or with the representatives of friendly powers to dispense with ceremony and etiquette.  His personal friendship, too, once bestowed, was never lightly withdrawn.  By nature he was sociable and pleasure-loving, he proved himself a notable patron of the arts and he took a conspicuous part in all the gaieties of the [[congress of Vienna]].  In his later years, however, he fell into a mood of settled melancholy; and, though still accessible to all who chose to approach him with complaints or petitions, he withdrew from all but the most essential social functions, and lived a life of strenuous work and of Spartan simplicity.  His gloom had been increased by domestic misfortune.  He had been married, on [[October 9]], [[1793]], without his wishes being consulted, to the beautiful and amiable princess [[Louise of Baden]] (Elisabeth Alexeyevna), a political match which, as he regretfully confessed to his friend [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]], had proved the misfortune of both; and he consoled himself in the traditional manner.  The two children of the marriage, a little grand-duchess Elizaveta, died on [[12 May]] [[1808]] and the other little grand-duchess Maria, that died six years earlier on [[26 June]] (or [[8 July]]) [[1800]]; and their common sorrow drew husband and wife closer together. Towards the close of his life their reconciliation was completed by the wise charity of the Empress in sympathizing deeply with him over the death of his beloved daughter by [[Princess Maria Naryshkina]].

==Death==
Tsar Alexander I, the man of mystery, became increasingly involved in [[mysticism]] and increasingly more suspicious of those around him. On the way to the conference in [[Aachen]], [[Germany]], an attempt had been made to kidnap him. Now he would trust no one. At home, his young daughter, an only child, died, and his wife became ill.

In [[1825]], the &quot;Tsar of All the Russians&quot; died in the city of [[Taganrog]]. After an official announcement of the Tsar's death, a British ambassador at the Russian court said he had seen Alexander boarding a ship. It was later rumored that a [[monk]] in [[Siberia]], Feodor Kuzmich, was really the former ruler. Whatever the truth, when the [[Soviet]] Government opened Alexander's grave many, many years later, it was empty.

Within weeks of Alexander's death, there was an unsuccessful attempt by liberal-minded military officers to seize power from the crown, now known as the [[Decembrist Revolt]].  The Decembrists were caught off guard by confusion regarding the order of succession.  Historians believe that the secret societies to wrest power from the crown appeared after the Russian officers' return from their [[Napoleonic wars|Napoleonic campaigns]] in [[Europe]] in 1815.

==Offspring==
He had other illegitimate children, nine all together. His other mistresses were [[Sophia Vsevolojsky]], [[Maria Ivanovna Katatcharova]], [[Veronica Dzierzanowska]], [[Marguerite-Josephine Weimer]], and Princess [[Barbara Tourkestanova]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AlexanderIIRussia.jpeg|frame|right|Alexander II (1818-1881)]] 

'''Alexander (Aleksandr) II Nikolaevitch ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Александр II Николаевич)''' ([[April 17]] [[1818]], [[Moscow]]&amp;ndash;[[March 13]] [[1881]]) was the Emperor ([[Czar]]) of [[Russia]] from [[March 2]] [[1855]] until his [[assassination]]. He was also the [[Grand Duke of Finland]].

Born in 1818 and assassinated in 1881, he was the eldest son of Czar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] and [[Charlotte of Prussia]], daughter of [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] and [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]]. His early life gave little indication of his ultimate potential, and up to the time of his accession in [[1855]], few imagined that he would be known to posterity as a great reformer.

==Early life==
Insofar as he may have had political convictions in his youth, Alexander seemed to possess the reactionary spirit predominant in Europe at the time of his birth, a trend which continued in [[Russia]] through to the end of his father's reign. In the period of thirty years during which he was [[heir apparent]], the atmosphere of [[Saint Petersburg, Russia|St. Petersburg]] was unfavourable to the development of any intellectual or political innovation. Government was based on principles under which all freedom of thought and all private initiative were, as far as possible, suppressed vigorously. Personal and official [[censorship]] was rife; criticism of the authorities was regarded as a serious offence.

Under supervision of the liberal poet [[Vasily Zhukovsky]], Alexander received the education commonly given to young Russians of good family at that time: a smattering of a great many subjects, and a good practical acquaintance with the chief modern [[Europe|European]] [[European languages|languages]]. He took little personal interest in military affairs. To the disappointment of his father, who was passionate about the [[military]], he showed no love of soldiering. Alexander gave evidence of a kind disposition and a tender-heartedness which were considered out of place in one destined to become a military [[autocrat]].

==Marriages and Children==
[[Image:Cartetsar.JPG|thumb|right|Tsar Alexander II, his wife Marie and son, the future Alexander III]]
On [[April 16]] [[1841]] he married [[Marie of Hesse and by Rhine|Princess Marie of Hesse]] in St. Petersburg, the daughter of [[Ludwig II, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine]], thereafter known as [[Empress Maria Alexandrovna of Russia|Maria Alexandrovna]]. The marriage produced six sons and two daughters:
* [[Alexandra Alexandrovna]] (1842-1849).
* [[Nicholas Alexandrovich]] (1843-1865). He was engaged to princess Dagmar of Denmark, who later married his brother Alexander III under the name [[Maria Fyodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Maria Fyodorovna]].
* [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander Alexandrovich]], the future emperor
* [[Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia|Maria Alexandrovna]] (1853-1920). Married [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]].
* [[Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia]] (1847-1909). Married Princess Marie of [[Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] and had issue: three sons (Grand Dukes Kirill, Boris and Andrey Vladimirovich) and a daughter (Grand Duchess Elena, who married Prince Nicholas of Greece).
* [[Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia|Alexei Alexandrovich]] (1850-1908). Married Alexandra Zhukovsky and had a son (executed by the Communist regime in 1932).
* [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia|Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia]] (1857-1905). Assassinated. Married [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna|Elisabeth]] of [[Hesse-Darmstadt]], who was murdered by the Bolsheviks in Alapaevsk in 1918. They had no children.
* [[Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia|Paul Alexandrovich of Russia]] (1860-1919). Married first [[Alexandra Yurievna of Greece|Alexandra of Greece]] (daughter of [[George I of Greece]]) and second Olga Karnovich von Pistolkors, [[Princess Paley]], and had issue by both. Both Grand Duke Paul and his son Prince [[Vladimir Paley]] (1897-1918), a remarkable poet, were killed by the Bolsheviks.

On [[July 6]] [[1880]], less than a month after Tsarina Maria's death on [[June 8]], Alexander formed a [[morganatic marriage]] with his mistress Princess [[Catherine Dolgoruki]], with whom he already had three children. A fourth child would be born to them before his death.

* George Alexandrovich Romanov Yurievsky (1872-1913). Married Countess Alexandra Zarnekau and had issue. They later divorced.
* Olga Alexandrovna Romanov Yurievsky (1873-1925). Married Count George von [[Merenberg]].
* Boris Alexandrovich Yurievsky (1876-1876).
* Catherine Alexandrovna Romanov Yurievsky (1878-1959). Married first Prince Alexander V. Bariatinsky and second Prince Serge Obolensky, whom she later divorced.

==Emperor== 
[[Image:AlexanderII_of_Russia(monument).jpg|thumb|200px|New monument to Alexander II in front of the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in Moscow.]]
Alexander succeeded to the throne upon the death of his father in 1855. The first year of his reign was devoted to the prosecution of the [[Crimean War]], and after the fall of [[Sevastopol]] to negotiations for peace, led by his trusted counselor, [[Alexander Gorchakov|Prince Gorchakov]]. Then he began a period of radical reforms, encouraged by public opinion but carried out with autocratic power. All who had any pretensions to enlightenment declared loudly that the country had been exhausted and humiliated by the war, and that the only way of restoring it to its proper position in Europe was to develop its natural resources and thoroughly to reform all branches of the administration. The government therefore found in the educated classes a new-born public spirit, anxious to assist it in any work of reform that it might think fit to undertake.

Fortunately for Russia the autocratic power was now in the hands of a man who was impressionable enough to be deeply influenced by the spirit of the time, and who had sufficient prudence and practicality to prevent his being carried away by the prevailing excitement into the dangerous region of [[Utopia|utopian]] dreaming. Unlike some of his predecessors, he had no grand, original schemes of his own to impose by force on unwilling subjects, and no pet projects to lead his judgment astray. He looked instinctively with a suspicious, critical eye upon the panaceas which more imaginative and less cautious people recommended. These character traits, together with the peculiar circumstances in which he was placed, determined the part which he was to, in great measure, brought to fruition the reform aspirations of the educated classes.

However, the growth of a revolutionary movement to the &quot;left&quot; of the educated classes led to an abrupt end to Alexander's changes when he was assassinated by a bomb in 1881. It is interesting to note that after Alexander became czar in 1855, he maintained a generally liberal course at the helm while providing a target for numerous assassination attempts (1866,1873,1880).

==Emancipation of the serfs==
:''Main article: [[Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia]].''

Though he carefully guarded his autocratic rights and privileges, and obstinately resisted all efforts to push him farther than he felt inclined to go, Alexander for several years acted somewhat like a constitutional sovereign of the continental type. Soon after the conclnched from Iran. The Alaska interceptors may be later augmented by the naval [[Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System]], by ground-based missiles in other locations, or by the [[Boeing YAL-1| Boeing Airborne Laser]]. President Bush has referenced the [[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks]] and the proliferation of ballistic missiles as reasons for missile defense.

&lt;!-- (Seems POV and a broad generalization, and I can't find a source for it. Please cite source and uncomment) Often overlooked in the ABM debate in the United States is the resistance of many Pentagon leaders to the construction of a National Missile Defense.  Admirals and generals of all services oppose spending huge sums (currently $8bn/yr in 2003) to research, develop, and procure NMD systems.  They would prefer to have that money spent on new conventional weapons, training, equipment, or pay. By conventional [[procurement]] methodologies ([[cost-benefit analysis]] and [[cost-utility analysis]]) missile defense would be regarded as a 'bad buy' owing to its very high costs, high level of project risk (it is essentially a research project, not acquisition of proven technologies) and the benefits are disputed. In order to prevent its cancellation by the Pentagon, successive administrations have placed missile defense outside of direct Pentagon control in a separate organisation.--&gt;

===International ABM efforts===
[[Image:Arrow missle.jpg|thumb|right|An Arrow anti-ballistic missile interceptor]]
In 1993, a symposium was held by western European nations to explore potential future ballistic missile defense programs. In the end, the council recommended deployment of early warning and surveillance systems as well as regionally controlled defense systems. [http://www.fas.org/spp/starwars/program/europe/weu_93/weu1363tasc.htm] In 1998 the [[Israel]]i military conducted a successful test of their [[Arrow missile|Arrow ABM]], developed in Israel with American assistance. Designed to intercept incoming missiles traveling at up to 2 mile/s (3 km/s), the Arrow is expected to perform much better than the Patriot did in the Gulf War. [[Taiwan]] is also engaged in the development of an anti-ballistic missile system, based on its indigenously developed Tien Kung-II (Sky Bow) SAM system. Although reports suggest a promising system, the ROC government continues to show strong interest towards the American [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense]] (THAAD) program.

===Bosnia===
The secession of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] from the multicultural [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian Federation]] and the subsequent declaration of Bosnia-Herzegovinan independence in October 1991 opened up a new ethnic and quasi-religious conflict at the heart of Europe. 	 

[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was ethnically diverse, with a nominal Muslim majority but with significant numbers of ethnic ([[Orthodox Christian]]) [[Serbs]] and ([[Roman Catholic]]) [[Croats]] distributed across its territory. It comprised a large, but militarily weak component of the former Yugoslavia and Yugoslavian disintegration saw some ethnic Serbs and some ethnic Croats within Bosnia, supported by their rump adjacent states (Serbia and Croatia), engage in a three way conflict against the [[Bosniaks]] dominated core. 	 

Radical Arab veterans of the war against the Soviets in [[Afghanistan]] seized on Bosnia as a new opportunity to &quot;defend Islam&quot;. Besieged on two fronts and seemingly abandoned by the West, the Bosnian regime was willing to accept any help it could get, military or financial, including that of a number of Islamic organisations, of which al-Qaeda was one&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Kohlmann, Evan F. | title = Al-Qaida's Jihad in Europe: The Afghan-Bosnian Network | publisher = Berg | year = 2004 | id = ISBN 1859738079}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Several close associates of Osama bin Laden (most notably, Saudi [[Khalid bin Udah bin Muhammad al-Harbi]], alias Abu Sulaiman al-Makki) joined the conflict in Bosnia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Kohlmann, Evan F. | title = Al-Qaida's Jihad in Europe: The Afghan-Bosnian Network  | publisher=Berg | year=2004 | id=ISBN 1859738079}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but while al-Qaeda might initially have seen Bosnia as a possible bridgehead enabling the radicalisation of European Muslims for operations against other European states and America, [[Bosniaks]] had been secularised for generations and their interest in fighting was largely limited to securing the survival of their nascent state. 	 

The &quot;Bosnian Mujahidin&quot; (comprising largely Arab veterans of the Afghan war and not ''necessarily'' members of al-Qaeda) thus operated as a largely autonomous force within central Bosnia. While their bravery in the fray initially attracted a small number of native Bosnians to join them, their brutality and a rising number of atrocites committed against civilians came to appall many native Bosnians and repelled new recruits. At the same time, their vigorous attempts to Islamicize the local population with rules on appropriate dress and behaviour were widely resented and largely went unheeded. In his book ''Al-Qaida’s Jihad in Europe: the Afghan-Bosnian network'', Evan Kohlmann sums up: ‘In spite of vigorous efforts to ‘Islamicise’ the nominally Muslim Bosnian populace, the locals could not be convinced to abandon pork, alcohol, or public displays of affection. Bosnian women persistently refused to wear the [[hijab]] or follow the other mandates for female behaviour prescribed by extreme fundamentalist Islam.’ 	 

The signing of the [[Washington Agreement]] in March 1994 brought to an end the Bosnian-Croatian conflict. While the &quot;Bosnian Mujahidin&quot; remained to fight on in the war against the Serbs, the [[Dayton Peace Accord]] of November 1995 brought that conflict to an end and required that foreign fighters disband and leave the country, with aid being conditional on this taking place. With Bosnian government support, [[NATO]] forces took effective action to close their bases and deport them. A limited number of former Mujahidin who had either married native Bosnians or who could not be found a country to go to were permitted to stay in Bosnia and granted Bosnian citizenship, but with the war in Bosnia over, many committed battle-hardened veterans had already returned to familiar territory.

===Return to Afghanistan===
After the Soviet withdrawal, Afghanistan was effectively ungoverned for seven years and plagued by constant infighting between the former allies, the various Mujahidin groups and their leaders. 

Throughout the 1990s a new force began to emerge. The origins of the [[Taliban]] (literally &quot;students&quot;) lay in children of Afghanis, many of them orphaned by the war, and many of whom had had been educated in the rapidly expanding network of Islamic schools (madrassas) either in Kandahar or in the refugee camps on the Afghan-Pakistani border.

According to Ahmad Rashid's well-regarded book ''Taliban'', five leaders of the Taliban were graduates of a single madrassa, Darul Uloom Haqqania, Akora Khattak, near Peshawar which is situated in Pakistan but which was largely attended by Afghan refugees. This institution reflected Salafi beliefs in its teachings and much of its funding came from private donations from wealthy Arabs for which bin Laden provided conduit. A further four more leading figures (including the perceived Taliban leader Mullah [[Mohammed Omar]] Mujahed) attended a similarly funded and influenced madrassa in Kandahar, Afghanistan. 

The ties between the Afghan Arabs and Taliban ran deep. Many of the mujahidin who later joined the Taliban fought alongside Afghan warlord Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi's Harkat i Inqilabi grouping at the time of the Russian invasion. This grouping had also enjoyed the loyalty of most Afghan Arab fighters.

The continuing internecine strife between various factions and accompanying lawlessness following the Soviet withdrawal enabled the growing and well-disciplined [[Taliban]] to expand their control over territory in Afghanistan and they came to establish an enclave which it called the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]]. In 1994, they captured the regional centre of Kandahar and making rapid territorial gains thereafter, went on to conquer the capital, Kabul, in September 1996.

After Sudan made it clear bin Laden and his group were no longer welcome in that year, Taliban-controlled Afghanistan -- with previously established connections between the groups, a similar outlook on world affairs and largely isolated from American political influence and military power -- provided a perfect location for al Qaeda to headquarter.

Some 200 bin Laden supporters and their families departed Khartoum for Jalalabad by air in 1996. Thereafter al-Qaeda enjoyed the Taliban's protection and a measure of legitimacy as part of their Ministry of Defense, although only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the [[United Arab Emirates]] recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. 

Al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan and the Pakistan border regions are alleged to have trained militant Muslims from around the world. Despite the perception of some people, al-Qaeda members are ethnically diverse and are connected by their radical version of Islam.

An ever-expanding network of supporters thus enjoyed a safe haven in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan until the Taliban were defeated by a combination of local forces and US troops in 2001. Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders are still believed to be located in areas where the population is sympathetic to the Taliban in Afghanistan or the border Tribal Areas of Pakistan.

===Start of militant operations against civilians===
On [[February 23]], [[1998]], Osama bin Laden and [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] of [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] issued a [[fatwa]] under the banner of the '''World Islamic Front for Jihad Against the Jews and Crusaders''' saying that &quot;to kill Americans and their allies, civilians, and military is an individual duty of every Muslim who is able.&quot; Although neither man possessed the Islamic credentials, education or stature to issue a fatwa of any kind, this seems to have been overlooked in the enthusiasm of the moment. This was also the year of the first major attack reliably attributed to al-Qaeda, the [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings|embassy bombings]] in [[East Africa]], which resulted in upward of 300 deaths. In 1999, Egyptian Islamic Jihad officially merged with al-Qaeda, and al-Zawahiri became bin Laden's closest confidant.

===September 11 attacks===
[[Image:WTC attack 9-11.jpg|thumb|left|United Airlines Flight 175 crashing into the South World Trade Center Tower]]
Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] attributed by authorities to al-Qaeda, the United States began to build up military forces in preparation for an attack on Afghanistan (whose government harboured bin Laden's organization) in response. In the weeks before the United States invaded, the Taliban twice offered to turn over bin Laden to a neutral country for trial if the United States would provide evidence of bin Laden's complicity in the attacks. The Americans, however, refused, and soon thereafter [[U.S. invasion of Afghanistan|invaded Afghanistan]] and, together with the [[Afghan Northern Alliance]], deposed the [[Taliban]] government. 

As a result of this invasion, Taliban training camps were destroyed and much of the alleged existing operating structure of al-Qaeda was disrupted, although strong resistance has remained in Afghanistan, and its main leaders, including Bin Laden, have not been caught. The American government now claims that two-thirds of the top leaders of al-Qaeda in 2001 are currently in custody (including [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]], [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], [[Abu Zubaydah]], [[Saif al Islam el Masry]], and [[Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri]]) or dead (including [[Mohammed Atef]]), though it warns the organization is not yet defeated and battles between the United States forces, the Taliban and al-Qaeda continue.

===Activity in Iraq===
[[Image:Zarqawi001.jpg|frame|right| Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi]]

{{See also|Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda}}
Osama bin Laden first took interest in [[Iraq]] when that country invaded [[Kuwait]] in 1990 (giving rise to concerns that the secular, [[socialist]] [[Baathist]] government of Iraq might next set its sights on [[Saudi Arabia]], homeland of bin Laden and of Islam itself). In a letter sent to [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]], he offered to send an army of mujahideen to defend Saudi Arabia &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Who is Osama Bin Laden? | work=BBC.com | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1551100.stm | accessdate=July 20 | accessyear=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

During the [[Gulf War]], the organization's interests became split between outrage with the intervention of the United Nations in the region and hatred of [[Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein's]] [[secular]] government, as well as expression of concern for the suffering that Islamic people in Iraq were undergoing. 

Bin Laden referred to Saddam Hussein (and the Baathists) as evil, a demon or devil worshipper in his speeches and recorded/written announcements, calling for his overthrow by the people of Iraq. In spite of the distrust Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein had for each other, published reports documented a number of alleged contacts between their organizations.  Official investigations by the [[NSA]], [[CIA]], [[DIA]], [[FBI]], the [[US Department of State|State Department]], the [[9/11 Commission]], and the [[Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] -- have led most analysts to conclude that there is no evidence of a cooperative relationship between them.  (See [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda]]).

During the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], al-Qaeda took more formal interest in the region and is known to have been responsible for actively organizing and aiding local resistance to the occupying coalition forces and the emerging democracy. During Iraq's elections in January 2005 al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for nine suicide blasts in the Iraqi capital [[Baghdad]].

[[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], founder of [[Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad]] and alleged ally of al-Qaeda, formally merged with al-Qaeda on [[17th October]] [[2004]]. The organization started to use the banners of &quot;[[Al-Qaeda in Iraq|al-Qaeda in the Land Between the Two Rivers]]&quot;, instead of old [[Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad]] banners. In the merger al-Zarqawi declared loyalty to [[Osama bin Laden]].

===Harmony Papers===
Documents seized from al-Qaeda were recently declassified from the Harmony database and became the subject of a published study from West Point titled ''Harmony and Disharmony: Exploiting al-Qa’ida’s Organizational Vulnerabilities.'' [http://www.ctc.usma.edu/aq/Harmony%20and%20Disharmony%20--%20CTC.pdf] The papers give an interesting look into the history of the movement, organizational structure, tensions among leadership and the lessons learned. 

One al-Qaeda writer concluded that one of the lessons learned is the influence of secular Baathist thinking distorts the message of jihad.  This writer advises the movement not to allow the jihad message to be influenced by the Iraqi Baath message. (Page 79) [http://www.ctc.usma.edu/aq/Harmony%20and%20Disharmony%20--%20CTC.pdf]

==Incidents attributed by some to al-Qaeda==
''Note: al-Qaeda does not take credit for most of the following actions, resulting in ambiguity over how many attacks the group has actually conducted.  Following the U.S. declaration of the [[War on Terrorism]] in 2001, the U.S. government has striven to highlight any connections between other terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.  Some prefer to attribute to [[al-Qaedaism]] actions that might not be directly planned by al-Qaeda as a military headquarter, but which are inspired by its tenets and strategies.'' 

[[Image:TerroristAttacksAlQaeda.png|thumb|right|500px|World Map of attacks attributed to al-Qaeda]]

The first militant attack that al-Qaeda allegedly carried out consisted of three bombings at hotels where American troops were staying in [[Aden]], [[Yemen]], on [[December 29]], 1992. A Yemeni and an [[Austria]]n tourist died in one bombing.

There are disputed claims that al-Qaeda operatives assisted in the shooting down of U.S. [[helicopter]]s and the killing of U.S. servicemen in [[Somalia]] in 1993. (see: [[Battle of Mogadishu]])

[[Ramzi Yousef]], who was involved in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing (though probably not an al-Qaeda member at the time), and [[Khalid Sheik Mohammed]] planned [[Operation Bojinka]], a plot to destroy airplanes in mid-Pacific flight using explosives. An apartment fire in [[Manila, Philippines]] exposed the plan before it could be carried out. Youssef was arrested, but Mohammed evaded capture until 2003.

Al-Qaeda is often listed as a suspect in two bombings in [[Saudi Arabia]] in 1995 and 1996: the bombing at a U.S. military facility in [[Riyadh]] in [[November]] [[1995]], which killed two people from [[India]] and five Americans, and the June 1996 [[Khobar Towers bombing]], which killed American military personnel in [[Dhahran, Saudi Arabia|Dhahran]]. However, these attacks are usually ascribed to [[Hizbullah]].

Al-Qaeda is believed to have conducted the [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings|bombings]] in August 1998 of the U.S. embassies in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], and [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Tanzania]], killing more than 200 people and injuring more than 5,000 others.

In [[December]] [[1999]] and into 2000, al-Qaeda [[2000 millennium attack plots|planned attacks]] against U.S. and [[Israel]]i tourists visiting [[Jordan]] for millennial celebrations; however, [[Jordan]]ian authorities thwarted the planned attacks and put 28 suspects on trial. Part of this plot included the planned bombing of the [[Los Angeles International Airport]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], but this plot was foiled when bomber [[Ahmed Ressam]] was caught at the US-[[Canada|Canadian]] border with explosives in the trunk of his car. Al-Qaeda also planned to attack the [[USS The Sullivans (DDG-68)|USS ''The Sullivans'']] on [[January 3]], [[2000]], but the effort failed due to too much weight being put on the small boat meant to bomb the ship.

Despite the setback with the USS ''The Sullivans'', al-Qaeda succeeded in bombing a U.S. warship in October 2000 with the [[USS Cole bombing]]. [[Germany|German]] police foiled a plot to destroy a [[Notre-Dame de Strasbourg|cathedral]] in [[Strasbourg]], [[France]] in [[December]] [[2000]]. See: [[Strasbourg cathedral bombing plot]]

The most destructive act ascribed to al-Qaeda was the series of attacks in the USA on [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11th, 2001]].

Several attacks and attempted attacks since [[September 11]], [[2001]] have been attributed to al-Qaeda. The first of which was the [[Paris embassy attack plot]], which was foiled.
The second of which involved the attempted shoe bomber [[Richard Reid (terrorist)|Richard Reid]], who proclaimed himself a follower of Osama bin Laden, and got close to destroying [[American Airlines]] [[American Airlines Flight 63|Flight 63]].

Other attacks ascribed to al-Qaeda and its affiliates:
*The [[Singapore embassies attack plot]].
*The [[kidnap]]ping and [[murder]] of [[Wall Street Journal]] reporter [[Daniel Pearl]], and numerous bombings in Pakistan.
*The [[El Ghriba synagogue|El Ghriba]] [[Ghriba Synagogue Attack|synagogue bombing]] in [[Djerba]], [[Tunisia]], which killed 21.
*Foiled attacks on Western warships in the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].
*The [[Limburg tanker bombing]].
*A [[November]] [[2002]] [[Kenyan hotel bombing|car bombing]] in [[Mombasa]], [[Kenya]], and an attempt to shoot down an Israeli airliner.
*[[Riyadh Compound Bombings|Bombings of Western compounds]] in Riyadh in May 2003 and other attacks of the [[Insurgency in Saudi Arabia|Saudi insurgency]].
*The [[Istanbul Bombings]] in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], in 2003.

Al-Qaeda has strong alliances with a number of other Islamic militant organizations including the Indonesian Islamic extremist group [[Jemaah Islamiyah]]. That group was responsible for the [[October]] [[2002]] [[Bali bombing]], and the [[2005 Bali bombings]].

Although there have been no identified al-Qaeda attacks within the territory of the United States since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], numerous al-Qaeda attacks in the Middle East, Far East, Africa and Europe have caused extensive casualties and turmoil.  In the aftermath of several [[March 11]], [[2004]] [[March 11, 2004 Madrid attacks|attacks on commuter trains in Madrid]], a [[London]] newspaper reported receiving an email from a group affiliated with al-Qaeda, claiming responsibility and a videotape claiming responsibility was also found. The timing of the attacks with the spanish elections, as well as the lack of proof on the real identity of the perpetrators has shed doubt on the al-Qaeda theory behind these attacks.

It is also believed that al-Qaeda was involved in the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], a series of attacks against mass transit in London which killed 56 people (see [[Mohammad Sidique Khan]]).A statement from a previously unknown group, &quot;The Secret Organization of al-Qaeda in Europe&quot;, claimed responsibility; however, the authenticity of the statement and the group's connection to al-Qaeda has not been independently verified.  The suspected perpetrators have not been definitively linked to al-Qaeda, although the contents of a video tape made by one of the bombers [[Mohammad Sidique Khan]] prior to his death and subsequently sent to [[Al Jazeera]] gives strong credence to an al-Qaeda connection.  An apparently unconnected group attempted to duplicate the attack later that month, but their bombs failed to detonate.

Al-Qaeda is suspected of being involved with the [[2005 Sharm el-Sheikh attacks]] in Egypt. On [[July 23]], [[2005]], a series of suspected car bombs killed about 90 people and wounded over 150. The attack was the deadliest terrorist action in the history of [[Egypt]].

Al-Qaeda is also suspected in the [[November 9]], [[2005]] [[Amman]], [[Jordan]] attacks in which [[2005 Amman bombings|three simultaneous bombings]] occured at [[United States|American]] owned hotels in Amman. The blast killed at least 57 people and injured 120 people. Most of the injured and killed were attending a wedding at the [[Radisson]] Hotel.

==The chain of command==
Though the current structure of al-Qaeda is unknown, information mostly acquired from the defector [[Jamal al-Fadl]] provided American authorities with a rough picture of how the group was organized. While the veracity of the information provided by al-Fadl and the motivation for his cooperation are both disputed, American authorities base much of their current knowledge of al-Qaeda on his testimony.

Bin Laden is the '''[[emir]]''' of al-Qaeda (although originally this role may have been filled by [[Abu Ayoub al-Iraqi]]), advised by a '''shura council''', which consists of senior al-Qaeda members, estimated by Western officials at about twenty to thirty people.

* The '''Military committee''' is responsible for training, weapons acquisition, and planning attacks.
* The '''Money/Business committee''' runs business operations. The travel office provides air tickets and false [[passport]]s. The payroll office pays al-Qaeda members, and the Management office oversees money-making businesses. In the US 911 Commission Report it is estimated that al-Qaeda requires 30,000,000 USD / year to conduct its operation.
* The '''Law committee''' reviews Islamic law and decides if particular courses of action conform to the law.
* The '''Islamic study/fatwah committee''' issues religious edicts, such as an edict in 1998 telling Muslims to kill Americans.
* In the late 1990s there was a publicly known '''Media committee''', which ran the now-defunct newspaper ''Nashrat al Akhbar (Newscast)'' and did [[public relations]]. It is currently assumed that media operations are now outsourced to internally redundant parts of the organization.

==Political revolt or structured terrorist organization: unknown==
Some organizational specialists have said that Al Qaeda's network structure, as opposed to a [[Hierarchical organization|hierarchical structure]] is its primary strength. The decentralized structure enables Al Qaeda to have a worldwide distributed base while retaining a relatively small core. While an estimated 100,000 Islamist militants are said to have received instruction in Al Qaeda camps since its inception, the group is believed to retain only a small number of militants under direct orders. Estimates seldom peg its manpower higher than 20,000 world wide. 

For its most complex operations (such as the 9/11 attacks on the US) all participants, planning and funding are believed to have been directly provided by the core Al Qaeda organisation. But in many attacks around the world where there appears to be an Al Qaeda connection, its precise role has been less easy to define. Rather than handling these operations from conception to delivery, Al Qaeda often appears to act as an international financial and logistical support-network, channelling income obtained from a network of fundraising activities to provide training capital and coordination for local radical groups. In many cases it is these local groups, only loosely affiliated to core Al Qaeda, which actually undertake the attacks. 

The [[2002 Bali bombing]] and subsequent bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta in 2003 provide some insight into Al Qaeda's decentralized method of operations: the attacks showed far greater coordination and effectiveness than might historically have been expected from regional terrorist networks. But police investigations and subsequent trials showed that while Al Qaeda was believed to have provided expertise and coordination, much of the planning and all the personnel who undertook the attacks came from local radical Islamist groups. 

Al Qaeda has been known to establish and foster new groups to further the radical Islamic interest in local conflicts. Indeed the Taliban might be deemed to fall into this category, the ro the aircraft.
*[[1986]]: 22 people are killed when Pakistani security forces storm [[Pan Am Flight 73]] at [[Karachi]], carrying 400 passengers and crew after a 16-hour siege.

None of the passengers and crew were hurt.

This is only the third incident in which there were survivors of a passenger jet that intentionally ditched into water. 
*[[1997]]: [[Air Malta]] Two men who hijacked an Air Malta airplane en route from Malta to Turkey on June 9, 1997 surrendered to police at Cologne's airport early on the same day and freed without incident about 80 crew members and passengers on board.

*[[1999]]-[[2000]]: [[Kashmir]]i militants hijack [[Indian Airlines Flight 814]] and divert it to [[Kandahar]]. After a week-long stand-off India agrees to release three jailed Kashmiri militants in exchange for the hostages. 1 hostage was stabbed to death and his body thrown on the tarmac as a &quot;warning attack&quot;
*[[2001]]: [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]], eastern [[United States|USA]]: 19 terrorists hijack four planes ([[American Airlines]] [[American Airlines Flight 11|Flight 11]], [[American Airlines Flight 77]], [[United Airlines]] [[United Airlines Flight 93|Flight 93]], and [[United Airlines Flight 175]]; two of the planes, [[United Airlines Flight 175]] and [[American Airlines Flight 11|Flight 11]], are used as missiles and deliberately flown into each of New York City's Twin Towers, while [[American Airlines Flight 77]] is used in a similar fashion at the Pentagon, in [[Washington, D.C.]].  They are the three most deadly of all aircraft hijackings.  In the fourth case the intention is likely the same but the passengers, learning of the fate of the other three planes, attacked the cockpit, causing the hijackers to crash the plane in rural Pennsylvania, killing all on board. By official count, 2,752 people died at the World Trade Center, 189 died in Washington, D.C., and 44 died in Pennsylvania.

==Prevention==

There has been talk of fortifying [[cockpit]] doors to prevent would-be hijackers from entering and gaining control of the aircraft. In the [[United States]] and [[Australia]], [[air Marshal (civil aviation)|air marshal]]s have also been added to some flights to deter and thwart hijackers. In addition, some have proposed remote control systems for aircraft whereby no one on board would have control over the plane's flight.

In the case of a serious risk that an aircraft will be used for flying into a target, it may have to be shot down, killing all passengers and crew, to prevent worse. 

United States commercial aircraft pilots now have an option of carrying a pistol on the flight deck, as a last resort to thwart hijack attempts. Opponents proposed that shooting down the aircraft and killing everyone onboard would be more reasonable than a pilot firing a pistol in an airliner at a flight deck intruder.  Explosive decompression in an aircraft, however, is a myth, and their objections are mostly hyperbole. [http://www.gadgetopia.com/post/2606]

Since &quot;Hi, Jack&quot; and &quot;hijack&quot; are [[homophones]] while aircraft are very vulnerable to any breaches to safety and security, this pronunciation is now widely regarded as a serious taboo in more airports. [[Los Angeles International Airport]] has reminded people not to say &quot;Hi, Jack&quot;, but &quot;Hello, Jack&quot; is no problem.

The '''Acropolis of Athens''' is the best known [[acropolis]] (high city) in [[Greece]]. Although there are many other acropoleis in Greece, the significance of the Acropolis of Athens such that it is commonly known as '''The Acropolis''' without qualification. The Acropolis is a flat-topped rock which rises 150 metres (512 feet) above sea level in the city of [[Athens, Greece|Athens]], [[Greece]]. It was also known as '''Cecropia''' in honor of the legendary [[snake|serpent]]-man, Kekrops or [[Cecrops]], the first Athenian king.

'''Coordinates:''' {{coor dms|37|58|17|N|23|43|36|E|}}

==Geology of the rock==

[[Image:ac.acropolis4.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The Acropolis of Athens, seen from the north, with the restored [[Stoa of Attalus]] in the foreground]]

The Acropolis rises sharply from the plain of [[Attica]] with steep cliffs on three sides. It is accessible by foot only to the west, where it is linked by a low ridge to the hill of the [[Areopagus]]. It is formed by a layer of blue-grey [[limestone]], which is very hard but water-permeable.  This rests on a layer of [[schist]]-[[sandstone]] [[marl]], softer than the limestone but water-impermeable.  This arrangement leads to the ready formation of artesian springs, as well as sheltered caves at the hill's feet, which was also a factor that attracted human habitation on and around the rock from early on.

==Early human presence==

[[Image:ac.acropolis2.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The south wall of the Acropolis of Athens, seen from the [[Theatre of Dionysus]].]]

The earliest artefacts from the area point to the Middle [[Neolithic]] era, although there have been documented habitations in Attica from the Early Neolithic ([[6000 BCE]]).  Once into the [[Bronze Age]], there is little doubt that a [[Mycenaean]] [[megaron]] must have stood on top of the hill, housing the local potentate and his household, guards, the local cult facilities and a number of workshops and ordinary habitations.  The compound was surrounded by a thick [[Cyclopean]] circuit wall (between 4.50 and 6onsisting of two [[parapet]]s built with large stone blocks and cemented with an earth mortar called ''emplekton''.  The wall follows typical Mycenaean convention in that its gate was arranged obliquely, with a parapet and tower overhanging the incomers' right-hand side, thus facilitating defense.  There were two lesser approaches up the hill on its north side, consisting of steep, narrow flights of steps cut in the rock.  [[Homer]] must refer to this state of affairs when he mentions the &quot;strong-built House of [[Erechtheus]]&quot; ([[Odyssey]] 7.81).  It was during that time that an earthquake caused a fissure near the northeastern edge, one that ran all the way down to the marl layer and in which water duly collected.  An elaborate set of stairs was built and the well was used as a protected source of drinking water during some portion of the Mycenaean period, as it was invaluable in times of siege.

==The Dark Ages==

[[Image:ac.acropolis2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Acropolis of Athens, seen from the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus]] to the south-east.]]

It seems that the Acropolis might have been spared of the violent destruction of other Mycenaean palaces, as there are no signs of fire or other large-scale destruction in what few artefacts of that time survive.  This ties with the standard Athenian folklore that the area resisted the Dorians successfully.  Not much is known as to the precise state of building on the rock leading up to the archaic era, except that the Acropolis was taken over by [[Cylon (ancient Athenian)|Kylon]] in the Kylonian revolt, and twice by [[Pisistratus]]: all attempts directed at seizing political power by ''[[coup]]s d' etat''.  Nevertheless it seems that a nine-gate wall, the ''Enneapylon'', had been built around the biggest water spring, the &quot;[[Clepsydra]]&quot;, at the northwestern foot.  It was [[Pisistratus]] who initially established a precinct for [[Artemis]] ''Brauronia'', the cult of his hometown, [[Brauron]], on the southwestern side of the rock, next to the circuit wall.

==Archaic Acropolis==

[[Image:Acropolis of Athens 31344.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Stairs leading up to the Propylea.]]

It is known with some certainty that a sizeable temple sacred to Athena Polias (Protectress of the City) was erected by mid-[[6th century BC]]. This Doric limestone building, from which many relics survive, is referred to as the &quot;Bluebeard&quot; temple, named after the pedimental three-bodied man-serpent sculpture, whose beards were painted dark blue.  Whether this temple replaced an older one, or a mere sacred precinct or altar, is not known.  In the late [[6th century BC]] yet another temple was built, usually referred to as the ''Archaios Naos'' (Old Temple). It is thought that the so-called ''Doerpfeld'' foundations might have belonged to this temple, which may have been sacred not to Polias but to Athena ''Parthenos'' (Virgin), at least for as long as the Polias &quot;Bluebeard&quot; temple stood.  It is not known how long these temples coexisted.  To confuse matters further, by the time the &quot;Bluebeard&quot; Temple had been dismantled, a yet newer and grander marble building, the &quot;Older Parthenon&quot;, was started following the victory at [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]] in 490 BCE. To accommodate it, the south part of the summit was cleared of older remnants, made level by adding some 8,000 two-ton blocks of [[Piraeus]] limestone, a foundation 11 meters deep at some points, and the rest filled with earth kept in place by the retaining wall.  The Mycenaean gate was demolished and replaced with the ''Old Propylon'', a monumental colonnaded structure whose purpose was strictly ceremonial, rather than defensive.  The Older Parthenon was caught unfinished by the invading Persians in [[480 BCE]], and was razed to the ground and burnt, along with the ''Archaios Neos'' and practically everything else on the rock.  Once the [[Persian Wars]] were over, the Athenians put the place in order, first ceremonially burying objects of worship and art that were rendered unsuitable for further use.  This &quot;[[Perserschutt|Persian debris]]&quot; is the richest archaeological treasure excavated on the Acropolis, as its burial had protected it from further destruction through the ages.

==The Periclean building program==

[[Image:Acropolis of Athens 01361.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The western side of the Parthenon.]]

Most of the major temples were rebuilt under the leadership of [[Pericles]] during the [[Golden Age]] of Athens (460–430 BC). [[Phidias]], a great Athenian sculptor, and [[Ictinus]] and [[Callicrates]], two famous architects, were responsible for the reconstruction. 

During the [[5th century BC]], the acropolis gained its final shape. After winning at [[Battle of the Eurymedon|Eurymedon]] in [[468 BC]], [[Cimon]] and [[Themistocles]] ordered the reconstruction of southern and northern walls, and [[Pericles]] entrusted the building of the [[Parthenon]] to Ictinus and [[Phidias]].  In [[437 BC]] [[Mnesicles]] started building the [[Propylaea]], monumental gates with columns of [[Penteli]] [[marble]], partly built upon the old propylaea of Pisistratus.  These colonnades were almost finished in the year [[432 BC]] and had two wings, the northern one serving as picture gallery.  At the same time, south of the propylaea, the building of the small Ionic temple of [[Athena Nike]] started.  After an interruption caused by the [[Peloponnesian War]], the temple was finished in the time of [[Nicias]]' peace, between [[421 BC]] and [[415 BC]].

At the same period they started the building of the [[Erechtheum]], a combination of sacred precincts including the temples of ''Athena Polias'', [[Poseidon]], Erechtheus, Cecrops, Erse, Pandrosos and Aglauros, with its so-called the ''Kore Porch'' (or ''[[Caryatid]]s' balcony''). Between the temple of Athena Nike and the Parthenon there was the [[temenos]] of [[Artemis]] Brauronia, the goddess represented as a bear and worshipped in the [[deme]] of Brauron.  The archaic ''[[xoanon]]'' of the [[goddess]] and a statue made by [[Praxiteles]] in the [[4th century BC]] were both in the sanctuary.  Behind the Propylaea, Phidias' gigantic bronze statue of ''[[Athena Promachos]]'' (&quot;she who fights in the front line&quot;), built between [[450 BC]] and [[448 BC]], dominated the ensemble.  The base was 1.50 meters high, while the total height of the statue was 9 meters.  The goddess held a lance whose gilt tip could be seen as a reflection by crews on ships rounding Cape [[Sounion]], and a giant shield on the left side, decorated by [[Mys]] with images of the fight between the [[Centaur]]s and the [[Lapiths]]. Other monuments that have left almost nothing visible to the present day are the [[Chalcotheke]], the [[Pandroseion]], [[Pandion's sanctuary]], Athena's altar, Zeus Polieus's sanctuary and, from Roman times on, the circular temple of [[Augustus]] and [[Rome]].

== Cultural significance ==

[[Image:Acropolis of Athens 01391.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The Erechtheum and Athena's olive tree.]]

Every four years the Athenians held a festival called the [[Panathenaea]] that rivalled the [[Olympic Games]] in popularity. During the festival, a procession moved through Athens up to the Acropolis and into the [[Parthenon]] (as depicted in the frieze on the inside of the Parthenon). There, a vast robe of woven wool (''[[peplos]]'') was ceremoniously placed on Phidias' massive ivory and gold statue of [[Athena]].

== Art and architecture ==
The entrance to the Acropolis was a monumental gateway called the [[Propylaea]]. At the near right of the Propylaea is the tiny [[Temple of Athena Nike]]. A bronze statue of Athena, sculpted by [[Phidias]], originally stood at its center. At the center of the acropolis is the [[Parthenon]] or Temple of Athena Parthenos (Athena the Virgin). To the left of the Propylaea is the [[Erechtheum]] with columns known as caryatids sculpted as figures of women . There is also the remains of an outdoor theater called [[Theatre of Dionysus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Adam Weishaupt''' ([[February 6]], [[1748]] - [[November 18]], [[1811]]) was a German who founded the Order of the [[Illuminati]].

He was born and raised in [[Ingolstadt]], where he attained the rank of Professor of Canon Law in [[1772]].  Though he was educated by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] and was clearly influenced by the discretion, loyalty and the hierarchic obedience of the Society of Jesus and was for a time a member of their order, his appointment as Professor of Natural and Canon Law at the University of Ingoldstadt in [[1775]] offended them.  He broke with them and became increasingly [[liberalism|liberal]] in his religious and political views, favoring [[deism]] and a kind of [[millennial]] natural order that swept aside [[state]]s and [[organized religion]].

With the help of [[Adolf Freiherr Knigge]], on [[May 1]], [[1776]] Weishaupt formed the &quot;Order of Perfectibilists&quot;, which was later known as the [[Illuminati]]. Some claim that this founding date is the origin for the date of the [[Communist]] [[May Day]] observance. He adopted the name of &quot;Brother [[Spartacus]]&quot; within the order. Though the Order was not [[egalitarian]] or [[Democracy|democratic]], its mission was to establish a New World Order, which meant the abolition of all governments and religions. 

Weishaupt wrote: '''the ends justified the means'''. The actual character of the society was determined by its [[traditionalist]] enemies to be an elaborate network of [[spies]] and counter-spies. Each isolated [[covert cell|cell]] of initiates reported to a superior, whom they did not know, a party structure that was effectively adopted by some later groups, including more recently by the early [[Ba'ath]] party in [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]].

Weishaupt was initiated into [[Freemasonry]] Lodge &quot;Theodor zum guten Rath&quot;, at [[Munich]] in [[1777]] by Baron Adolph von Knigge. His project of &quot;illumination, enlightening the understanding by the sun of reason, which will dispel the clouds of superstition and of prejudice&quot; was an unwelcome reform. Soon however he had developed [[gnostic]] mysteries of his own, with the goal of &quot;perfecting human&quot; nature through re-education to achieve a communal state with nature, freed of government and organized religion. He began working towards incorporating his system of [[Illuminism]] into that of Masonry, with the aim of creating a New World Order.  

He wrote: ''&quot;I did not bring Deism into [[Bavaria]],&quot; he wrote, &quot;more than into [[Rome]]. I found it here, in great vigour, more abounding than in any of the neighboring [[Protestant State]]s. I am proud to be known to the world as the founder of the Illuminati.&quot;''

Weishaupt's [[radical]] [[rationalism]], sweeping away nations and religions, [[private property]] and [[marriage]], with the vocabulary used by the [[French Revolution]], was not likely to succeed. Writings that were intercepted in [[1784]] were interpreted as [[seditious]], and the Society was banned by [[Bavaria]]'s government in [[1784]], Weishaupt lost his position at the [[University of Ingolstadt]] and fled Bavaria. He received the assistance of [[Duke Ernst II]] of [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]] (1745-1804), and lived in [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]] writing a series of works on Illuminism, including &lt;cite&gt;A Complete History of the Persecutions of the Illuminati in Bavaria&lt;/cite&gt; ([[1785]]), &lt;cite&gt;A Picture of Illuminism&lt;/cite&gt; ([[1786]]), &lt;cite&gt;An Apology for the Illuminati&lt;/cite&gt; ([[1786]]), and &lt;cite&gt;An Improved System of Illuminism&lt;/cite&gt; ([[1787]]). He died there in [[1811]], though his later career was so obscure that some sources place the year of his death at [[1830]].

A century after his death, [[Occult|occultist]] interest in Weishaupt and the Bavarian Illuminati picked up, through the writings of [[Aleister Crowley]]. Modern adepts trace the imagery of [[symbolism]] like the [[eye in the pyramid]], and embrace the secrecy of the Illuminati traditions...

==Quotes about Weishaupt==

:''A human devil.''

:--[[Augustin Barruél]]

:''An enthusiastic philanthropist.''

:--[[Thomas Jefferson]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mtj:@field(DOCID+@lit(tj090050)) ''Thomas Jefferson to Reverend James Madison, January 31, 1800,'' The Thomas Jefferson Papers (American Memory from the Library of Congress)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weishaupt in Fiction==

Adam Weishaupt is referred to repeatedly in the ''[[Illuminatus Trilogy]]'', by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]], as the founder of the [[Bavarian Illuminati]], and as an imposter who killed [[George Washington]] and took his place as the first president of the [[United States]]. Washington's portrait on the [[U.S. one-dollar bill|one-dollar bill]] is said to actually be Weishaupt's.

Another fictionalized version, Adam Weisshaupt, appears in ''[[Cerebus]]'', as a combination of Weishaupt and [[George Washington]].  He appears primarily in the '''Cerebus''' and '''Church and State I''' volumes.  His motives are [[Republic]]an confederalizing of city-states in Estarcion (a pseudo-Europe) and the accumulation of capital unencumbered by government or church.

Weishaupt is also mentioned among the mish-mash of complicated conspiricies in the PC game ''[[Deus Ex]]''. During JC Denton's escape from Versalife labs in Hong Kong, he recovers a virus engineered with the molecular structure of 1748. This is revealed to be an Illuminati signature, honoring Weishaupt (it is his birthdate) while at the same time furthering the secret society's objectives.

[[Image:Greek Hoplite.jpg|thumb|180px|A [[hoplite]] wearing (only) a [[helmet]], [[breastplate]] [[greave]]s and a [[shield]].]]

'''Armour''' ([[Commonwealth English]]) or '''armor''' ([[American English]]), is protective clothing intended to defend its wearer from intentional harm in [[combat]] and [[military]] engagements, typically associated with soldiers.  Armour has been used throughout [[recorded history]], beginning with [[hide]]s, [[leather]], and [[bone]], before progressing to [[bronze]], then [[steel]] during the [[middle ages]], to modern fabrics such as [[kevlar]], [[Dyneema]] and [[ceramic]]s. 

Armour was also commonly used to protect [[war animal]]s, such as [[war horse]]s and [[war elephant |elephants]]. Armour for war horses was called &quot;barding&quot;. Armour has also been produced for [[hunting dog]]s that hunt dangerous game, such as [[boar]]s. Since [[World War I]], [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s are protected by [[vehicle armour]].

'''Armour''', or ''[[the armoured]]'' is also a heavily armoured military force or organization, such as heavy [[infantry]] or heavy [[cavalry]] (as opposed to [[light infantry]] or cavalry).  In modern [[armoured warfare]], '''armoured units''' equipped with [[tank]]s serve the historic role of heavy cavalry, and belong to the '''armoured branch''' in a national [[army]]'s organization (sometimes, the ''armoured corps'').  Heavy infantry have been replaced by [[mechanized infantry]].

==History==
[[Image:SamuraiArmor.jpg|thumb|200px|Japanese [[Samurai]] [[Odoshi]] Armor.]] 

Throughout human history, the development of armor has always run parallel to the development of increasingly more efficient weaponry on the battlefield, creating an [[arms race]] of sorts across multiple [[civilization]]s to create better protection without sacrificing mobility.

In [[European history]], well-known armor types include the [[lorica segmentata]] of the [[Roman legions]], the [[chainmail]] [[hauberk]] of the early medieval age, and the full steel [[plate armor]] worn by later medieval [[knight]]s, and a few key parts, ( breast and back plates) by heavy cavalry in several European countries right up to the first year of World War 1. (1914-15).
In East Asian history, [[lamellar armour]] and [[brigandine]] was popular. In pre-Qin dynasty times, leather armor was made out of exotic animals such as rhinoceros. Chinese influence in Japan would result in the Japanese adopting Chinese styles, their famous 'samurai armor' being a result of this influence.

=== European Medieval Armour: Steel cap, or helmet with linked chain mail 950 A.D. to 1300 ===
The early middle ages saw the gradual adoption of coats of chain mail, that offered protection from arrows and edged  weapons. The mail was made of individually forged steel links, which formed a flexible protective coat for the warrior.
A steel helmet fit over the head, usually conforming to the shape of the upper head in a  rounded fashion. A nose guard was
frequently fitted to the helmet, It could best be described as a steel skull cap. Otherwise, the mail, which usually conformed to cover the neck, legs, arms and hands, offering overall  body protection. A medium sized shield was usually carried in the non-weapon bearing hand. This simple combination carried the European combatant through the 3 centuries that included, the [[Norman Conquest]] of England, and the several [[Crusades]] to the &quot;Holy Land&quot;.

=== Transitional period, the 1300s ===
Little by little, small additional plates or disks of steel were added to the mail to protect vulnerable areas. The knees
were capped with steel, and two circular disks were fitted to protect the underarms, by the late 1200s. The small skull 
cap evolved into a bigger true helmet, as it was lengthened downward to protect the back of the neck and the sides of the head. This evolutionary process proceeded to add steel plate elements to protect the shins, feet, throat and upper chest.
and soon (mid to late 1300s) most of the mail was covered by these protective plates. The next phase saw the plate cover
almost all parts of the mail, and several forms of closed-helmets were introduced in the late 1300s.

=== Plate armour, 1400 and later ===
{{main |plate armour}}
[[image:Joan d'Arc.jpg|thumb|200px|St.Joan mounted in armour {{3d_glasses}}]] 

Probably the most recognised style of armour in the world, associated with the [[knight]]s of  Late Medieval Europe,  but continuing later through the 1500 &amp; 1600s in all European countries. Heavy cavalry continued to use breast &amp; back plates into the early 20th century in elite cuirassier units.

=== Musket ball stopping armour ===
[[Image:Zbroja Batorego.jpg|200px|thumb|Armour of King [[Stefan Batory]] of [[Poland]], painted by [[Jan Matejko]].]]

Conventional wisdom says that plate armour faded away on the battlefild soon after firearms were introduced. This is very much not the case. Crude cannon were being used before plate armour became the norm. Soon, in the 1400s a small, mobile &quot;[[gonne|hand cannon]]&quot; was being used by horsemen. Improved cross bows, and the first pistols and pre-musket long arms, began to take a heavy toll on the mail clad, and partially plated knights and foot soldiers. Rather than dooming the use of body armour, the threat of small firearms intensified the use and further refinement of plate armour. There was a 150 year period, that more and better metallurgically advanced steel armour was being used, precisely because of the danger posed by the gun. 
In the early years of pistol and muskets, fire arms were relatively low velocity,the full suits of armor, or breast plates actually stopped bullets fired from a modest distance. The front breast plates were, in fact, commonly shot as a test. The impact point would be encircled with ingraving to point it out. This was called the &quot;proof&quot; . It was not uncommon for a man in armour, mounted on a horse, to ride up closer to the enemy, in a tactical maneuver called &quot;The wheel&quot;, and discharge his hand-cannon or later, pistols, right into the faces of the adversary at close range. Cross-bow arrows, if still used, would seldom penetrate good plate, nor would any bullet but one fired from close range. In effect, (and this has long been misunderstood), plate armour actually came to replace chain mail because it was relatively, &quot;musket ball proof&quot;. Plate would stop all of these at a distance. Hence, guns and cavalry in plate armour were &quot;threat and remedy&quot; together on the battlefield for almost 400 years. For most of that period, it allowed horsemen to fight while being the targets of defending musketeers without being easily killed. Full suits of armour were actually worn by generals and princely commanders right up to the second decade of the 1700s. It was the only  way they could be mounted &amp; survey the overall battlefield with safety from distant musket fire.
The armour shown here of the Polish King, Stefan Batory, is an early example of the &quot;field-marshall style&quot; battle armour.

=== Plate Armour &quot;Barding&quot; for Horses ===
It should be noted that the horse was afforded protection from gunfire, and lances by steel plate &quot;barding&quot;. This gave the horse  protection and added a certain &quot;heroic quality&quot; to the appearance. Fanciful &quot;unicorn spike horns&quot; were frequently added to the protective steel mask. Body areas were protected as well.

=== Characteristics of armour ===
Going back to the heyday of armour in the 1400s,most parts of the [[human body]] have been fitted with specialised steel pieces, typically worn over linen or woollen underclothes and attached to the body via leather straps and buckles, with mail (maille) protecting those areas that could not be fitted with plate (the backs of the knee for instance). Well-known constituent parts of plate-armour include the [[helmet|helm]], [[Gauntlet (gloves)|gauntlet]]s, [[gorget]] or 'neckguard', [[breastplate]], and [[greaves]] worn on the lower legs.

Typically, full-body plate armour was custom-made for the individual. This was understandably a very time-consuming and expensive undertaking, costing as much as a family house or high-powered car in today's money. As such, it was almost exclusively the luxury of the noble and landed classes, with soldiers of lower standing generally wearing cheaper armour (if at all) typically limited to a helm and a breastplate. Armour often bore an insignia in the interior, that was only visible to the wearer upon removal. Full plate armour made the wearer virtually impervious to sword blows as well as providing some protection against arrows, bludgeons and even early musket shot. Although sword edges could not penetrate the relatively thin (as little as 2 mm) plate, they ''could'' cause serious concussive damage via the impact. Also, although arrows shot from bows could often pierce early plate at close range, later improvements in the steel forging techniques and armour design made even this line of attack increasingly difficult. By its apex, toughened steel plate was almost impregnable on the battlefield.  Knights were instead increasingly felled by ''blunt'' weapons like [[mace]]s or [[warhammer]]s that could send concussive force ''through'' the plate armour resulting in injuries such as broken bones, organ [[haemorrhage]] and/or head trauma. Another tactic was to attempt to strike though the gaps between the armour pieces, using daggers to attack the Knight's eyes or joints.

[[image:etched armour.jpg|thumb|200px|etched plate armour 1560 {{3d_glasses}}]]

Contrary to common misconceptions, a well-made suit of medieval 'battle' armour (as opposed to the primarily ceremonial 'parade' and 'tournament' armours popular with kings and nobility of later years) hindered its wearer no more than the equipment carried by soldiers today. An armoured Knight (trained since his teens in its wearing) could comfortably run, crawl, climb ladders, as well as mount and dismount his horse without recourse to a crane (a myth originating from [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]''). A full suit of medieval plate is thought to have weighed little more than 60 lb (27 kg) on average, considerably ''lighter'' than the equipment often carried by the elite of today&amp;#8217;s armies (e.g., SAS patrols have been known to carry equipment weighing well over 200 lb (91 kg) for many miles).

===Plate Armour slowly discarded===
Gradually starting in the mid 1500s, one plate element after another was discarded to save weight for foot soldiers, but breast and back plates continued to be used though the entire period of the 1700s through Napoleonic times in many (heavy) european cavalry units, all the way to the early 20th Century. Rifled muskets from about 1750 and later, could pierce plate, so cavalry had to be far more mindful of the fire. At the start of World War 1 the French Cuirassiers, in the thousands, rode out to engage the German Cavalry who likewise used helmets and armour. By that period, the shiny armour plate was covered in dark paint and a canvas wrap covered their elaborate Napoleonic style helmets. Their armour was meant to protect only against sabres and light lances. The cavalry had to beware of high velocity rifles and machine guns like the foot soldiers, who at least had a trench to protect them. Machine gunners in that war also occasionally wore a crude type of heavy armour.

===Modern personal armour===
[[Image:Bodyarmor.jpg|thumb|200px|A modern ballistic vest.]]

Today, [[bullet proof vest]]s made of ballistic cloth (e.g [[Kevlar]] or [[Dyneema]]) and ceramic or metal plates are common among [[police force]]s, [[security guard|security staff]] and in some branches of the military. For [[infantry]] applications, lighter protection (historically known as a [[flak jacket]]) is often used to protect [[soldier]]s from [[grenade]] fragments and indirect effects of [[bombardment]], but usually not [[small arms]] fire. This is because [[assault rifle]]s usually fire harder, higher-energy [[armor piercing bullet|bullets]] than [[pistol]]s, and the increased protection needed to stop these would be too cumbersome and heavy to use in [[combat]].

The US Army has adopted Interceptor Ballistic Armor, however, which uses ceramic plates in the chest and back of the armor.  Each plate is rated to stop 3 hits from a 7.62 round at a range of 10m, though accounts in Iraq and Afghanistan tell of soldiers shot as much as seven times in the chest without penetration.

However, as the name implies, modern ballistic armor is much less impervious to close combat weapons such as knives, due to the fact that they were not made to withstand such weapons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''armoured fighting vehicle''' (AFV) is a military [[vehicle]], equipped with protection against hostile attacks and often mounted [[weapon]]s. Most AFVs are equipped for driving in rugged [[terrain]].

Armoured fighting vehicles are classified according to their intended role on the battlefield and characteristics. This classification is not absolute; at different times different countries will classify the same vehicle in different roles. For example, ''[[armoured personnel carrier]]s'' were generally replaced by ''[[infantry fighting vehicle]]s'' in a very similar role, but the latter has some capabilities lacking in the former.

Successful general-purpose armoured fighting vehicles often also serve as the base of a whole family of specialised vehicles, for example, the [[M113]] and [[MT-LB]] tracked carriers, and the [[Mowag Piranha]] wheeled AFV.

== Types of AFVs ==
* [[Tank]] (main battle tank, MBT)
* [[Armoured personnel carrier]] (APC) 
* [[Infantry fighting vehicle]] (IFV) 
* [[Self-propelled gun]]s:
** [[Self-propelled artillery]]
** [[Assault gun]]
** [[Tank Destroyer]]
* [[Self-propelled anti-aircraft]]
* [[Armoured car]]
* [[Tankette]]
* [[Armoured train]]
* [[Aerosan]]

Not AFVs, but often considered together with them:
* Support vehicles (not strictly ''fighting'' vehicles):
** [[Combat engineering vehicle]] (CEV) 
** [[Armoured recovery vehicle]] (ARV)
* Unarmoured fighting vehicles:
** ''[[Technical (fighting vehicle)|Technical]]'', a civilian truck mounting a support weapon
** ''[[Tachanka]]'', a horse-drawn machine gun carrier used in the [[Russian Civil War]]
** [[Katyusha]], a series of truck-mounted [[multiple rocket launcher]]s

=== Tank ===

[[Image:T72 Georgia.jpg |thumb|right|A [[T-72]] main battle tank clad in reactive armour bricks, in [[Georgia (country) |Georgian]] service.]]
{{main | tank}}

A '''tank''' is a [[Caterpillar track|tracked]], armoured combat vehicle ([[armoured fighting vehicle]]), designed primarily to engage enemy forces by the use of [[indirect fire|direct fire]]. A modern [[main battle tank]] is distinguished by its high level of firepower, mobility and armour protection relative to other vehicles of its era.  It can cross comparatively rough terrain at high speeds, but is fuel, maintenance, and ammunition-hungry and is [[Military logistics|logistically]] demanding.  It has the heaviest [[Vehicle armour |armour]] of any vehicle on the battlefield, and carries a powerful weapon that may be able to engage a wide variety of ground targets.  It is among the most versatile and fearsome weapons on the battlefield, valued for its [[fear |shock action]] against other troops and high survivability.

=== Armoured personnel carrier ===

[[Image:M113.jpg|thumb|right|The [[M113]], one of the most common tracked APCs, on duty during the [[Vietnam War]]]]
{{main | Armoured personnel carrier}}

'''Armoured personnel carriers''' (APCs) are light [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s for the transport of [[infantry]].  They usually have only a [[machine gun]] although variants carry [[recoilless rifle]]s, [[anti-tank guided missile]]s (ATGMs), or [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s.  They are not really designed to take part in a direct-fire battle, but to carry the troops to the battlefield safe from [[shrapnel]] and [[ambush]]. They may have [[wheel]]s or [[Caterpillar track|tracks]]. Examples include the American [[M113]] (tracked), the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[FV 432 AFV|FV 432]] (tracked) the [[France|French]] [[Véhicule de l'Avant Blindé|VAB]] (wheeled) and the Soviet [[BTR-60 |BTR]] (wheeled). The concept was fully realized by the Canadian Army in Normandy in 1944 with the invention of the Kangaroo.  Previous APCs were either semi-tracked (halftracks) or too small to effectively move a section/squad of infantry (such as the Universal Carrier).

=== Infantry fighting vehicle ===
{{main |infantry fighting vehicle}}

The first attempt to carry troops in an armoured tracked vehicle was made by the British in the First World War, a lengthened [[Mark I (tank)#Mark V|Mark V]] that could house a squad of infantry while still armed as a tank. Post-war, the idea was largely dropped in favour of trucks and lightly-armoured half-tracks, which were widely used during the Second World War. During WWII there were some experiments into heavily armoured carriers, such as the [[Kangaroo (armoured personnel carrier)|Kangaroo]]s, converted by stripping turrets from tanks.  After the war, there was a shift away from half-tracks to tracked or wheeled armoured personnel carriers (APCs), usually armed with a machine gun for self-defence.

[[Image:Cv90 8.jpg|thumb|left|Swedish [[Combat Vehicle 90]], a modern IFV.]]

Modern IFVs are well-armed infantry carriers that allow the infantry inside to fight from within the vehicle.  They are different from earlier APCs by their heavier armament allowing them to give direct-fire support during an [[attack |assault]], firing ports allowing the infantry to fire [[firearms |personal weapons]] while mounted, and improved [[vehicle armour |armour]].  They are typically armed with a twenty-millimetre or larger [[autocannon]], and possibly with [[ATGM]]s.  IFVs are usually [[Caterpillar track|tracked]], but some wheeled vehicles fall into this category, too.  

Specially-equipped IFVs have taken on some of the roles of light tanks; they are used by reconnaissance organizations, and light IFVs are used by airborne units which must be able to fight without the heavy firepower of tanks.

By comparison the Israeli [[Merkava]] is a main battle tank with the ability to carry a section of infantry.

=== Self-propelled artillery and assault gun ===
{{main articles|[[self-propelled artillery]], [[assault gun]]}}

[[Image:Su152 2.jpg|thumb|right|Soviet [[SU-152]] assault gun, mounting a 152-mm gun.]]

Various types of [[artillery]] pieces have been given their own integral transport by mounting them on armoured, [[caterpillar track |tracked]] or wheeled chassis.  This lets them keep up with the pace of [[armoured warfare]], and gives them nominal protection from [[counter-battery]] or [[small arms]] fire.  Like towed artillery, a battery of [[self-propelled artillery|self-propelled guns]] must still set up in a relatively safe area to perform [[fire mission]]s, but they are able to relocate more quickly.

[[Assault gun]]s are self-propelled artillery pieces intended support [[infantry]] in the direct-fire role. They usually have a large-calibre gun capable of firing a heavy high-explosive [[shell (projectile) |shell]], effective against dug-in troops and fortifications.

=== Tank destroyer ===
{{main|tank destroyer}}
[[Image:JPz IV-70.jpg|thumb|left|German [[Jagdpanzer IV |Jagdpanzer IV/70 (V)]], mounting the Panther tank's 75-mm gun on a Panzer IV chassis.]]
Self-propelled anti-tank guns, or ''tank destroyers'', are used primarily to provide [[antitank]] support for [[infantry]] or [[tank]] units, in [[defence (military) | defensive]] or [[withdrawal (military) |withdrawal]] operations. They may mount a high-velocity anti-tank gun or sometimes an [[antitank guided missile]] launcher, or ATGM.

Tank destroyers cannot fulfil the many roles of tanks; they are much less flexible, and usually lacking in anti-infantry capability.  But they are much less expensive to manufacture, maintain, and resupply than tanks.

Gun-armed tank destroyers have been largely supplanted by the more general-purpose tanks since Second World War, but lightly-armoured ATGM carriers are used for supplementary long-range antitank capabilities, and to replace tanks in light or [[airborne forces|airborne]] forces.

=== Tankette ===

[[Image:TKS.jpg |thumb|right|Polish [[TKS]] tankette, armed with a single 7.92-mm machine gun.]]
{{main |tankette}}

A tankette is a small armoured fighting vehicle with a crew of one or two, similar to a tank, intended for infantry support or reconnaissance.  Most had no [[turret]] and were armed with one or two [[machine gun]]s, or rarely with a heavier gun or grenade launcher. Tankettes were produced between about [[1930]] and [[1935]], but the concept was abandonded because of its limited utility and vulnerability to antitank weapons. Their role was largely taken over by armoured cars.  

A classic design was the British [[Carden Loyd Tankette]]—many others were modelled after it.  Japan was among the most prolific users of tankettes, producing a number of designs, which they found useful for [[jungle warfare]].

[[nlas supposedly a test for [[Operation Bojinka]], which was discovered by [[Manila]] police on [[January 6]], [[1995]].

Abu Sayyaf's first large-scale action was the beachhead assault on the town of [[Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay|Ipil]] in [[Mindanao]] in April [[1995]]. It is responsible for the kidnapping and murder of more than 30 foreigners and Christian clerics and lay-workers.

Abdurajik Janjalani was killed in a clash with the Philippine National Police on [[December 18]], [[1998]]. Khaddafy Janjalani, his younger brother, is said to have succeeded him.

The death of Aburajik Abubakar Janjalani, otherwise known as Abu Sayyaf, marked a turning point in ASG operations, shifting from its ideological focus to more general kidnappings, murders and robberies. 
[[Image:robotx1.jpg|right|thumb|Galib Andang a.k.a Kumander Robot getting treated for injuries sustained after being captured by the Philippine military.]] 

The ASG primarily operates in the southern Philippines with members occasionally traveling to [[Manila]], but the group expanded its operations to [[Malaysia]] in 2000 when it abducted foreigners from two different resorts. A commander named [[Abu Sabaya]] was killed in 2002 while trying to evade forces.[http://www.ict.org.il/spotlight/det.cfm?id=796]. [[Galib Andang]], aka Commander Robot, was captured in [[Sulu]] in [[December]] [[2003]].

Abu Sayyaf is estimated to have a core membership of 200 with an extended membership of over 2000. The group was originally not thought to receive funding from any government, but intelligence reports from the [[United States]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Australia]] have found intermittent ties to the Indonesian [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] terrorist group.

'''Armenian''' is an [[Indo-European language]] spoken by the [[Armenians|Armenian people]] in the [[Armenia|Armenian]] Republic and also used by the [[Armenian Diaspora]]. It constitutes an independent branch of the Indo-European language family, though many Indo-Europeanists believe it forms a subgroup with the Greek and Indo-Iranian families (see Clackson 1994 for extensive discussion).

==General considerations==

Armenian is regarded as a close relative of [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]]. From the modern languages [[Greek language|Greek]] seems to be the most closely related to Armenian. Armenian shares major [[isogloss]]es with Greek, some linguists propose that the linguistic ancestors of the Armenians and Greeks were either identical or in a close contact relation. Armenian and Phrygian show no close relationship with the [[Anatolian languages]] other than borrowings. The Anatolian loan words within Armenian indicate that proto-Armenians were in contact with both [[Luwian]] speakers and with [[Hittites]]. The Classical Armenian language (often referred to as grabar, literally &quot;written (language)&quot;) imported numerous words from Middle Iranian languages, primarily [[Parthian]], and contains smaller inventories of borrowings from Greek, Syriac, Latin, and autochthonous languages such as [[Urartian language|Urartian]]. Middle Armenian (11th–15th centuries AD) incorporated further loans from Arabic, Turkish, Persian, and Latin, and the modern dialects took in hundreds of additional words from Modern Turkish and Persian. The two modern literary dialects, Western (originally associated with writers in the Ottoman Empire) and Eastern (originally associated with writers in the Russian Empire), removed almost all of their Turkish lexical influences in the 20th century, primarily following the genocide of the Armenians in Anatolia by the Turks in 1915–1920.

Armenian is written in the [[Armenian alphabet]], created by Saint [[Saint Mesrob|Mesrop Mashtots]] in [[406]] AD. This alphabet, with two additional letters, is still used today.

Literature written in Armenian appeared by the [[5th century]]. The written language of that time, called [[classical Armenian]] or [[Grabar]], remained the Armenian literary language, with various changes, until the 19th century. Meanwhile, spoken Armenian developed independently of the written language. Many dialects appeared when Armenian communities became separated by geography or politics, and not all of these dialects remained mutually intelligible.

==Grammar==
Armenian resembles other Indo-European languages in its structure, but it shares distinctive sounds and features of its grammar with neighboring languages of the [[Caucasus]] region. Armenian is rich in combinations of consonants. Both classical Armenian and the modern spoken and literary dialects have a complicated system of declining nouns, with six or seven noun cases but no gender. In modern Armenian the use of auxiliary verbs to show tense (comparable to will in &quot;he will go&quot;) has generally supplemented the inflected verbs of classical Armenian. Negative verbs are conjugated differently from positive ones (as in English &quot;he goes&quot; and &quot;he does not go&quot;). Grammatically, early forms of Armenian had much in common with classical [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]], but the modern language, like modern Greek, has undergone many transformations. 

[[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] studied the Armenian language. He helped to compile an Armenian grammar textbook and translated a few Armenian books into English.

==Phonology==
[[Classical Armenian]] distinguishes seven vowels: 
''a'', ''i'', ''[[schwa]]'', open ''e'', closed ''e'', ''o'', and ''u'' (transcribed as ''a'', ''i'', ''ə'', ''e'', ''ē'', ''o'', ''ow'' and ''u'' respectively).

The [[stop consonant|occlusives]] have a special aspirated series (transcribed with a Greek ''[[spiritus asper]]'' after the letter): ''{{unicode|p῾}}'', ''{{unicode|t῾}}'', ''{{unicode|c῾}}'', ''{{unicode|č῾}}'', ''{{unicode|k῾}}''.

==Morphology==

===Noun===
Classical Armenian has no [[grammatical gender]], not even in the pronoun. The nominal inflection, however, preserves several types of inherited stem classes. The noun may take seven cases, [[nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[locative]], [[genitive]], [[dative]], [[ablative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]].

===Verb===
''Main article: [[Armenian verbs]]''

Verbs in Armenian have an expansive system of [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] with two main verb types (three in Western Armenian) changing form based on tense, mood and aspect.

==Dialects==
One of the greatest differences in the two modern dialects is the way certain letters are pronounced. Eastern Armenian speakers have kept the original pronunciations of the letters, pronouncing each of the 38 letters quite distinctively.  On the other hand, Western Armenian speakers pronounce a few of the letters in the same way.  This has to do with Western Armenians living in regions where other languages, which lacked these rich variations, were also widely spoken and therefore have been influenced by the pronunciations of these other languages (usually either Arabic or Turkish.)

For example, the Armenian language has the letter &quot;t&quot; ({{Hayeren|թ}}), aspirated as in &quot;tiger&quot;, the letter &quot;d&quot; ({{Hayeren|դ}}) as in &quot;develop&quot;, and another letter which is an unaspirated voiceless stop, sounding somewhere between the two as in &quot;s'''t'''op&quot; ({{Hayeren|տ}}).  Western Armenians will pronounce the &quot;tiger&quot; and &quot;develop&quot; examples in the same way, where as Eastern Armenian speakers pronounced each of the three differently.

Armenian also has many other unique letters not heard in other languages. There are two different &quot;k&quot;s; as well as a letter sounding like a cross between &quot;p&quot; and &quot;b&quot;; two &quot;r&quot; letters, one pronounced with a rolling &quot;r&quot; sound; the letter &quot;gh&quot; pronounced like the French &quot;r&quot;; &quot;kh&quot; a harder pronunciation also found in many Middle Eastern languages; as well as the letters &quot;ts&quot;, &quot;tz&quot;, &quot;dz&quot;, &quot;dch&quot;, &quot;uh&quot; like the &quot;a&quot; sound in the word &quot;arrange&quot;; and many more.  These are just a few examples that make Armenian a rich and unique language.

There is no precise linguistic border between one dialect and another because there is nearly always a dialect transition zone of some size between pairs of geographically identified dialects). The main difference between both blocks are:
*'''Western Armenian''' (''Arevm'tahayeren''):
** example
*'''Eastern Armenian''' (''Arevelahayeren''):
** example

In addition, neither dialect is completely homogeneous: any dialect can be subdivided into several subdialects. Armenian can be subdivided in two major dialectal blocks and those blocks into individual dialects, though many of the Western Armenian dialects have died due to the effects of the Armenian Genocide:

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Additive synthesis''' is a technique of audio synthesis which creates [[music]]al [[timbre]].

The timbre of an instrument is composed of multiple [[harmonic]]s, in different quantities, that change over time. Additive synthesis emulates such timbres by creating numerous waveforms pitched to different harmonics, with a different [[amplitude]] envelope on each, along with non-harmonic artifacts.

Usually this involves a bank of [[numerically controlled oscillator|oscillators]] tuned to multiples of the base frequency. Often, each oscillator has its own customizable volume envelope, creating a realistic, dynamic sound.

The concept behind additive synthesis may be related to discoveries by the French  mathematician [[Joseph Fourier]].  Fourier discovered that discontinuous functions are formed by the summation of an infinite series.  Following this, it was established that all signals, when represented as a mathematical function, can be composed as a sum of sine functions ( sin(''x'') ) of various frequencies.  More rigorously, any periodic sound in the [[discrete time]] domain can be synthesized as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;s(n) = \frac{1}{2} a_0(n) + \sum_{k=1}^{k_{\max}} a_k(n) \cos\left( \frac{2 \pi f_0}{F_s} k n \right)-b_k(n) \sin\left( \frac{2 \pi f_0}{F_s} k n \right)&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;s(n) = \frac{1}{2} a_0(n) + \sum_{k=1}^{k_{\max}} r_k(n) \cos\left( \frac{2 \pi f_0}{F_s} k n +\varphi_k(n) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where 

:&lt;math&gt;a_k(n) = r_k(n) \cos \left( \varphi_k(n) \right) \,&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;b_k(n) = r_k(n) \sin \left( \varphi_k(n) \right) \,&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;F_s \,&lt;/math&gt; is the sampling frequency, &lt;math&gt;f_0 \,&lt;/math&gt; is the fundamental frequency, and &lt;math&gt;k_{\max}&lt;\operatorname{floor}(F_s/2 f_0) \,&lt;/math&gt; is the highest harmonic and below the [[Nyquist frequency]].   The [[direct current|DC]] term is generally undesirable in audio synthesis, so the a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; term can be removed.  Introducing time varying coefficients ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') allows for the dynamic use of envelopes to modulate oscillators creating a &quot;quasi-periodic&quot; waveform (one that is periodic over the short term but changes its waveform over the longer term).  Additive synthesis can also create non-[[harmonic]] sounds if the individual [[partial]]s are not all having a frequency that is an integer multiple of the same [[fundamental frequency]].

A classic additive synthesizer was the [[Synclavier]].  The pipe organ may also qualify as an additive synthesizer because its pipes generate sine waves when blown, which are  added to each other to generate tones.  More contemporary popular implementations of additive synthesis include the [[Kawai]] K5000 series of synthesizers in the [[1990s]] and, more recently, [[software synthesizer]]s such as the [[Camel Audio]] Cameleon, the [[VirSyn]] Cube, [[White Noise]] WNAdditive, and the [[ConcreteFX]] softsynth Adder. 

It has been shown in [http://www.musicdsp.org/files/Wavetable-101.pdf Wavetable Synthesis 101, A Fundamental Perspective], that [[wavetable synthesis]] is equivalent to additive synthesis in the case that all [[partial]]s or [[overtone]]s are [[harmonic]] (that is all overtones are at frequencies that are an integer multiple of a [[fundamental frequency]] of the tone as shown in the equation above).  Not all musical sounds have harmonic partials, (e.g. [[bell (instrument) | bell]]s) but many do.  In these cases, an efficient implementation of additive synthesis can be accomplished with wavetable synthesis.  '''Group additive synthesis''' is a method to group partials into harmonic groups (of differing fundamental frequencies) and synthesize each group separately with wavetable synthesis before mixing the results.

An '''aircraft carrier''' is a [[warship]] whose main role is to deploy and recover [[aircraft]]&amp;mdash;in effect acting as a sea-going airbase. Aircraft carriers thus allow a naval force to project [[air power]] great distances without having to depend on local bases for land-based aircraft. Modern navies who operate such ships, treat aircraft carriers as the centerpiece of the fleet, a role previously played by the [[battleship]]. The change, part of the growth of air power as a significant part of warfare, took place during [[World War II]]. Unescorted carriers are considered vulnerable to attack by other ships, aircraft, submarines or missiles and therefore travel as part of a [[carrier battle group]].  In many navies, especially the [[United States Navy]], an aircraft carrier is a [[capital ship]].

==Flight deck configuration==
[[Image:Enterprise Returns.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The island of [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|USS ''Enterprise'']].]]

Modern aircraft carriers have a flat-top deck, the [[flight deck]] that serves as a [[take off|take-off]] and [[landing]] area for aircraft. Aircraft take off to the front, into the wind, and land from the rear. Carriers steam at speed, for example up to 35 [[knot (nautical)|knots]] (65 km/h), into the wind during take-off in order to increase the [[apparent wind]] speed, thereby reducing the speed of the aircraft relative to the ship. On some ships, a steam-powered [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] is used to propel the aircraft forward assisting the power of its engines and allowing it to take off in a shorter distance than would otherwise be required, even with the headwind effect of the ship's course. On other carriers, aircraft do not require assistance for take off — the requirement for assistance relates to aircraft design and performance. Conversely, when landing on a carrier, some aircraft rely upon a [[tailhook]] that catches on [[arrestor wires]] stretched across the deck to bring them to a stop in a shorter distance than normal. Other aircraft utilise their hover capability to land vertically and so require no assistance in speed reduction upon landing. Since the end of [[World War II]] it has been common to direct the landing recovery area off to port at an angle to the line of the ship. The primary function of the angle deck landing area is to allow aircraft who miss the arresting wires, refered to as a &quot;bolter&quot;, to become airborne again without the risk of hitting aircraft parked on the forward parts of the deck. The angle deck also allows launching of aircraft at the same time as others land.

The above deck areas of the warship (the [[bridge (ship)|bridge]], flight [[control tower]], engine exhausts and so on) are concentrated to the [[starboard]] side of the deck in a relatively small area called an &quot;island&quot;.  Very few carriers have been designed or built without an island and such a configuration has not been seen in a fleet sized carrier.

A more recent configuration, used by the [[Royal Navy]], has a 'ski-jump' ramp at the forward end of the flight deck. This was developed to help launch [[VTOL]] (or [[STOVL]]) aircraft (aircraft that are able to take off and land with little or no forward movement) such as the [[BAE Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier]]. Although the aircraft are capable of flying vertically off the deck, using the ramp is more fuel efficient. As catapults and arrestor cables are unnecessary, carriers with this arrangement reduce weight, complexity, and space needed for equipment.

==Common types==
Over the course of the last century there have been several types of aircraft carrier, some of which are now obsolete. They can be generally categorised as follows:

===Initial designs and inter-war developments===
* [[Seaplane tender]]s, such as [[HMS Engadine (1911)|HMS ''Engadine'']], out of frontline use after the 1920s when carriers capable of handling conventional airplanes came into fleets and the superiority of landplanes over [[seaplane]]s in naval operations became firmly established.
* Standard carriers, such as [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']], typically 20,000 to 65,000 tons. Often known as &quot;fleet carriers.&quot;
* Flying aircraft carrier; airship that can carry aircraft. Example include [[USS Akron (ZRS-4)|USS ''Akron'']] and [[USS Macon (ZRS-5)|''Macon'']]

===World War II developments===
[[Image:Hmcs bonaventure.jpg|250px|right||thumb|[[HMCS Bonaventure (CVL 22)|HMCS ''Bonaventure'']], a [[Majestic class aircraft carrier|''Majestic'' class]] aircraft carrier of the [[Royal Canadian Navy]].]]

* [[Escort carrier]]s, such as [[USS Barnes (CVE-20)|USS ''Barnes'']], were built only during World War II, and were used by the Royal Navy and U.S. Navy. 
* [[Light aircraft carrier]]s, such as [[USS Independence (CVL-22)|USS ''Independence'']], were designed to primarily carry fighters.
* [[CAM ship]]s, such as [[SS Michael E|SS ''Michael E'']], cargo carrying merchant ships which could launch but not retrieve fighter aircraft. These vessels were an emergency measure during [[World War II]].
* [[Merchant aircraft carrier]]s (MACs), such as [[MV Empire MacAlpine|MV ''Empire MacAlpine'']], another emergency measure which saw cargo-carrying merchant ships equipped with flight decks.
* [[Carrier battleship]]s were created by the Imperial Japanese Navy to partially compensate for the loss of carrier strength at [[Battle of Midway|Midway]]. Two of them were made from [[Ise class battleship|''Ise'' class]] battleships during late 1943. The aft turrets were removed and replaced with a hangar, deck and catapult.  The heavy cruiser [[Mogami|''Mogami'']] concurrently received a similar conversion. 
* [[Submarine aircraft carrier]]s, such as the French [[French submarine Surcouf|''Surcouf'']], or the Japanese [[I-400 class submarine]]s which were capable of carrying 3 [[Aichi]] [[Aichi M6A|M6A ''Seiran'']] aircraft. The first of these were built in the 1920s.

In addition, many battleships, cruisers and merchant raiders were equipped with floatplanes for reconnaissance.

===Post-war developments===
* [[Amphibious assault ship|Amphibious assault carrier]]s, such as [[USS Tarawa (LHA-1)|USS ''Tarawa'']], which often also serve the purpose of carrying and landing [[soldier]]s and operate a large contingent of helicopters for that purpose. Also known as &quot;commando carriers&quot; or &quot;helicopter carriers.&quot;
* [[Anti-submarine warfare carrier]]s, such as [[HMS Ocean (L12)|HMS ''Ocean'']], also known as &quot;helicopter carriers.&quot;
* [[Supercarrier]]s, such as [[USS Nimitz (CVN-68)|USS ''Nimitz'']], typically 75,000 tons or greater.

Some [[cruiser (warship)|cruisers]] and [[capital ship]]s of the inter-war years often carried a catapult launched seaplane for reconnaissance and spotting the fall of the guns. It was launched by a catapult and recovered by crane from the water after landing. These were mostly removed during World War II, but had some notable successes early in the war as shown by [[HMS Warspite (1913)|HMS ''Warspite'']]’s [[Supermarine Walrus|Walrus]] during operations in the Norwegian fjords in 1940.

Many modern warships have [[helicopter]] landing capability and helicopter assault ships represent a new form of amphibious assault carrier.

==History and milestones==
===Genesis===
[[Image:Ely-takeoff.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Ely takes off from&lt;br&gt;USS ''Birmingham'', [[14 November]] [[1910]].]]
[[Image:Ely-landing.jpg|thumb|200px|Ely lands on USS ''Pennsylvania'', &lt;br&gt;[[18 January]] [[1911]].]]
As heavier-than-air aircraft developed in the early 20th century various navies began to take an interest in their potential use as scouts for their big gun warships. A number of experimental flights were made to test the concept. [[Eugene Ely]] was the first [[Aviator|pilot]] to launch from a stationary ship in November 1910. He took off from a structure fixed over the forecastle of the US [[armoured cruiser]] [[USS Birmingham (CL-2)|USS ''Birmingham'']] at [[Hampton Roads]], [[Virginia]] and landed nearby on [[Willoughby Spit]] after some five minutes in the air. On [[January 18]] [[1911]] he became the first pilot to land on a stationary ship. He took off from the Tanforan racetrack and landed on a similar temporary structure on the aft of [[USS Pennsylvania (ACR-4)|USS ''Pennsylvania'']] anchored at the [[San Francisco]] waterfront&amp;mdash;the improvised braking system of sandbags and ropes lead directly to the arrestor hook and wires described above. His aircraft was then turned around and he was able to take off again. [[Commander]] Charles Samson, RN, became the first airman to take off from a moving warship on [[May 2]] [[1912]]. He took off in a [[Short S27]] from the battleship [[HMS Hibernia (1905)|HMS ''Hibernia'']] while she steamed at 10.5 knots (19 km/h) during the [[Royal Fleet Review]] at [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]].

[[HMS Ark Royal (1914)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']] was the first aircraft carrier. She was originally laid down as a merchant ship, but was converted on the building stocks to be a seaplane carrier. Launched in 1914, she served in the [[Dardanelles]] campaign and throughout World War I. 

The first strike from a carrier against a land target took place on [[July 19]] [[1918]]. Seven [[Sopwith Camel]]s launched from [[HMS Furious (1916)|HMS ''Furious'']] attacked the German [[Zeppelin]] base at [[Tondern]], with two 50 lb bombs each. Several [[airship]]s and [[balloon]]s were destroyed, but as the carrier had no method of recovering the aircraft safely, two of the pilots ditched their aircraft in the sea alongside the carrier while the others headed for neutral [[Denmark]].

===The inter-war years===
[[Image:H42235.jpg|thumb|left|150px|left|The first flat deck, [[HMS Argus (I49)|HMS ''Argus'']] in 1918]]
[[Image:Japanese aircraft carrier Hosho.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The first purpose-designed aircraft carrier, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hosho|''Hosho'']], in 1922]]
The [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922 placed strict limits on the tonnages of battleships and [[battlecruiser]]s for the major naval powers after [[World War I]], as well as limits not only on the total tonnage for carriers, but also an upper limit on 27,000 tonnes for each ship. Although exceptions were made regarding the max ship tonnage (fleet units counted, experimental units did not), the total tonnage could not be exceeded. However, while all of the major navies were over-tonnage on battleships, they were all considerably under-tonnage on aircraft carriers. Consequently, many battleships and battlecruisers under construction (or in service) were converted into aircraft carriers. The first ship to have a full length flat deck was [[HMS Argus (1917)|HMS ''Argus'']] the conversion of which was completed in September [[1918]], with the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] not following suit until 1920, when the conversion of [[USS Langley (CV-1)|USS ''Langley'']] had completed.  The first American fleet carriers would not join the service until [[Lexington class aircraft carrier|1928]] ([[USS Lexington (CV-2)|USS ''Lexington'']] and [[USS Saratoga (CV-3)|''Saratoga'']]).

The first purpose-designed aircraft carrier to be developed was the [[HMS Hermes (1923)|HMS ''Hermes'']], although the first one to be commissionned was the Japanese [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hosho|''Hosho'']] (commissioned in December 1922, followed by HMS ''Hermes'' in July 1923). ''Hermes''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; design preceded and influenced that of the Hosho, and its construction actually began earlier, but numerous tests, experiments and budget considerations delayed its commission.

By the late 1930s, aircraft carriers around the world typically carried three types of aircraft: [[torpedo bomber]]s, also used for conventional bombings and [[reconnaissance]]; [[dive bomber]]s, also used for reconnaissance (in the U.S. Navy, this type of aircraft were known as &quot;scout bombers&quot;); and [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]s for fleet defence and bomber escort duties. Because of the restricted space on aircraft carriers, all these aircraft were of small, single-engined types, usually with [[folding wing]]s to facilitate storage.

===The Second World War===
Aircraft carriers played a significant role in [[World War II]]. With seven aircraft carriers afloat, the Royal Navy had a considerable numerical advantage at the start of the war as neither the Germans or the Italians had carriers of their own. However, the vulnerability of carriers to traditional battleships was quickly illustrated by the sinking of [[HMS Glorious|HMS ''Glorious'']] by German battlecruisers during the Norwegian campaign in 1940. By World War II, seaplane carriers were no longer considered to be equals to carriers which could operate conventional aircraft, as conventional planes could fly farther, faster, with heavier weapons loads and greater performance; by the end of the war, early helicopters were taking over many of the roles of seaplanes.

This apparent weakness to battleships was turned on its head in November 1940 when [[HMS Illustrious (R87)|HMS ''Illustrious'']] launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at [[Battle of Taranto|Taranto]]. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships in the harbour at a cost of two of the 21 attacking [[Fairey Swordfish]] [[torpedo bombers]]. Carriers also played a major part in reinforcing [[Malta]], both by transporting planes and by defending convoys sent to supply the besieged island. The use of carriers prevented the Italian Navy and land-based German aircraft from dominating the Mediterranean theatre.

In the Atlantic, aircraft from HMS ''Ark Royal'' and [[HMS Victorious (R38)|HMS ''Victorious'']] were responsible for slowing [[German Battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] during May 1941. Later in the war, escort carriers proved their worth guarding convoys crossing the [[Second Battle of the Atlantic|Atlantic]] and [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic]] oceans.

Many of the major battles in the Pacific involved aircraft carriers. [[Japan]] started the war with ten aircraft carriers, the largest and most modern carrier fleet in the world at that time. There were six American aircraft carriers at the beginning of the hostilities, although only 3 of them were operating in the Pacific.

[[Image:Carrier shokaku.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Planes from the Japanese aircraft carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Shokaku|''Shokaku'']] preparing the attack on [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]].]]

Drawing on the 1939 Japanese development of low-depth runs for aerial torpedoes, and the 1940 British aerial attack on the Italian fleet at Taranto the 1941 Japanese surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] was a clear illustration of the [[power projection]] capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Simultaneously, the Japanese began their advance through South East Asia and the [[sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinking of ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'']] by Japanese land-based aircraft drove home the need for this ship class for fleet defence from aerial attack. In April 1942, the Japanese Fast Carrier Strike Force ranged into the [[Indian Ocean raid|Indian Ocean]] and sank shipping, including the under-repair and undefended carrier [[HMS Hermes (95)|HMS ''Hermes'']]. Smaller Allied fleets with inadequate aerial protection were forced to retreat or be destroyed. In the [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]], US and Japanese fleets traded aircraft strikes in the first battle where neither side's ships sighted the other. At the [[Battle of Midway]] four Japanese carriers were sunk in a surprise attack by planes from three American carriers and this is considered to be the turning point of the war in the Pacific.

Subsequently the US was able to build up large numbers of aircraft aboard a mixture of fleet, light and (newly commissioned) escort carriers. These carriers played a major part in winning the [[Pacific war]]. The eclipse of the battleship as the primary component of a fleet was clearly illustrated by the sinking of the largest battleship ever built, [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']], by carrier-borne aircraft in 1945. Japan also built the largest aircraft carrier of the war, [[Japanese aircraft carrier Shinano|''Shinano'']], which, like ''Yamato'', was named after a Japanese province.

==Wartime innovations==
[[Image:Viraat lengthy.jpg|thumb|250px|[[India]]'s [[INS Viraat|INS ''Viraat'']].]]

Combat experience proved that the British invention of the sealed &quot;hurricane bow&quot; which protected against storms was superior to any other use for the very front of the ship, be it machine-guns or a second flight deck. This became standard for British and American carriers. The Japanese carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Taiho|''Taiho'']] was the first of their ships to incorporate it.

Starting late in the war with the [[Midway class aircraft carrier|''Midway'' class]], American carriers had grown so large that it was no longer practical to continue the concept of designing the hangar deck to be the strength deck, and all subsequent American carriers have the flight deck as the strength deck, leaving only the island as superstructure.

===Light Aircraft Carriers===
The loss of three major carriers in quick succession in the Pacific led the US Navy to develop the light carrier (CVL) from [[light cruiser]] hulls that had already been laid down. These were intended to add fighter squadrons to a task force, and were used in the US Navy only during World War II. The Royal Navy made a similar design which served both them and [[Commonwealth]] countries after World War II. One of these carriers, India's [[INS Viraat|INS ''Viraat'']], formerly [[HMS Hermes (R12)|HMS ''Hermes'']], is still being used.

===Escort Carriers and Merchant Aircraft Carriers===
To protect Atlantic [[convoy]]s, the British developed what they called [[Merchant Aircraft Carrier]]s, which were merchant ships equipped with a flat deck for half a dozen aircraft. These operated with civilian crews, under merchant colors, and carried their normal cargo besides providing air support for the convoy. As there was no lift or hangar, aircraft maintenance was limited and the aircraft spent the entire trip sitting on the deck.

These served as stop-gap until dedicated [[escort carrier]]s could be built in the US (US classification ''CVE''). About a third of the size of a fleet carrier, it carried about two dozen aircraft for anti-submarine duties. Over one hundred were built or converted from merchantmen.

Escort carriers were built in the US from two basic hull designs: one from a merchant ship, and the other from a slightly larger, slightly faster tanker. Besides defending convoys, these were used to transport aircraft across the ocean. Nevertheless, some participated in the battles to liberate the [[Philippines]], notably the [[battle off Samar]] in which six escort carriers and their escorting destroyers briefly took on five Japanese battleships and bluffed them into retreating.

===Catapult Aircraft Merchantmen===
As an emergency stop-gap before sufficient merchant aircraft carriers became available, the British provided air cover for convoys using ''Catapult aircraft merchantman'' (CAM ships) and [[merchant aircraft carrier]]s. CAM ships were merchant vessels equipped with an aircraft, usually a battle-weary [[Hawker Hurricane]], launched by a catapult. Once launched, the aircraft could not land back on the deck and had to ditch in the sea if it was not within range of land. Over two years, fewer than 10 launches were ever made, yet these flights did have some success: 6 bombers for the loss of a single pilot.

===The Angled Deck===
During the Second World War, aircraft would land on the flight deck parallel to the long axis of the ship's [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]. Aircraft which had already landed would be parked on the deck at the bow end of the flight deck. A crash barrier was raised behind them to stop any landing aircraft which overshot the landing area because its landing hook missed the arrestor cables. If this happened, it would often cause serious damage or injury and even, if the crash barrier was not strong enough, destruction of parked aircraft. 

An important development of the 1940s was the British invention of the angled deck, where the runway was canted at an angle of a few degrees across the ship. If an aircraft misses the arrestor cables, the pilot only needs to increase [[engine]] power to maximum to get airborne again and will not hit the parked aircraft because the angled deck points out over the sea. The picture of [[USS John C. Stennis (CVN-74)|USS ''John C. Stennis'']] at the top shows an angled landing deck.

===Post-War Developments===
[[Image:FS CdG Optics.jpg|thumb|250px|Landing optics of ''[[FS Charles de Gaulle|Charles de Gaulle]]'']]

The modern steam-powered catapult, powered by steam from the ship's [[boiler]]s or reactors, was invented by Commander C.C. Mitchell [[Royal Naval Reserve|RNVR]]. It was widely adopted following trials on [[HMS Perseus (R51)|HMS ''Perseus'']] between 1950 and 1952 which showed it to be more powerful and reliable than the compressed air catapults which had been introduced in the 1930s. As now only [[nuclear power|nuclear powered]] carriers have boilers as part of their motive power system, the majority of aircraft carriers are now equipped with steam generating plant solely to power the catapults.

Another British invention was the glide-slope indicator (also known as a &quot;meatball&quot;). This was a gyroscopically-controlled lamp on the port side of the deck which could be seen by the aviator who was about to land, indicating to him whether he was too high or too low in relation to the desired glidepath. It also took into account the effect of the waves on the flight deck. The device became a necessity as the landing speed of aircraft increased.

The US Navy prematurely attempted to become a strategic nuclear force with the project to build [[USS United States (CVA-58)|''United States'']], termed CVA, with the &quot;A&quot; signifying &quot;atomic&quot;. This ship would have carried twin-propeller bombers, each of which could carry an atomic bomb. The project was cancelled under pressure from the newly-created [[United States Air Force]], and the letter &quot;A&quot; was re-cycled to mean &quot;attack.&quot; But this only delayed the growth of carriers. Nuclear weapons would put to sea despite Air Force objections in 1955 aboard [[USS Forrestal (CV-59)|USS ''Forrestal'']], and by the end of the fifties the Navy had a series of nuclear-armed attack aircraft.

The US Navy took nuclear power afloat in other ways by building aircraft carriers powered by nuclear reactors. [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|USS ''Enterprise'']] was the first aircraft carrier to be powered in this way and subsequent supercarriers took advantage of this technology to increase their endurance. The only other nation to have followed the US lead is France with [[FS Charles de Gaulle|''Charles de Gaulle'']].

The post-war years also saw the development of the helicopter with different capabilities to a fighter aircraft. Whereas fixed-wing aircraft are suited to air-to-air combat and air-to-surface attack, helicopters are used to transport equipment and personnel and can be used in an [[anti-submarine warfare]] role with dipped sonar and missiles.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the UK converted some of its old carriers into Commando Carriers, sea-going helicopter airfields like [[HMS Bulwark (R08)|HMS ''Bulwark'']]. To militate against the expensive connotations of the term &quot;aircraft carrier&quot;, the new [[Invincible class aircraft carriers|''Invincible'' class]] carriers were originally designated &quot;through deck cruisers&quot; and were initially helicopter only craft to operate as escort carriers. The arrival of the Sea Harrier meant they could carry fixed wing aircraft despite their short flight deck.

==Aircraft carriers today==
[[Image:FlightOps launch.jpg|thumb|200px|Flight operations on the deck of [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|USS ''Abraham Lincoln'']].]]
Aircraft carriers are generally the largest ships operated by [[Navy|navies]]; a ''Nimitz''-class carrier powered by two [[nuclear reactor]]s and four [[steam turbine]]s is 1092 ft (333 m) long and costs about $10 billion. The United States has the majority of aircraft carriers with a dozen in service, and its aircraft carriers are a cornerstone of American power projection capability.

Ten countries maintain aircraft carriers: [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[India]], [[Russia]], [[Spain]], [[Brazil]], [[Italy]] and [[Thailand]]. In addition the [[People's Republic of China]]'s [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] possesses the former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] aircraft carrier [[Soviet aircraft carrier Varyag|''Varyag'']], but most naval analysts believe that they have no intention to operate it, but instead are using ''Varyag'' to learn about carrier operations for a future Chinese aircraft carrier. Canada, China, Japan, [[Pakistan]], [[Australia]] and [[Chile]] also operate helicopter-carrying vessels.

Aircraft carriers are generally accompanied by a number of other ships, to provide protection for the relatively unwieldy carrier, to carry supplies, and to provide additional offensive capabilities. This is often termed a battle group or carrier group, sometimes a carrier battle group.

===Modern carriers===
[[Image:HMS Hermes (R12) (Royal Navy aircraft carrier.jpg|thumb|200px|HMS ''Hermes'']]
More modern uses of aircraft carriers include the [[Falklands War]], where the United Kingdom was able to win a conflict 8,000 miles (13,000 km) from home in large part due to the use of the full size carrier HMS ''Hermes'' and the smaller [[HMS Invincible (R05)|HMS ''Invincible'']]. The Falklands showed the value of a [[VSTOL]] aircraft&amp;mdash;the [[Hawker-Siddeley Harrier]] (the RN Sea Harrier and press-ganged RAF Harriers) in defending the fleet and assault force from shore based aircraft and for attacking the enemy. Helicopters from the carriers were used to deploy troops and pick up the wounded. 

The US has also made use of carriers in the [[Persian Gulf]], [[Afghanistan]] and to protect its interests in the Pacific. Most recently, the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] featured US aircraft carriers as the primary base of US air power. Even without the ability to place significant numbers of aircraft in Middle Eastern airbases, the United States was capable of carrying out significant air attacks from carrier-based squadrons.

In the early 21st century, worldwide aircraft carriers were capable of carrying about 1250 aircraft. US carriers accounted for over 1000 of these; the second leading country, the United Kingdom fielded over 50 aircraft. The United Kingdom and France are both undergoing a major expansion in carrier capability (with a [[Royal Navy CVF programme|common ship class]]), but the United States will still maintain a very large lead.

&lt;p clear=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

==Future aircraft carriers==
Several nations which currently possess aircraft carriers are in the process of planning new classes, to replace current ones. 

===French ''Marine Nationale''===
The [[French Navy]] has set in motion plans for a [[Future French aircraft carrier|second aircraft carrier]], to supplement ''[[FS Charles de Gaulle|Charles de Gaulle]]''. The design is to be much larger, in the range of 50&amp;ndash;60,000 tonnes, and will not be nuclear-powered like Charles de Gaulle. There are plans to adopt the current [[Royal Navy CVF programme|Royal Navy design]] for [[CATOBAR]] operations (the [[Thales Group|Thales]]/[[BAE Systems]] design for the Royal Navy is for a STOVL carrier which is reconfigureable to CATOBAR operations).

===Indian Navy===
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Gorshkov-01-model.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A model of [[Admiral Gorshkov]] after reconfiguration.]] --&gt;

India started the construction of a 37,500 tonne, 252 metre-long aircraft carrier in April [[2005]]. The new carrier will cost US$762 million and will operate [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG 29K 'Fulcrum']] and Sea Harrier aircraft along with Russian- and Indian-made helicopters. The ship will be powered by four turbine engines and when completed will have a range of 7,500 nautical miles, carrying 160 officers, 1400 sailors, and 30 aircraft. The carrier is to be constructed by a state-run shipyard in southern India. In 2004, India also bought [[Soviet aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov|''Admiral Gorshkov'']] from [[Russia]] for US$1.5 billion; it is expected to join the [[Indian Navy|Indian Navy]] in 2008 after a refit.{{ref|India}}

===Italian ''Marina Militare''===
The construction of the conventional powered ''[[Marina Militare]]'' V/STOL aircraft carrier [[Cavour (C552)|''Cavour'']] began in 2001. It is being built by [[Fincantieri]] of Italy. After much delay, ''Cavour'' is expected to enter service in 2008  to complement the Marina Militare aircraft carrier [[Italian aircraft carrier Giuseppe Garibaldi|''Giuseppe Garibaldi'']]. A second aircraft carrier in the 25-30,000 ton range is much desired by the Italian Navy, to replace the already decommissioned carrier [[Italian aircraft carrier Vittorio Veneto|''Vittorio Veneto'']], but for budgetary reasons all further development is on hold.

===People's Republic of China===
In June 2005, it was reported by boxun.com that [[China]] would build a US$362 million aircraft carrier with a displacement of 78,000 tons, to be built by the Jiangnan Shipyard in [[Shanghai]]. The report was denied by Chinese defense official ''Zhang Guangqin''. {{ref|China}} Previous attempts to purchase an aircraft carrier from Russia and France did not succeed.

===British Royal Navy===
[[Image:2006 CVF STOVL.jpg|thumb|200px|Royal Navy CVF]]
The Royal Navy is currently planning two new larger aircraft carriers (as yet only known as [[Royal Navy CVF programme|CVF]]) to replace the two [[Invincible class aircraft carrier|''Invincible'' class]] carriers currently in service. These two ships are expected to be named [[HMS Queen Elizabeth (2012)|HMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']] and [[HMS Prince of Wales (2015)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']]. They will be able to operate about 50 aircraft and will have a displacement of around 60,000 tonnes. The two ships are due to enter service in 2012 and 2015 respectively. Their primary aircraft complement will be made up of [[F-35 Joint Strike Fighter]], and their ship's company will number around 1000.

The two ships will be the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy. Initially to be configured for STOVL operations, the carriers are to be adaptable to allow any type of future generation of aircraft to operate from them.

===Russian Federation===
Has one operational aircraft carrier, [[Soviet aircraft carrier Kuznetsov | ''Admiral Kuznetsov'']]. [[Image:Carrier_Admiral_Kuznetsov.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Russian ''Admiral Kuznetsov'']]

The Russian Federation is currently developing a new aircraft carrier design. They are starting from scratch to make a modern model, with the newest available materials and electronics. Requirements would be for two aircraft carriers - one for the Russian Baltic Fleet and one for the Russian Pacific Fleet. Construction is set to begin by 2010, and finish in around 6 years.

===Spanish ''Armada Española''===
[[Image:buqueproyeccionestrategica.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Spanish ''Buque de proyección estratégica'']]
The project for the 231 meter-long and 25,000-30,000 tons conventional powered ''[[Buque de Proyección Estratégica]]'' (Strategic projection vessel) for the Spanish navy was approved in 2003, and its construction started in August 2005, with the ship-building firm [[Navantia]] in charge of the project. The ''Buque de proyección estratégica'' is a vessel designed to operate both as [[amphibious assault]] vessel and as VSTOL aircraft carrier, depending on the mission assigned. The design was made keeping in mind the low-intensity conflicts in which the Spanish Armada is going to be involved in the future. When it is configured to operate as VSTOL aircraft carrier, the operating range will be about 25,000 tons, and it will operate a maximum of 20 [[AV-8B Harrier II|Matador AV-8B+]], F-35 or a mixed force of both aircraft. The ship is provided with a Sky-Jump and a tri-dimensional radar based combat system, and she will be the second operating aircraft carrier of the Spanish navy after [[Spanish aircraft carrier Principe de Asturias|''Príncipe de Asturias'']].

===US Navy===
[[Image:Image-CVNX picture.JPG|200px|thumb|right|CVNX/CVN-21]]

The current US Fleet of [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz''-class]] carriers are to be followed into service (and in some cases replaced) by the [[CVN-21]]/CVNX Carrier. It is expected that the ships will be larger and will operate more aircraft than the 80 or so of [[USS Nimitz|''Nimitz'']], and will also be designed for lower detectability by radar.

The '''Apicomplexa''' are a large group of [[protozoa]], characterized by the presence of an apical complex at some point in their life-cycle.  They are exclusively parasitic, and completely lack [[flagellum|flagella]] or [[pseudopod]]s except for certain [[gamete]] stages.  Diseases caused by Apicomplexa include:

* [[Babesiosis]] (''[[Babesia]]'')
* [[Cryptosporidiosis]] (''[[Cryptosporidium]]'')
* [[Malaria]] (''[[Plasmodium]]'')
* [[Toxoplasmosis]] (''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'')

Most members have a complex life-cycle, involving both asexual and sexual reproduction.  Typically, a host is infected by ingesting cysts, which divide to produce ''[[sporozoite]]s'' that enter its cells.  Eventually, the cells burst, releasing ''[[merozoites]]'' which infect new cells.  This may occur several times, until ''gamonts'' are produced, forming gametes that fuse to create new cysts.  There are many variations on this basic pattern, however, and many Apicomplexa have more than one host.

The apical complex includes vesicles called rhoptries and micronemes, which open at the anterior of the cell.  These secrete enzymes that allow the parasite to enter other cells.  The tip is surrounded by a band of [[microtubule]]s, called the polar ring, and among the Conoidasida there is also a funnel of rods called the conoid.  Over the rest of the cell, except for a diminished mouth called the micropore, the membrane is supported by vesicles called alveoli, forming a semi-rigid pellicle.

The presence of alveoli and other traits place the Apicomplexa among a group called the [[alveolate]]s.  Several related flagellates, such as ''[[Perkinsus marinus|Perkinsus]]'' and ''Colpodella'' have structures similar to the polar ring and were formerly included here, but most appear to be closer relatives of the [[dinoflagellate]]s.  They are probably similar to the common ancestor of the two groups.

Another similarity is that apicomplexan cells contain a single [[plastid]], called the apicoplast, surrounded by either 3 or four membranes.  Its functions are thought to include tasks such as lipid synthesis, it appears to be necessary for survival.  They are generally considered to share a common origin with the chloroplasts of dinoflagellates, although some studies suggest they are ultimately derived from [[green alga|green]] rather than [[red algae]].

The Apicomplexa comprise the bulk of what used to be called the Sporozoa, a group for parasitic protozoans without flagella, pseudopods, or cilia. Most of the Apicomplexa are motile however.  The other main lines were the [[Ascetosporea]], the [[Myxozoa]] (now known to be derived from [[animal]]s), and the [[Microsporidia]] (now known to be derived from [[fungus|fungi]]).  Sometimes the name Sporozoa is taken as a synonym for the Apicomplexa, or occasionally as a subset.

:''This article was a former [[Wikipedia:Spanish Translation of the Week|Spanish Translation of the Week]]. Portions of the [[#Central region and las Pampas]] and [[#Northwest region]] sections still need to be translated.  The Spanish text has been commented out; to translate, simply click &quot;edit&quot; on the specific sections.  You can also help by copyediting and proofreading.''

Argentine cuisine has evolved distinctly from the rest of the Latin American culinary landscape because of the heavy influence of [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] and [[Spanish cuisine]]. These European traditions have been complemented by indigenous influences, most notably those of [[Andean]] origin (including [[Quechua]] and [[Mapuche]]) and those of Amazonic origin (such as the [[Guaraní]]).  The influx of Italian, Spanish and even some Near Eastern dishes makes the typical Argentine diet is a variation on what is often called the [[Mediterranean diet]].

Another determining factor in Argentine cuisine is that Argentina is one of the world's major food producers. It is a major producer of [[wheat]], beans, [[maize]] and corn, [[meat]] (especially [[beef]]), [[milk]] and, since the [[1970s]], [[soybean]]s. Given the country's vast production of beef, red meat is an exceedingly common part of the Argentine diet (in many periods of Argentine history the annual consumption of beef has been above 100 kg per capita  and during the 19th century, neared 180 kg per capita.) Similarly, the enormous quantities of domestically-harvested wheat have made white bread (made with wheat flour) the most commonly found on the table. This explains, to a great deal, the populariity of wheat-based Italian dishes, as well as the fact that Argentine pizza uses more dough than Italian pizza.

Besides the regional disparities addressed in this article, there exist at least two other comparisons which are important in understanding Argentine cuisine: the first distinguishes a cuisine that is essentially urban and cosmopolitan (highly influenced by the &quot;globalization&quot; of food and eating patterns) from a more traditional, idiosyncratic rural cuisine. The second comparison is made on the basis of socioeconomic differences.

While certain foods can be found in all corners of the country (barbecued meat; dulce de leche; empanadas; yerba mate,) one can map out four broad gastronomical regions based on major trends.


==Typical foods==
Argentines are famous for their high [[protein]] diet, particularly [[beef]]. Grilled meat (''parrilla'') from the ''[[asado]]'' is a staple, with [[steak]] and beef ribs especially common. ''[[Chorizo]]'', ''[[black pudding|morcilla]]'', ''[[chinchulines]]'', ''[[mollejas]]'', and other parts of the animal are enjoyed. In [[Patagonia]], lamb and [[chivito]] &amp;mdash; goat &amp;mdash; are eaten more than beef. Whole lambs and goats can be seen on the asado. ''[[Chimichurri]]'', a sauce of herbs and chili, is usually the only seasoning for steak and chorizo. 

[[Image:Spaghetti-prepared.jpg|right|200px|thumb|''Fideos'' and other Italian dishes are features of Argentine cuisine]]

Breaded and fried meat &amp;mdash; ''[[milanesa]]s'' &amp;mdash; are used as snacks, in sandwiches or eaten warm with mashed [[potato]]es &amp;mdash; ''puré''. ''[[Empanadas]]'' &amp;mdash; pastries of meat, cheese, sweet corn and a hundred other varieties &amp;mdash; are a common sight for parties, starters and [[picnic]]s across Argentina. Vegetables and salads are important too for Argentines, even beyond the fried or mashed potato. [[Tomato]]es, [[onions]], [[lettuce]], [[eggplant]]s, [[squash]]es and [[zucchini]] are common sides. 

Just as much as beef, [[Italy|Italian]] staples, such as [[pizza]] and ''[[al dente]]'' [[pasta]], are eaten. It is said that [[Buenos Aires]] has more pizzerias than [[Rome]]. ''[[noodles|Fideos]]'', ''[[Gnocchi|ñoquis]]'', ''[[Ravioli|ravioles]]'' and [[Cannelloni|canelones]] can be bought freshly-made on every block in [[Buenos Aires]]. Italian-style [[ice cream]] is made in huge parlours, with even drive-thru places offering hundreds of flavors to satisfy this national obsession.

In [[Chubut]], the Welsh community is known for their teahouses, with [[scones]] and ''Torta Galesa'', rather like [[Bara Brith]].

''Sandwiches de miga'' are delicate sandwiches made with crustless buttered white bread, very thinly sliced cured meat and cheese and leaf lettuce.  They are often purchased from entrepreneurial home cooks and consumed with a [[Cerveza Quilmes|Quilmes beer]] for a light evening meal.

[[Image:GEM corn.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Maize features in pre-Columbian Argentine cuisine]]

In the provinces, food is less European and more influenced by pre-Columbian and colonial traditions, with [[maize]], beans, [[pumpkin]]s and chilis making more appearances, whereas in Buenos Aires, even [[black pepper]] has been shunned. ''[[Locro]]'' is a spicy [[stew]] of white maize, often with pumpkin and [[sausage]]. ''Pucheros'' (stews) and ''cazuelas'' (casserikes) reflect a blend of [[Amerindian]] and Spanish cuisines.

The sweet paste, ''[[Dulce de leche]]'' is another national obsession, used to fill cakes and pancakes, spread over toasted bread for breakfast or as an ice cream flavour. ''[[Alfajor]]es'' are shortbread cookies sandwiched together with dulce de leche or a fruit paste.  The &quot;policeman's&quot; or &quot;truck driver's&quot; sweet is cheese with [[quince]] paste or ''dulce de membrillo''. ''Dulce de batata'' is made of [[sweet potato]] / [[yam (vegetable)|yam]]: this with cheese is the ''[[Martin Fierro]]'''s sweet. Fruits of Argentina are delicious, and their quinces, [[apple]]s, [[pear]]s, [[peach]]es, [[kiwifruit]]s, [[avocado]]s and [[plum]]s are major exports.

A traditional drink of Argentina is a tea-like drink called ''[[yerba mate]]'' or ''mate''.  The dried leaves and twigs are placed in a small cup, also called ''mate'', usually made from a gourd, but also bone or horn. The drink is sipped through a metal or cane straw called a ''bombilla''. ''Mate'' can be sweetened with sugar, or flavoured with aromatic herbs or dried orange peel, to hide its strong bitter flavour, although this a less traditional method, looked at unkindly by seasoned drinkers, as the added flavours may remain in the gourd and influence later ''mates''. Hot water is poured into the gourd at near-boiling point so as to not burn the herb and spoil the flavour. This action is called ''cebando el mate'', and is considered an important social ritual. At family or small social gatherings, one mate may be shared by the group, with the host preparing the mate to the preference of each guest.  When one guest is finished, the mate is returned to the host, who will then prepare a mate for another guest.  ''Mate cocido'' is the same leaf, which rather than brewed, is boiled and served, as coffee or tea, with milk or sugar to taste. Other typical drinks include [[wine]] (occasionally mixed with soda water); tea and coffee are equally important. 'Quilmes' is the national brand of [[lager]], named after the town [[Quilmes]] where it was first produced.

==Regional differences==
Although there exists an Argentine cuisine that is common to the whole country&amp;mdash;[[asado]]s (grilled meats), [[dulce de leche]] (a sweet caramel-like custard), [[empanadas]] and [[mate]]&amp;mdash;there is a cuisine that is specific to each of four regions of Argentina, which follow in order of population (2005):

===Central region and las Pampas===
This region comprises of the provinces of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]], part of [[Entre Ríos]], and all of the Autonomos City of [[Buenos Aires]].
This region of Argentina has received the greatest direct European influence, most visibly from [[Italy]] and [[Spain]]. It is also a crucial center of [[cattle]] production for Argentina and is thus the origin of the quintessentially Argentine dishes ''[[carne asada]]'' (roasted beef) and ''[[dulce de leche]]''.  It is here that red-meat-based foods are combined with white meat, dairy products and pasta, producing a high-[[protein]] [[diet (nutrition)|diet]].  

In addition to the aforementioned ''carne asada'' and ''dulce de leche'', other dishes that typify the region are ''milanesas'', or breaded meats. A common dish of this variety is the ''milanesa napolitana'' (the name comes from [[Naples]], [[Italy]]).  ''Milanesa napolitana'' is an Argentine innovation despite its name. In addition to roast beef, ''bifes'', and ''churrascos'', a visitor to the central region will find many dishes of Italian origin that have been incorporated into the Argentine cuisine and heavily modified from their original forms.

[[Pizza]] (locally pronounced ''pisa''), for example, has been wholly subsumed and in its Argentine form more closely resembles Italian [[calzone]]s than it does its Italian ancestor. Typical or exclusively Argentine pizzas include ''pizza canchera'', ''pizza rellena'' (stuffed pizza), ''pizza por metro'' (pizza by the meter), and ''pizza a la parrilla'' (grilled pizza). While Argentine pizza, derives from [[Naples|Neapolitan]] cuisine, the Argentine ''fugaza''/''fugazza'' comes from the ''focaccia xeneise'' ([[Genoa]]n), but in any case its preparation is different from its Italian counterpart, and the addition of cheese to make the dish (fugaza con queso or fugazzeta) is an Argentine invention.

Another Argentine invention is ''[[fainá]]'', a type of fugazza made with [[chickpea]]  flour (adopted from Spain).  During the [[20th century]], people in pizza shops in Buenos Aires, Rosario or Córdoba have commonly ordered a &quot;combo&quot; of ''moscato'', pizza, and ''fainá''. This is a large glass of a sweet wine called [[moscato]] ([[muscat]]), plus two triangular stacked pieces (the lower one being pizza and the upper one ''fainá'').

Nevertheless, the ''[[pasta]]s'' (pasta, always in the plural) surpass pizzas in consumption levels. Among them are ''tallarines'' ([[fettuccine]]), ''ravioles'' ([[ravioli]]), ''ñoquis'' ([[gnocchi]], and ''canelones'' ([[cannelloni]]).  They are usually cooked, served, and consumed in Argentine fashion, called ''al-uso-nostro'', a phrase of Italian origin. 

For example, it is common for pasta to be eaten together with white bread (&quot;French bread&quot;), which is unusual in Italy. This can be explained by the low cost of bread and the fact that Argentine pastas tend to come together with a large amount of ''tuco'' sauce (Italian ''suco'' &quot;juice&quot;), and accompanied by ''[[estofado]]'' (stew). Less commonly, pastas are eaten with a dressing of ''[[pesto]]'', a green sauce based on [[basil]], or ''salsa blanca'' ([[Béchamel sauce]]).

The ''sorrentinos'' are also a local dish with a misleading name (they do not come from [[Sorrento]], but were invented in [[Mar del Plata]]). They look like big round ''ravioles'' stuffed with [[mozzarella]], [[cottage cheese]] and [[basil]] in [[tomato sauce]]. 

''[[Polenta]]'' comes from northern Italy and is very common throughout Argentina. But unlike in Italy, this [[cornmeal]] is eaten as a main dish, with sauce and melted cheese.

Spanish influences are abundant: desserts like the ''[[churros]]'' (cylinders of pastry, usually fried, sometimes filled with [[dulce de leche]]), [[''flan'']], 
''ensaimadas'' ([[Catalan]] sweet bread), and ''[[alfajor]]es'' are all descended from Spain. Main dishes such as the ''[[Spanish tortilla|tortillas]]'' ([[omelet]]s of egg, onion and potato, and having no relation to the Mexican dish of the same name), nearly all kinds of stew, ''arroces'' (rice dishes such as [[paella]]), and ''fabada'' ([[Asturian]] bean stew).  All of the ''[[guiso]]s'' and ''[[puchero]]s'' ([[stew]]s) are of Spanish origin. Argentine preparations of fish, such as dried salt [[cod]] (''[[Bacalhau|bacalao]]''), calamari, and octopus, originate from the [[Basque]] and [[Galician]] regions.  

''[[Empanada]]s'', though typically South American, have a [[Moorish]] origin (they derived from the [[Southwest Asia|Near-Eastern]] ''lahmayim'' and ''[[fatay]]''), and they can be also traced to the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]n empanada and to certain stuffed ''[[calzoni]]''.

Germanic influence is comparatively small, but appears remarkable in the field of sweet dishes. The pastries known as ''facturas'' are Germanic in origin: [[croissant]]s, known as ''medialunas'', are the most popular of these, and can be found in two varieties: butter- and lard-based.  Also German in origin are the &quot;Berlinese&quot; known as ''bolas de fraile'' (&quot;friar's balls&quot;), and the rolls called ''piononos''. The ''facturas'' were re-christened with local names given the difficult phonology of German, and usually Argentinized by the addition of a dulce of leche filling.

Most dishes of the Central/Pampean region are urban, often requiring a gas [[oven]] of a type not found in the countryside. This is not strange considering that more than 80% of the [[demographics of Argentina|Argentine population]] is concentrated in the main cities of this region ([[Buenos Aires City|Buenos Aires]], [[Rosario]], [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], etc.). Not much is left of the ''gaucho'' food, except ''asado'', ''dulce de leche'', ''mate'' (the yerba mate infusion), ''tortas fritas'', and ''arroz con leche'' ([[rice pudding]]).

The scene was different until the first half of the 19th century.  [[Lucio V. Mansilla]] in his ''Memoriaebsite]

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:M113.jpg|thumb|right|The [[M113]], one of the most common tracked APCs, on duty during the [[Vietnam War]].]]

'''Armoured personnel carriers''' (APCs) are light [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s for the transport of [[infantry]].  They usually have only a [[machine gun]] although variants carry [[recoilless rifle]]s, [[anti-tank guided missile]]s (ATGMs), or [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s.  They are not really designed to take part in a direct-fire battle, but to carry the troops to the battlefield safe from [[shrapnel]] and [[ambush]]. They may have [[wheel]]s or [[Caterpillar track|tracks]]. Examples include the American [[M113]] (tracked), the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[FV 432 AFV|FV 432]] (tracked), the [[France|French]] [[Véhicule de l'Avant Blindé|VAB]] (wheeled), the [[Germany|German]] [[Boxer MRAV]] (wheeled) and the Soviet [[BTR-60 |BTR]] (wheeled).

==History==
[[Image:Bt7 6.jpg|thumb|right|Before the advent of APCs, some forces practised very dangerous [[tank desant]] tactics]]

During [[World War I]], when the [[tank]] was developed, the British [[Mark I (tank)|Mark V]] tank was designed with a small passenger compartment to carry troops.  By some definitions this can be considered the first armoured personnel carrier.  The first specialised APC was the [[Mark IX tank|Mark IX]] of [[1918]].

Often, APCs were simply armoured cars with the capacity for carrying troops, but they evolved into purpose-built vehicles to suit the demands of motorised warfare from [[World War II]]. 

In [[1944]], the commander of [[2nd Canadian Corps]], General [[Guy Simonds]], ordered the conversion of 72 [[United States|US]]-produced [[M7 Priest]] self-propelled [[howitzer]]s to personnel carriers.  They were due for replacement anyway, as the howitzer barrels were worn out.  The howitzer was removed, and the resulting hole was plugged with whatever steel was available.  The vehicle was called [[Kangaroo (armoured personnel carrier)|Kangaroo]], after the workshop which did the conversion. Later in the war Canadian-built [[Ram tank|Ram]] tanks were used as a basis for the majority of conversions, as they were then obsolete and the original Kangaroos were worn out.

After the war different specialised APCs were developed.  The United States developed a series of tracked vehicles, culminating in the M113 &quot;box on tracks&quot;, of which 80,000 were made.  The [[Soviet Union]] developed the wartime [[BTR-40]] into a series of 8-wheeled APC.

At the end of the [[1980s]], [[Israel]] converted captured [[T-55]] tanks to APCs, reminiscent of WWII conversions.  The result is one of the best protected APCs in the world, called [[IDF Achzarit]].

==Technology==
[[Image:VAB armoured personnel carrier DSC00846.jpg|right|thumb|A French VAB, one of the most common wheeled APCs]]

Most armoured personnel carriers use a [[diesel engine]] comparable to that used in a large [[truck]] or in a typical city [[bus]] (APCs are often known to troops as 'Battle Taxis' or 'Battle Buses').  The M113 for instance used the same engine as the standard [[General Motors]] urban bus.  A single M113 moving at top speed generates as much noise as a General Motors urban bus moving at top speed.  However, the typical armoured personnel carrier can carry only six to ten soldiers while a typical urban bus can carry thirty to fifty seated passengers, and hundreds when standing passengers are included.

Most APCs are amphibious.  Usually tracked APCs are powered by their tracks in the water, and wheeled APCs have propellors or [[water jet]]s.  Preparations for amphibious operations usually comprises checking the integrity of the hull and folding down a trim wane in front.  Swimming required fairly still waters, and good entry and exit points.  Speed in water is typically 3-6 km/h.

Armour on APCs are usually simple steel or [[aluminium]] armour, sufficient for protection against small arms fire and most shell fragments.  Just about any type of anti-tank weapon can defeat the armour of an APC.

The usual armament for an APC is a 12.7 (.50) or 14.5 mm heavy [[machine gun]].  This is mounted on top of the vehicle, either on a simple [[pintle mount]], sometimes with a gun shield, or a small turret.  Sometimes an automatic [[grenade launcher]] is used instead.

==The APC in action==
[[Image:BTR-80 and Bradley.jpg|right|thumb|APC vs. IFV: [[United States|US]] [[M2 Bradley]] IFV on the left and [[Russia|Russian]] [[BTR-80]] APC on the right]]
[[Image:Stryker deployment.jpg|right|thumb|US infantrymen de-bussing from a [[Stryker]] wheeled APC.  Note the lowered ramp for easy access.]]

[[Romania]]n Transporter Auto Blindat APCs that made infamous front-line news in 1989 were mostly eight-wheeled, massive Romanian clones of the Soviet [[BTR-60]] APC. Soldiers hated this machine, with uncomfortable access from above and heavy latches that seemed designed to snap one's fingers off. Limited visibility and clumsy manoeuvrability in an urban environment might have contributed (along with bad will, of course) to the numbers of deaths through crushing during the [[Romanian Revolution]].

The idea of the APC has arrived in the modern era to become the [[IFV]], from which troops can fight, firing their weapons from ports in the vehicle, instead of just being transported by it; examples being the US [[M2 Bradley]] or Russian [[BMP-1|BMP]] series. 

Actual combat experience has however shown that infantry cannot fight effectively from their vehicle and a mounted attack is practically suicidal. As a result, most infantry vehicles no longer have firing ports; most of those on the M2 Bradley for example have been covered over by additional armour protection. They have been omitted completely from newer designs. As a result the main distinction between an APC and IFV is now simply that an IFV mounts an automatic cannon of 20-40mm calibre for heavier fire support and anti armour capability, while an APC is armed only with machine guns. 

Many APC designs have been converted to IFVs by the addition of such an automatic cannon, and many chassis’s are produced in both machine gun and grenade launcher armed APC and cannon armed IFV form. The reason for doing this may be cost, or the need for more interior space on some vehicles, as automatic cannon and their ammunition supply may reduce the number of infantry that can be carried.

      <comment>/* World War II */ some minor additions and rephrasing; and BTW SU-85 was a tank destroyer, not an assault gun</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''assault gun''' is a [[gun]] or [[howitzer]] mounted on a motor vehicle or armored chassis, designed for use in the [[direct fire]] role in support of [[infantry]] when attacking other infantry or fortified positions.

Historically the custom-built fully armored assault guns usually mounted the gun or howitzer in a fully enclosed casemate on a tank chassis. The use of a casemate instead of a turret limited these weapons' field of fire, but provided a simpler construction that was cheaper to build and less prone to mechanical breakdowns. The increased space and reduced weight of the turretless design also allowed mounting a larger weapon and providing heavier frontal armor on any given chassis, and in most cases these turretless vehicles also presented a lower profile as a target for the enemy.

==History==

===World War II===
[[Image:KW-2 1940.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Soviet [[KV-2]] &quot;Heavy Assault Tank&quot; was really an assault gun, 1940.]]

Assault guns were primarily used during [[World War II]], in the hands of the [[Germany|Germans]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviets]]. Early in the war the Germans began to create makeshift assault guns by mounting their infantry support weapons on the bed of a truck or on obsolete [[tank]]s with the turret removed. Later in the war both the Germans and the Soviets introduced fully armored purpose-built assault guns into their arsenals.

Early on the Soviets built the KV-2, a variant of the [[KV-1]] heavy tank with a short-barreled 152mm howitzer mounted in an oversized turret. They later produced a very successful series of increasingly powerful turretless assault guns on the KV, the [[SU-76]], [[SU-122]], and the heavy [[SU-152]], which were followed by the [[ISU-122]] and [[ISU-152]] on the newer [[Iosif Stalin tank|IS]] heavy tank chassis.

[[Image:StugIII at Kursk.jpg|thumb|right|250px|German [[StuG III]] with high-velocity 75mm gun, 1943.]]

The primary German assault gun was the [[Sturmgeschütz III]] (StuG III). Armed with a high-velocity dual-purpose 75mm gun, late production StuG III variants blurred the line between assault guns and [[tank destroyer]]s. The Germans also built a number of other fully armored turretless assault guns, including the [[StuG IV]], [[Sturmgeschütz_III#Variants|StuH 42]], [[Brummbär]], [[Sturmtiger]]. The latter two were very heavy vehicles, built only in small quantities.

Battalions of assault guns, usually StuG IIIs, commonly replaced the intended panzer battalion in the German [[Panzergrenadier|panzergrenadier divisions]] due to the chronic shortage of tanks, and were sometimes used as makeshifts even in the [[panzer division]]s. Independent battalions were also deployed as 'stiffeners' for infantry divisions, and the StuG III's anti-tank capabilities contributed much to the German's ability to draw out the war long after they had lost the strategic initiative.

=== Postwar use ===

In the post-[[World War II|WWII]] era a second use was envisioned for the assault gun, as a light-weight air-deployable direct fire weapon for use with airborne troops. Current weapons were either based on [[jeep]]s or small [[Caterpillar track|tracked]] vehicles and the airborne troops thus always fought at a distinct disadvantage in terms of heavy weapons.

The US was the first to build an assault gun in this category, the 152mm armed [[M551 Sheridan]]. The Sheridan's gun was a low-velocity weapon suitable in the assault role, but with the addition of the [[Shillelagh missile]] could double in the anti-tank role as well. The Sheridan was generally considered a failure however, and largely detested by its crews.

An attempt to address the Sheridan's problems and provide the airborne divisions with a modern weapon system developed into the [[M8 Armored Gun System]] (or ''AGS''). However the AGS was continually stung with budget cuts and program changes, and was never produced. Instead a wheeled vehicle based on the standard LAV III wheeled chassis is being deployed with the 105mm gun as the [[Stryker]], with similar characteristics as the [[Centauro]] Wheeled Tank Destroyer of the [[Italian army|Italian Army]] and the French [[AMX 10 RC]].

Another country to 'retry' the assault gun after [[World War II]] was Sweden with the [[Stridsvagn_103|Stridsvagn 103]], developped in the 50's. After minor modifications, it came into service in 1966 and was used untill phased it in 1997 with the arrival of the [[Leopard II]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A self-propelled anti-tank gun, or '''tank destroyer''', is a type of [[armoured fighting vehicle]].  Tank destroyers are used primarily to provide [[antitank]] support for [[infantry]] or [[tank]] units, in [[defence (military) | defensive]] or [[withdrawal (military) |withdrawal]] operations. They may mount a high-velocity anti-tank gun or sometimes an [[antitank guided missile]] launcher, or ATGM.

Tank destroyers cannot fulfil the many roles of tanks; they are much less flexible, and usually lack a strong anti-infantry capability.  But they are much less expensive to manufacture, maintain, and resupply than tanks.

Gun-armed tank destroyers have been largely supplanted by the more general-purpose tanks since Second World War, but lightly-armoured ATGM carriers are used for supplementary long-range antitank capabilities.

== World War II ==

[[Image:ISU-122 skos RB.jpg|thumb|350px|Soviet [[ISU-122]] tank destroyer with Polish Army markings]]

Dedicated antitank vehicles made their first major appearance in [[the Second World War]], as combatants developed effective armoured vehicles and tactics.

These tank destroyers fell broadly into two categories. Some were designed to be faster and cheaper than medium tanks while still able to destroy heavy armour at long range. Some of these designs were clearly expedients rushed into production. The second design strategy was to create heavily-armoured vehicles that were more effective tank destroyers than enemy tanks.

[[Nazi Germany|German]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] designs mounted anti-tank guns, with limited traverse in turretless hulls.  The results were smaller, lighter, and simpler to build than tanks, but could carry larger guns.   This design methodology was used by both forces to provide heavier anti-tank capability at lower cost, during the rapid up-armoring of all AFVs that took place during the war.

For instance, the German [[Panzer I]] light tank was obsolete before the war even started, with thin armor and only machine guns for armament. Yet it was forced into battle during the invasion of [[Poland]], where it was found to be a death trap. Before the invasion of [[France]], 202 were rebuilt as [[Panzerjäger I]] self-propelled 47mm anti-tank guns. Soon the same sort of thing happened to [[Panzer II]] tanks during [[Operation Barbarossa]]: captured Soviet 76.2mm anti-tank guns were mounted on [[Panzer II]] chassis, producing [[Marder II]] anti-tank guns. The most common mounting was a German 75mm antitiank gun on the Czech [[Panzer 38(t)]] chassis to produce the [[Marder III]]. 

Whereas the [[Panzerjäger]]s (&quot;tank hunters&quot;) were based on the rebuilt chassis of obsolescent tanks, dedicated [[Jagdpanzer]] (&quot;hunting tank&quot;) versions of tanks were developed later in the war.  The [[Jagdpanther]] on the [[Panther tank]]'s chassis is considered the best of the Jagdpanzers. This vehicle mounted the L/71 version of the [[88mm gun]] on a reliable, highly mobile, well-armored chassis. The Soviets produced the 85mm [[SU-85]] and 100mm [[SU-100]] self-propelled guns based on the same chassis as the [[T-34]] medium tank, as well as the 122mm [[ISU-122]] and 152mm [[ISU-152]] which shared components with the [[IS-2]] heavy tank.  In 1943, the Soviets also shifted all production of light tanks like the [[T-70]] to much simpler and better-armed [[SU-76]] self-propelled guns, which used the same drive train.

The Germans became side-tracked into production of large numbers of tank-destroyers because they could be produced more cheaply than full tanks.   

=== US Army tank destroyer doctrine ===

[[U.S.]] and derivative [[United Kingdom|British]] designs were very different in conception. U.S. doctrine was based on the need to defeat German [[blitzkrieg]] tactics. U.S. units expected to be faced with large numbers of German tanks attacking on relatively narrow fronts. In actual practice, such attacks rarely happened. In pre–Second World War planning, U.S. tanks were not intended to fight enemy tanks directly. Instead they were dedicated to the roles of infantry support and exploitation in a fast moving battle. In order to deal with the enemy tanks U.S. forces would instead rely on separate tank destroyer units, which could deal with armor at long range.

The U.S. tank destroyer designs were intended to be very mobile and heavily armed. Most retained a turret, but left it open on top both to save weight and to accommodate a larger gun. The earliest expedient design was an [[M3 Half-track|M3 half-track]] mounting an M1897 75mm gun in a limited-traverse mount. The larger guns required a counterweight at rear of the turret, which can be seen on designs like the 3-inch gun [[M10 Wolverine]] and the 90 mm gun [[M36 Jackson]]. The [[M18 Hellcat|M18]] came closer to the U.S. ideal; the vehicle was very fast, small, and mounted a 76mm gun in a turret. The open top made these particularly vulnerable to artillery, air, and infantry assault, and the very idea of independent anti-tank groups was found unworkable. 

By [[1944]], a number of the &quot;basic&quot; [[Sherman tank|Sherman]]s in British use were being converted to [[Sherman Fireflies]] by adding [[17 pounder]] guns—giving each platoon of Shermans a dedicated anti-tank gun. In British service, 17-pounders were also mounted M10 Wolverine (&quot;Achilles&quot;) and [[Archer (tank destroyer)|Archer]] tank destroyers in the [[Comet tank|Comet]], the [[Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger|Challenger]] and the experimental [[Black Prince (tank)|Black Prince]] tanks.

Virtually every U.S. Infantry Division had an attached battalion of tank destroyers, and frequently also a tank battalion. In practice the two types of units were used interchangeably. In effect, the U.S. Army had a mix of vehicles that were either under-armed (the tanks) or under-armored (the tank destroyers). At the end of the war, the arrival of the more balanced [[M26 Pershing]] heavy tank design showed that the lesson had been learnt.

== Post–World War II development ==

In the face of the Warsaw Pact, a general need for extra firepower was identified. In the 1950s, the UK produced the Charioteer to beef up the tank regiments, mounting a 20 pounder gun in an oversize turret on the Cromwell tank hull - it lacked the all round capability of the Centurion tank.

With the development of flexible ATGMs which can be installed on almost any vehicle in the [[1960s]], the concept of the tank destroyer has waned.  
With the weight of main battle tanks growing to the forty to seventy-tonne range, airborne forces were unable to deploy reasonable antitank forces. The result was a number of attempts to make a light vehicle, including the conventional [[ASU-85]], the recoilless rifle–armed [[Ontos]], and missile-armed [[Malkara missile#FV1620 Humber Hornet|Hornet Malkara]] armoured car and [[M551 Sheridan|Sheridan]] light tank.

==Modern tank destroyers==
Many forces' [[IFV]]s carry ATGMs in every infantry platoon, and attack [[helicopter]]s have also added antitank capability to the modern battlefield.  But there are still dedicated antitank vehicles with very heavy long-range missiles, and ones intended for airborne use. 

[[Image:NM142 x 3.jpg|thumb|250px|A Norwegian antitank platoon equipped with [[NM142]] TOW missile launchers]]

There have also been dedicated antitank vehicles built on ordinary [[armoured personnel carrier]] or [[armoured car]] chassis. Examples include the U.S. M901 &quot;Improved TOW Vehicle&quot; and the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[NM142]], both on an [[M113]] chassis, several [[Soviet]] ATGM launchers based on the [[BRDM]] reconnaissance car, and the [[Germany|German]] [[Raketenjagdpanzer]] series built on the chassis of the [[HS 30]] and [[Marder (IFV)|Marder]] IFV.

A [[United States Army|US Army]] mechanized infantry battalion has four infantry companies with TOW missile–armed [[M2 Bradley |Bradley IFVs]] and can bring a large concentration of accurate and lethal fire to bear on an attacking enemy unit that uses AFVs.

Some gun-armed tank destroyers continue to be used.  The German army had specialized [[Kanonenjagdpanzer]], similar in design to the WWII tank destroyers, from the mid-1960s until the 1980s.  [[China]] has developed the [[PTL02]] tank destroyer. This wheeled assault tank destroyer armed with a 100mm rifled gun was developed by NORINCO for the PLA new light (rapid reaction) mechanised infantry divisions. The vehicle has a three-man turret derived from the [[Type 96  |Type 88]] MBT, and a 6×6 wheeled chassis based on the [[WZ551]] APC.

A military '''armoured car''' is a type of [[armoured fighting vehicle]] having [[wheel]]s (from four to eight large off-road wheels) instead of [[Caterpillar track|tracks]], and usually light [[vehicle armour|armor]]. Armoured cars are typically inexpensive and have superior speed and range compared to more heavily armoured military vehicles.  Their normal use is for [[reconnaissance]], command, control, and communications (liaison between forward units). They may have a [[machine gun]], an [[autocannon]], a small gun, or may even be unarmed.

At the beginning of the twentieth century a number of military armoured vehicles were manufactured by adding armour and weapons to existing vehicles: [[tractor|armoured tractors]], armoured cars, and [[armoured train]]s are known.  Most of the early designs were a large car chassis to which an body made of steel plates had been added.  A spectacularly impractical early armoured ‘car’ was the [[Russia]]n [[Tsar Tank]] of 1915, a sort of tricycle with nine-metre wheels.

Armoured cars have their use in peacekeeping or internal security duties where their appearance is less confrontational or threatening than tanks, their size and mobility fits better with an urban environment with good roads.

==Civilian armoured cars==
Civilian '''armoured cars''' are modified versions of normal cars, made by replacing the windows with [[bulletproof glass]] and inserting layers of armour under the outer skin of the car, a labor-intensive process that takes a few weeks and costs about $100,000 in the U.S. There is typically no apparent external difference between a non-armoured and armoured version of the same car, in order to not look conspicuous. In most cases [[aramid]] [[composite material|composite]] and ballistic [[steel]] plates are used and the increased mass is offset by a souped-up engine and brakes, as [[composite armour]] is considerably more expensive. The cars may also be equipped for their role: with a [[fire extinguisher]], rims in the wheels allowing to drive on empty tires for typically 15 to 50 km, an explosion-resistant fuel tank, remote starting of the car, pressure and temperature control of the tires, a siren or alarm, and an intercom between the exterior and interior of the car. Sometimes they can also be sealed air-tight from inside, and carry an oxygen bottle, to protect against gas attacks (tear gas, etc).

Armoured cars are in common use by people who feel at risk and can afford them, for example politicians, enterpreneurs, ambassadors, or in higher-risk areas including Colombia, Iraq, Moscow, and Washington DC. They are very popular in [[Mexico City]] due to the level of violence there. Armoured cars can also help protect the passengers in a [[car accident]].

Civilian armoured cars can be divided into two types:

# [[automobile|cars]] or [[truck]]s used in [[transport]]ing valuables, such as large quantities of money which are armored and equipped to resist attempts at [[highway]] [[robbery]] or the [[hijacking]] of the cargo. They may be manned with armed guards but do not mount weapons. Armoured cars are usually operated by [[security]] firms, which provide secure transport for clients' property.
# Armoured versions of cars or [[Sport utility vehicle|SUVs]] used as protection from crime or violence either by individuals who fear they may become victims, or in high risk environments. Diplomatic missions typically use armoured cars as standard vehicles, and many manufacturers or after market firms offer armoured versions of their vehicles. They are typically indistinguishable from the regular version on casual inspection from a distance.

A '''self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon''' (SPAA, also ''self-propelled air defense'', SPAD) is an [[anti-aircraft]] gun or missile mounted on a vehicle [[chassis]].  

Specific weapon systems include [[machine gun]]s, [[autocannon]], larger guns, or [[missile]]s, and some mount both guns and longer-ranged missiles.  The vehicle mount may be based on a [[truck]].  Weapons meant for deployment in the forward battle area may be mounted on [[armoured fighting vehicles]], such as an [[armoured personnel carrier|APC]] or [[tank]], for protection from aircraft, artillery, and small arms fire.  

Anti-aircraft guns are usually mounted in a quickly-traversing [[turret]] with a high range of elevation, for tracking fast-moving aircraft.  They are often in dual or quadruple mounts, allowing a high rate of fire.  The concept was pioneered mainly by [[Germany]] during [[World War II]], with their [[flakpanzer]] series.  Today, [[missile]]s have largely replaced medium and heavy antiaircraft guns.

The [[Russian language|Russian]] equivalent of ''SPAAG'' is ''ZSU'', for ''zenitnaya samokhodnaya ustanovka'', (&quot;anti-aircraft self-propelled mount&quot;).

German WWII self-propelled anti-aircraft guns include [[Möbelwagen]], [[Wirbelwind]], [[Ostwind]], [[Kugelblitz]], ''Coelian''.  Modern weapons include the [[Russia|Russian]] [[ZSU-23-4 Shilka]], [[China|Chinese]] [[Type 88 SPAAG]], [[United States|American]] [[M163 VADS]], German [[Flugabwehrkanonenpanzer Gepard|Gepard]] and similar versions with the British Marksman turret (which was also adapted for a number of other users), [[Italy|Italian]] [[SIDAM-25]] and [[Otomatic]] and versions of the [[France|French]] [[AMX-13]]. Older post-war examples include the [[ZSU-57-2]], the failed [[M247 Sergeant York]], [[M16 Quad Fifty]] and [[M42 40 mm Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Gun|M42 Duster]].

Other examples include:
* [[ZSU-23-4 Shilka]], Soviet Union
* [[Gepard]], Germany
* [[PZA Loara]], Poland

'''AZ Alkmaar''' is a [[Football (soccer)|football]] club from [[Alkmaar]], [[the Netherlands]]. It was founded on [[May 10]], [[1967]] as '''AZ '67''', the result of a merger of ''Alkmaar '54'' and ''FC Zaanstreek''. In the Netherlands the club is known as just ''AZ'', but in Europe ''Alkmaar'' is often added. However, very few people outside the Netherlands know the meaning of AZ and it might be better to call the club ''Alkmaar Zaanstreek'' and not ''AZ Alkmaar''.

Owing to the commitment of businessmen Cees and Klaas Molenaar, AZ '67 was successful in the late seventies and early eighties. In 1981 they became Dutch champions and UEFA Cup finalists. After the Molenaar brothers left the club, things went downhill. In 1988 AZ were relegated from the &quot;Eredivisie&quot; (Dutch premier league).

The involvement of businessman [[Dick Scheringa]] in the late nineties marked the revival of the club. AZ returned to the Eredivisie in 1998. In 2004-05 they reappeared in the UEFA Cup tournament, advancing to the semifinals. They also finished third in the Eredivisie that season, again qualifying for the UEFA Cup, after spending most of the season in the top two spots. That is a remarkable achievement, since AZ is not a very big club and it does not have a very large fanbase, even by Dutch standards. AZ's home ground is the [[Alkmaarder Hout]] which has a spectator capacity of 8390. AZ is the only club in the Dutch top flight that does not yet play in a new or renovated stadium. The Alkmaarderhout is an old but very romantic stadium and a reminder of times long gone. It is however not appropiate for a club that has managed to become a force to be reckoned with in recent years, both in the Netherlands and in Europe. The average attendance in 2004/05 was 8,300, but in the summer of 2006 the club will finally move to a new 13,500 (or 16,000) capacity stadium which, due to a much larger demand than expected, will probably be expanded to 30,000 in 2008 by adding a second tier.

The club manager is [[Louis van Gaal]], who succeeded [[Co Adriaanse]] after the 2004-05 season. One of the starting eleven of the team were locally born in [[Alkmaar]]. This season the team is performing very well, and some people even think they might reach the [[Champions League]] next season.

'''Antoni Gaudí i Cornet''' ([[25 June]] [[1852]] – [[10 June]] [[1926]]) was a [[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[architecture|architect]] famous for his unique style and highly individualistic designs.

==Gaudí's Life==
===Birth and childhood=== &lt;font color=FF3399&gt; &amp;hearts; elh &lt;/font color=FF3399&gt;
Gaudí was born in [[Tarragona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]], in [[1852]] though no one knows exactly where. While many believe his birthplace to be the town of [[Reus]], others claim it was in fact [[Riudoms]].{{ref|birth}} It is known, however, that he was [[baptism|baptized]] in Reus a day after his birth. The artist's parents, Francesc Gaudí Serra and Antonia Cornet Bertran, both came from families of metalsmiths.

Gaudí, the youngest of five, found himself unable to play with friends his age because of [[rheumatism]]. Being in such pain, he was rarely able to walk on foot and was forced to ride a donkey when he wanted to go anywhere outside his home. That he remained close to home allowed him substantial free time to observe [[nature]] and its design.{{ref|rheumatism}} It has been hypothesized that it was this exposure to nature at an early age that began to hone two of his greatest qualities: observation and the analysis of nature.{{ref|observe-nature}}

===Early education===
At a young age, Gaudí entered a [[nursery school]] (''parvulari'') under the instruction of Francesc Berenguer, and his imaginative qualities began to manifest themselves: when Berenguer lectured the child on how wings let birds fly, Gaudí observed that chickens do not fly. He concluded that their wings must help them run faster.{{ref|chickens}}

When the time came for his formal education, Gaudí enrolled in the Collegi de les Escoles Píes de Reus, where he soon became fast friends with Eduard Toda and Josep Ribera. It was perhaps their insatiable curiosity that drove them to learn all they could about the intricacies of nature.{{ref|school-1}}

During his time at Les Escoles, Gaudí did not make the best of grades, though he proved to be an abstract thinker. He did, however, see remarkable improvement in the area of [[geometry]], a subject which fascinated him. This fascination would carry through with him until his death. Its first major effect on his life was his choice of career.

===Higher education===
As an [[architecture]] student at the Escola Tècnica Superior d'Arquitectura in [[Barcelona]] from [[1873]] to [[1877]], Gaudí continued to achieve mediocre grades but did well in the &quot;Trial drawings and Projects&quot; course.  {{ref|arch-grades}}

He would remain affiliated with the Escola Tècnica Superior d'Arquitectura his entire life. Awarded the title of Architect by the school in [[1878]], Gaudí immediately began to plan and design. When Elies Rogent signed the title, he declared, &quot;I have either found a lunatic or a genius.&quot;{{ref|lunatic}}

===Interests===
Gaudí, throughout his life, was fascinated by nature. He studied nature's angles and curves and incorporated them into his designs. Instead of relying on geometric shapes, he mimicked the way trees and humans grow and stand upright. The [[hyperboloid|hyperboloids]]  and [[paraboloid|paraboloids]] he borrowed from nature were easily reinforced by steel rods. He didn't limit his use of natural structures to support, however, and most of his designs resemble elements from the environment.

Because of his rheumatism, the artist observed a strict vegetarian diet, used [[homeopathy|homeopathic]] drug therapy, underwent water therapy, and hiked regularly. Long walks, besides suppressing his rheumatism, further allowed him to experience nature.
&lt;!-- 
To be finished before published: 
===Early career===
The first of Gaudí's major successes was, ironically, a failure in the his eyes. He was commissioned to design and build housing for the workers of La Cooperativa Mataronense, a factory in Barcelona. Although he only completed a single section of the factory, along with a kiosk, his work was recognized at the World Fair in Paris, giving him a name in the architecture world. It was at the World Fair that he first met Eusebi Güell.{{ref|met-Guell}}

--&gt;

===Later years===
[[Image:Casamila.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Casa Milà]], in the [[Eixample]], [[Barcelona]].]]

Gaudí was an ardent Catholic and a fervent [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan nationalist]]. (He was once arrested for speaking in Catalan in a situation deemed illegal by authorities.) In his later years, he abandoned secular work and devoted his life to Catholicism and his ''[[Sagrada Família]]''. In the early twentieth century, Gaudí's closest family and friends began to die; his works slowed to a halt; and his attitude changed. Perhaps one of his closest family members – his niece Rosa Egea – passed away in [[1912]], only to be followed by a &quot;faithful collaborator, Francesc Berenguer Mestres&quot; two years later. After both tragedies, Barcelona fell on hard times, economically. The construction of ''La Sagrada Família'' slowed; the construction of ''La Colonia Güell'' ceased altogether. Four years later, Eusebi Güell died.{{ref|slowdown}} 

Perhaps it was because of this unfortunate sequence of events that Gaudí changed. He became reluctant to talk with reporters or have his picture taken and solely concentrated on his masterpiece, ''La Sagrada Familia''.{{ref|focus-sagrada}}

On [[June 7]] [[1926]], Antoni Gaudí was run over by a [[tram]]. Because of his ragged attire and empty pockets, multiple cab drivers refused to pick him up for fear that he would be unable to pay the fare. He was eventually taken to a pauper's hospital in Barcelona. Nobody recognized the injured Gaudí until some friends found him at the poor hospital the next day. When they tried to move him into a nicer hospital, Gaudí refused, reportedly saying &quot;I belong here among the ghetto.&quot; He died two days later, half of Barcelona mourning his death. It was, perhaps, fitting that he was buried in the midst of his unfinished masterpiece, ''La Sagrada Família''.{{ref|death}}

==Artistic style==
[[Image:Sagradafamilia-overview.jpg|thumb|right|Gaudí's unfinished masterpiece, ''[[La Sagrada Familia|Sagrada Família]]'']]

Gaudí's first works were designed in the style of [[gothic architecture|gothic]] and traditional Catalan architectural modes, but he soon developed his own distinct sculptural style. French architect [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]], who promoted an evolved form of gothic architecture, proved a major influence on Gaudí. But the student surpassed the master architect and contrived highly original designs – irregular and fantastically intricate. Some of his greatest works, most notably ''La Sagrada Família'', have an almost hallucinatory power.

He integrated the [[parabolic arch]], nature's organic shapes, and the fluidity of water into his architecture. While designing buildings, he observed the forces of [[gravity]] and related [[catenary]] principles. (He designed many of his arches upside down by hanging various weights on interconnected strings, using gravity to calculate catenaries for a natural curved arch.) Using the Catalan ''[[trencadís]]'' technique, Gaudí often decorated surfaces with broken tiles.

The architect's work has been categorized as [[Art Nouveau]] architecture, a precursor to [[modern architecture]]. But his adoption of biomorphic shapes rather than orthogonal lines put him in a category unto himself (in Latin, ''[[sui generis]]''). His style was later echoed by that of Austrian architect [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]] (1928&amp;ndash;2000).

Though hailed as a genius, some hypothesize that Gaudí was [[color blindness|color blind]] and that it was only in collaboration with [[Josep Maria Jujol]] – an architect twenty seven years his junior whom he acknowledged as a genius in his own right – that he produced his greatest works.

==Popularity==
Gaudí's originality was at first ridiculed by his peers. Indeed, he was first only supported by the rich industrialist [[Eusebi Güell]]. His fellow citizens referred to the ''Casa Milà'' as ''La Pedrera'' (&quot;the quarry&quot;), and [[George Orwell]], who stayed at Barcelona during the [[Spanish Civil War]], admittedly loathed his work. As time passed, though, his work became more famous, up to the point that he is now considered one of [[List of Catalan people|Catalonia's best and brightest]].

==Social and political influences==
The opportunities afforded by Catalonia's socioeconomic and political environments were endless. Catalonians such as Antonio Gaudí often showcased the region's diverse art techniques in their works. By mimicking nature, such artists symbolically pushed back the province's ever-increasing industrial society. Gaudí, among others, promoted the Catalan nationalist movement by incorporating elements of Catalan culture in his designs.

==Major works==
[[Image:Parcguell.jpg|thumb|right|View of the [[Park Guell|Park Güell]], [[El Carmel]], [[Barcelona]].]]

* ''[[Casa Vicens]]'' (1878-1880)
* ''[[Palau Güell]]'' (1885-1889)
* ''[[College of the Teresianas]]'' (1888-1890)
* ''Crypt of the [[Church of Colònia Güell]]'' (1898-1916)
* ''[[Casa Calvet|Casa Calvet]]'' (1899-1904)
* ''[[Casa Batlló]]'' (1905-1907)
* ''[[Casa Milà]]'' (''La Pedrera'') (1905-1907)
* ''[[Park Guell|Park Güell]]'' (1900-1914)
* ''[[Sagrada Familia|Sagrada Família]]'' (1884-1926)

Many of these works can be found in the [[Eixample]] district of Barcelona. Eight are [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]]  [[World Heritage Sites]]. Park Güell, Palau Güell, and Casa Milà have been heritage sites since 1984. The other five &amp;ndash; the façade of the Nativity, the crypt of ''La Sagrada Família'', ''La Casa Vicens'', ''La Casa Batlló'' and the crypt of the Church of Colònia Güell &amp;ndash; became so labeled by UNESCO in 2005.

==Influence==
*Gaudí's abandoned plans for a [[New York]] [[skyscraper]] [[hotel]] influenced the redesign of the [[World Trade Center]] after [[September 11, 2001]].

*In [[1992]], five artists founded La Asociación pro Beatificación de Antonio Gaudí. The secular association has since pushed for the [[Catholic church]] to [[beatification|declare Gaudí blessed]].{{ref|beatify}}

*Gaudí's life and work inspired [[The Alan Parsons Project]] to create the [[1987]] album ''[[Gaudi (album)|Gaudí]]''.

*Gaudi's work recently inspired a shop owner in [[Muswell Hill]] London to build a shopfront in the style of [[Casa Batlló]].

#{{note|chickens}} [http://www.gaudiclub.com/ingles/i_vida/i_vida2.asp Biography at Gaudí and Barcelonan-Muslims.  In [[1679]], contrary to the advice of many of his court nobles and theologians, Aurangzeb reimposed the [[Jizya]] or poll tax on non-Muslims. 

In [[1668]] the Hindu [[Jat]]s in the Agra district revolted. Though they suffered horrendous loss of life, the revolt continued for years. In [[1681]], the Jats attacked and desecrated [[Akbar]]'s tomb in [[Sikandra]].

In [[1672]] the [[Satnami]]s, a Hindu sect concentrated in an area near Delhi, staged an armed rebellion, plundering villages and defeating Mughal forces in a press toward Delhi. Aurangzeb sent an army of ten thousand, including his Imperial Guard, and put the rebellion down at great cost of life.

Hindu [[Rajputana]], which had been a loyal Mughal vassal state, grew restive. The Jaipur Rajputs led by Jai Singh continued loyal, but other Rajput kingdoms didn't. With its Maharaja [[Jaswant Singh]] died in [[1679]], Aurangzeb seized control of [[Jodhpur]], destroying many temples. He also moved on Udaipur.  There was never a clear resolution to this war.

Hindu military leaders and their troops banded together in various alliances throughout Aurangzeb's reign, initiating nearly constant battles and bloodshed. Among the most notable alliances was the [[Maratha Confederacy]]. At the same time [[Sikh]]s were forming the militant [[Khalsa]].

===The Deccan wars and the rise of the Marathas===
In the time of Shah Jahan, the Deccan had been controlled by three Muslim kingdoms: Ahmednagar, Bijapur and Golconda. Following a series of battles, Ahmendnagar was effectively divided, with large portions of the kingdom ceded to the Mughals and the balance to Bijapur. One of Ahmednagar's generals, a Hindu [[Maratha]] named [[Shahaji|Shahji]], retreated to Bijapur. Shahji left in behind in [[Pune]] his wife and young son [[Shivaji]]. 

In 1657, while Aurangzeb attacked Golconda and Bijapur, Shivaji, using guerrilla tactics, took control of three Bijapuri forts formerly controlled by his father. With these victories, Shivaji assumed defacto leadership of many independent Maratha clans. The Marathas harried the flanks of the warring Bijapuris and Mughals, gaining weapons, forts, and territories. During the war of succession, Shivaji's small and ill-equipped army survived an all out Bijapuri attack, and Shivaji personally killed the attacking general, [[Afzul Khan]]. With this event, the Marathas transformed into a powerful military force, capturing more and more Bijapuri and Mughal territory.

Following his coronation in [[1659]], Aurangzeb sent his trusted general and maternal uncle [[Shaista Khan]] to the Deccan to recover his lost forts. Shaista Khan drove into Marathi territory, and took up residence in [[Pune]]. In a daring raid, Shivaji retook Pune, even cutting off Shaista Khan's thumb as he fled. Once more the Marathis rallied to his leadership, taking back the territory. 

Aurangzeb for the next few years ignored the rise of the Marathas. Shivaji led by inspiration, not by any official authority, and the Marathas continued to capture forts belonging to both Mughals and Bijapur. At last Aurangzeb sent his Jaipuri general [[Jai Singh]], a Hindu, to attack the Marathas. 

Jai Singh's blistering attacks were so successful that he was able to persuade Shivaji to agree to peace by becoming a Mughal vassal. But when Shivaji and his son accompanied Jai Singh to Agra to meet Aurangzeb, confusion occurred, ending in an altercation at he fealty ceremony. As a result, Shivaji  and his son [[Sambhaji]] were placed under house arrest in Agra, from which they managed to escape.

Shivaji returned to the Deccan, successfully drove out the Mughal armies, and was crowned [[Chhatrapati]] or king of the Maratha confederacy in [[1674]]. While Aurangzeb continued to send troops against him, Shivaji expanded Maratha control throughout the Deccan until his death in [[1680]].

Sambhaji succeeded in [[1681]]. Though he was less effective militarily and politically, Mughal efforts to control the Deccan continued to fail. 

Aurangzeb's son Akbar left the Mughal court and joined with Sambhaji, inspiring some Mughal forces to join the Marathas. Aurangzeb in response moved his court to Aurangabad and took over command of the Deccan campaign. More battles ensued, and Akbar fled to Persia.

Aurangzeb captured [[Sambhaji]] and publicly tortured and killed him in [[1688]]. His brother [[Rajaram]] succeeded, but the confederacy fell into disarray. Surprisingly, however, this collapse provided the Marathas with great military advantage. Maratha Sardars(commanders) raised individual battles against the Mughals, and territory changed hands again and again during years of endless warfare. Since there was no central authority in control, Aurangzeb was forced to contest every inch of territory, at great cost in lives and treasure. Even as Aurangzeb drove west, deep into Maratha territory(notably conquering [[Satara]]), the Marathas expanded attacks eastward into Mughal lands, including Mughal-held [[Malwa]] and [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]]. 

Aurangzeb waged continual war for more than two decades with no resolution. After Aurangzeb's death, new leadership arose among the Marathas, who soon became unified under the rule of the [[Peshwa]]s.

===Defiance of the Sikhs and the rise of the Khalsa===
Since its founding by [[Guru Nanak]] in the 1500s, [[Sikh]]ism grew in popularity throughout India, particularly in the Punjab. In the years following the persecution and death of the fifth [[Guru Arjan Dev]] by Aurangzeb's grandfather [[Jahangir]], the Sikhs had become increasingly militant and defiant. 

Early in Aurangzeb's reign, various insurgent groups of Sikhs engaged Mughal troops in increasingly bloody battles. In 1670, the ninth [[Sikh]] Guru, [[Guru Tegh Bahadur|Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji]] encamped in Delhi, receiving large numbers of followers. Aurangzeb regarded this popularity as a potential threat, and determined to subdue it. But Mughal skirmishes with the increasingly militant Sikhs continued.

Sikhs and Kashmiri Pandits recount that in [[1675]] a group of Kashmiri brahmins, who were of the Hindu faith, were being pressured by Muslim authorities to convert to Islam and approached Guru Tegh Bahadur with their dilemma.  To demonstrate a spirit of unity and tolerance, the Guru agreed to help the brahmins: He told them to inform Aurangzeb that the brahmins would convert only if Guru Tegh Bahadur himself was converted.  

His response led to his death. &lt;!-- The Guru and his diciples were tortured by various methods, boiled alive, burned alive, sawn in half and scalped. It is no suprise that there is such an animosity between Hindus and Sikhs with Muslims. --&gt; At length Guru Tegh Bahadur was arrested and beheaded, giving his life to protect the brahmins. His execution infuriated the Sikhs. In response, his son and successor, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] further militarized his followers. Sikhs engaged in numerous battles against the Mughals, and though often outnumbered, succeeded in gaining more and more territory.

Aurangzeb installed his son [[Bahadur Shah]] as governor of the northwest territories, including Sikh-controlled parts of Punjab. The new governor relaxed enforcement of Aurangzeb's edicts, and an uneasy peace ensued.But Gobind Singh had determined that the Sikhs should actively prepare to defend their territories and their faith. In 1699 he established the [[Khalsa]] a Sikh order of &quot;saint-soldiers&quot;, ready to die for their cause. 

This development alarmed not only the Mughals, but the nearby Rajputs. In a temporary alliance, both groups attacked Gobind Singh and his followers. Facing defeat, Gobind Singh asked Aurangzeb for safe passage from their fort in Andrapuhr. Aurangzeb agreed, but as the Sikhs fled, the Mughals attacked in betrayal of the agreement. 

The Mughals killed all four of Gobind Singh's sons and decimated much of the Sikh army. Only Gobind Singh escaped. Gobind Singh sent Aurangzeb an eloquent yet defiant letter entitled the [[Zafarnama]] (''Notification of Victory''), accusing the emperor of treachery, and claiming a moral victory.

On receipt of this letter, Aurangzeb invited Gobind Singh to meet in Ahmednagar, but Aurangzeb died before Gobind Singh arrived.

==Legacy==

Aurangzeb's influence continues through the centuries, affecting not only India, but Asia, and the world. 

He was the first ruler to attempt to impose Sharia law on a non-Muslim country. His critics, principally Sikhs, Buddhists and Hindus, decry this as intolerance. His supporters, mostly Muslims, applaud him, some calling him a [[pir]] or [[Caliph]].

He engaged in nearly perpetual war, justifying the ensuing death and destruction on moral and religious grounds. His one-pointed devotion to conquest and control based on his personal world-view has continuing resonance in our current world. Even now, political groups of all kinds point to his rule to justify their actions. Without much effort, one can follow a direct line from Aurangzeb to many of the political and religious conflicts of the present day. The influence of the Fatawa-e-Alamgiri on future Islamic governments has been considerable.

Unlike his predecessors, Aurangzeb considered the royal treasury as a trust of the citizens of his empire and that it should not be used for his personal expenses. But his constant warfare drove his empire to the brink of bankruptcy as much as the personal profligacy of earlier emperors had done.

Despite his success in imposing Sharia within his kingdom, he alienated many constituencies, not only non-Muslims, but also native Shias. This led to increased militancy by the Marathas, the Sikhs, and Rajputs, who along with other territories broke from the empire after his death, and to disputes among Indian Muslims. The destruction of Hindu temples remains a source of emotional debate. 

He alienated many of his children and wives, driving some into exile and imprisoning others. At the ebb of his life, he expressed his loneliness, and perhaps, regret. 

In contrast to his predecessors, Aurangzeb left few buildings. He created a modest mausoleum for his first wife, [[Bibi Ka Maqbara]], sometimes called the mini-Taj, in Aurangabad.  He also built in [[Lahore]] what was at the time the largest mosque outside [[Mecca]]: the [[Badshahi Masjid]] ('Imperial' Mosque, sometimes called the 'Alamgiri' Mosque).  He also added a small marble mosque known as the ''[[Moti Masjid]]'' (Pearl Mosque) to the [[Delhi Fort|Red Fort]] complex in Delhi.

Aurangzeb's personal piety is undeniable. He led an extremely simple and pious life. He followed Muslim precepts with his typical determination, and even memorized the [[Qur'an]]. He knitted [[haj]] caps and copied out the [[Qur'an]] throughout his life, and sold these works anonymously. He used the proceeds, and only these, to fund his modest resting place. 

He ruled india with an iron fist, and during his rule none of his decendents dared conspire overthrowing him. He died in [[Ahmednagar]] in [[1707]] at the age of 90, having outlived many of his children. In conformance with his view of Islamic principles, his body rests in an open-air grave in [[Kuldabad]], near [[Aurangabad]]. 

After Aurangzeb's death, there were more than 100 claimants to throne due to his extended rule, and power struggle and infighting, which were characteristics of Mughal dynasty, followed. Eventually, his son [[Bahadur Shah I]] took the throne, but this infighting weakened the Mughal Empire. In addition, Auregzeb's religious intolerance had already alienated the non-Muslim majority, which found no reason to demonstrate allegiance to the Emperor. With hostile subjects, everyday conspiracies, and infighting, the Mughal Empire entered a long decline.

==Commentary by recent historians==

===Wolpert===
[[Stanley Wolpert]] writes in his ''New History of India'' ISBN 0195166779 (Oxford, 2003)
:...Yet the conquest of the Deccan, to which [Aurangzeb] devoted the last 26 years of his life, was in many ways a Pyrrhic victory, costing an estimated hundred thousand lives a year during its last decade of futile chess game warfare...The expense in gold and rupees can hardly be accurately estimated. [Aurangzeb]'s moving capital alone- a city of tents 30 miles in circumference, some 250 bazaars, with a 1/2 million camp followers, 50,000 camels and 30,000 elephants, all of whom had to be fed, stripped peninsular India of any and all of its surplus gain and wealth... Not only famine but bubonic plague arose...Even [Aurangzeb] had ceased to understand the purpose of it all by the time he..was nearing 90... &quot;I came alone and I go as a stranger. I do not know who I am, nor what I have been doing,&quot; the dying old man confessed to his son in Feb 1707. &quot;I have sinned terribly, and I do not know what punishment awaits me.&quot;

===[http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/index.html Manas] Group, UCLA===
:A year after he assumed power in 1658, Aurangzeb appointed muhtasaibs, or censors of public morals, from the ranks of the ulema or clergy in every large city. He was keen that the sharia or Islamic law be followed everywhere, and that practices abhorrent to Islam, such as the consumption of alcohol and gambling, be disallowed in public...

:It can scarcely be doubted, once the historical evidence is weighed, that the religious policies of Aurangzeb were discriminatory... [L]ittle, if any, evidence has been offered to suggest how far the conversion of Hindus took place, and whether there was any official policy beyond one of mere encouragement that led to the conversion of Hindus. Then, as now, conversion would have been more attractive to the vast number of Hindus living under the tyranny of caste oppression...[T]he kind of inducements that Aurangzeb offered [were not] substantially different from the inducements that modern, purportedly secular, politicians offer...

:Hindus employed...under Aurangzeb's reign rose from 24.5% in the time of his father Shah Jahan to 33% in the fourth decade of his own rule.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''Alternate meaning: [[Alexandrine of Denmark]]''

An '''alexandrine''' is a line of [[Meter (poetry)|poetic meter]]. Alexandrines are common in the [[German literature]] of the [[German literature of the Baroque period|Baroque period]] and in [[List of French language poets|French poetry]] of the early modern and modern periods and much less common in [[English poetry]], which more frequently uses [[iambic pentameter]] or 5-foot verse.

==Syllabic verse==

In [[syllabic verse]], such as that used in [[French literature]], an alexandrine is a line of twelve syllables, often with a [[caesura]] between the sixth and seventh syllables. Alternatively, an alexandrine may be divided into three four-syllable sections by two caesuras.

The dramatic works of [[Pierre Corneille]] and [[Jean Racine]] are typically composed of rhyming alexandrine couplets. (The caesura after the 6th syllable is here marked || )

:Nous partîmes cinq cents ; || mais par un prompt renfort
:Nous nous vîmes trois mille || en arrivant au port 

:(Corneille, ''Le Cid'' Act IV , scene 3) 

[[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]]'s ''Les Bijoux'' (The Jewels) is a typical example of the use of the alexandrine in 19th century French poetry :

:La très-chère était nue, || et, connaissant mon cœur,
:Elle n'avait gardé || que ses bijoux sonores,
:Dont le riche attirail || lui donnait l'air vainqueur
:Qu'ont dans leurs jours heureux || les esclaves des Mores.

Even a 20th century Surrealist, such as [[Paul Éluard]] used alexandrines on occasion, such as in these lines from ''L'Égalité des sexes'' (in ''Capitale de la douleur'') (note the variation between caesuras after the 6th syllable, and after 4th and 8th):

:Ni connu la beauté || des yeux, beauté des pierres,
:Celle des gouttes d'eau, || des perles en placard,
:Des pierres nues || et sans squelette, || ô ma statue

==Accentual verse==

In [[accentual verse]], it is a line of [[iambic]] [[hexameter]] - a line of six feet or measures (&quot;iambs&quot;), each of which has two syllables with an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable.  It is also usual for there to be a caesura between the sixth and seventh syllables (as the examples from [[Alexander Pope|Pope]] below illustrate.  [[Robert Bridges]] noted that in the lyrical sections of ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'', [[John Milton|Milton]] significantly varied the placement of the caesura.

In [[quantitative meter]]s, an iamb comprises a short syllable followed by a long syllable (as in the word ''delay''), and an alexandrine consists of six such short+long feet.
 
In the poetry of [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' 8 lines of pentameter are followed by an alexandrine, the 6-foot line slowing the regular rhythm of the 5-foot lines.

Undoubtedly the most famous alexandrine in the English language is a rhyming [[couplet]] of [[Alexander Pope]]'s, in which the first line is in iambic pentameter and the second line is an alexandrine:

:A needless alexandrine ends the song
:that like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along.

A few lines later Pope continues discussing fast lines:

:Not so, when swift Camilla scours the Plain,
:Flies o'er th'unbending corn and skims along the Main.

The second line of the couplet, a very fast line, is remarkably an alexandrine itself, which Pope just claimed made the line excruciatingly slow.  As [[Paul Fussell]] has said, &quot;It is the literary equivalent of shouting, 'Look! No hands.'&quot;

Alexandrines are sometimes introduced into predominantly pentameter verse for the sake of variety. The [[Spenserian stanza]], for instance, is eight lines of pentameter followed by an Alexandrine. In the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] and eighteenth century, poetry written in couplets is sometimes varied by the introduction of a triplet in which the third line is an Alexandrine, as in this example from [[John Dryden|Dryden]], which introduces a triplet after two couplets: 

:But satire needs not those, and wit will shine
:Through the harsh cadence of a rugged line:
:A noble error, and but seldom made,
:When poets are by too much force betrayed.
:Thy generous fruits, though gathered ere their prime,
:Still showed a quickness; and maturing time
:But mellows what we write to the dull sweets of rhyme.

==Origin==

There is some doubt as to the origin of the name; but most probably it is derived from a [[Alexander Romance|collection of Alexandrine romances]], collected in the 12th century, of which [[Alexander the Great|Alexander of Macedon]] was the hero, and in which he was represented, somewhat like the British [[King Arthur|Arthur]], as the pride and crown of chivalry. Before the publication of this work most of the [[trouvère]] romances appeared in octosyllabic verse. There is also a theory that the form was invented by a [[Alexander of Paris|poet named Alexander]]. The new work, which was henceforth to set the fashion to French literature, was written in lines of twelve syllables, but with a freedom of pause which was afterwards greatly curtailed. The new fashion, however, was not adopted all at once. The metre fell into disuse until the reign of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], when it was revived by [[Jean-Antoine de Baïf]], one of the seven poets known as [[La Pléiade]].

* [[Rocket]] propelled - Tube or rail launched - A reaction propulsion system mounted to the projectile provides continuous thrust for an initial period of the flight.
* Rocket assist - A combination of tube fired and rocket propelled - uses a rocket motor in the base of the projectile to extend the range by about 30%.
* [[Base bleed]] - Similar to a rocket assist projectile, uses a small pyrotechnic charge at the base of the projectile. The charge introduces sufficient combustion products into the low-pressure region behind the base of the projectile responsible for a large proportion of the [[Form drag|drag]] to substantially (&gt; 30%) increase range. Like a rocket assist projectile, trajectory is changed to non-ballistic, which may complicate counter-battery location.

=== Ammunition ===
High-explosive; shrapnel, dual purpose improved conventional munitions (DPICM)- bomblet; canister or anti-personnel; illuminating or star-shell; armour-piercing; incendiary (white phosphorus, &quot;Willie Pete&quot;); gas or aerosol, chemical or biological; smoke; nuclear and non-lethal (developing area - includes High Power Microwave HPM, and NL payload carrier shells).

=== [[Fuse (explosives)|Fuzes]] ===
Quick or super-quick; delay; hardened-delay or concrete-piercing; timer; proximity.  [[Proximity fuze]]s can be set to detonate at various heights for above ground detonation providing for air-bursts which multiply the round's killing effectiveness.  In anti-aircraft fire the proximity fuze can be made to have a premature detonation because of the moisture in heavy rain clouds.  The proximity fuze emerged on the battlefields of Europe in 1944, and was signicant in providing a counter to German personnel in open.  Proximity fuzes were a big improvement over the mechanical fuze which it replaced.

== Modern artillery operations ==
[[Image:Hirlimann-Le-char-au-garage.jpeg|thumb|An [[AMX_30_AuF1|AuF1]] of the French artillery detachement of the [[IFOR]] near [[Sarajevo]] in 1996.]]
[[Image:Gun5a.JPG|thumb|[[USMC]] [[M-198]] firing outside of [[Fallujah]], [[Iraq]] in 2004]]
Depending on the calibre of the weapons, artillery is used in a variety of roles. Mortars fire relatively short range and small- to medium-calibre (up to about 120 mm) projectiles. Modern mortars, because of their lighter weight and simpler, more transportable design, are usually organic to [[infantry]] and [[armor]] units, allowing greater responsiveness and negating their shorter range.

Howitzers are generally used in direct support of infantry and armor, where the guns of a [[Artillery battery|battery]] or even a [[battalion]] will be massed to fire simultaneously onto a single point or area target. Howitzers are usually between about 105 mm and 155 mm in calibre.

=== Counter-battery fire ===
Attacks aimed at enemy artillery rather than infantry or fortifications are known as [[counter-battery fire|counter battery fire]].

[[Radar]] coupled to [[computer|computers]] can accurately track a projectile in flight back to its firing point. This can be used as targeting information for an enemy artillery site.

When artillery fire is directed via radio by a forward observer (FO), the location of FO's transmitter can be calculated and attacked with artillery as well. If successful, this counter-attack will limit the effectiveness of the FO's artillery fire. Radar also improves the all-weather flexibility of modern artillery.

The rise in counter-battery abilities has driven field artillery to adopt &quot;[[shoot-and-scoot]]&quot; tactics emphasizing constant maneuver within a designated position area, usually from hide point to firing point and back again. This has required reliance on sometimes temperamental technology and increased the cost of modern field artillery systems.

=== Field artillery team ===
{{main|field artillery}}
Modern field artillery (Post-[[World War I]]) has three distinct parts: the forward observer (or FO), the fire direction center (FDC) and the actual guns themselves.  The forward observer observes the target using tools such as [[binocular]]s, [[laser range-finder]]s, designators and call back fire missions on his radio.  The FO deals solely with the FDC, of which there is usually one per each [[Artillery battery|battery]] of six guns. The FDC computes firing data, ''fire direction'', for the guns. The FDC will transmit the fire order to the guns, specifying the number of volleys, shell and fuze combination, charge, deflection and quadrant elevation, and any special instructions.

=== MRSI ===
It is possible for modern computer-controlled artillery to fire more than one volley at a target and have all the shells arrive simultaneously, which is called MRSI (Multiple Rounds Simultaneous Impact). This is because there is more than one trajectory for the rounds to fly to any given target - typically one is below 45 degrees from horizontal and the other is above it, and if you can vary the amount of propellant with each shell, you can create more trajectories. Because the higher trajectories cause the shells to arc higher into the air, they take longer to reach the target and so if the shells are fired on these trajectories for the first volleys (starting with the shell with the most propellant and working down) and then after the correct pause more volleys are fired on the lower trajectories, the shells will all arrive at the same time. This is useful because many more shells can land on the target with no warning. With traditional volleys along the same trajectory, anybody at the target point will have a certain amount of time (however long it takes to reload and re-fire the guns) to run away or take cover between volleys. In addition, if guns in more than one location are firing on one target, with careful timing it can be arranged for all their shells to land at the same time for the same reason.

Examples of MRSI guns are [[South Africa]]'s [[Denel G6]]-52 (which can land six rounds simultaneously at targets at least 25 km away) and [[Germany]]'s [[PzH 2000 howitzer|Panzer Haubitze 2000]] (which can land five rounds simultaneously at targets at least 17 km away). The [[United States]] [[XM2001 Crusader|Crusader]] programme (now cancelled) was slated to have MRSI capability.

When an effect similar to that of MRSI is achieved using separate batteries of traditional artillery, using varying fuzes to account for the variant distances or trajectories to cause all shells to detonate on the target at the same time, it is called TOT (Time On Target).  The logic behind this practice is the same as that for MRSI: to surprise the enemy and to sow confusion when guns heard to be firing at different times nonetheless result in deadly explosions in the same instant.  

An additional wrinkle can be added when some or all of the shells are set for airburst, meaning they explode in the air above the target instead of upon impact.  This is a very effective tactic against infantry and light vehicles because it scatters the [[shrapnel]] over a larger area and prevents the blast [[shockwave]] from being blocked by terrain, but usually proves ineffective against troops or equipment protected by even rudimentary [[fortification|fortifications]]. However, airbursts are probably more likely to impact units protected by [[trench]]es and [[revetment]]s, since the shrapnel can enter them from above, while a ground-burst nearby would simply cause the shrapnel to impact the walls or fly overhead.

*&quot;If two sides start out at equal strength, and are relatively equally damaged, but one side can replenish his artillery, and the other side cannot, then that one side that gets his artillery back has all but won.&quot; - Anonymous

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Arnulf of Carinthia''' ([[German language|German]] ''Arnulf von Kärnten'',  [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] ''Arnulf Koroški'') ([[850]] &amp;ndash; [[December 8]] [[899]]) was one of the last ruling members of the [[Carolingians|Carolingian Dynasty]] in [[East Francia]], which had been split from the rest of [[Frankish]] territory by the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in [[843]].  He was the illegitimate son of the [[duke of Bavaria|Bavarian king]] [[Carloman, King of Bavaria|Carloman]] and his [[concubine]], Liutswind (also ''Litwinde'' or ''Litwindie''), of [[Carinthia]]n origin, daughter of one Count Ernst.  He was given the [[duchy of Carinthia]] (a Frankish [[vassal]] state and successor of the ancient [[Principality of Karantania]]) by his father when he divided his realm, giving Bavaria to [[Louis the Younger]] and [[Italy]] to [[Charles the Fat]], in [[880]] on his death.  

He spent his childhood in Karantania, homeland of his mother.  Carloman had a court there, in [[Moosburg]] (then ''Blatograd''), where the young Arnulf grew up.  From later events it is evident that the Karantanians, from an early time, treated him as their own duke. 

He took the leading role in the deposition of his uncle, the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Charles the Fat]].  With the support of the nobles, Arnulf assumed his title of [[King of Germany|King of East Francia]] (later [[Germany]]) in [[887]].  Charles asked only for a few royal villas in [[Swabia]], which Arnulf granted him.  

Arnulf was not a negotiator, but a fighter. At the decisive [[Battle of Leuven]] on [[September]] [[891]], he defeated an invading force of the Northmen, or [[Vikings]], essentially ending invasion attempts on that front. The ''Annales Fuldensis'' (Annals of [[Fulda]]) report that the bodies of dead Northmen blocked the run of the river.  After his victory, Arnulf had built a new [[castle]] on an island in the [[Dijle]] river ([[Latin]] ''Luvanium'', local ''Lovon''). 

In [[894]] or [[895]], [[Great Moravia]] probably lost a part of its territory &amp;mdash; present-day Western [[Hungary]] &amp;mdash; to him.  Arnulf, however, failed to conquer Great Moravia in [[892]], [[893]], and [[899]].  In 895, [[Bohemia]] broke away from Great Moravia and became his vassal.  An accord was made between him and the [[duke of Bohemia|Bohemian Duke]] [[Borivoj]] (reigned [[870]]-[[895]]); Bohemia was freed from the danger of invasion. 

Arnulf invaded [[Italy]] in [[896]] and was crowned [[Emperor]] and [[King of Italy]] by [[Pope Formosus]] ([[pope]] [[891]]-[[896]]) in opposition to [[Lambert of Spoleto]]. He only retained power in Italy as long as he was personally there, he was vigourously opposed by Lambert's mother, [[Agiltrude]], and when he left, having taken ill, most of Italy was in Lambert's supporters' hands.  On his death in [[899]], he was succeeded as a king of the [[East Franks]] by his son by his wife Ota, [[Louis the Child]] ([[900]]-[[911]]).

Arnulf's illegitimate son [[Zwentibold]] reigned as [[king of Lotharingia]] from [[895]] to [[900]].

'''Alexanderplatz''' is a large open square and public transport hub in central [[Berlin]], near the [[Spree]] river and the [[Berliner Dom]]. Berliners often call it simply ''Alex''. 

Originally a cattle market, it was named in honour of a visit of the [[Russia]]n Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] to Berlin on [[25 October]] [[1805]]. It gained a prominent role in the late 19th century with the construction of the station of the same name and a nearby public market, becoming a major commercial centre. Its heyday was in the [[1920s]], when together with [[Potsdamer Platz]] it was at the heart of Berlin's [[nightlife]], inspiring the [[1929]] [[novel]] ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]''. (see [[1920s Berlin]])

The Alexanderplatz has been subject to redevelopment several times in its history, most recently during the [[1960s]], when it was enlarged as part of the [[German Democratic Republic]]'s redevelopment of the city centre. It is surrounded by several notable structures including the [[Fernsehturm]] (TV Tower), the second tallest structure in [[Europe]]. Because of its high profile, many newcomers to Berlin mistake the [[nickname]] ''Alex'' and apply it to the Fernsehturm instead. The ''Alex'' also accommodates the [[Forum Hotel Berlin]] and the World Time Clock, a continually rotating installation that shows the time throughout the globe.

[[Image:Berlin - Weltzeituhr.jpg|thumb|The World time clock]]
Following [[German reunification]] the Alexanderplatz has undergone a gradual process of change with many of the surrounding buildings being renovated. Despite the construction of a [[tram]] line and the addition of some greenery it has retained its socialist character, including the much-[[graffiti]]ed ''Fountain of Friendship between Peoples'' (''Brunnen der Völkerfreundschaft''). In [[1993]] plans for a major redevelopment including the construction of several skyscrapers were published, but due to a lack of demand it is unlikely these will be constructed. However, beginning with the reconstruction of the department store [[Kaufhof]] in 2004, some buildings will be redesigned and new structures built on the square's south-eastern side.

Many historic buildings are located in the area around Alexanderplatz. The traditional seat of city government, the [[Rotes Rathaus]], or ''Red City Hall'',  is located nearby, as is the East German parliament building, the [[Palast der Republik]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Asian Development Bank (ADB)'''  is a multilateral development finance institution dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific. It was founded in 1966 with 31 members states and has now grown to include 64.

==Organization==

The highest policy-making body of the bank is the ''Board of Governors'' composed of one representative from each member state. The Board of Governors, in turn, elect among themselves the 12 members of the ''Board of Directors'' and their deputy. Eight of the 12 members come from regional (Asia-Pacific) members while the rest come from non-regional members.

The Board of Governors also elect the bank's ''President'' who is the legal representative of the bank and manages the Board of Directors. The president has a term of office lasting five years, and may be reelected. Traditionally, and because [[Japan]] is one of the largest shareholders of the bank, the President has always been Japanese. The current President is [[Haruhiko Kuroda]].

The headquarters of the bank is at 6 ADB Avenue, [[Mandaluyong City]], [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]], and it has representative offices around the world. The bank employs approximately 2,000 people, more than half of which are [[Filipino people|Filipino]].

The bank has been under corruption investigation by the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs.

==Notable projects of the ADB==
*[[Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline]] (US$3B)
*[[Gujarat(INDIA) Earthquake Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project]] (US$500M)
*[[Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program]]

[[Image:Giant abatis.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Giant abatis, made from entire trees, is an effective anti-vehicle obstacle.]]

'''Abatis''', '''Abattis''' or '''Abbattis''' (a [[French language|French]] word meaning a heap of material thrown), a term in field [[fortification]] for an obstacle formed of the branches of trees laid in a row, with the tops directed towards the enemy and interlaced or tied with [[wire]].  The abatis is used alone or in combination with [[wire entanglement]]s and other obstacles.

Although used since at least [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial]] times, abatis is rarely seen nowadays, having been largely replaced by [[wire obstacle]]s. However it may be used as a supplement when [[barbed wire]] is in short supply. Also, a form of giant abatis, using whole trees instead of branches, can be used as an anti-[[tank]] obstacle.

An important weakness of abatis - in comparison to [[barbed wire]] - is that if time allows, it can be destroyed by [[fire]]. Also if it is laced together with [[rope]] instead of [[wire]], the rope can be very quickly destroyed by fire, after which the abatis can be quickly pulled apart by [[grappling hook]]s thrown from a safe distance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Antoine Thomson d'Abbadie''' ([[January 3]], [[1810]] &amp;ndash; [[March 19]], [[1897]]), was a [[France|French]] [[geographer]], notable for his travels in [[Ethiopia]] during the first half of the [[19th century]]. He was the older brother of [[Arnaud Michel d'Abbadie]].

They were both born in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]] of a [[France|French]] father and an Irish mother. The family moved to [[France]] in 1818, and there the brothers received a careful scientific education.

In 1835 the [[French Academy]] sent Antoine on a scientific mission to [[Brazil]], the results being published at a later date (1873) under the title of ''Observations relatives à la physique du globe faites au Bresil et en Ethiopie''. The younger Abbadie spent some time in [[Algeria]] before, in 1837, the two brothers started for Ethiopia, landing at [[Massawa]] in February 1838. They visited various parts of Ethiopia, including the then little-known districts of [[Ennarea]] and [[Kingdom of Kaffa|Kaffa]], sometimes together and sometimes separately. They met with many difficulties and many adventures, and became involved in political intrigues, Antoine especially exercising such influence as he possessed in favour of France and the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] missionaries. After collecting much valuable information concerning the geography, geology, archaeology and natural history of Ethiopia, the brothers returned to France in 1848 and began to prepare their materials for publication.

The more distinguished brother, Antoine, became involved in various controversies relating both to his geographical results and his political intrigues. He was especially attacked by [[Charles Tilstone Beke]], who impugned his veracity, especially with reference to the journey to [[Kana, Ethiopia|Kana]]. But time and the investigations of subsequent explorers have shown that Abbadie was quite trustworthy as to his facts, though wrong in his contention -- hotly contested by Beke -- that the [[Blue Nile]] was the main stream. The topographical results of his explorations were published in [[Paris]] between 1860 and 1873 in ''Geodesie d'Ethiopie'', full of the most valuable information and illustrated by ten maps. Of the ''Geographie de l'Ethiopie'' (Paris, 1890) only one volume has been published. In ''Un Catalogue raisonné de manuscrits ethiopiens'' (Paris, 1859) is a description of 234 Ethiopian [[manuscript]]s collected by Antoine. He also compiled various vocabularies, including a ''Dictionnaire de la langue amarinna'' (Paris, 1881), and prepared an edition of the ''[[Shepherd of Hermas]]'', with the Latin version, in 1860. He published numerous papers dealing with the geography of Ethiopia, Ethiopian coins and ancient inscriptions. Under the title of ''Reconnaissances magnetiques'' he published in 1890 an account of the [[magnetic]] observations made by him in the course of several journeys to the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Levant]]. The general account of the travels of the two brothers was published by Arnaud in 1868 under the title of ''Douze ans dans la Haute Ethiopie''.

Both brothers received the grand medal of the [[Paris Geographical Society]] in 1850. Antoine was a knight of the [[Légion d’honneur|Legion of Honour]] and a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. He died in 1897, and bequeathed an estate in the [[Pyrenees]], yielding 40,000 francs a year, to the Academy of Sciences, on condition of its producing within fifty years a catalogue of half-a-million stars. His brother Arnaud died in 1893.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abba Mari''' (in full, '''Abba Mari ben Moses ben Joseph'''), [[France|French]] [[rabbi]], was born at [[Lunel]], near [[Montpellier]], towards the end of the [[13th century]]. He is also known as '''Yarhi''' from his birthplace ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''Yerah'', i.e. [[moon]], lune), and he further took the name '''Astruc''', '''Don Astruc''' or '''En Astruc of Lunel'''.

The descendant of men learned in [[rabbinic]] lore, Abba Mari devoted himself to the study of [[theology]] and [[philosophy]], and made himself acquainted with the writings of [[Maimonides|Moses Maimonides]] and [[Nachmanides]] as well as with the ''[[Talmud]]''.

In Montpellier, where he lived from 1303 to 1306, he was much distressed by the prevalence of [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[rationalism]], which in his opinion, through the medium of the works of Maimonides, threatened the authority of the [[Old Testament]], obedience to the law, and the belief in [[miracle]]s and [[revelation]]. He therefore, in a series of letters (afterwards collected under the title ''Minhat Kenaot'', i.e., &quot;Jealousy Offering&quot;) called upon the famous rabbi [[Solomon ben Adret]] of [[Barcelona]] to come to the aid of orthodoxy. Ben Adret, with the approval of other prominent Spanish rabbis, sent a letter to the community at Montpellier proposing to forbid the study of philosophy to those who were less than thirty years of age, and, in spite of keen opposition from the liberal section, a decree in this sense was issued by Ben Adret in 1305.  The result was a great schism among the [[Jew]]s of [[Spain]] and southern [[France]], and a new impulse was given to the study of philosophy by the unauthorized interference of the Spanish rabbis.

On the expulsion of the Jews from France by [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] in 1306, Abba Mari settled at [[Perpignan]], where he published the letters connected with the controversy. His subsequent history is unknown.  Beside the letters, he was the author of liturgical poetry and works on civil law.

==Defender of Law and Tradition==

(Graetz and others have, incorrectly, En Duran): Leader of the opposition to the [[rationalism]] of the Maimonists in the Montpellier controversy of 1303-1306; born at Lunel—hence his name, Yarḥi (from Yeraḥ = Moon = Lune). He was a descendant of [[Meshullam ben Jacob]] of Lunel, one of whose five sons was Joseph, the grandfather of Abba Mari, who, like his son Moses, the father of Abba Mari, was highly respected for both his rabbinical learning and his general erudition. Abba Mari moved to Montpellier, where, to his chagrin, he found the study of rabbinical lore greatly neglected by the young, who devoted all of their time and zeal to [[science]] and [[philosophy]]. The rationalistic method pursued by the new school of Maimonists (including [[Levi ben Abraham ben Chayyim]] of [[Villefranche]], near the town of [[Perpignan]], and [[Jacob Anatolio]]) especially provoked his indignation; for the sermons preached and the works published by them seemed to resolve the entire [[Scripture]]s into [[allegory]] and threatened to undermine the Jewish faith and the observance of the Law and tradition. He was not without some philosophical training. He mentions even with reverence the name of Maimonides, whose work he possessed and studied; but he was more inclined toward the mysticism of Nachmanides. Above all, he was a thorough believer in [[revelation]] and in a [[divine providence]], and was a sincere, law-observing follower of rabbinical Judaism. He would not allow Aristotle, &quot;the searcher after God among the heathen,&quot; to be ranked with Moses.

==Opponent of Rationalism==

Abba Mari possessed considerable Talmudic knowledge and some poetical talent; but his zeal for the Law made him an agitator and a persecutor of all the advocates of liberal thought. Being himself without sufficient authority, he appealed in a number of letters, afterward published under the title of ''Minḥat Ḳenaot'' (''Jealousy Offering''), to [[Solomon ben Adret]] of [[Barcelona]], the most influential rabbi of the time, to use his powerful authority to check the source of evil by hurling his [[anathema]] against both the study of philosophy and the allegorical interpretations of the Bible, which did away with all belief in miracles. Ben Adret, while reluctant to interfere in the affairs of other congregations, was in perfect accord with Abba Mari as to the danger of the new rationalistic systems, and advised him to organize the conservative forces in defense of the Law. Abba Mari, through Ben Adret's aid, obtained allies eager to take up his cause, among whom were Don [[Bonafoux Vidal]] of Barcelona and his brother, Don [[Crescas Vidal]], then in Perpignan. The proposition of the latter to prohibit, under penalty of [[excommunication]], the study of philosophy and any of the sciences except [[medicine]], by one under thirty years of age, met with the approval of Ben Adret. Accordingly, Ben Adret addressed to the congregation of Montpellier a letter, signed by fifteen other rabbis, proposing to issue a decree pronouncing the anathema against all those who should pursue the study of philosophy and science before due maturity in age and in rabbinical knowledge. On a Sabbath in September, 1304, the letter was to be read before the congregation, when [[Jacob Machir Don Profiat Tibbon]], the renowned astronomical and mathematical writer, entered his protest against such unlawful interference by the Barcelona rabbis, and a [[schism]] ensued. Twenty-eight members signed Abba Mari's letter of approval; the others, under Tibbon's leadership, addressed another letter to Ben Adret, rebuking him and his colleagues for condemning a whole community without knowledge of the local conditions. Finally, the agitation for and against the liberal ideas brought about a schism in the entire Jewish population in southern [[France]] and [[Spain]].

Encouraged, however, by letters signed by the rabbis of [[Argentière]] and Lunel, and particularly by the support of [[Kalonymus ben Todros]], the ''[[nasi]]'' of [[Narbonne]], and of the eminent Talmudist [[Asheri of Toledo]], Ben Adret issued a decree, signed by thirty-three rabbis of Barcelona, excommunicating those who should, within the next fifty years, study [[physics]] or [[metaphysics]] before their thirtieth year of age (basing his action on the principle laid down by Maimonides, ''Moreh,'' i. 34), and had the order promulgated in the synagogue on Sabbath, [[July 26]], [[1305]]. When this [[heresy]]-decree, to be made effective, was forwarded to other congregations for approval, the friends of liberal thought, under the leadership of the Tibbonites, issued a counter-ban, and the conflict threatened to assume a serious character, as blind party zeal (this time on the liberal side) did not shrink from asking the civil powers to intervene. But an unlooked-for calamity brought the warfare to an end. The expulsion of the Jews from France by [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] (&quot;the Fair&quot;), in 1306, caused the Jews of Montpellier to take refuge, partly in [[Provence]], partly in Perpignan and partly in [[Majorca]]. Consequently, Abba Mari removed first to [[Arles]], and, within the same year, to Perpignan, where he finally settled and disappeared from public view. There he published his correspondence with Ben Adret and his colleagues.

==His Works==

Abba Mari collected the correspondence and added to each letter a few explanatory notes. Of this collection, called ''Minḥat Ḳenaot,'' there are several manuscript copies extant; namely, at [[Oxford]] (Neubauer, ''Cat. Bodl. Hebr. MSS.,'' Nos. 2182 and 2221); [[Paris]], Bibl. Nat. No. 976; Günzburg Libr., [[St. Petersburg]]; [[Parma]]; [[Ramsgate]] [[Montefiore College]] Library (formerly Halberstam, No. 192); and [[Turin]]. Some of these (Oxford, No. 2221, and Paris, Bibl. Nat.) are mere fragments. The printed edition (Presburg, 1838), prepared by M. L. Bislichis, contains: (1) Preface; (2) a treatise of eighteen chapters on the [[incorporeality]] of [[God]]; (3) correspondence; (4) a treatise, called ''Sefer ha-Yarḥi,'' included also in letter 58; (5) a defense of ''The Guide'' and its author by [[Shem-Tob Palquera]] (Grätz, ''Gesch. d. Juden,'' vii. 173). As the three cardinal doctrines of Judaism, Abba Mari accentuates: (1) That of the recognition of God's existence and of His absolute sovereignty, eternity, unity, and incorporeality, as taught in revelation, especially in the ''[[Decalogue]]''; (2) that of the world's creation by Him out of nothing, as evidenced particularly by the Sabbath; (3) that of the special [[Divine providence|providence]] of God, as manifested in the Biblical [[miracle]]s. In the preface, Abba Mari explains his object in collecting the correspondence; and in the treatise which follows he shows that the study of philosophy, useful in itself as a help toward the acquisition of the knowledge of God, requires great caution, lest we be misled by the Aristotelian philosophy or its false interpretation, as regards the principles of creatiom ''[[ex nihilo]]'' and divine individual providence. The manuscripts include twelve letters which are not included in the printed edition of ''Minḥat Ḳenaot.''

==Contents of the Minḥat Ḳenaot==

The correspondence refers mainly to the proposed restriction of the study of the Aristotelian philosophy. Casually, other theological questions are discussed. For example, letters 1, 5, and 8 contain a discussion on the question, whether the use of a piece of metal with the figure of a lion, as a [[talisman]], is permitted by Jewish law for medicinal purposes, or is prohibited as [[idolatry|idolatrous]]. In letter 131, Abba Mari mourns the death of Ben Adret, and in letter 132 he sends words of sympathy to the congregation of Perpignan, on the death of Don [[Solomon Vidal]] and Rabbi Meshullam. Letter 33 contains the statement of Abba Mari that two letters which he desired to insert could not be discovered by him. MS. Ramsgate, No. 52, has the same statement, but also the two letters missing in the printed copies. In the ''Sefer ha-Yarḥi'', Abba Mari refers to the great caution shown by the rabbis of old as regards the teaching of the mysteries of philosophy, and recommended by men like the [[Hai Gaon]], Maimonides, and [[David Kimhi]]. A responsum of Abba Mari on a ritual question is contained in MS. Ramsgate, No. 136; and Zunz (''Literaturgeschichte der Synagogalen Poesie,'' p. 498), mentions a ''ḳinah'' composed by Abba Mari.

The ''Minḥat Ḳenaot'' is instructive reading for the historian because it throws much light upon the deeper problems which agitated Judaism, the question of the relation of religion to the philosophy of the age, which neither the zeal of the fanatic nor the bold attitude of the liberal-minded could solve in any fixed dogmatic form or by any anathema, as the independent spirit of the congregations refused to accord to the rabbis the power possessed by the [[Church]] of dictating to the people what they should believe or respect. At the close of the work are added several eulogies written by Abba Mari on Ben Adret (who died in 1310), and on Don Vidal, [[Solomon of Perpignan]], and Don [[Bonet Crescas]] of Lunel.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Abbas Helmi.jpg|right]]'''Abbas Hilmi Pasha''' or '''Abbas II''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: عباس حلمي باشا) ([[July 14]], [[1874]] &amp;ndash; [[1944]]) was the last ''[[khedive]]'' of [[Egypt]] ([[January 8]], [[1892]] &amp;ndash; [[1914]]).

Abbas Hilmi Pasha was the great-great-grandson of [[Mehemet Ali (Egypt)|Mehmet Ali]]. He succeeded his father, [[Tewfik Pasha]], as ''khedive'' of Egypt. When a boy he visited [[England]], and he had an English tutor for some time in [[Cairo]]. He then went to school in [[Lausanne]], and from there passed on to the [[Theresianum]] in [[Vienna]]. In addition to [[Turkish language|Turkish]], his [[mother tongue]], he acquired fluency in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and a good conversational knowledge of [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]].

He was still at college in Vienna when the sudden death of his father raised him to the ''Khedivate''; and he was barely of age according to [[Turkey|Turkish]] law, which fixes majority at eighteen in cases of succession to the throne. For some time he did not cooperate very cordially with [[Great Britain]]. He was young and eager to exercise his new power. His throne and life had not been saved for him by the British, as was the case with his father. He was surrounded by intriguers who were playing a game of their own, and for some time he appeared almost disposed to be as reactionary as his great-uncle [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]].

But in process of time he learnt to understand the importance of [[United Kingdom|British]] counsels. He paid a second visit to England in 1900, during which he frankly acknowledged the great good the British had done in Egypt, and declared himself ready to follow their advice and to cooperate with the British officials administering Egyptian affairs. The establishment of a sound system of native justice, the great remission of taxation, the reconquest of the [[Sudan]], the inauguration of the substantial irrigation works at [[Aswan]], and the increase of cheap, sound education, each received his approval and all the assistance he could give. He displayed more interest in [[agriculture]] than in statecraft, and his farm of cattle and horses at [[Koubah]], near Cairo, would have done credit to any agricultural show in England; at [[Montaza]], near [[Alexandria]], he created a similar establishment. He married the Princess [[Ikbal Hanem]] and had several children. [[Prince Muhammad Abdul Moneim|Muhammad Abdul Moneim]], the heir-apparent, was born on [[February 20]], [[1899]].

When the [[Ottoman Empire]] joined the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]], Britain declared Egypt a British [[protectorate]] and deposed Abbas. He retired to [[Switzerland]], where he died.

== Footnote ==
{{fnb|(1)}} The principle had, however, been invoked before then, e.g. in 1957, R.H. Dicke wrote: 'The age of the Universe &quot;now&quot; is not random but conditioned by biological factors ... [changes in the values of the fundamental constants of physics] would preclude the existence of man to consider the problem.' (R.H. Dicke, ''Principle of Equivalence and Weak Interactions'', Rev.Mod.Phys. 29, 355 (1957).) Even earlier statements of the principle may be found in [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]'s book ''Man's Place in the Universe'', which was first published in 1903. For example: &quot;such a vast and complex universe as that which we know exists around us, may have been absolutely required ... in order to produce a world that should be precisely adapted in every detail for the orderly development of life culminating in man.&quot; (pp. 256-7 in the 1912 edition).

It also has analogs in, e.g., [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of [[historical materialism]]: &quot;The first premise of all human history is, of course, the existence of living human individuals. Thus the first fact to be established is the physical organisation of these individuals and their consequent relation to the rest of nature.&quot; (''The German Ideology'', [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm#a2 ch. 1])

[[Image:Australianarmy.gif|right|thumb|The Australian Army Emblem]]
The '''Australian Army''' is [[Australia|Australia's]] military land force. It is part of the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF) along with the [[Royal Australian Navy]] and the [[Royal Australian Air Force]].

The Australian Army is commanded by the Chief of the Army (CA), who is responsible to the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF).

As well as ground troops, approximately 80 [[Leopard MBT|Leopard tanks]] and artillery, it also operates helicopters: [[UH-60 Black Hawk|Blackhawk]], [[CH-47 Chinook|Chinook]], and has taken delivery of the first of  22 [[Eurocopter Tiger]] Armed Reconnaissance Helicopters (with the last of the [[UH-1 Iroquois]] serving with distinction in [[Aceh]] for humanitarian relief after [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] before removal from service.) Recently plans have been announced to procure 59 [[M1 Abrams|M1A2 tanks]] and 7 M88 Hercules II armoured recovery vehicles.

Australian soldiers have been involved in a number of minor and major conflicts throughout its history, but only in [[World War II]] did Australian territory come under direct attack.

The history of the Australian Army can be divided into two periods:
*1901-47, when limits were set on the size of the '''regular army''', the vast majority of peacetime soldiers were in the '''reserve army''' units of the [[Australian Citizens Military Force]] (also known as the CMF or Militia), and [[Australian Imperial Force]]s were formed to serve overseas, and
*post-1947, when a standing peacetime [[infantry]] force was formed and the CMF (known as the Army Reserve after 1980) began to decline in importance.

The army has been involved in many peacekeeping operations, usually under the auspices of the [[United Nations]]. The biggest one began in 1999 in [[East Timor]]. Other notable operations include peacekeeping on [[Bougainville]] and in the [[Solomon Islands]], which are ongoing as of May 2004. Humanitarian relief after [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] in [[Aceh]] Province, [[Indonesia]], [http://www.defence.gov.au/optsunamiassist/default.htm Operation Sumatra Assist], ended on [[24 March]] [[2005]].

==The Army Today==
{{further|[[Modern Equipment and Uniform of the Australian Army]]}}

===Organisation===
The Australian Army is currently organised around two Division headquarters. The Deployable Joint Force Headquarters/1st Division has responsibility for the majority of the regular army, while 2nd Division is the main home defence formation, containing Army Reserve units. The regular army is organised around the six battalion [[Royal Australian Regiment]] - three of these are standard light infantry, with two of the others roled as paratroops and mechanised infantry. The final battalion is a specialised commando unit class as special forces. The [[Royal Australian Armoured Corps]] has three regular regiments, one of main battle tanks and two light cavalry (formation reconnaissance). These forces, together with the associated combat support (artillery, engineers, signals) and combat service support (logistics, maintainence etc) are based around two deployable brigades, [[Australian 1st Brigade|1 Brigade]], which is primarily a heavy mechanised formation, and [[Australian 3rd Brigade|3 Brigade]], which is a light, air deployable formation. [[Australian 7th Brigade|7 Brigade]] is an integrated Regular/Reserve formation that would primarily be used in conjunction with DJHQ were it ever to be deployed overseas.

===Current deployments===
The Australian Army currently has significant forces deployed on two major operations:
*'''Operation Catalyst''' - Australia's commitment to the Coalition forces in [[Iraq]]. The army's contribution includes:
**[[Al Muthanna Task Group]]; this is a [[battlegroup (army)|battlegroup]] consisting of a headquarters, infantry company, armoured squadron and training team, with a total of 450 personnel. This has two tasks:
***Provide a secure environment for the Japanese Iraq Reconstruction and Support Group (JIRSG) 
***Assist in the training of local Iraqi Army units so that they are able to take over the internal and external defence of their country
**Australian Army Training Team; this encompasses 55 personnel providing logistic training to the [[new Iraqi Army]].
**Embassy security detatchment; this provides security protection and escort for staff at the Australian Embassy in [[Baghdad]], and consists of 100 personnel.
*'''[[Operation Slipper]]''' - Australia's commitment to the [[War on Terror]]. The army contribution is primarily concentrated in [[Afghanistan]] and consists of a '''Special Operations Task Group''' of personnel from the [[Special Air Service Regiment]], [[4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] and [[Incident Response Regiment]].
*In addition to these, small numbers of personnel are deployed on various operations around the world, including [[Timor-Leste]], the [[Solomon Islands]], and on peacekeeping duties with the [[Multinational Force and Observers]] and the [[United Nations]].
===&quot;Hardened and Networked Army&quot;===
On [[15 December]] [[2005]], the then Australian Minister for Defence, [[Robert Hill (Australian politician)|The Hon. Senator Robert Hill]] announced  that the Australian Army would be restructured and redeveloped in the biggest ADF shake up in over 50 years. The policy of creating a  'Hardened and Networked' Army will see a major reorganisation of both the regular Army and Army Reserve. The overriding rationale for this is to bring about &quot;A reduction in singular capabilities that can not be rotated, hence an 'Army of twos'&quot;{{fn|1}}. This will involve the army being organised so that it can deploy a number of [[battlegroup (army)|battlegroups]], consisting of infantry, armour, artillery etc in the correct proportions relavent to each type of mission. For this, nine separate army units are being structured to act as battlegroup headquarters:
*[[1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|1st]], [[2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|2nd]], and [[6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|6th]] Bn, [[Royal Australian Regiment]] are standard light infantry battalions, with [[5th/7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|5/7 Bn]] as a mechanized battalion. The [[3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|3rd Bn]] is classed as a light infantry unit in the parachute role, though it is scheduled to convert to a mechanized battalion by 2011. 
*[[1st Armoured Regiment]]
*[[2nd Cavalry Regiment]]
*[[2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment|2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment (Queensland Mounted Infantry)]]
*[[Australian 1st Aviation Regiment|1st Aviation Regiment]]

The 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment will be relocated from Sydney to Adelaide, converting from its current parachute role into a mechanised unit. This new 'battle group' will take on a similar role to 5/7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment which is the major mechanised battalion. By the end of this process in approximately 2015, [[Australian 1st Brigade|1 Brigade]] will be the army's major mechanised formation. The armoured units of the Army Reserve in 2nd Division will be restructured, with four becoming pure light cavalry and the fifth being utilised in the armoured lift role.

==Rank and Insigina of the Australian Army==
The Ranks of the Australian Army are based on the ranks of the [[British Army]], and carry mostly the same actual insignia. Other than the shoulder title &quot;Australia&quot;, the [[Officer (armed forces)|Officer]] ranks are exactly identical. The [[Non-Commissioned Officer]] insignia are the same up until [[Warrant Officer]] ranks, where they are stylised for Australia.

The '''American Registry for Internet Numbers''' ('''ARIN''') is the [[Regional Internet Registry]] (RIR) for [[Canada]], the [[United States]], and portions of the [[Caribbean]]. 

Established in December 1997, ARIN is incorporated as a nonprofit in the Commonwealth of Virginia, USA. ARIN is one of five (5) RIRs. Like the other RIRs, ARIN:

* Provides services related to the technical coordination and management of Internet number resources in its respective service region. 
* Participates in the global Internet community;
* Facilitates the development of policy decisions made by its members and the stakeholders in its region;
* Is a nonprofit, membership organization;
* Is governed by an executive board elected by its membership.

== Services ==

ARIN provides services related to the technical coordination and management of Internet number resources. The nature of these services is described in ARIN's mission statement:

:''Applying the principles of stewardship, ARIN, a nonprofit corporation, allocates Internet Protocol resources; develops consensus-based policies; and facilitates the advancement of the Internet through information and educational outreach.''

These services are grouped in three areas: Registration, Organization, and Policy Development.

=== Registration Services ===

Registration Services pertain to the technical coordination and management of Internet number resources. They include:

* IP address space allocation, transfer, and record maintenance
* ASN allocation, transfer, and record maintenance
* Directories
** Registration transaction information (WHOIS)
** Routing information (Internet Routing Registry)
* DNS (Reverse)

=== Organization Services ===

Organization Services pertain to interaction between ARIN members and stakeholders and ARIN. They include:

* Elections
* Members Meetings
* Information publication and dissemination
* Education and training

=== Policy Development Services ===

Policy Development Services facilitate the development of policy for the technical coordination and management of Internet number resources in the ARIN region. They include:

* Maintaining discussion e-mail lists
* Conducting Public Policy Meetings
* Publishing policy documents

== Structure ==

ARIN is a nonprofit service organization that is responsive to the needs of the public it serves. Stakeholders in the community drive policies and activities, thus enabling ARIN to keep in step with their requirements. The organizational structure of ARIN is comprised of a 7-member Board of Trustees, a 15-member Advisory Council, and a professional staff of nearly 40. The Board of Trustees and Advisory Council are elected by ARIN members for three-year terms.

=== Board of Trustees ===

The ARIN membership elects the Board of Trustees, which has ultimate responsibility for the business affairs and financial health of ARIN, and manages ARIN's operations in a manner consistent with the guidance received from the Advisory Council and the goals set by the registry's members. The Board is responsible for determining the disposition of all revenues received to ensure that all services are provided in an equitable manner.

The Board votes on proposals generated from the membership and submitted through the Advisory Council. Executive decisions are carried out following approval by the Board.

The Board of Trustees consists of 7 members. Six members are elected by ARIN's membership and the President of ARIN serves as the seventh Trustee. Current members of the Board include Secretary Scott Bradner, Treasurer Lee Howard, President Ray Plzak, and the Chairman, [[John Curran]], as well as Trustees Bill Manning, Bill Woodcock, and [[Paul Vixie]].

=== Advisory Council ===

In addition to the Board of Trustees, ARIN has an Advisory Council. The Advisory Council serves in an advisory capacity to the Board of Trustees on IP allocation policy and related matters. Adhering to the procedures in the Internet Resource Policy Evaluation Process, the Advisory Council forwards consensus-based policy proposals to the Board for ratification, as well as membership proposals to the Board for formal votes.

The Advisory Council consists of 15 elected members. The President of ARIN is an ex-officio member and acts as the liaison between the Board of Trustees and the Advisory Council. The current chair of the Advisory Council is Ron da Silva.

==History==

[[Image:Arinlogo-sml.jpg|left|ARIN Logo from 1998 until 2001]] 

The organization was formed in December 1997 to &quot;provide [[Internet Protocol|IP]] registration services as an independent, nonprofit corporation.&quot; Until this time IP registration in the ARIN region was done by a department within the [[Network Solutions]] corporation, which provided the initial staff and  computer infrastructure for ARIN.

The first president of ARIN was Kim Hubbard, from 1997 until 2000. The current president of ARIN is Raymond Plzak.

Until late [[2002]] it served [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], [[South America]] and all of the [[Caribbean]]. [[LACNIC]] now handles parts of the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, and South America. Also, [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] was part of its region until recently, when [[AfriNIC]] was officially recognized by [[ICANN]] as the fifth [[Regional Internet Registry]] in April 2005. 

==Service Region==

The countries in the ARIN service region are:

* [[Anguilla]]
* [[Antigua and Barbuda]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Akihabara''' (&amp;#31179;&amp;#33865;&amp;#21407;) is also known as '''Akihabara Electric Town''' (Akihabara Denki Gai).  It is located less than five minutes by rail from [[Tokyo Station]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. Its name is sometimes shortened to ''Akiba'' by locals. While there is an official locality named Akihabara nearby, part of [[Taito-ku, Tokyo|Taito-ku]], the area known to most people as ''Akihabara'' (including the [[Japan Railway|JR]] railway station of the [[Akihabara Station|same name]]) is actually Soto-Kanda, a part of [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda]]-ku.
[[Image:Akihabara_picture.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Akihabara in 2003]]

Akihabara is best-known as one of the largest shopping area on Earth for electronic, computer, [[anime]], and [[otaku]] goods, including new and used items. New items are mostly to be found on the main street, Chuo Dori, with used items of all descriptions (software, hardware, and junk galore) to be found in the back streets of Soto Kanda 3 chome. First hand parts for the do-it-yourself PC builder are readily available, with many places around for the hunter n [[1860]].

==Assessment of his achievements==
The caution which the archduke preached so earnestly in his strategical works, he displayed in practice only when the situation seemed to demand it, though his education certainly prejudiced him in favour of the defensive at all costs. He was at the same time capable of forming and executing the most daring offensive strategy, and his tactical skill in the handling of troops, whether in wide turning movements, as at Würzburg and Zürich, or in masses, as at Aspern and Wagram, was certainly equal to that of any leader of his time, with only a few exceptions.

His campaign of [[1796]] is considered almost faultless. That he sustained defeat in 1809 was due in part to the great numerical superiority of the French and their allies, and in part to the condition of his newly reorganized troops. His six weeks' inaction after the victory of Aspern is, however, open to unfavourable criticism. As a military writer, his position in the evolution of the art of war is very important, and his doctrines had naturally the greatest weight. Nevertheless they cannot but be considered as antiquated even in 1806. Caution and the importance of strategic points are the chief features of his system. The rigidity of his geographical strategy may be gathered from the prescription that this principle is never to be departed from.

Again and again he repeats the advice that nothing should be hazarded unless one's army is completely secure, a rule which he himself neglected with such brilliant results in 1796. Strategic points, he says (not the defeat of the enemy's army), decide the fate of one's own country, and must constantly remain the general's main solicitude, a maxim which was never more remarkably disproved than in the war of 1809. The editor of the archduke's work is able to make but a feeble defence against [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]]'s reproach that Charles attached more value to ground than to the annihilation of the foe. In his tactical writings the same spirit is conspicuous. His reserve in battle is designed to cover a retreat. 
[[Image:Archduke_Charles_Statue.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Statue of Archduke Charles on the [[Heldenplatz]] in [[Vienna]].]]
The baneful influence of these antiquated principles was clearly shown in the maintenance of Königgratz-Josefstadt in [[1866]] as a strategic point, which was preferred to the defeat of the separated Prussian armies. In the strange plans produced in Vienna for the campaign of 1859, and in the almost unintelligible [[Battle of Montebello (1859)|Battle of Montebello]] in the same year. The theory and the practice of Archduke Charles form one of the most curious contrasts in military history. In the one he is unreal, in the other he displayed, along with the greatest skill, a vivid activity which made him for long the most formidable opponent of Napoleon.

On the battlefield, it is probably fair to say, Charles was comparable in skill and style to Sir [[Arthur Wellesley]] - quite conservative and yet exceedingly competent. That Wellesley emerged with a superior reputation is probably due to the fact that he only once faced Napoleon and even then was only co-commander of an Allied force. By contrast Charles was confronted by Napoleon in battle more times than any other commander. On these occasions the reliable and yet unimaginative tactics Charles was fond of were not sufficient (except on one occasion at Aspern-Essling) to defeat the unpredictable Corsican. Nonetheless Charles is a member of a pantheon of famous Napoleonic figures that includes the Emperor himself, [[Louis Nicolas Davout]], [[Karl Philipp Fürst zu Schwarzenberg|Karl von Schwarzenberg]], [[Alexander Suvorov]], [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher]] and the aforementioned Sir Arthur Wellesley.

==Writings and References==
His writings were edited by Archduke Albert and his brother Archduke William in the ''Ausgewählte Schriften weiland Sr. K. Hoheit Erzh. Carl v. Osterreich'' (1862; reprinted 1893, Vienna and Leipzig), which includes the ''Grundsätze der Kriegskunst für die Generale'' (1806), ''Grundsätze der Strategie erläutert durch die Darstellung des Feldzugs 1796'' (1814), ''Geschichte des Feldzugs von 299'' (1819)--the two latter invaluable contributions to the history of the war, and papers on the higher art of war, on practical training in the field, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Augustine of Canterbury''' (birth unknown, died [[May 26]], [[604]]) was the first [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], sent to [[Ethelbert of Kent]], [[Bretwalda]] of England by [[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]] in [[597]].  He was accompanied by [[Laurence of Canterbury]], the second [[archbishop]].

In [[596]], Augustine was ''praepositus'' (prior) of the monastery of [[Saint Andrew]], founded by [[Pope Gregory I]], and was sent by Gregory at the head of forty monks to preach to the Anglo-Saxons. They lost heart on the way and Augustine went back to Rome from [[Provence]] and asked that the mission be given up.  The pope, however, commanded and encouraged them to proceed, and they landed on the Island of [[Thanet]] in the spring of [[597]]. 

Ethelbert's wife Bertha, daughter of [[Charibert]], one of the [[Merovingian]] kings of the [[Franks]], had brought a chaplain with her (Liudhard) and either built a church, or restored a church in Canterbury from Roman times, and dedicated it to [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin of Tours]] (either of which is possibly [[Church of St. Martin, Canterbury|St. Martin's]]), a major patronal saint for the Merovingian royal family. Ethelbert himself was a [[Paganism|pagan]], but allowed his wife to worship God her own way.  Probably under influence of his wife, Ethelbert asked [[Pope Gregory I]] to send missionaries.

Ethelbert permitted the missionaries to settle and preach in his town of [[Canterbury]] and before the end of the year he was converted and Augustine was consecrated bishop at [[Arles]]. At [[Christmas]] 10,000 of the king's subjects were baptized. 

Augustine sent a report of his success to Gregory with certain questions concerning his work. In [[601]] [[Mellitus]], [[Justus]] and others brought the pope's replies, with the [[pallium]] for Augustine and a present of sacred vessels, [[vestment]]s, [[relic]]s, books, and the like. Gregory directed the new archbishop to ordain as soon as possible twelve [[suffragan]] [[bishop]]s and to send a bishop to [[York]], who should also have twelve suffragans &amp;mdash; a plan which was not carried out, nor was the primatial [[episcopal see|see]] established at [[London]] as Gregory intended. Augustine consecrated [[Mellitus]] Bishop of London and Justus Bishop of [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]].

More practicable were the pope's mandates concerning heathen temples and usages: the former were to be consecrated to Christian service and the latter, so far as possible, to be transformed into dedication ceremonies or feasts of martyrs, since &quot;he who would climb to a lofty height must go up by steps, not leaps&quot; (letter of Gregory to Mellitus, in [[Bede]], i, 30). 

Augustine reconsecrated and rebuilt an old church at Canterbury as his cathedral and founded a monastery in connection with it. He also restored a church and founded the monastery of St. Peter and St. Paul outside the walls. He is claimed to have founded [[The King's School, Canterbury]], which would make it the world's oldest school; however there may be little more to this than that some teaching took place at the monastery.

His attempts to effect a union with the [[Old British Church]] in [[Wales]] failed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alexander Hales'''
(also '''Halensis''', '''Alensis''', '''Halesius''', '''Alesius'''; called  ''Doctor Irrefragabilis'' and ''Theologorum Monarcha'') was a [[scholasticism|scholastic ]] [[theology|theologian]]. He was born at [[Hales]], [[Gloucestershire]], [[England]], and died in [[Paris]] on [[August 21]], [[1245]]. He was educated in the monastery at Hales, studied and lectured at Paris, acquired great fame as a teacher in theology, and entered the [[Franciscan|Franciscan order]] in [[1222]]. 

Alexander was the first to write a commentary on the [[Sentences]] of [[Peter Lombard]], before him theologians had always commented upon the scriptures. His ''Summa universae theologiae'' (first printed at [[Venice, Italy|Venice]], [[1475]]) was undertaken at the request of  [[Pope Innocent IV]], and received his approbation. It was finished by Alexander's scholars after his death. It is an independent work giving a triple series of  authorities-- those who say yes, those who say no, and then the reconciliation or judgment. The authorities are chosen not only from the [[Bible]] and the Fathers, but also among Greek, Latin, and Arabic poets and philosophers, and later theologians. It treats in its first part the doctrines of [[God]] and his attributes; in its second, those of [[creation (theology)|Creation]] and [[sin]]; in its third, those of [[redemption]] and [[atonement]]; and, in its fourth and last, those of the [[sacrament]]s.  In recognition of his efforts, Alexander was given the title of &quot;Doctor Irrefragabilis&quot;.

Among the doctrines which were specially developed and, so to speak, fixed by Alexander of Hales, are those of the  ''[[thesaurus supererogationis perfectorum]]'', and of the ''[[sacramental character|character indelibilis]]'' of [[baptism]], 
[[confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]], and [[Holy Orders|ordination]].  That doctrine had been written about much earlier by [[Augustine of Hippo]] and was eventually defined a [[dogma]] by the [[Council of Trent]].

John Gerson tells us “The doctrine of Alexander is of a wealth surpassing all expression. It is said that someone asked St. Thomas what was the best manner of studying theology; he replied that it was by attaching oneself to a Master. And to which Doctor? he was asked again. To Alexander of Hales, the [[Thomas Aquinas|Angelic Doctor]] replied.&quot; (Gerson, Opera omnia.Epistola Lugdunum missa cuidam fratri Minori, vol. 1, p. 554.)

Compare [[Hailes Abbey]], Gloucestershire, founded in 1245/6.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For other meanings, see [[ASP]].'' 
'''Active Server Pages''' ('''ASP''') is [[Microsoft]]'s [[Server (computing)|server]]-side technology for dynamically-generated web pages that is marketed as an add-on to [[Internet Information Services]] (IIS).

Programming ASP [[website]]s is made easier by various [[Wiktionary:built-in|built-in]] [[Object (computer science)|objects]].  Each object corresponds to a group of frequently-used functionality useful for creating [[dynamic web page]]s.  In ASP 3.0 there are six such built-in objects: Application, ASPError, Request, Response, Server and Session. Session, for example, is a [[cookie]]-based [[Session (computer science)|session]] object that maintains [[variable]]s from page to page.  [[Application Center Test]] is also available for load testing.

Most ASP pages are written in [[VBScript]], but any other [[Active Scripting]] engine can be selected instead by using the &lt;tt&gt;@Language&lt;/tt&gt; directive. [[JScript]] (Microsoft's implementation of [[ECMAScript]]) is the other language that is usually available. PerlScript ([[Perl]]) and others are available as third-party installable Active Scripting engines.

==Versions==
ASP has gone through four major releases:

* ASP 1.0 (distributed with IIS 3.0) in December 1996, 
* ASP 2.0 (distributed with IIS 4.0) in September 1997, 
* ASP 3.0 (distributed with IIS 5.0) in November 2000,
* [[ASP.NET]] (part of the [[.NET Framework|Microsoft .NET platform]]) in January 2002 (the pre-.NET versions are currently referred to as &quot;classic&quot; ASP)
* ASP.NET version 2.0 (released on November 7th, 2005).

ASP.NET introduced the ability to replace in-HTML scripting with full-fledged support for [[.NET Framework|.NET]] languages such as [[Visual Basic .NET]] and [[C Sharp programming language|C#]].  In-page scripting can still be used (and is fully supported), but now pages can use VB.NET and C# classes to generate pages instead of code in HTML pages.

==Apache::ASP==
[http://www.apache-asp.org/ Apache::ASP] provides an Active Server Pages port to the Apache Web Server with Perl scripting only, and enables developing of dynamic web applications with session management and embedded Perl code.

'''Amoxicillin''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) or '''amoxycillin''' (former [[British Approved Name|BAN]]) is a moderate-spectrum [[beta-lactam antibiotic|&amp;beta;-lactam antibiotic]] used to treat bacterial [[infection]]s caused by susceptible [[microorganism]]s. It is usually the drug of choice within the class because it is better absorbed, following oral administration, than other beta-lactam antibiotics.  Amoxicillin is susceptible to degradation by [[beta-lactamase|&amp;beta;-lactamase]]-producing bacteria, and so may be given with [[Clavulanic acid]] to increase its susceptability (see below).  It is currently marketed by [[GlaxoSmithKline]] under the trade name '''Amoxil'''&amp;reg;.

==Mode of action==
Amoxicillin acts by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls. It inhibits cross-linkage between the linear peptidoglycan polymer chains that make up a major component of the cell wall of [[Gram-positive]] bacteria.

''Main article: [[beta-lactam antibiotic]]''

==Microbiology==
Amoxicillin is a moderate-spectrum antibiotic active against a wide range of [[Gram-positive]], and a limited range of [[Gram-negative]] organisms. Some examples of susceptible and resistant organisms, from the Amoxil® Approved Product Information (GSK, 2003), are listed below.

===Susceptible Gram-positive organisms===
''[[Streptococcus]]'' spp., ''[[Diplococcus]] pneumoniae'', non [[beta-lactamase|&amp;beta;-lactamase]]-producing ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' spp., and ''[[Streptococcus]] faecalis.''

===Susceptible Gram-negative organisms===
''[[Haemophilus]] influenzae'', ''[[Neisseria]] gonorrhoeae'', ''[[Neisseria]] meningitidis'', ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Proteus (bacterium)|Proteus]] mirabilis'' and ''[[Salmonella]] spp.''

===Resistant organisms===
Penicillinase producing organisms, particularly penicillinase producing ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' spp. Penicillinase-producing ''N. gonorrhoeae'' and ''H. influenzae'' are also resistant

All strains of ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' spp., ''[[Klebsiella]]'' spp., ''[[Enterobacter]]'' spp., [[indole]]-positive ''[[Proteus (bacterium)|Proteus]]'' spp., ''[[Serratia]]'' marcescens, and ''[[Citrobacter]]'' spp. are resistant.

The incidence of &amp;beta;-lactamase-producing resistant organisms, including ''E. coli'', appears to be increasing.

Doubling the routinely given concentration (in pediatrics) of amoxicillin has been shown to eradicate intermediately resistant organisms (Red Book, 2003 Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases, American Academy of Pediatrics).

==Formulations==
Amoxicillin in trihydrate form is avaialable as capsules or syrup for oral use, and as the sodium salt for intravenous administration.

== Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid ==
Amoxicillin (in either trihydrate or sodium salt forms) may be combined with [[Clavulanic acid]] (as [[potassium clavulanate]]), a &amp;beta;-lactamase inhibitor, to increase the spectrum of action against [[Gram-negative]] organisms, and to overcome bacterial antibiotic resistance mediated through &amp;beta;-lactamase production. This formulation is referred to as [[Co-amoxiclav]] ([[British Approved Name]]), but more commonly by proprietary names such as [[Augmentin]]® and Clamoxyl®.

''Main article: [[Co-amoxiclav]]''

== Proprietary Preparations ==
The patent for amoxicillin has expired. Thus amoxicillin is marketed under many trade names including: Actimoxi®, Amoxibiotic®, Amoxicilina®, Dispermox&amp;reg;,Pamoxicillin®, Lamoxy®, Ospamox®, Polymox®, Trimox®, Tolodina®, Wymox® and Zimox®.

      <comment>provided miss[[Haganah]]'s transformation into the Israel Defense Forces), Sharon was a [[platoon]] commander in the [[Alexandroni Brigade]]. Sharon was severely wounded in the [[groin]] by the [[Jordan]]ian [[Arab Legion]] in the Second Battle of [[Latrun]], an unsuccessful attempt to relieve the [[Siege|besieged]] [[Jew]]ish community of [[Jerusalem]]. His injuries eventually healed. 

In September 1949, he was [[Promotion|promoted]] to [[Company (military unit)|company]] commander (of the Golani Brigade's reconnaissance unit) and in 1950 to [[intelligence officer]] for Central Command. He then took leave to begin studies of history and Middle Eastern culture at the [[Hebrew University|Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. A year and a half later, he was asked to return to active service in the rank of [[major]] and as the leader of the new [[Unit 101]], Israel's first [[special forces]] unit.

Unit 101 undertook a series of [[Revenge|retaliatory]] [[raid]]s against [[Palestinian]]s and neighboring [[Arab]] states that helped bolster Israeli morale and fortify its [[deterrence|deterrent]] image. However, the unit was also known for targeting civilians as well as Arab soldiers, notably in the widely condemned [[Qibya massacre|Qibya operation]] in the fall of 1953, in which 69 Palestinian civilians, half of which were women and children, were killed by Sharon's troops in a reprisal attack on their [[West Bank]] village.  In the [[documentary]] &quot;Israel and the Arabs: 50 Year War&quot; Ariel Sharon recalls what happened after the raid, which was heavily condemned by many countries in the West, including the U.S.:

:''I was summoned to see [[David Ben-Gurion|Ben-Gurion]]. It was the first time I met him, and right from the start Ben-Gurion said to me: &quot;Let me first tell you one thing: it doesn't matter what the world says about Israel, it doesn't matter what they say about us anywhere else. The only thing that matters is that we can exist here on the land of our forefathers. And unless we show the Arabs that there is a high price to pay for murdering Jews, we won't survive.&quot;''

Shortly afterwards, just a few months after its founding, Unit 101 was merged into the 202nd [[Paratroopers Brigade]] (Sharon eventually became the latter's commander), which continued to attack military and civilian targets, culminating with the attack on [[Qalqilyah]] police station in autumn 1956.

Sharon has been [[widow]]ed twice. Shortly after becoming a [[Drill instructor|military instructor]], he married his first wife, [[Margalit Sharon|Margalit]], with whom he had a son, Gur.  Margalit died in a [[car accident]] in 1962. Their son, Gur, died in October 1967 after a friend shot him while they were playing with the elder Sharon's [[rifle]]. [http://www.smh.com.au/news/Middle-East-Conflict/Sharon-mourns-slain-son/2005/02/14/1108229937965.html] [http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,589127,00.html] [http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0306/14/pitn.00.html] After Margalith's death, Sharon married her younger sister, [[Lily Sharon|Lily]]. They had two sons, [[Omri Sharon|Omri]] and [[Gilad Sharon|Gil'ad]]. Lily Sharon died in 2000.

==Mitla incident==
In the [[1956 Suez War]] (the British &quot;[[Operation Musketeer]]&quot;), Sharon commanded the 202nd Brigade and was responsible for taking ground east of the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]]'s [[Mitla Pass]] and eventually taking the pass itself. Having successfully carried out the first part of his mission (joining a battalion paratrooped near Mitla with the rest of the brigade moving on ground), Sharon's unit was deployed near the pass. Neither [[reconnaissance aircraft]] nor [[Reconnaissance|scouts]] reported enemy forces inside the Mitla Pass. Sharon, whose forces were initially heading east, away from the pass, reported to his superiors that he was increasingly concerned with the possibility of an enemy thrust through the pass, which could attack his brigade from the flank or the rear.

Sharon asked for permission to attack the pass several times but his requests were denied although he was allowed to check its status so that if the pass was empty, he could receive permission to take it later. Sharon sent a small scout force which was met with heavy fire and became bogged down due to vehicle [[malfunction]] in the middle of the pass. Sharon ordered the rest of his troops to attack in order to aid their comrades. In the ensuing successful battle to capture the pass thirty-eight Israeli soldiers were killed. Sharon was not only criticized by his superiors, he was damaged by revelations several years later by several former subordinates (one of IDF's first major revelations to the press), who claimed that Sharon tried to provoke the [[Egypt]]ians and sent out the scouts in bad faith, ensuring that a battle would ensue. Deliberate or not, the attack was considered strategically reckless because the Egyptian forces were expected to withdraw from the pass in the following one or two days.

==Six-Day War and Yom Kippur War==
{{main articles|[[Six-Day War]] and [[Yom Kippur War]]}}
The Mitla incident hindered Sharon's military career for several years. In the meantime, he occupied the position of an infantry brigade commander and received a [[law degree]] from [[Tel Aviv University]]. When [[Yitzhak Rabin]] (who within a few years became associated with the [[Labour (Israel)|Labour Party]]) became [[Chief of Staff]] in 1962, however, Sharon began again to rise rapidly in the ranks, occupying the positions of Infantry School Commander and Head of Army Training Branch, eventually achieving the rank of [[Major General]] (''[[Aluf]]''). In the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], Sharon commanded the most powerful armored division on the Sinai [[Front (military)|front]] which made a breakthrough in the Kusseima-Abu-Ageila fortified area. In 1969, he was appointed the Head of IDF's Southern Command. He had no further promotions before retiring in August 1973. Soon after, he joined the right-wing Likud [[political party]].[http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/storyville/ariel-sharon.shtml] 

[[Image:Arik_Sharon_with_Bandage_Dayan.jpg|right|thumb|22
30px|Sharon (in bandage) with [[Moshe Dayan]] (right) in 1973]]

Sharon' s military career was not over, however. At the start of the [[Yom Kippur War]] on [[October 6]] [[1973]], Sharon was called back to duty and assigned to command a reserve armored division. His forces did not engage the [[Egyptian Army]] immediately but it was Sharon who helped locate a breach between the Egyptian forces, which he then exploited by capturing a [[bridgehead]] on [[October 16]] and throwing a bridge across the [[Suez Canal]] the following day. He violated his orders from the head of Southern Command by exploiting this success to cut the [[supply line]]s of the Egyptian Third Army, located to the south of the canal crossing, isolating it from other Egyptian units.

The divisions of Sharon and [[Abraham Adan|Abraham Adan]] (Bren) passed over this bridge into [[Africa]] advancing to within 101 kilometers of [[Cairo]]. They wreaked havoc on the supply lines of the Third Army stretching to the south of them, cutting off and [[Encirclement|encircling]] the Third Army, but could not force its surrender before the [[cease-fire]]. Tensions between the two generals followed his decision, but a [[military tribunal]] later found his action was militarily effective. This move was regarded by many Israelis as the turning point of the war in the Sinai front. Thus, Sharon is viewed by some as a [[war hero]] who saved Israel from defeat in Sinai. A photo of Sharon wearing a head bandage on the Suez Canal became a famous symbol of Israeli military prowess.

Sharon's aggressive political positions were controversial and he was relieved of duty in February 1974.

==Sabra and Shatila massacre==
{{main|Sabra and Shatila massacre}}
During the [[1982 Lebanon War]], while Ariel Sharon was [[Defense minister]], the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] took place, in which between 460 and 3,500 Palestinian civilians in the [[refugee camp]]s were killed by Lebanese Christian forces under the command of Lebanese [[Maronite]] [[Phalange]] [[militia]]. The Security Chief of the Phalange militia, [[Elie Hobeika]], was the ground commander of the militiamen who entered the Palestinian camps and killed the Palestinians. The Phalange had been sent into the camps to clear out [[PLO]] fighters, and Israeli forces had been sent to the camps at Sharon's command to provide them with [[logistical]] support and to guard camp exits.

The [[Kahan Commission]] claimed that &quot;absolutely no direct responsibility devolves upon Israel or upon those who acted in its behalf.&quot; Yet it did charge Sharon with &quot;personal responsibility.&quot; It recommended in early 1983 the removal of Sharon from his post as Defense minister. In their recommendations and closing remarks, the commission stated:

:''We have found, as has been detailed in this report, that the Minister of Defense [Ariel Sharon] bears personal responsibility. In our opinion, it is fitting that the Minister of Defense draw the appropriate personal conclusions arising out of the defects revealed with regard to the manner in which he discharged the duties of his office - and if necessary, that the [[Prime Minister]] consider whether he should exercise his authority under Section 21-A(a) of the Basic Law: the Government, according to which &quot;the Prime Minister may, after informing the Cabinet of his intention to do so, remove a minister from office.&quot;''[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1982-1984/104%20Report%20of%20the%20Commission%20of%20Inquiry%20into%20the%20e]

Nevertheless the [[Kahan Commission]] did not interview Palestinian survivors of the massacre.

Journalist [[Robert Fisk]], based on some eyewitness accounts and his own investigation, alleged that Sharon and the IDF bore a greater responsibility for the massacre, describing Sharon's efforts to stop the massacre as &quot;pitiful&quot; and &quot;inadequate&quot;.

An AP report on [[15 September]] [[1982]] stated : 

:''Defence Minister Ariel Sharon, in a statement, tied the killing [of the Phalangist leader Gemayel] to the PLO, saying: &quot;It symbolises the terrorist murderousness of the PLO terrorist organisations and their supporters.&quot;  Habib Chartouni, a Lebanese Christian from the Syrian Socialist National Party confessed to the murder of Gemayel, and no Palestinians were involved. Sharon had used this to instigate the entrance of the Lebanese militias into the camps.''[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/fisk/article336785.ece]

Sharon was dismissed by Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]] but he remained in successive governments as a Minister.

In 1987, [[Time Magazine|''TIME'' magazine]] published a story implying Sharon was directly responsible for the massacres. Sharon [[Lawsuit|sued]] ''Time'' for [[Slander and libel|libel]] in American and Israeli [[court]]s. ''Time'' won the suit in the U.S. court because although the [[jury]] found the article false and defamatory, Sharon could not establish that ''Time'' had &quot;acted out of malice,&quot; as required under the U.S. law. [http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=10&amp;x_subject=3]

On [[June 18]], [[2001]], relatives of the victims of the Sabra massacre began proceedings in [[Belgium]] to have Ariel Sharon indicted on war crimes charges [http://www.caabu.org/campaigns/complaint-against-sharon.html]. In June 2002, a [[Brussels]] Appeals Court rejected the lawsuit because the law was subsequently changed under heavy U.S. pressure to disallow such lawsuits unless a Belgian citizen is involved. [http://www.droit.fundp.ac.be/cours/pen/JC032C1.pdf]

==Political career==
When Sharon joined Begin's government he had relatively little political experience. He avoided Begin's [[Herut]] party in the 1940s and 1950s and seemed to be personally devoted to the ideals of [[Mapai]], and then Labor. However, after retiring from military service, Sharon was instrumental in establishing the [[Likud]] in July 1973. The [[Likud]] was comprised of [[Herut]], the [[Israel Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] and independent elements. Sharon became chairman of the campaign staff for the elections which were scheduled for November 1973. But two and a half weeks after the start of the election campaign, the [[Yom Kippur War]] erupted and Sharon was called back to reserve service (''see above''). In December 1973 Sharon was elected to the [[Knesset]], but a year later he tired of political life and resigned.

From June 1975 to March 1976, Sharon was a special aide to Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]]. With the 1977 elections near, Sharon tried to return to the Likud and replace [[Menachem Begin]] at the head of the party. He suggested to [[Simcha Ehrlich]], who headed the Liberal Party bloc in the Likud, that he was more fitting than Begin to win an election victory; but he was rejected. Following this he tried to join the [[Israel Labor Party|Labour Party]] and the centrist [[Shinui|DASH]], but was rejected in those parties too. Only then did he form his own list, [[Shlomtzion Party|Shlomtzion]], which won only two Knesset seats in the subsequent elections. Immediately after the elections he merged Shlomtzion with the Likud and became Minister of Agriculture.

During this period, Sharon supported the [[Gush Emunim]] settlements movement and was viewed as the patron of the messianic settlers' movement. He used his position to encourage the establishment of a network of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories to prevent the possibility of the return of these territories to Palestinian Arabs. Sharon doubled the number of Jewish settlements on the West Bank and Gaza Strip during his tenure.

On his settlement policy, Sharon said while addressing a meeting of the Tsomet Party: &quot;Everybody has to move, run and grab as many (Palestinian) hilltops as they can to enlarge the (Jewish) settlements because everything we take now will stay ours... Everything we don't grab will go to them.&quot; (Agence France Presse, [[15 November]] [[1998]].)

After the 1981 elections, Begin rewarded Sharon for his important contribution to Likud's narrow win, by appointing him Minister of Defense. (''See above for further information about Sharon's tenure as Minister of Defense.'')

After being dismissed from the Defense Minister post because the Kahan Commission found him &quot;personally responsible&quot; for his &quot;disregard of the danger of a massacre,&quot; Sharon remained in successive governments as a Minister without portfolio (1983&amp;ndash;1984), Minister for Trade and Industry (1984&amp;ndash;1990), and Minister for Housing Construction (1990&amp;ndash;1992). During this period he was a rival to then prime minister [[Yitzhak Shamir]], but failed in various bids to replace him as chairman of the ruling [[Likud]] party. Their rivalry reached a head on the &quot;Night of Microphones&quot; in February 1990, when Sharon snapped the microphone from Shamir, who was addressing the Likud central committee, and famously exclaimed: &quot;Who's for wiping out terrorism?&quot;. The implication was that only Sharon knew how to destroy the scourge and whoever deemed this as important should support him. The incident was widely viewed as an apparent [[putsch]] attempt against Shamir's leadership of the party.

==Prime Minister==

In [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s 1996&amp;ndash;1999 government, he was Minister of National Infrastructure (1996&amp;ndash;1998), and Foreign Minister (1998&amp;ndash;1999). Upon the election of the [[Ehud Barak|Barak]] Labor government, Sharon became leader of the Likud party. After the collapse of Barak's government, he was elected Prime Minister in February 2001.

[[The Greek island affair]] involves attempts by [[David Appel]] to purchase an island near the coast of [[Athens]] for the purpose of building a multimillion-dollar resort complex.
While Ariel Sharon was [[Foreign Minister]] under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 1999, Appel contracted to pay his Sharon's son, [[Gilad Sharon|Gilad]], then 30 years old and a business novice, $20,000 monthly as a business consultant. According to reports, Gilad might have received up to $3 million had the project been successful.
Police believe Appel signed the contract with Gilad Sharon in order to secure his father's help in facilitating the resort project. Sharon later hosted the deputy foreign minister of [[Greece]] during his visit to Israel. Appel is widely suspected of bribing [[Ehud Olmert]], the former mayor of [[Jerusalem]] into helping him by funding an official banquet held for the Athenian mayor. 
In return for the aid received from both Likud leaders, Appel allegedly contributed to the campaigns of both men when they ran for chairman of the Likud after Netanyahu's resignation in 1999. On [[June 14]] [[2004]], Israel's Attorney General, [[Meni Mazouz]], decided to close the case due to lack of evidence and prosecutorial misconduct.

[[Image:Red Sea Summit in Aqaba.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palestinian]] Prime Minister [[Mahmoud Abbas]], [[United States]] President [[George W. Bush]], and Ariel Sharon after reading statement to the press during the closing moments of the Red Sea Summit in [[Aqaba]], [[Jordan]], [[June 4]] [[2003]].]]

According to the Palestinians, Ariel Sharon has followed an aggressive policy of non-negotiation. Palestinians allege that the [[al-Aqsa Intifada]] (September 2000&amp;ndash;February 2005) was sparked by a visit by Sharon and an escort of several hundred policemen to the [[Haram al-Sharif]]/[[Temple Mount]] complex, site of the [[Dome of the Rock]] and [[al-Aqsa Mosque]]. Sharon's visit, prior to his election as Prime Minister, came after archeologists claimed that extensive building operations at the site were destroying priceless antiquities and a few months before the election. While visiting the site, Sharon declared that the complex would remain under perpetual Israeli control. Palestinian commentators accused Sharon of purposely inflaming emotions with the event to provoke a violent response and obstruct success of delicate ongoing peace talks.

Sharon's supporters claim that [[Yasser Arafat]] and the [[Palestinian Authority]] planned the intifada. [http://www.mafhoum.com/press3/111P55.htm] [http://www.townhall.com/columnists/charleskrauthammer/ck20010520.shtml] [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/myths/mf19.html#a1] [http://www.eretzyisroel.org/~jkatz/alaksa.html]. They state that Palestinian security chief Jabril Rajoub provided assurances that if Sharon did not enter the mosques, no problems would arise. They also often quote statements by Palestinian Authority officials, particularly Imad Falouji, the P.A. Communications Minister, who admitted months after Sharon's visit that the violence had been planned in July, far in advance of Sharon's visit, stating the intifada &quot;was carefully planned since the return of (Palestinian President) Yasser Arafat from [[Camp David]] negotiations rejecting the U.S. conditions.&quot;[http://gulf-news.com/Articles/print.asp?ArticleID=11166][http://jewishweek.org/news/newscontent.php3?artid=3846] According to the Mitchell Report, the government of Israel asserted that
[[Image:sharon_bush_abbas.jpg|thumb|left|President [[George W. Bush]], center, discusses the [[Peace process in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict|Middle East peace process]] with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel, left, and Palestinian Prime Minister [[Mahmoud Abbas]] in [[Aqaba]], [[Jordan]], [[June 4]], [[2003]].]]
:''the immediate catalyst for the violence was the breakdown of the Camp David negotiations on [[25 July]] [[2000]] and the &amp;#8220;widespread appreciation in the international community of Palestinian responsibility for the impasse.&amp;#8221; In this view, Palestinian violence was planned by the PA leadership, and was aimed at &amp;#8220;provoking and incurring Palestinian casualties as a means of regaining the diplomatic initiative.&amp;#8221;''
The Mitchell Report, based on a subsequent investigation, also found that the Sharon visit did not cause the Al-Aqsa Intifada, though it was poorly timed and would clearly have a provocative effect.[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/Mitchellrep.html]

Palestinians doubt the existence of popular support for Sharon's actions. Polls published in the media, as well as the 140% call-up of reservists (as opposed to the 60% in regular periods) seem to indicate that the Israeli public is quite supportive of Sharon's policies. A survey conducted by Tel Aviv University's Jaffe Center in May 2004 found that 80% of Jewish Israelis believe that the Israel Defense Forces have succeeded in militarily countering the Al-Aqsa Intifada, [http://spirit.tau.ac.il/socant/peace/peaceindex/2004/data/may2004d.pdf] indicating widespread faith in Sharon's hard-line policy.

[[Image:Bush sharon.jpg|thumb|President Bush and Prime Minister Sharon meet in the White House on [[14 April]] [[2004]].]]

On [[July 20]] [[2004]], Sharon called on [[France|French]] [[Jew]]s to emigrate from France to Israel immediately, in light of an increase in French [[anti-Semitism]] (94 anti-Semitic assaults reported in the first six months of 2004 compared to 47 in 2003). France has the third largest Jewish population (about 600,000 people), after the [[United States]] and [[Israel]]. Sharon claimed that an &quot;unfettered anti-Semitism&quot; reigned in France. The French government responded by describing his comments as &quot;unacceptable&quot;, as did the French representative Jewish organization [[CRIF]], which denied Sharon's claim of intense anti-Semitism in French society. An Israeli spokesperson later claimed that Sharon had been misunderstood. France then postponed a visit by Sharon. Upon his visit, both Sharon and Chirac were described as showing a willingness to put the issue behind them.

On [[July 26]], [[2005]], Israeli attorney general [[Menachem Mazuz]] announced that he would indict Sharon's son, [[Omri Sharon|Omri]], on charges of [[political corruption|corruption]]. Omri had [[parliamentary immunity]] at the time, but indicated willingness to stand trial. The Knesset passed a law limiting members' immunity in order to allow the indictment and Omri was formally indicted on [[August 28]].

==Gaza evacuation==
While some believe that his recent efforts have been damaging to the peace process, he has embarked on a risky course of unilateral withdrawal from the [[Gaza Strip]], while maintaining control of its coastline and airspace. It has been welcomed by both the [[Palestinian Authority]] and the left-wing in Israel, as well as by many abroad, including the United States and the [[European Union]], as a step towards a final peace settlement. However, it has been greeted with opposition from within his own Likud party and from other right-wing Israelis, on security, military, and religious grounds. Other detractors have publicly distrusted Sharon's motives for this plan, and their suspicions were further roused after publication of an interview with top Sharon aide Dov Weisglass in the Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' on [[October 8]] [[2004]], in which he explained Israel's motivation for withdrawing from Gaza. He told the newspaper that both Israel and the US felt Palestinian terrorism must end before a political process leading to a Palestinian state begins. Otherwise, Weisglass said, &quot;the result would be a Palestinian state with terrorism...&quot; The Gaza withdrawal would allow Israel to delay negotiations, and a Palestinian state, until such time that their leadership abandons violence. Critics interpreted Weisglass' comments as saying the purpose of disengagement was to destroy Palestinian aspirations for a state for years to come. This incident has bolstered tnd [[grenade]]s and [[land mine|landmines]] were not unheard of either, especially in the [[Middle East]] and Balkans (the initial attempt on Archduke Franz Ferdinand's life was with a grenade; he was on his way to visit an aide injured in the first attack when his driver stopped to ask directions and he and his wife were shot). Also, [[Rocket propelled grenade]]s (RPGs) became an especially useful tool, given the popularity of armored cars discussed below. Today, any manner of different techniques for the elimination of an enemy - popular or not - might be utilized; the sky, as it were, is the limit. One remarkable recent example involved a political figure who made the mistake of keeping to a regular route and schedule.  Assassins were able to plan for his travel, and detonated an explosive charge &lt;em&gt;beside&lt;/em&gt; the roadway, which propelled a metal plate through the target's vehicle at lethal speed, killing him.

One option glamorized in the media is using a [[sniper rifle]], such as the [[L96]]. The problem with this method is that using a sniper rifle generally attracts the attention of [[police]] and [[government]] authorities, which every smart bounty-hunter wishes to avoid.  A far more useful tool is the [[handgun]].  Deployed correctly and left at the scene of the incident, the completion of the contract can even be portrayed as a [[suicide]].

==Counter-measures==
It would not be a large stretch to say that, in addition to [[terrorism]], political assassination is one of the biggest threats to any modern [[state]] and its [[government]]. As such, the measures to which a leader goes to avoid professional killers ranges from what an average person would consider to be farcical to the paranoid to the downright bizarre. Many would argue, though, that such measures are a lot more effective than they first appear, and that in the world of a new threat seemingly each week, no security is too much.

One of the earliest forms of defense against assassins is without doubt the [[bodyguard]]. Essentially, the bodyguard functions as a counter-assassin, attempting to neutralize the killer before they can make contact with or inflict harm upon the &quot;principal&quot;, or protected/targeted official. This function was often executed by the leader's most loyal warriors, and was extremely effective throughout most of early human history, to the point where a direct assassination had to be replaced with carefully-planned [[subterfuge]], such as poison (which was answered by the [[food taster]] such as the [[Beefeater]]s protecting the [[England|English]] monarchs), and even then such methods were often thwarted. Notable examples of bodyguards would include the Roman [[Praetorian Guard]] or the Ottoman [[Janissary|janissaries]] — although, in both cases, it should be noted that the protectors often became assassins themselves, exploiting their power to make the [[head of state]] a virtual hostage at their whim or eliminating threatening leaders altogether.  Indeed, assassinations both then and today are most often effective when they have the support, tacit or open, of other powerful figures. This is less a concern in the West, where organizations such as the British [[Special Branch]] and American [[Secret Service]] are noted as well-trained and apolitical protective forces. Disloyal protectors continue to be a problem in developing nations, however; [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]] met such an end in 1984.

The race was on with the Middle Ages between leaders and assassins as gunpowder became predominant, each in turn trying to develop stronger and better checks against the increasing abilities of the other. One of the first reactions was to simply increase the guard, creating what at times might seem a [[brigade|small army]] trailing every leader; another was to begin clearing large areas whenever a leader was present, to the point where entire sections of a city might be shut down. Heads of state began to cease taking their armies onto the field personally around this time as well, although this was likely as much due to the increasing skills required for generalship and division of power within the government as it was for safety concerns.

As the 20th century dawned, the prevalence of assassins and their capabilities skyrocketed, and so did measures to protect against them. For the first time, [[armored car]]s or [[armored limousine]]s were put into service for safer transport, with modern versions rendering them virtually invulnerable to [[small arms]] fire. [[Bulletproof vest]]s were also commissioned, though not often used for political reasons. Access to famous persons, too, became more and more restrictive; potential visitors would be forced through dozens of different checks and double-checks before being granted access to the official in question, and as [[communication]] became better and [[information technology]] more prevalent, it has become next-to-impossible for a would-be killer to get close enough to the personage at work to effect an attempt on his or her life, especially given the common use of [[metal detector|metal]] and [[bomb detector]]s. As such most modern assassinations have been committed either during a public performance or during [[transport]], both due to weaker security and security lapses, such as with US [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] or as part of [[Coup d'état|coups d'état]] where security is either overwhelmed or completely removed, such as with [[Patrice Lumumba]] and possibly also [[Salvador Allende]].

Some of the wilder and arguably stranger methods used for protection by famous people of both today and yesterday have evoked many reactions from different people, some resenting the separation from their officials or major figures, some comforted by the security and some lamenting the state of society that such measures are necessary. One example might be traveling in a car protected by a bubble of clear [[bulletproof glass]], such as the [[Popemobile]] of [[Pope]] [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] (built following an extremist's attempt at his life). [[Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia|Frederick William I of Prussia]] had an entire command of soldiers above two [[meters]] of height, and would reportedly go to great lengths to obtain more. Many leaders, such as [[Josef Stalin]] or the Argentinean [[junta]] were so possessed by paranoia that they executed their opponents ''en masse'', with the death toll ranging from hundreds to millions. Still others go into seclusion, rarely heard from or seen in public afterwards, such as [[writer]] [[Salman Rushdie]] or eccentric [[inventor]] [[Howard Hughes]], though it is more likely that Hughes was concerned about [[germ]]s than about assassination. A more exotic form of protection is the use of a body double. A body double in this case is a person who is built similar to the person he is expected to protect and made up to look like him. The body double then takes the place of the person in high risk situations. Fidel Castro, Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein are known to have used [[political decoy|body doubles]].

It is important to note that, in the final analysis, it is thought by many that if a person or group is committed beyond [[reason]] or concerns for [[welfare|self-preservation]] towards the removal of a certain person or leader from not only their position but this plane of existence, then the chances are better than fair that any security measures taken will come to naught. The [[ninja]] of Japan and [[suicide bombers|suicide attackers]] are both groups known for pursuing every avenue for however long necessary to accomplish their 'hit'. Often, such people or groups would [[suicide|operate without concern for their own life]] in order to gain the slightest chance of eliminating their mark. Certain leaders, notably [[Abraham Lincoln]], were thought to have wrestled with this supposed inevitability during difficult times (with some, like Lincoln's, proving prophetic). In the end it comes down to will - if the will of the would-be assassins to execute their target surpasses that of their security to save them, or the will of the targeted person to survive, then success for a killer may be a matter of time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alcoholism''' (rel. [[drug abuse]]) is a chemical [[addiction]] to either or both the ''consumption of'' or the ''[[inebriation|inebriating]] effects of'' [[alcohol]].
 

== Terminology ==

There are many terms, such as use, [[misuse]], [[heavy use]], [[addiction]], [[abuse]] [[dependence]], all of which have different and sometimes non-standard meanings. 'Use' refers to simple use of a substance. 

An individual who drinks a beer once a day uses alcohol. Misuse and 'heavy use' do not have standard definitions in the field. 

Addiction has two meanings: 
*development of tolerance to the use of a substance (needs more of the substance to achieve the same effect). Withdrawal effects upon discontinuing use. 

*The second definition of addiction is a chemical [[addiction]] to either or both the ''consumption of'' or the ''[[inebriation|inebriating]] effects of'' [[alcohol]]. 

The first definition refers to physiologic dependence, something which for certain drugs can be created in anyone taking the drug. The second refers to the &quot;disease&quot; state of interest to readers of this section, and which cannot be created in an individual simply through use of the drug. 

Psychiatrists and some others refer to the second definition of addiction as dependence. This is where frequent confusion arises since physiologic dependence does not imply the existence of the disease state which psychiatrists call dependence. For example, a test subject might be given alcohol in increasing amounts each day to the extent that the individual would have severe withdrawal if the alcohol were suddenly stopped; in this case, physiologic dependence has formed, but no disease is present. Similarly, an alcoholic in recovery is not drinking at all yet still has the condition just as a diabetic who keeps his blood glucose at precisely 100 (normal) all the time is still diabetic. 

Neither individual would be likely to suffer significant symptoms secondary to their ongoing illness, yet both are still afflicted.

==Diagnosis==
There have been many efforts at diagnostic approaches to alcoholism. 

In a 1992 [[JAMA]] article, the [[Joint Committee of the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence]] and the [[American Society of Addiction Medicine]] published this definition for alcoholism: &quot;Alcoholism is a primary chronic disease with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. The disease is often progressive and fatal. It is characterized by impaired control over drinking, preoccupation with 
the drug alcohol, use of alcohol despite adverse consequences, and distortions in thinking, mostly denial. Each of these symptoms may be continuous or periodic.&quot;

The [[DSM IV]] diagnosis of alcohol dependence represents another approach to the definition of alcoholism, one more closely based on specifics than the 1992 JAMA article. In part this is to assist in the development of research protocols in which findings can be compared with one another, but the DSM definition is the one in general use from a diagnostic standpoint. That definition is: Maladaptive alcohol use with clinically significant impairment as manifested by at least three of the following within any one-year period: Tolerance; Withdrawal; Taken in greater amounts or over longer time course than intended; Desire or unsuccessful attempts to cut down or control use; Great deal of time spent obtaining, using, or recovering from use; Social, occupational, or recreational activities given up or reduced; Continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological sequelae.

Note that many [[sedative]] agents are cross-tolerant with alcohol (meaning that these agents can be taken instead of alcohol to relieve withdrawal symptoms or to maintain the level of sedation provided by alcohol). A more general diagnosis than alcohol dependence is that of sedative dependence. Whether an individual uses alcohol or another sedative, if they meet the criteria above, the process is likely the same.

==Biological mechanism==
The biological mechanism of alcoholism is unknown, although the biologic mechanism of alcohol metabolism and alcohol-induced behavioral change is well-described in the literature. Alcohol itself is not a factor in the development of this condition, however, or one would be able to turn a non-alcoholic into an alcoholic through the provision of alcohol (the literature has demonstrated that this is impossible).

==As a &quot;disease&quot;==
The American Society of Addiction Medicine and the American Medical Association both maintain extensive policy regarding alcoholism. The [[American Psychiatric Association]] recognizes the existence of &quot;alcoholism&quot; as the equivalent of alcohol dependence.  With the publication of the DSM-III in 1980, two separate syndromes of ''alcohol dependence'' and ''alcohol abuse'' replaced the earlier category of alcoholism.  The World Health Organization dropped the diagnostic category &quot;alcoholism&quot; in 1979, replacing it with the diagnostic categories &quot;alcohol dependence&quot; and &quot;harmful use&quot; (ICD-9, 
ICD-10)[http://alcoholism.about.com/cs/alerts/l/blnaa30.htm]. The [[American Hospital Association]], the [http://www.apha.org American Public Health Association], the [[National Association of Social Workers]], and the [[American College of Physicians]] classify &quot;alcoholism&quot; as a [[disease]].

[[Image:Stop_drinking.jpg|thumb|250px|Polish propaganda poster saying: &quot;Stop drinking! Come with us and build a happy tomorrow.&quot;]] The causes for alcohol abuse and dependence cannot be easily explained. However, the belief that the roots are from moral or ethical weakness on the part of the sufferer has been largely altered. A 1995 [[Gallup Poll]] found that 90% of Americans currently believe that &quot;alcoholism&quot; is a [[disease]].{{fact}}

In contrast, in a 1988 U.S. Supreme Court decision on whether alcoholism is a condition for which the U.S. Veterans Administration should provide benefits, Justice Byron R. White agrees with the U.S. District Court that there exists &quot;a substantial body of medical literature that even contests the proposition that alcoholism is a disease, much less that it is a disease for which the victim bears no responsibility.&quot; [4][5]

Whether or not alcoholism is a disease remains a controversial subject, and not all participants in the debate are without self-interest. For example, if alcoholism is not considered a disease, third-party payments to physicians and hospitals for its treatment might cease.

==Effects==

{{seealso2|Effects of alcohol on the body|Alcohol consumption and health}}
The use of alcohol in alcoholic conditions may have impact upon physical, occupational, marital, educational, and other areas of function. The condition can be lifelong but can be sometimes treated through ongoing therapy accompanied by attendance at self-help meetings. 


== Social impact ==

Today, alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence are major [[public health]] problems in [[North America]], costing the region's inhabitants, by some estimates, as much as [[US dollar|US$]]170 [[billion]] annually. Alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence are life-threatening problems that sometimes end in death, particularly through [[liver]], [[pancreas|pancreatic]], or [[kidney]] disease, internal bleeding, [[brain]] deterioration, [[alcohol poisoning]], and [[suicide]].  Heavy alcohol consumption by a pregnant mother can also lead to [[fetal alcohol syndrome]], an incurable and damaging condition.

Additionally, alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence are major contributing factors for [[head injury|head injuries]], [[motor vehicle accident]]s (MVA), violence and assaults, [[neurology|neurological]], and other [[medicine|medical]] problems ([[cirrhosis]], etc.).

Of the one half of the North American population who consume alcohol, it has been estimated by some that 10% are alcohol abusers and alcohol dependents, and 6% consume more than half of all alcohol.

[[Stereotype]]s of alcohol abusers and alcohol dependents are often found in [[fiction]] and [[popular culture]]: for example the &quot;[[town drunk]],&quot; or the [[stereotype]] of [[Russians]] and the [[Irish ethnicity|Irish]] as alcoholics. In modern times, the recovery movement has led to more realistic portraits of abusers and dependents and their problems, such as in [[Charles R. Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lost Weekend]]'', or the films ''[[Days of Wine and Roses (movie)|Days of Wine and Roses]]'', and ''[[My Name is Bill W]]'' or the extreme &quot;[[Leaving Las Vegas]]&quot;. [[Charles Bukowski]] describes honestly his alcohol addiction in the movie ''[[Barfly]]'' and in his other writings.
Alcohol dependence can be harder to break and significantly more damaging than dependence on most other addictive substances. The physical symptoms when withdrawing from alcohol can be quite severe and dangerous, with death reported in extreme cases.

The alcoholic personality can exhibit a radical change when they drink, from passive when sober to aggressive when drunk, though the reverse can also be true. 

An alcoholic does not have to be someone who is drunk every night, and a functional alcoholic can have largely normal work and family relationships. However, alcohol represents a major or the major focus of their lives.

===Long-term===
The long-term effects of high quantity alcohol use can include: 
* [[pancreatitis]], or inflammation of the [[pancreas]] (but the [[acute pancreatitis|acute]] and [[chronic pancreatitis|chronic]] form)
* [[heart disease]], including [[dilated cardiomyopathy]]
* [[polyneuropathy]], or damage to the [[nerves]] leading to poor sensation or pain
* [[cirrhosis]] of the [[liver]], a chronic disease characterized by destruction of liver cells and loss of liver function, and its numerous complications, including bleeding from [[esophageal varices]]
* [[clinical depression|depression]], [[insomnia]], [[anxiety]], and [[suicide]]
* [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure)
* increased incidence of many types of [[cancer]], including [[breast cancer]], [[head and neck cancer]], [[esophageal cancer]] and [[colorectal cancer]]
* [[nutritional deficiency]] of [[folic acid]], [[thiamine]] (vitamin B1) and several others
* [[Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome]], a neuropsychiatric disorder caused by thiamine deficiency that results from poor nutrition in alcoholics
*[[personality]] changes toward others, especially those who are close
* significant damage to occupational, social, and interpersonal areas, including [[sexual dysfunction]]
*[[gait ataxia]] due to damage to the [[superior vermis]]

==Screening==
Several tools may be used to detect the habitual abuse of alcohol. The CAGE questionnaire, developed by Dr. John Ewing and named for its four questions, is one such example that may be used to screen patients quickly in a doctor's office.

Two &quot;yes&quot; responses indicate that the respondent should be investigated further.

The questionnaire asks the following questions:
# Have you ever felt you needed to '''C'''ut down on your drinking?
# Have people '''A'''nnoyed you by criticising your drinking?
# Have you ever felt '''G'''uilty about drinking?
# Have you ever felt you needed a drink first thing in the morning ('''E'''ye-opener) to steady your nerves or to get rid of a hangover?

Another screening questionnaire is the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), developed by the World Health Organization.

The Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire [http://eib.emcdda.eu.int/index.cfm?fuseaction=public.Content&amp;nNodeID=3556&amp;sLanguageISO=EN] is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the CAGE test. The Alcohol Dependence Data Question2 by [[Suncom]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''air force''' is a [[Armed force|military]] organization that primarily operates in [[aerial warfare]]. They typically use a combination of [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], [[bomber]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[Cargo aircraft#Military Cargo Aircraft|transport planes]] and other aircraft.  Many air forces are also responsible for operations of military space, [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBM), and communications equipment.

==Organization==
Most, but not all, armed forces have air forces that are ''independent'' - that is, it is neither part of the [[army]] nor the [[navy]]. This does not stop armies and especially navies from possessing air arms to support their land or sea operations, although some, such as the [[Canadian Forces Air Command|Canadian Air Force]] operate all military aircraft, even when they are attached to [[Canadian Forces Land Force Command|Canadian Army]] units.

Air Forces typically operate numerous types of aircraft. These may include
* ''[[Fighter aircraft|Fighters]]'', used to destroy other aircraft;
* ''[[Bomber]]s'' and ''Attack Aircraft'', used to attack ground targets;
* ''[[Reconnaissance]] Aircraft'';
* ''[[Electronic Warfare]] Aircraft'';
* ''[[Airborne Early Warning]] Aircraft'';
* ''Transport Aircraft''; 
* ''Tankers'' which provide in-flight re-fuelling for other aircraft;
* ''[[Helicopter]]s'', used for attack, reconnaissance or transport;
* and ''Training Aircraft''.

Air forces also operate numerous types of satellites.  These satellites provide services such as:
* Secure and unsecure communications 
* Position, navigation and timing
* Missile warning
* Weather data
* Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaisance (ISR)

Some air forces such as the British [[Royal Air Force]] have a unique [[Air_force_officer_ranks|rank structure]]; other air forces such as the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) have a [[Ranks_and_insignia_of_NATO_Air_Forces_Enlisted|rank structure on the Enlisted side]] that is unique, but the Officer corps uses [[Ranks_and_insignia_of_NATO_Air_Forces_Officers|Army-style rank]]. And finally there are air forces such as [[Soviet Air Force]] that use Army-style ranks for both Enlisted and Officer corps. Most (but not all) wear blue-grey uniforms pioneered by the Royal Air Force. The organization structures of the air forces also vary: some air forces (such as the [[United States Air Force]] and the [[Royal Air Force]]) are divided into ''commands'', ''groups'' and ''squadrons''; others (such as the [[Soviet Air Force]]) have an Army-syle organizational structure.

Contrary to popular belief, pilots often make up only a small portion of an air force's personnel.  For every pilot, there is a flight crew who supports the air craft, a maintenance group, communications crew, satellite operators, administrative personnel, medical personnel...in truth, although the majority of the senior leadership of most air forces are pilots, the majority of the personnel are not. Some air forces also operate [[anti-aircraft artillery]] (now with [[radar]]s and [[missile]]s), and a few air forces even have their own [[paratrooper]]s. Given the pilots' special status, they often wear special insignia in the form of a [[vol]] or &quot;wings&quot;. Other air crews might wear variations of such insignia.

The '''Amiga 1200''', or '''A1200''', was [[Commodore International]]'s third-generation [[Amiga]] computer, aimed at the home market. It was released in October 1992, at a base price of £399 in the [[United Kingdom]] and $599 in the [[United States]].

Like its predecessor, the [[A500]], it featured an all-in-one design incorporating the [[Central processing unit|CPU]], keyboard, and [[disk drive]]s (including, unlike the A500, the option of an internal [[hard disk drive]]) in one physical unit. It shipped with 2 MB of [[Chip RAM]] (and no [[Fast RAM]] as in it's bigger brother the [[A4000]]), Commodore's third-generation chipset, [[Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]]; and [[AmigaOS]] 3.0. It utilized a [[Motorola]] [[MC68EC020]] [[CISC]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]] (a 68020 with 24bit addressing) running at 14.18 MHz [[PAL]] / 14.32 MHz [[NTSC]].  For expansion, the A1200 featured a memory/CPU slot, a [[PCMCIA]] slot and a feature unique to the A1200 - a clockport, a remnant of an abandoned design feature (a real time clock and expandable Chip RAM) which has since been used by third-party expansion boards.

Because the unit's memory was shared between the CPU and the sound and video chips, expanding memory beyond 2 MB greatly increased the A1200's speed. Various third-party accelerators featuring [[Motorola 68020|68020]], [[Motorola 68030|68030]], [[Motorola 68040|68040]], [[Motorola 68060|68060]] and later [[PowerPC]] processors quickly became available to increase the computer's speed further.

Unlike the A500 and A600, which were only incremental upgrades over the original A1000 released in 1985, the A1200 was a significant upgrade, featuring more than four times the processing power and greatly enhanced graphics capabilities. However, the A1200 proved not to be as popular as the A500. Although its graphics capabilities stood up well in comparison to the [[Intel 80386]] and [[Intel 80486|486]]-based [[IBM PC compatible]]s it competed against, many PC clones had more processing power and a lower price, in addition to a larger software library. The Amiga's custom chips were simply more expensive to produce than the commodity chips utilized in PCs, which drove up the A1200's price. In addition, fewer retailers carried the A1200 than earlier Commodore computers, especially in the United States. Although Commodore never released any official sales figures, it is estimated that Commodore shipped fewer than 1 million A1200s worldwide before going bankrupt in April 1994.

The A1200 was re-launched in 1995 after the Amiga assets were sold to Escom, but the new units were priced at 1992 levels and experienced compatibility problems. As of 2003, the A1200 is still being sold by Amiga, Inc., the fourth company to own the rights to the machine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Amiga 1000.jpg|thumb|Amiga 1000 (1985)]]

The '''A1000''', or  [[Commodore_International|Commodore]] [[Amiga]] 1000, was Commodore's initial Amiga [[multimedia]] [[home computer|home]]/[[personal computer]], released in the summer of [[1985]] at an original retail price of US$1,295 without a monitor. A 13-inch analog [[RGB]] monitor was available for around US$300. Before the follow-up [[A500]] and [[A2000]] models were released in 1987, the A1000 was usually just called the '''Amiga'''.

The A1000 had a number of characteristics that distinguished it from later Amigas: It was the only model to feature the short-lived Amiga &quot;checkmark&quot; logo on its case; the case was elevated slightly to give a storage area for the keyboard when not in use (a &quot;keyboard garage&quot;); and the inside of the case was engraved with the signatures of the Amiga designers, including [[Jay Miner]] and the paw print of his dog Mitchy.

Many A1000 owners remained attached to their machines long after newer models rendered the units technically obsolete, and it attracted numerous aftermarket upgrades. Many CPU upgrades that plugged into the [[Motorola 68000]] socket functioned in the A1000. Additionally, a line of products called the ''Rejuvinator'' series allowed the use of newer chipsets in the A1000, and an [[Australia|Australian]]-designed replacement A1000 motherboard called ''The Phoenix'' utilized the same chipset as the A3000 and added an A2000-compatible video slot and onboard [[SCSI]].

== Writable Control Store ==
Because [[AmigaOS]] was rather [[computer bug|buggy]] at the time of the A1000's release, the OS was not placed in ROM. Instead, the A1000 included a [[daughterboard]] with 256 KB of RAM, dubbed the &quot;Writable Control Store&quot; (WCS), into which the operating system was [[booting|booted]] from floppy disk (the disk containing the 256 KB image was called &quot;Kickstart&quot;). The WCS was write-protected after loading, and system resets did not require a reload of the WCS.

== The two versions of the A1000 ==

There were two versions of the Amiga 1000. The first one was sold only in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], had a [[NTSC]] display and lacked the EHB video mode which all other models of the Amiga had. Later versions of this version would have this video mode built in. The second one had a [[PAL]] display, the enhanced video modes (EHB) and was built in [[Germany]].

      <comment>/* Overview */ fixed internal link to [[colon (punctuation)]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''AmigaOS''' is the default native [[operating system]] of the [[Amiga]] and [[AmigaOne]] personal computers.

==Overview==
The main [[modularity (programming)|modularization]] technique in AmigaOS is based on ''libraries'' (files with a &quot;&lt;code&gt;.library&lt;/code&gt;&quot; extension), which are collections of functions much like [[shared library|shared libraries]] in other operating systems, but don't make use of [[dynamic linking]] (this has advantages and disadvantages).

One standard AmigaOS library enjoys a special status: the ''exec.library'' is the only library in the system hooked to a fixed memory address (address 4), and it basically functions as the AmigaOS [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]].

[[Device driver]]s are files with a &quot;&lt;code&gt;.device&lt;/code&gt;&quot; extensions and are basically special libraries with somewhat standardized calls. The higher-level part of device and resource management, however, is deferred to ''handlers'', which are not libraries but [[Task (computers)|task]]s, and communicate by means of [[message passing]].

One important type of handler is a [[filesystem]] handler. The AmigaOS can make use of any filesystem for which a handler has been written, a possibility that has been exploited by programs like [[CrossDOS]] and by a few &quot;alternative&quot; filesystems to the standard [[Amiga Old File System|OFS]] and [[Amiga Fast File System|FFS]]. These filesystems allow one to add new features like [[journaling file system|journaling]] or [[file privilege]]s, which aren't found in the standard OS.

Handlers typically expose a ''device name'' to the [[disk operating system|DOS]], which can be used to access the peripheral (if any) associated with the handler. The ''SPEAK: handler'', offering one of several ways to access the AmigaOS speech synthesis system, is one example of a handler offering services not directly related to a peripheral.

Device names are [[case sensitivity|case insensitive]] (uppercase by convention) strings followed by a [[colon (punctuation)|colon]]. After the colon a ''specifier'' can be added, which gives the handler additional information about ''what'' is being accessed and ''how''. In the case of filesystem, the specifier usually consists of a [[path (computing)|path]] to a file in the filesystem; for other handlers, specifiers usually set characteristics of the desired input/ouput channel (for the ''SER:'' serial port driver, for example, the specifier will contain [[bitrate]], [[Asynchronous start-stop|start and stop bits]], etc).

Filesystems expose ''drive names'' as their device names. For example, ''DF0:'' by default refers to the first floppy drive in the system, while ''DH0:'' is the first hard drive.

Filesystems also expose ''volume names'', following the same syntax as device names: these identify the specific medium in the filesystem-managed drive. If ''DF0:'' contains a disk named &quot;Workbench&quot;, then ''Workbench:'' will be a volume name that can be used to access files in ''DF0:''.

If one wanted to access a file named &quot;Bar&quot; located in directory &quot;Foo&quot; of the disk with name &quot;Work&quot; in drive ''DF0:'', one could write
 DF0:Foo/Bar
or
 Work:Foo/Bar
However, these are not completely equivalent, since when the latter form is used, the system knows that the wanted volume '''is''' &quot;Work&quot; and not just any volume in ''DF0:'', and thus will say something to the effect of
 Please insert volume Work in any drive
whenever a requested file on &quot;Work&quot; is being accessed without volume &quot;Work&quot; being present in any drive.

[[Computer program|Program]]s often need to access files without knowing their physical location (either the drive or the volume): they only know the &quot;logical path&quot; of the file, i.e. whether the file is a library, a documentation file, a translation of the program's messages, etc.

This is solved in AmigaOS by the use of ''assigns''. An assign follows, again, the same syntax as a device name; however, it already points to a directory inside the filesystem. The place an assign points to can be changed at any time by the user. Standard assigns that are generally present in an AmigaOS system include
* ''SYS:'', which points to the boot drive's root directory; this is the only assign created automatically by the kickstart
* ''LIBS:'', pointing to a directory containing the system's libraries, usually SYS:Libs/
* ''DEVS:'', pointing to a directory containing the system's devices, usually SYS:Devs/
* ''C:'', pointing to a directory containing shell commands, usually SYS:C/

==The AmigaOS components==
Until 3.5 release AmigaOS always came divided in two parts, Kickstart and the Workbench.

Each Kickstart version is tied to a particular version of the Amiga's operating system software, so users should only boot Workbench 2.0 on a machine with a 2.0 Kickstart [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. It is possible to boot incorrect versions (Workbench 3.1 will boot on Kickstart 3.0, with some problems). The exception is Workbench 2.1, which works with Kickstart 2.04. Also, the latest Workbench versions, 3.5 and 3.9, use Kickstart 3.1 and load ROM updates at boot time.

===Kickstart===
[[image:Amiga kickstart.png|frame|right|The image shown by '''Amiga OS 1.x''' on startup, asking the user to insert the kickstart [[Floppy disk|disk]].]] 
'''Kickstart''' is the name given to the [[bootstrap]] [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. On the first [[Amiga]] model, the [[Amiga 1000|A1000]], this was loaded from disk, although eventually the Kickstart was embedded in a ROM chip inside the computer. The Amiga 1000 could be modified to take these chips, and subsequent Amiga models all used ROM chips.

As well as containing the code needed to boot the computer, the Kickstart also contained large portions of the Amiga's operating system&amp;mdash;the portions making up the '''Amiga ROM Kernel'''&lt;!--correct?--&gt;&amp;mdash;such as Intuition (the Amiga's graphical user interface libraries), Exec (its [[preemptive multitasking]] microkernel), and AmigaDOS (the disk handling libraries). The latter based on a [[TRIPOS]] port by [[MetaComCo]] written in [[BCPL]].

Later versions of the Kickstart contained drivers for [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]] and [[SCSI]] controllers, [[PCMCIA]] ports and various other hardware that came with Amiga.

With third party [[Computer software|software]], it is possible to have a different Kickstart loaded in RAM and to use it instead of the ROM one - for example Kickstart 1.3 may be loaded in order to run old games incompatible with Kickstart 2.0 and higher. These programs are called ''Softkickers''. There are also hardware ''Kickstart switchers'' which allow you to have more than one set of Kickstart chips inside the computer, which are selectable either by a switch or a keyboard shortcut when you first turn the machine on. It is also possible to swap hardware ROM chips using minimal tools.

===Workbench===
Workbench is the native graphical [[operating system shell|shell]] for the [[Amiga]] computer. As the name suggests, the [[metaphor]] of a workbench, rather than a desktop, is used: directories are depicted as ''drawers'', executable files are depicted as ''tools'', data files are depicted as ''projects'' and GUI widgets are ''gadgets''. Most Amiga application software has [[pull-down menus]] starting &quot;Project Edit ...&quot; rather than the usual &quot;File Edit ...&quot; from other platforms. Strictly speaking, the term ''Workbench'' refers only to the main file-manager of AmigaOS, but it is commonly used in referring to all the parts of the OS not residing in the ROM.

The Workbench environment is not required for the machine to function, therefore a lot of old games can boot directly from Kickstart, without loading it. Most such games don't even let the OS finish the normal booting process; instead, they take over most of the OS itself, disable multitasking, and sometimes run without even ''using'' OS functions.

In many other aspects the interface resembles [[Mac OS]], with the main desktop having the drive icons, and a single menu bar at the very top of the screen. Unlike the contemporaneous Mac [[computer mouse|mouse]], the standard Amiga mouse has two buttons &amp;ndash; the right mouse button operates the pull-down menus, with a Macintosh-style &quot;release to select&quot; mechanism. Later, it was also possible to utilise a mouse with three buttons or a wheel.

A unique feature of Workbench is ''multiple screens''. These are conceptually similar to [[X Window System]] virtual desktops or workspaces, but are generated dynamically by application programs as necessary. Each screen can have a different resolution and colour depth. A gadget in the top-right corner of the screen allows screens to be cycled - as the OS stores all screens in memory simultaneously, re.  Her illusions destroyed, she decides she must leave her husband, her children, and her Doll's House to discover what is truly real and what is not.  As Ibsen described it, &quot;Depressed and confused by her faith in authority, she loses faith in her moral right and ability to bring up her children. A mother in contemporary society, just as certain insects go away and die when she has done her duty in the propagation of the race.&quot;

==Critics==

To the Victorians, this was scandalous. Nothing was considered more sacrosanct than the covenant of marriage, and to portray it in such a way was completely unacceptable. Some theatre houses refused to stage the play, so Ibsen was pressed to write an alternate ending that was far less black. This distressed him considerably, and on occasion he actually submitted a &quot;correction&quot;  at the last minute to the actors on opening nights.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:sidewider_missile_20040710_145400_1.4.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Sidewinder Missile]]
The '''AIM-9 Sidewinder''' is a [[heat-seeking]], short-range, [[air-to-air missile]] carried by [[fighter aircraft]]. It is named after the [[Sidewinder (snake)|Sidewinder snake]], which also detects its prey via body heat. The Sidewinder was the first really effective air-to-air missile, widely imitated and copied. Its latest variants remain in active service with many air forces.

==History==
===Early development===
The Sidewinder missile was a development of the Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS), Inyokern, California, now the Naval Air Weapon Development Center, China Lake, California. It was officially designated in 1952 and was originally conceived by William Burdette McLean. 

Developed by the [[US Navy]] starting in the late [[1940s]], the Sidewinder introduced several new technologies that made it simpler and much more reliable than its [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) counterpart, the [[AIM-4 Falcon]].  After terrible experiences with the Falcon in the [[Vietnam War]], the Air Force replaced its Falcons with Sidewinders.

The primary advantage to the Sidewinder is its sophisticated, yet simple detection and guidance system. During [[World War II|WWII]] the Germans had experimented with [[infrared]] guidance systems in a large missile known as the [[Enzian missile|Enzian]], but were unable to get it to work reliably.  The Enzian was guided by an [[Infra-red|IR]] detector mounted in a small, steerable telescope.  A vane in front of the mirror shaded the detector, so the system could locate the target.  By continually turning toward the telescope, the missile was guided toward the target using what is known as a ''pure pursuit''.

The Sidewinder improved on this. The first was to replace the &quot;steering&quot; mirror with a mirror rotating around a shaft pointed out the front of the missile.  The detector was mounted in front of the mirror.  Instead of attempting to track the target in the mirror, the IR sensor would see the target as brief flashes as the mirror lined up with the target. By knowing where the flash was as the mirror spun, the direction (radially) to the target was also known.  This system could also track the radial angle to the target by timing the flashes.  If the target was further to the side, the flash seen in the detector would be shorter due to the mirror's higher rate of motion at the outside.

This signal makes the tracking system both simpler and better.  Instead of simply pointing the missile at the target (which is inefficient), the Sidewinder &quot;remembered&quot; each flash's direction and time.  By attempting to zero out the changes, instead of the difference between the detector and missile angles, the Sidewinder flies a course known as ''proportional pursuit'', which is much more efficient and makes the missile &quot;lead&quot; the target.

However this system also requires the missile to have a fixed roll axis orientation. If the missile spins at all, the timing based on the speed of rotation of the mirror is no longer accurate. Correcting for this spin would normally require some sort of sensor to tell which way is &quot;down&quot; and then adding controls to correct it. Instead, small control surfaces were placed at the rear of the missile with spinning disks on their outer surface. Airflow over the disk spins them to a high speed.  If the missile starts to roll, the gyroscopic force of the disk drives the control surface into the airflow, cancelling the motion. Thus the Sidewinder team replaced a potentially complex control system with some simple mechanical bits.

===Service entry===
A prototype Sidewinder, the '''XAAM-N-7''' (later '''AIM-9A'''), was first fired successfully in September [[1953 in aviation|1953]]. The initial production version, designated '''AAM-N-7''' (later '''AIM-9B'''), entered operational use in [[1956 in aviation|1956]], and has been improved upon steadily since. The first combat use of the Sidewinder was in [[1958 in aviation|1958]] with the air force of the [[Republic of China]] on Taiwan. During that period of time, the ROC was engaged in air battles with the [[People's Republic of China]] over the [[Taiwan Strait]]. The United States provided a few dozen Sidewinders to ROC forces, which used them to great effect against PRC [[MiG-15]]s, adding a new element to an air war which had formerly been fought only with guns. 

The Taiwan Strait battles inadvertently produced a new derivative of Sidewinder: shortly after that conflict the [[Soviet Union]] began the manufacture of the [[Vympel K-13|K-13/R-3S]] missile ([[NATO reporting name]] '''AA-2 'Atoll''''), a reverse-engineered copy of the Sidewinder. It was reportedly made possible after a Taiwanese AIM-9B hit a Chinese [[MiG-15]] without exploding, and served as a &quot;university course&quot; in missile design for Soviet engineers. The K-13 and its derivatives remained in production for nearly 30 years.

Although originally developed for the USN, the Sidewinder was subsequently adopted by the USAF as the '''GAR-8''' (later '''AIM-9E'''). During the [[1960s]] the USN and USAF pursued their own separate versions of the Sidewinder, but cost considerations later forced the development of common variants.

The Sidewinder subsequently evolved through a series of upgraded versions with newer, more sensitive seekers with various types of cooling and various propulsion, fuse, and warhead improvements.

Although each of those versions had various seeker, cooling, and fuzing differences, all but one shared infrared homing. The exception was the US Navy '''AAM-N-7 Sidewinder IB''' (later '''AIM-9C'''), a Sidewinder with a [[semi-active radar homing]] seeker head developed for the [[F-8 Crusader]]. Only about 1,000 of these weapons were produced, many of which were later rebuilt as the [[AGM-122 Sidearm]] [[anti-radiation missile]].

The '''AIM-9J Sidewinder''' version was used by the United States Air Force as well as being widely exported. An improved version of the basic AIM-9B, the main features are larger control surfaces as well as a more aerodynamic IR seeker and improved rocket motor. The missile however still has to be fired at the target from behind, a drawback of all early IR missiles.

===All-Aspect Sidewinders===
==== AIM-9L / AIM-9M / AIM-9M-7 ====
The next major advance in IR Sidewinder development was the '''AIM-9L''' ('''&quot;Lima&quot;''') model, introduced in [[1978 in aviation|1978]]. This was the first &quot;[[all-aspect]]&quot; Sidewinder with the ability to attack from all angles, including head-on. In its first combat uses by [[Israel]] over [[Lebanon]] and by the [[United Kingdom]] during the [[Falklands War]], the &quot;Lima&quot; reportedly achieved a kill ratio of around 80%, a dramatic improvement over the 10-15% levels of earlier weapons. In both cases, the users' opponents had not developed any tactics for the evasion of a head-on missile shot of this kind, making them all the more vulnerable.  

The subsequent '''AIM-9M''' ('''&quot;Mike&quot;''') has the all-aspect capability of the L model while providing all-around higher performance. The M model has improved defense against infrared countermeasures, enhanced background discrimination capability, and a reduced-smoke rocket motor. These modifications increase its ability to locate and lock on a target and decrease the missile's chances for detection. Deliveries began in [[1983 in aviation|1983]]. The '''AIM-9M-7''' was a specific modification to AIM-9M in response to threats expected in the [[Persian Gulf]] war zone. 

==== AIM-9X ====
Now entering service is the '''AIM-9X''', a new variant with an imaging infrared focal plane array seeker with claimed 90° off-boresight capability, compatibility with [[helmet-mounted sight]]s (the new U.S. [[Joint Helmet-Mounted Cueing System]]), and a totally new thrust-vectoring system replacing the traditional control surfaces. It retains the same motor and warhead of the &quot;Mike,&quot; but its lower drag gives it improved range and speed.

==== SIDEARM / AGM-122A ====
[[Image:Sidearm_loading.jpg|thumb|left|120px|AGM-122A SIDEARM being loaded onto an [[F-14 Tomcat]].]]

The Sidewinder was also adapted into a new missile, the '''[[AGM-122 Sidearm|AGM-122A Sidearm]]''', which is an [[Anti-radiation missile]] utilizing an AIM-9C guidance section modified to detect and track a radiating ground-based air defense system radar. The target detecting device is modified for air-to-surface use, employing forward hemisphere acquisition capability. Sidearm stocks have apparently been expended, and the weapon is no longer in the active inventory.

==== Architecture ====
The AIM-9 is made up of a number of different components manufactured by different companies including [http://www.aerojet.com/default.cfm AeroJet] and [http://www.raytheon.com Raytheon].  The missile is divided into four main sections: guidance, target detector, warhead, and rocket motor.  

The Guidance and Control Unit (GCU) contains most of the electronics and mechanics that enable the missile to function.  At the very front is the IR seeker head utilizing the rotating spindle, mirror, and five [[Photoresistor#Cadmium sulfide cells|CdS]] cells or “pan and scan” [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] (AIM-9X), [[Electric motor|electric motor]], and armature all protruding into a glass dome.  Directly behind this are the electronics that gather data, interpret signals, and generate the control signals that steer the missile.  An umbilical on the side of the GCU attaches to the launcher, which is pulled from the missile at launch.  A 5,000 [[pound-force per square inch|psig]] (35 [[megapascal|MPa]]) [[Argon|argon]] bottle or Sterling liquid nitrogen generator (AIM-9X) is used to cool the electronics.  Two electric servos power the [[Canard|canards]] to steer the missile (Except AIM-9X).  At the back of the GCU is a gas grain generator or thermal battery (AIM-9X) to provide electrical power.  The AIM-9 X features High-Off-Boresight capability, together with [[Helmet-mounted sights | JHeMoCS]] (Joint Helmet Mounted Cuing System) this missile is capable of locking on to a target that it is behind it.  The Aim-9X also features a Built-In-Test to aid in maintenance and reliability.

Next is a target detector with four IR emitters and detectors that detonate the warhead in the event of a near miss.  Versions older than the AIM-9L featured an influence fuze that relied on the targets magnetic field as input. Current trends in shielded wires and non-magnetic metals in aircraft construction rendered this obsolete.

Recent models of the AIM-9 are configured with an annular blast fragmentation [[Warhead|warhead]], the WDU-17B by Argotech Corperation.  The case is made of spirally wound spring steel filled with 8 pounds (4 kg) of PBXN-3 tritonol.  The [[Fuse (explosives)|fuze]] requires five seconds at 20 ''g'' (200 m/s²) acceleration to arm and features a safe/arm device.

The solid propellant [[Solid rocket|rocket]] motor provides propulsion for the missile.  A reduced smoke propellant makes it difficult for a target to see and avoid the missile.  This section also features the launch lugs used to hold the missile to the rail of the missile launcher.  The forward of the three lugs has two contact buttons that electrically pre-arm the warhead and activate the motor igniter.  The fins provide stability from an aerodynamic point of view but it is the rolerons at the end of the fins providing [[Precession|gyroscopic precession]] that prevents the [[snake|serpentine]] motion that gave the Sidewinder its name in the early days.  The wings and fins of the AIM-9X are smaller to accommodate its use on the [[F-22]] and this time it is the fins that do the steering while the wings up front provide stability.  The AIM-9X also features [[Thrust vectoring | Vectored Thrust]] to increase maneuverability and accuracy with four vanes inside the exhaust that move as the fins move.  The last upgrade to the missile motor on the AIM-9X is the addition of a wire harness that allows communication between the guidance section and the control section as well as a new 1760 bus to connect the guidance section with the launcher’s digital umbilical.

===Conclusion===
The Sidewinder is the most widely used air-to-air missile in the West, with more than 110,000 missiles produced for the US and 27 other nations. It has been built under license by some nations (including Sweden, which builds it under the local designation '''Rb24''').  The AIM-9 is one of the oldest, least expensive and most successful air-to-air missiles.

It has been said that the design goals for the original Sidewinder were to produce a reliable and effective missile with the &quot;electronic complexity of a table model radio and the mechanical complexity of a washing machine&quot; -- goals which were well accomplished in the early missiles. The Sidewinder is so successful that the United States Navy hosted a 50th anniversary celebration of its existence in 2002.

The '''AIM-7 Sparrow''' is a medium-range [[semi-active radar homing]] [[air-to-air missile]] operated by the [[United States Air Force]], [[US Navy]], and [[USMC]] as well as various allied air forces. Sparrow and its derivatives were the West's principal beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air missile from the late [[1950s]] until the [[1990s]]. It remains in service, although it is being phased out in favor of the more advanced [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]].  Its primary carrier aircraft is the [[F-14 Tomcat]], which is being phased out and therefore has not been modified to carry the AMRAAM.

The Sparrow was used as the basis for a [[surface-to-air missile]], the '''RIM-7 Sea Sparrow''', which is used by the [[US Navy]] for air defense of its ships.

==Development==
====Sparrow I====
The Sparrow emerged from a late-[[1940s]] [[US Navy]] program to develop a guided rocket weapon for air-to-air use. In [[1947 in aviation|1947]] the Navy contracted [[Sperry]] to build a [[beam-riding]] version of a standard 5-inch (127 mm) [[HVAR]], the standard unguided aerial rocket, under  '''Project Hotshot'''. The weapon was initially dubbed '''KAS-1''', then '''AAM-2''', and, from [[1948 in aviation|1948]] on, '''AAM-N-2'''. The airframe was developed by [[Douglas Aircraft]]. The diameter of the HVAR proved to be inadequate for the electronics, leading Douglas to expand the missile's airframe to 8 in (203 mm) diameter. The prototype weapon made its first aerial interception in [[1952 in aviation|1952]].

After a protracted development cycle the initial '''AAM-N-2 ''Sparrow''''' entered service in [[1956 in aviation|1956]], carried by the [[F3H Demon|F3H-2M Demon]] and [[F7U Cutlass]] [[fighter aircraft]]. Compared to the modern versions, the Sparrow I was more [[streamlined]] and featured a bullet-shaped airframe with a long pointed nose.

Sparrow I was a limited and rather primitive weapon. The limitations of beam-riding guidance (which was slaved to an optical sight, requiring visual identification of the target) restricted the missile to visual-range attacks and made it essentially useless against a maneuvering target. Only about 2,000 rounds were produced to this standard.

====Sparrow II====
As early as [[1950]] Douglas examined equipping the Sparrow with an active radar seeker, initially known as '''XAAM-N-2a ''Sparrow II''''', the original retroactively becoming '''''Sparrow I'''''. In 1952 it was given the new code '''AAM-N-3'''.

By 1955 Douglas proposed going ahead with development, intending it to be the primary weapon for the [[F5D Skylancer]] [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]], and later the [[Avro Arrow]] to be built under license by [[Canadair]]. However the small size of the missile forebody and the K-band AN/APQ-64 radar limited performance, and it was never able to work in testing.

The program was cancelled in 1958, and although there was some discussion of Canadair taking over the work, when the Arrow was cancelled all work ended.

====Sparrow III====
Concurrently, in [[1951 in aviation|1951]], [[Raytheon]] began work on the [[semi-active radar homing]] version of Sparrow family of missiles, the '''AAM-N-6 ''Sparrow III'''''. The first of these weapons entered [[US Navy]] service in [[1958 in aviation|1958]].

The '''AAM-N-6a''' was similar to the -6, but used a new [[Thiokol]] liquid-fuel rocket engine for improved performance. It also included changes to the guidance electronics to make it effective at higher closing speeds. The -6a was also selected to arm the Air Force's '''F-110A ''Spectre''''' ([[F-4 Phantom]]) fighters in 1962, known to them as the '''AIM-101'''. It entered production in 1959, eventually being built to about 7500 examples.

Another upgrade switched back to a Rocketdyne solid-fuel motor for the '''AAM-N-6b''', which started production in 1963. The new motor significantly increased range, which was up to 35 km for head-on attacks.

During this year the Navy and Air Force agreed on a standardized naming for their missiles, the Sparrows becoming the AIM-7 series. The original Sparrow I and aborted Sparrow II became the '''AIM-7A''' and '''AIM-7B''', even though both were long gone from the inventory. The -6, -6a and -6B became the '''AIM-7C''', '''AIM-7D''' and '''AIM-7E''' respectively.

25,000 AIM-7E's were produced, and saw extensive use during the [[Vietnam War]], where its performance was generally considered disappointing. The mixed results were a combination of reliability problems (exacerbated by the tropical climate), limited pilot training in fighter-to-fighter combat, and restrictive rules of engagement that generally prohibited BVR (beyond visual range) engagements. The P&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; (kill probability) of the AIM-7E was less than 10%.

In 1969 an improved version, the E-2, was introduced with clipped wings and various changes to the fusing. It was intended to be used at shorter ranges where the missile was still travelling at high speeds, making it much more useful in the visual limitations imposed on the engagements. An E-3 included additional changes to the fusing, and an E-4 featured a modified seeker for use with the [[F-14 Tomcat]].

Improved versions of the AIM-7 were developed in the [[1970s]] in an attempt to address the weapon's limitations. The '''AIM-7F''', which entered service in [[1976 in aviation|1976]], had a dual-stage rocket motor for longer range, [[solid-state electronics]] for greatly improved reliability, and a larger warhead. Even this version had room for improvement, leading [[British Aerospace]] and the Italian firm [[Selenia]] to develop advanced versions of Sparrow with better performance and improved electronics as the '''[[Skyflash]]''' and '''Selenia Aspide''', respectively.

The most common version of the Sparrow today, the '''AIM-7M''', featured a new inverse monopulse seeker (matching the capabilities of Skyflash), active radar fuse, digital controls, improved [[ECM]] resistance, and better low-altitude performance, entered service in [[1982 in aviation|1982]]. It was used to good advantage in the [[1991 Gulf War]], where it scored many USAF air-to-air kills.

The '''AIM-7P''' is similar in most ways to the M versions, and was primarily an upgrade program for existing M-series missiles. The main changes were to the software, improving low-level performance. A follow-on Block II upgrade added a new rear receiver allowing the missile to receive mid-course correction from the launching aircraft. Plans initially called for all M versions to be upgraded, but currently P's are being issued as required to replace M's lost or removed from the inventory.

The final version of the missile was to have been the '''AIM-7R''', which added an [[infra-red]] seeker to an otherwise unchanged AIM-7P Block II. A general wind-down of the budget led to it being cancelled in 1997. 

Sparrow is now being phased out with the availability of the active-radar [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]], but is likely to remain in service for a number of years.

====Sea Sparrow====
Sea Sparrow was developed as a lightweight &quot;point defense&quot; weapon that could be retrofitted to existing ships, often in place of existing gun-based anti-aircraft weapons. The primary development issues were changes to the seekers to allow them to operate with shipboard radars, and a new trainable launcher system, based on the [[ASROC]] launcher, to align the seeker head with the target before launch.

As a surface-to-air system, the Sparrow has a number of disadvantages. For one, the missile steers with its mid-mounted wings, which makes them unfoldable. For this reason the missile takes up much more room than it would have to if the wings could be folded. Additionally the engine is optimized for flight time, as opposed to fast acceleration, which makes sense when launched from an aircraft moving at high speed at a target at long range. In the surface-to-air role, however, one would rather have very high acceleration in order to allow it to intercept sea-skimming targets as soon as possible.

In order to address these issues, a consortium of many Sea Sparrow users joined together to create the [[ESSM|''Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile'' ('''ESSM''')]]. The new design uses the tail-fins for steering, allowing the wings to fold. This allows the missile body to increase in size while still fitting into the same launchers, growing to 10 inches in diameter and offering far higher performance. Additionally the wing-based manuvering of the older design is designed to save energy during the long gliding period of the missile, while the tail-fin based steering of the ESSM uses up more energy but offers considerably higher manuverability while the engine is still firing.

Another recent development is the ''Jet Vane Control'' ('''JVC''') unit, which can be added to the base of the missile to allow it to be vertically launched. After being &quot;poppped&quot; from the launch cell the JVC rotates the missile to bring the seeker onto the target and level the flightpath in that direction. It is then jettisoned. Vertical launching allows a single cell to cover the entire area around the ship, because the seeker can be pointed in any direction by the JVC after launch. Additionally the time needed to point the launcher is eliminated.

The [[Egyptian Navy]] uses the Sea Sparrow for air defense of its two [[Descubierta class frigate|''Descubierta'' class light frigates]].

==Description==
The Sparrow has four major sections: guidance section, [[warhead]], control, and rocket motor (currently the Hercules MK-58 solid-propellant rocket motor). It has a cylindrical body with four wings at mid-body and four tail fins. Although the external dimensions of the Sparrow remained relatively unchanged from model to model, the internal components of newer missiles represent major improvements, with vastly increased capabilities. The warhead is of the [[continuous-rod warhead|continuous-rod]] type.

As with other semi-active radar guided missiles, the missile does not generate radar signals, but instead homes in on reflected continuous-wave signals from the launch platform's radar. The receiver also senses the guidance radar to enable comparisons that enhance the missile's resistance to passive jamming.

==Principle of guidance (semi-active version)==
The launching aircraft will illuminate the target with its radar. In radars of the 1950's these were single target tracking devices using a nutating horn as part of its antenna. This caused the beam to be swept in a small cone. Signal processing would be applied to determine the direction of maximum illumination and so develop a signal to steer the antenna toward the target. The missile detects the reflected signal from the target with a high gain antenna in a similar fashion and steers the entire missile toward closure with the target. The missile guidance also samples a portion of the illuminating signal via rearward pointing [[waveguide]]s. The comparison of these two signals enabled logic circuits to determine the true target reflection signal, even if the target were to eject radar-reflecting [[chaff (radar countermeasure)|chaff]].

The '''AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile''', or '''AMRAAM''' (pronounced am-ram), commonly known to air crews as the &quot;Slammer,&quot; is a modern [[air-to-air missile|air-to-air]] [[missile]] (AAM).

==Politico-historical background==
AMRAAM was developed as the result of an agreement, no longer in effect, among the United States and several other [[NATO]] nations to develop air-to-air missiles and to share production technology.  Under this agreement the U.S. was to develop the next generation medium range missile (AMRAAM) and Europe would develop the next generation short range missile ([[ASRAAM]]). The breakdown in this agreement lead to Europe developing the [[MBDA Meteor]], a competitor to AMRAAM and the U.S. pursuing upgrades of the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]]. After protracted development, deployment of AMRAAM (AIM-120A) began in September [[1991 in aviation|1991]].

The eastern counterpart of AMRAAM is the very similar [[Russian Air Force|Russian]] [[R-77 AA-12 Adder]], commonly known in the west as &quot;Amraamski.&quot;

==Operational features summary==
AMRAAM has an all-weather, beyond-visual-range capability. It improves the aerial combat capabilities of U.S. and allied aircraft to meet the future threat of enemy air-to-air weapons. AMRAAM serves as a follow-on to the [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] missile series. The new missile is faster, smaller, and lighter, and has improved capabilities against low-altitude targets. It also incorporates an active radar in conjunction with an inertial reference unit and micro-computer system, which makes the missile less dependent upon the fire-control system of the aircraft.

Once the missile closes in on the target, its active [[radar]] guides it to intercept. This feature, called &quot;[[fire and forget]],&quot; frees the pilot from the need to continuously illuminate the missile's target with a radar lock, enabling the pilot to aim and fire several missiles simultaneously at multiple targets and perform evasive maneuvers while the missiles guide themselves to the targets.

==Guidance system overview==
===Interception course stage===
AMRAAM uses two-stage [[missile guidance|guidance]] when fired at long range. The aircraft passes data to the missile just before launch, giving it information about the location of the target aircraft from the launch point and its direction and speed. The missile uses this information to fly on an interception course to the target using its built in [[inertial navigation system]] (INS). This information is generally obtained using the launching aircraft's [[radar]], although it could come from an [[infra-red]] search and tracking system ([[IRST]]), from a [[Joint Tactical Information Distribution System|data link]] from another fighter aircraft, or from an [[AWACS]] aircraft. 

If the firing aircraft or surrogate continues to track the target, periodic updates are sent to the missile telling it of any changes in the target's direction and speed, allowing it to adjust its course so that it is able to close to self-homing distance while keeping the target aircraft in the ''basket'' in which it will be able to find it.

Not all AMRAAM users have elected to purchase the mid-course update option, which limits AMRAAM's effectiveness in some scenarios. The [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] initially opted not to use mid-course update for its [[RAF_Tornado_F3|Tornado F3]] force, only to discover that without it, testing proved the AMRAAM was less effective in BVR engagements than the older [[semi-active radar homing]] [[Skyflash|BAE Skyflash]] weapon--the AIM-120's own radar is necessarily of limited range and power compared to that of the launch aircraft.

===Terminal stage and impact===
Once the missile closes to self-homing distance, it turns on its active radar seeker and searches for the target aircraft. If the target is in or near the expected location, the missile will find it and guide itself to the target from this point. If the missile is fired at short range (typically, visual range), it can use its active seeker just after launch, making the missile truly [[fire-and-forget]]. At the point where an AMRAAM switches to autonomous self-guidance, the NATO brevity word &quot;pitbull&quot; would be called out on the radio to inform other pilots, just as &quot;Fox Three&quot; would be called out upon launch.

==Kill probability and tactics==
===General considerations===
Once in its terminal mode, the missile's advanced electronic-counter-counter-measure ([[ECCM]]) support and good maneuverability mean that the chance of it hitting or exploding close to the target is high (on the order of 90%), as long as it has enough remaining energy to maneuver with the target if it is evasive. The [[probability of kill|kill probability]] (PK) is determined by several factors, including aspect (head-on interception, side-on or tail-chase), altitude, the speed of the missile and the target, how hard the target can turn, etc. Typically, if the missile has a sufficient amount of energy during the terminal phase, which comes from being launched close enough to the target from an aircraft flying high and fast enough, it will have an excellent chance of success. This chance drops as the missile is fired at longer ranges as it runs out of overtake speed at long ranges, and if the target can force the missile to turn it might bleed off enough speed that it can no longer chase the target.

===Lower-capability targets===
This leads to two main engagement scenarios. If the target(s) is/are not armed or not armed with any medium or long-range [[fire-and-forget]] weapons, the aircraft firing the AMRAAM need only to get close enough to the target, depending upon whether the target is heading towards or away from the firing aircraft, and launch the missile(s) to have a reasonable chance of hitting. Especially against low-maneuverability targets, in this situation the missiles are unlikely to miss. If the target aircraft are approaching the launching aircraft, especially if they are moving fast, the missile can be launched at long range since the range will be closing fast. In this situation, even if the target(s) turn around, it is unlikely they can speed up and fly away fast enough to avoid being overtaken and hit by the missile(s) (as long as the missiles are not released too early). It is also unlikely they can outmaneuver the missiles since the closure rate will be so great. In a tail-on engagement, the firing aircraft might have to close to between one-half and one-quarter maximum range (or maybe even more for a very fast target) in order to give the missile sufficient energy to overtake the targets.

If the targets are armed with missiles, the [[fire-and-forget]] nature of the AMRAAM is invaluable, enabling the launching aircraft to fire missiles at the target and then turn and run away. Even if the targets have longer-range [[semi-active radar homing]] ([[SARH]]) missiles, they will have to chase the launching aircraft in order for the missiles to track them, effectively flying right into the AMRAAM. If the target aircraft fire missiles and then turn and runs away, their own missiles will not be able to hit. Of course, if the target aircraft have long range missiles, even if they are not [[fire-and-forget]], the fact that they force the launching aircraft to turn and run reduces the kill probability, since it is possible that without the mid-course updates the missiles will not find the target aircraft. However the chance of success is still good and compared to the relative impunity the launching aircraft enjoy, this gives the AMRAAM-equipped aircraft a decisive edge. If one or more missiles fail to hit, the AMRAAM-equipped aircraft can turn and re-engage, although they will be at a disadvantage compared to the chasing aircraft due to the speed they lose in the turn, and would have to be careful that they're not being tracked with [[SARH]] missiles.

===Similarly armed targets===
The other main engagement scenario is against other aircraft with [[fire-and-forget]] missiles like the [[Vympel R-77]] (NATO AA-12 &quot;Adder&quot;) - perhaps [[MiG-29]]s, [[Su-27]]s or similar. In this case engagement is very much down to teamwork and could be described as &quot;a game of chicken.&quot; Both flights of aircraft can fire their missiles at each other beyond visual range (BVR), but then face the problem that if they continue to track the target aircraft in order to provide mid-course updates for the missile's flight, they are also flying into their opponents' missiles. This is why teamwork is so important and advanced missiles with guidance systems with hand-off capability can help overcome this problem. The other main tactic would be to sneak up behind the enemy aircraft and launch missiles without them noticing, giving the launching aircraft sufficient time to leave the danger zone of the enemy after launching. Even if the enemy detects the launch and turns around, the speed and possibly altitude it loses during the turn puts its missiles at an energy disadvantage which may be sufficient for the other aircraft to defeat it successfully. This typically requires excellent [[ground-control intercept]] (GCI) or airborne radar ([[AWACS]] - Airborne Warning and Control System) facilities in order to be successful.

==Variants and upgrades==
===Air-to-air missile versions===
There are currently three variants of AMRAAM, all in service with the [[United States Air Force]] and [[USN]]. The AIM-120A is no longer in production and shares the enlarged wings and fins with the successor AIM-120B currently in production. The AIM-120C has smaller &quot;clipped&quot; aerosurfaces to enable internal carriage on the USAF [[F-22A Raptor]]. AIM-120B deliveries began in [[1994 in aviation|1994]], and AIM-120C deliveries began in [[1996 in aviation|1996]]. 

The AIM-120C has been steadily upgraded since it was introduced. The AIM-120C-6 contained an improved fuze (Target Detection Device) compared to its predecessor. The AIM-120C-7 development began in [[1998]] and included improvements in homing and greater range (actual amount of improvement unspecified). It was successfully tested in 2003 and is currently being introduced into active service (early 2005). It helps the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] replace the [[F-14 Tomcat]]s which are being retired and replaced with [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]]s&amp;mdash;the loss of the [[F-14]]'s long-range [[AIM-54 Phoenix]] missiles (already retired) can be partially offset with a longer-range AMRAAM but note that the AMRAAM does not have a longer range than the Phoenix.

The AIM-120D is a planned upgraded version of the AMRAAM with improvements in almost all areas, including 50% greater range (than the already long range AIM-120C-7) and better guidance over its entire flight envelope yielding an improved kill probability ([[Probability of kill|PK]]). 

There are also plans for [[Raytheon]] to develop a [[Ramjet]]-powered derivative of the AMRAAM, the Future Medium Range Air-Air Missile (FMRAAM). It is not known whether the FMRAAM will be produced since the target market, the British Ministry of Defence has chosen the [[MBDA_Meteor|Meteor missile]] over the FMRAAM for a [[BVR]] missile for the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] aircraft.

===Ground-launch systems===
[[Raytheon]] successfully tested launching AMRAAM missiles from a five-missile carrier on an [[HMMWV]] (hum-vee). They receive their initial guidance information from a radar not mounted on the vehicle (probably the [[MPQ-64 Sentinel]] radar system or possibly a [[Patriot missile|PATRIOT]] missile battery radar) and help to provide low-level, close-in defence while the PATRIOT system engages targets at higher altitudes and further ranges. The missile's range would be lower when launched from the ground, due to the lack of speed or altitude of the launch vehicle. This system will be known as the '''HUMRAAM''' (a contraction of HUMVEE and AMRAAM).

The [[NASAMS|Norwegian Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System]] (NASAMS), developed by [[Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace]], consists of a number of vehicle-pulled launch batteries (containing six AMRAAMs each) along with separate radar trucks and control station vehicles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''AGM-84 ''Harpoon''''' is a [[United States|U.S.]] all-weather, over-the-horizon, [[anti-ship missile|anti-ship]] [[cruise missile]] system, originally developed by [[McDonnell Douglas]], with development and manufacturing now taken over by [[Boeing Integrated Defense Systems]]. In 2004, Boeing delivered the 7000th Harpoon unit since the weapon's introduction in 1977. The missile system has also been further developed into a coastal strike version, the '''AGM-84E Standoff Land Attack Missile''' ('''SLAM''').
[[Image:Harpoon asm bowfin museum.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A Harpoon missile on display at the [[USS Bowfin (SS-287)|USS ''Bowfin'']] [[museum]] at [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Hawaii]].]]

Harpoon uses [[active radar homing]] and low-level, sea-skimming cruise trajectory to improve survivability and effectiveness. The missile's launch platform options include:
*[[warship|surface ship]]s ('''RGM-84''', fitted with a [[solid rocket]] launch booster that detaches when expended to allow the missile's integral [[turbojet]] to maintain flight)
*[[submarine]]s ('''UGM-84''', fitted with a solid-rocket launch booster and encapsulated in a container to enable submerged launch through a torpedo tube)
*[[airplane]]s ('''AGM-84''', without the booster)
*coastal defense batteries

The chief competitor of the ''Harpoon'' is the French ''[[Exocet]]''.

==Versions and operators==

===Original Harpoon===
Initially developed for the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] to serve as its basic anti-ship missile for fleet-wide use, the '''AGM-84D''' has been adapted for use on Air Force [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52G bombers]], which can carry from eight to 12 of the missiles. The AGM-84E has been adapted for use on the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]], in use by both the [[United States|USA]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. The [[Royal Australian Air Force]] can fire AGM-84 series missiles from its [[General Dynamics F-111#F-111C|F-111C/G Aardvark]], [[F/A-18 Hornet]] and [[P-3 Orion|AP-3C Orion]] aircraft.  The [[Egyptian Navy]] uses the Harpoon SSM to equip eight [[frigate]]s and four [[submarine]]s.

The AGM-84A was first introduced in [[1977]], and in [[1979]] an air-launched version was deployed on the Navy's P-3 Orion aircraft.

===Harpoon Block II===
[[Image:Harpoon-block-II-launch.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Harpoon Block II test firing from [[USS Decatur (DDG-73)|USS ''Decatur'']].]]

In production at Boeing facilities in [[Saint Charles, Missouri|St. Charles, Mo.]] is the '''Harpoon II''', intended to offer an expanded engagement envelope and advanced [[electronic countermeasures|counter measures]] together with improved targeting. The key improvements of the Harpoon II are obtained by incorporating the [[inertial measurement unit]] from the [[Joint Direct Attack Munition|JDAM]] program, and the software, computer, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]/inertial navigation system and GPS antenna/receiver from the '''SLAM-ER''' ('''''E'''xpanded '''R'''esponse'', an upgrade to the AGM-84E SLAM).

The first international customer for Harpoon Block II systems was the [[Royal Danish Navy]], which ordered 50 upgrade kits in 1997; the first systems were delivered in 2002.

The '''AGM-88 High-Speed Anti-radiation Missile (HARM)''' is an air-to-surface tactical [[missile]] designed to seek out and destroy enemy [[radar]]-equipped air defense systems. The missile was originally developed by [[Texas Instruments]] as a replacement for the [[AGM-78 Standard]] ARM system. Production was later taken over by [[Raytheon Corporation]].

The AGM-88 can detect, attack and destroy a target with minimal aircrew input. The proportional guidance system that homes in on enemy radar emissions has a fixed antenna and seeker head in the missile's nose. A smokeless, solid-propellant, [[dual-thrust]] [[rocket motor]] propels the missile at speeds up to [[Mach number|Mach]] 4.

The HARM missile was approved for full production in March [[1983]]. It proved effective against [[Libya|Libyan]] targets in the [[Gulf of Sidra]] in [[1986]], and was used extensively by the [[United States Navy]] and the [[United States Air Force]] for Operation Desert Storm during the [[Gulf War]] of [[1991]].

The '''Harrier II''' is a family of second generation vertical/short takeoff and landing ([[V/STOL]])  [[turbofan|jet]] aircraft of the late 20th century. They were developed from the earlier [[Hawker-Siddeley Harrier]]s, are primarily used for light attack or [[multi-role]] tasks, and are almost all operated from small aircraft carriers. Versions of it are used primarily by [[NATO]] countries, and the non-NATO country of [[India]]. This includes:

*The [[Royal Air Force]] and [[Fleet Air Arm]] of the [[United Kingdom]] under a number of variants and versions starting in the late 1980s, including the GR7, T10, FRS1, FA.2 and T4 versions. (''see [[RAF Harrier II]], [[BAE Sea Harrier]] '')
*[[United States Marine Corps]] as the [[McDonnell Douglas AV-8B]] and TAV-8B starting in 1985.
*The [[Spanish Navy|Spanish Naval air wing]] (''Arma Aerea De La Armada'') as the [[EAV-8B]], AV8-S and TAV-8S.
*The [[Marina Militare|Italian Navy air wing]] (''Aviazione per la Marina Militare'') as the AV-8B and TAV-8.
*The [[Indian Navy]] as the FRS51 and T60.

The Harrier II is also notable in history as an example of U.S.-U.K cooperation and of [[Cold War]] defense achievements. Of note is the U.S aid funding early development under the [[Mutual Weapons Development Program]] (MWDP) and the salvaging of what was left of [[AV-16A Advanced Harrier Program]] by McDonnell Douglas, making the second-generation family possible.  

==History==
===Introduction===
The aircraft had its direct origins in a Joint U.S.-British project (Hawker-Siddeley and McDonnell Douglas Aircraft) for a much-improved Harrier aircraft, to be the AV-16A Advanced Harrier program. However cost over-runs in engine development on the part of Rolls Royce and in the aircraft development caused the British to pull out of the program. Interest remained in the U.S. so a less ambitious, though still expensive project was undertaken by McDonnell on their own catered to U.S. needs. Using things learned from AV-16A development, though dropping some things such as further Pegasus development, the development work continued leading the AV-8B for the U.S. Marine Corps. The aircraft was centered on the Marine's needs, light ground attack and was focused on payload and range as opposed to speed. In the late 1970 the British re-entered development of their own second generation Harrier based on the U.S. design leading eventually to the GR.5, which had somewhat different performance goals.

===Overview and Use===
The '''AV-8B''' is an extensively redesigned aircraft with a new [[composite material|composite]] wing, new cockpit and [[avionics]] (e.g., FLIR and new bombing system), and more powerful engine. The new wing enables higher take-off weights and more ordnance. The payload was nearly double and the range much increased over the older design, one of the chief complaints with the older type. It was focused primarily on close-air support, and all the added capabilities came at the cost of about 50 mph (80 km/h) slower speed. The AV-8B was put into service in January [[1985 in aviation|1985]] at a cost of US$21.6 million each. The design was further developed into later types with high-speed, that placed less focus on payload and range.

The primary mission of the AV-8B in [[USMC]] service is to provide responsive close air support for ground forces. This single-piloted, advanced V/STOL aircraft can operate from short fields, forward sites, roads and surface ships providing minimum response time to targets. Recent AV-8B II+ have an expanded secondary air-to-air role.

Three AV-8B squadrons stationed about 40 miles (64 km) from the [[Kuwait|Kuwaiti]] border, were the most forward deployed tactical strike aircraft during Operation [[Desert Storm]] and operated from relatively unprepared sites. One AV-8B squadron and one six-aircraft detachment operated off the landing helicopter ship [[USS Nassau|''USS Nassau'']] in the [[Persian Gulf]]. The average turnaround time during the ground war surge was 23 minutes.  A total of 86 [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] Harriers flew 3,567 sorties against [[Iraq]]i targets in [[Kuwait]] and Iraq.  Five Harriers were lost&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; four in combat.  Following the war, Marine Corps analysis showed that the placement of the engine nozzles that allow for the Harrier's Vertical Take-Off/Landing made the aircraft far more vulnerable to [[infrared]] [[surface-to-air missile]] fire than other aircraft. This is because the nozzles are almost dead center on the aircraft, which means that when infra-red guided missiles hit they generally damage a greater number of systems.

In the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Harrier II versions saw extensive usage by both the USMC and RAF. USMC Harriers were based on two USMC amphibious assault ships, [[USS Bataan (LHD-5)|''USS Bataan'' (LHD-5)]] and [[USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD-6)|''USS Bonhomme Richard'' (LHD-6)]]. Each carried 24 Harriers, about four times their normal complement of fixed-wing aircraft, and tried out the long dormant secondary purpose of the LHDs and LHAs, that of a small aircraft carrier, or sea control ship. RAF Harriers were shore-based in Kuwait. Two detachments from [[RAF Cottesmore]] were sent to the region, with one known to have been based at the Ahmed al Jaber Air Base ({{coor dms|28|56|05|N|47|47|31|E}}) in Kuwait, and the other at an undisclosed location. A total of 23 RAF Harriers took part in the campaign; one USMC Harrier crashed into the [[Persian Gulf]] early in the war while trying to land on the ''USS Nassau''. The pilot ejected.

The current AV-8B Remanufacture Program converts older AV-8B day attack aircraft to the most recent production radar/night attack configuration. This radar-equipped version of the AV-8B, called the AV-8B II+, became operational in the summer of [[1994 in aviation|1994]]. The AV-8B II+ uses the same [[AN/APG-65]] radar system as the [[F/A-18 Hornet]] and is able to carry [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]] missiles, giving the aircraft a considerable increase in anti-aircraft capabilities. However, these missiles are most likely to be deployed as a means of self-defense or airbase defense instead of air superiority, because despite its agility, the Harrier is subsonic and therefore slower than most fighters. 

'''Avionics:''' [[AN/APG-65]] radar, ASB-19(V) angle-rate bombing system, laser spot tracker, TV tracker, CEC-Marconi [[FLIR]], [[GPS]]

==Manufacture==
Aircraft were built by McDonnell Douglas and [[BAE Systems]] the latter at their [[Warton]] facility in [[Preston]], [[Lancashire]] in the [[UK]]. The factory is also home to the [[Panavia Tornado]], [[SEPECAT Jaguar]], [[BAE Hawk|BAe Hawk T1]] , [[Hawker-Siddeley Nimrod#MRA4|BAe Nimrod MRA4]] and more currently being built there the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]].

The aircraft is known mainly as the '''AV-8B''' in [[USMC]] service and the '''[[RAF Harrier II|GR7/GR9]]''' in RAF service. The '''AV-8A''' (and also TAV-8A versions) , which was the previous generation of Harrier and should not be confused with the next generation, was a [[Hawker-Siddeley Harrier#Harrier GR.3|Hawker-Siddeley Harrier GR.3]] procured for the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]].

==Variants==
Harrier II variants can vary significantly depending on the exact model, even among a single country's aircraft. 

* '''YAV-8B''' 
* '''AV-8B''' Harrier II&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Two versions were developed.  The first was commonly known as the &quot;Day Attack&quot; variant.  Later, a &quot;Night Attack&quot; variant was fielded (1991).  The Night Attack Harrier incorporated a Navigation Forward Looking Infrared camera (NAV FLIR) and the cockpit was made compatible with night vision goggles (NVGs).  It was also able to use the larger Rolls Royce engine.  The II+ described below is identical to the Night Attack variant, except it incorporates an APG-65 radar, the same as in early F/A-18 Hornets.
* '''AV-8B II+'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; AV-8B with radar (APG-65) allowing firing of radar guided air-to-air missiles; should be designated '''AV-8C'''.
* '''AV-8C'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; An experimental version developed from the AV-8B model
* '''TAV-8B''' Harrier II&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; A two-seat trainer version

* '''EAV-8B'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Spanish Navy version

* '''Harrier GR5'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; First RAF version of [[RAF Harrier II]]
* '''Harrier GR7'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Avionics upgrade to GR5
* '''Harrier GR7A'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; GR7 with more powerful engine
* '''Harrier GR9'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Avionics upgrade to GR7

The '''AGM-65 Maverick''' is an [[air-to-surface missile|air-to-surface tactical missile]] (ASM) designed for close air support, prohibition, and forceful prevention. It is effective against a wide range of [[Military tactic|tactical]] targets, including [[armor]], air defenses, [[ship]]s, ground transportation, and fuel storage facilities.

The AGM-65F ([[infrared]] targeting) used by the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] has an [[infrared]] guidance system optimized for ship tracking and a larger penetrating warhead than the [[shaped charge]] used by the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] and the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] (300 pounds (136 kg) vs 125 pounds (57 kg)). The AGM-65 has two types of [[warhead]]s; one has a contact [[Fuse (explosives)#Fuze|fuze]] in the nose, and the other has a heavyweight warhead with a delayed fuze, which penetrates the target with its [[kinetic energy]] before firing. The latter is most effective against large, hard targets. The propulsion system for both types is a solid-fuel rocket motor behind the warhead.

AGM-65 missiles were employed by [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]s and [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]]s during Operation [[Gulf War|Desert Storm]] in [[1991]] to attack armored targets. Mavericks played a large part in the destruction of [[Iraq]]'s military force. 

LAU-117 Maverick launchers have also been used on USA navy and air force [[aircraft]]: [[A-4 Skyhawk]], [[A-6 Intruder]], [[A-7 Corsair II]], [[AH-1 Cobra|AH-1W]], [[AV-8 Harrier II]], [[F-4 Phantom II]], [[F-5 Freedom Fighter]], [[F-15 Eagle]], [[F/A-18 Hornet]], [[General Dynamics F-111]], [[P-3 Orion]], and [[SH-2 Seasprite|SH-2G]]; and the [[Royal Air Force|UK Royal Air Force]]' [[AV-8 Harrier II|Harrier GR7]].

      <comment>clarify, AIM-54 is still a missile, just not in use</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AIM-54 Phoenix.jpg|thumb|300px|An AIM-54 Phoenix]]The '''AIM-54 Phoenix''' is a long-range [[air-to-air missile|air-to-air]] [[missile]], carried in clusters of up to six missiles on the [[F-14 Tomcat]], the only aircraft capable of carrying it.

The Phoenix missile was the [[US Navy]]'s only long-range air-to-air missile. It is an airborne weapons control system with multiple-target handling capabilities, used to kill multiple air targets with conventional warheads. Near simultaneous launch is possible against up to six targets in all weather and heavy jamming environments. The improved Phoenix, the AIM-54C, was developed to better counter projected threats from tactical aircraft and cruise missiles.

The AIM-54 Phoenix was retired from USN service on [[30 September]] [[2004 in aviation|2004]].

==Versions==
'''AIM-54A''': The original version to become operational, in [[1974 in aviation|1974]]. 

'''AIM-54C''': Improved version, better able to counter [[cruise missiles]]. Superseded the AIM-54A from [[1986 in aviation|1986]].

'''AIM-54 ECCM/[[Sealed round|Sealed]]''': Improved to include electronic counter-countermeasure capabilities, does not require coolant conditioning during captive flight. Used from [[1988 in aviation|1988]] onwards.

Because the AIM-54 ECCM/Sealed receives no coolant, [[F-14 Tomcat|Tomcats]] carrying this version of the missile may not exceed a certain airspeed.
In recent years, [[Iran]] is said to have developed its own version of the Phoenix.

==Combat performance==
Reports of use of the 285 missiles supplied to Iran [http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0077.shtml] during the [[Iran-Iraq War]], from 1980&amp;ndash;88, vary, with some sources claiming as many as 25 kills with it [http://www.iiaf.net/aircraft/jetfighters/F14/f14.html] and others suggesting sabotage of the aircraft making it impossible to fire the missile or no kills for other reasons. It is generally reported that the primary use of the [[F-14]] was as an [[airborne early warning]] aircraft, guarded by other fighters. However, some insist that this is incorrect and point to the experience of fighting Iraqi pilots during the [[1991 Gulf War]]. Iraqi fighter pilots consistently turned and fled as soon as American F-14 pilots turned on their fighters' very distinctive [[AN/AWG-9]] radars.

The [[Gulf of Sidra incident (1981)]], in which American F-14s shot down 2 [[Libya]]n [[Su-22]]s is sometimes thought to have involved AIM-54. However, the engagement was conducted at short ranges using the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]]. The other US F-14 fighter to fighter engagement, the [[Gulf of Sidra incident (1989)]] used [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] and Sidewinder missiles, not the Phoenix.

In training, the Phoenix hit a target drone at a range of 212 km (in January 1979, in Iran).

Actual ranges at which the Phoenix has successfully hit targets in tests:
* longest shot to kill: ~ 140 km
* average engagement ranges: 20 to 70 km
* the shortest shot to kill: 7.5 km

Other than the possible Iranian firings, the only confirmed combat use of the Phoenix was the use of it by 2 F-14Ds engaging [[Iraq]]i [[MiG-25]]s.  Both missiles missed.  One reportedly followed a MiG-25 into the ground that possibly crashed when it ran out of fuel.

[[Image:A10Thunderbolt2 990422-F-7910D-517.jpg|thumb|right|300px|USAF A-10A Thunderbolt II]]
[[Image:Thunderbolt - Closeup.jpg|thumb|right|300px|USAF A-10 Thunderbolt from 1975]]
The '''A-10/OA-10 Thunderbolt II''', nicknamed and universally known as the &quot;Warthog&quot;, is the first [[US Air Force]] aircraft designed for [[close air support]](CAS) of ground forces. It is a simple, effective and hardy single-seat, twin-engine [[jet aircraft]] designed to attack [[tank]]s, [[armored vehicle]]s, and other ground targets. It is named after the [[P-47 Thunderbolt]] of World War II, a plane that was particularly good at the CAS mission.

==Origins==
The A-10 was developed in response to the increasing vulnerability of ground attack-planes as evidence by the large number that were shot down  to small arms fire, surface-to-air missiles, and low level anti-aircraft gunfire druing the Vietnam War. This led to a need for a specialized, heavily armed, heavily armored aircraft. Previous aircraft used in the CAS mission had been bombers or fighters pressed into the job.

On [[6 March]] [[1967 in aviation|1967]] the US Air Force released a request for information to 21 companies. Their objective was to create a design study for a low cost attack aircraft designated A-X, or &quot;Attack Experimental&quot;. In May [[1970 in aviation|1970]], the USAF issued a modified, yet much more detailed request for proposals (RFP). Six companies submitted contestants to the USAF, with [[Northrop]] and [[Fairchild-Republic]]  selected to build prototypes: the [[Northrop YA-9|YA-9A]] and YA-10A, respectively. 

First flight of the A-10 was in May [[1972 in aviation|1972]]. After trials and a flyoff against the A-9, the Air Force selected Fairchild-Republic's A-10 as the winner on [[10 January]] [[1973 in aviation|1973]]. The first production A-10 flew in October [[1975 in aviation|1975]], and deliveries to the Air Force commenced in March [[1976 in aviation|1976]]. The first squadron to use the A-10 went operational in October [[1977 in aviation|1977]]. 715 aircraft were produced, ending in [[1984 in aviation|1984]]. One experimental two-seat version was built.

==Description==
[[Image:Thunderbolt - Formation.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Four A-10 Thunderbolt IIs fly in formation during a refueling mission.]]

===Features===
The A-10/OA-10 has excellent maneuverability at low speeds and altitude, thanks to wide, straight wings. These also allow short takeoffs and landings, permitting operations from airfields near front lines. The plane can loiter for extended periods of time and operate under 1,000 foot (300 m) ceilings with 1.5-mile (2.4 km) visibility. It can fly at a relatively slow speed of 200 mph (320&amp;nbsp;km/h), which makes it better at ground-attack than fast [[fighter-bomber]]s, which often have difficulty targeting small and slow-moving targets.

The 'Warthog' is exceptionally hardy, with a strong airframe that can survive direct hits from armor-piercing and high-explosive projectiles up to 23mm. The aircraft has triple redundancy in its flight systems, with mechanical systems to back up double-redundant [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] systems. This permits pilots to fly and land when hydraulic power or part of a wing is lost. The aircraft is  designed to fly with one engine and a wing torn off. Self-sealing fuel tanks are protected by fire-retardant foam.

The cockpit and parts of the flight-control system are protected by 900 pounds (400 kg) of [[titanium]] [[armor]], referred to as a &quot;titanium bathtub.&quot; Its engine exhaust passes over the aircraft's [[Stabilizer (aircraft)|horizontal stabilizer]] and between the [[twin tail]]s, decreasing the A-10's infrared signature and lowering the likelihood that the aircraft can be targeted by heatseeking missiles. The placement of the engines partially shields them from anti-aircraft fire behind the wings and tail. The A-10 can fly even after the loss of one side of the tail, 2/3 of a single wing, and one engine.

The Thunderbolt II can be serviced and operated from bases with limited facilities near battle areas. An unusual feature is that many of the aircraft's parts are interchangeable between the left and right sides, including the engines, main [[landing gear]], and vertical stabilizers. A built-in ladder allows the pilot to enter or exit the aircraft without assistance. The sturdy landing gear, low-pressure tires and large, straight wings allow operation from short rough strips even with a heavy ordnance load. These also allow the aircraft to operate from damaged airbases. The aircraft is designed to be re-fueled, re-armed, and serviced with minimal equipment. Operating from a forward area is both useful for close air support and necessary due to the A-10's relatively low cruise and top speeds. 

Although the A-10 can carry a considerable weight of disposable stores, its primary built-in weapon is the 30&amp;nbsp;mm [[GAU-8 Avenger|GAU-8/A Avenger]] [[Gatling gun]]. One of the most powerful aircraft cannon ever flown, it fires large, [[depleted uranium]] armor-piercing shells at a rate of 4,200 rounds per minute. The massive shells and high muzzle velocity allow the Avenger to destroy heavily armored [[main battle tank]]s in as little as 6 direct hits. The gun is accurate as well, capable of placing 80% of its shots within a 30 ft. wide circle from a distance of 1 mile while the aircraft is in flight. The chassis of the plane is actually built around the gun. 

Despite the power of the GAU-8, the principal weapon of the A-10 is the [[AGM-65 Maverick]] air-to-surface missile, with electro-optical targeting. The Maverick allows targets to be engaged at much greater ranges than the cannon, a safer proposition in the face of modern anti-aircraft systems. Other weapons include [[cluster bomb]]s and rocket pods. Although the A-10 is equipped to deliver conventional and [[laser-guided bomb]]s, their use is relatively uncommon. A-10s usually fly with an [[Electronic countermeasures|ECM pod]] under one wing and two [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] [[air-to-air missile]]s under the other for self-defense.

===Criticisms===
The A-10 has been criticized for its minimal avionics fit. It was originally intended purely for close air support, for which it was felt that complex electronics would be unnecessary (and would have an undesirable effect on serviceability and cost). Initial fit provided basic communications, a [[RWR|radar-warning system]], and [[TACAN]] navigation, early aircraft lacking even an [[autopilot]]. As [[United States Air Force|USAF]] emphasis shifted towards the anti-armor role, presumably in a conflict with the [[Warsaw Pact]] in Western [[Europe]], where weather is frequently poor, there was pressure for improved sensors and electronics. Fairchild-Republic offered a two-seat NAW (Night and Adverse Weather) variant beginning in 1977, but it was not adopted. Aircraft were eventually upgraded with [[inertial navigation]] and a [[Pave Penny]] laser sensor (marked target seeker) pod that allowed the pilot to detect laser energy for PID (Positive Identification) of an illuminated target. The Pave Penny is a passive seeker and cannot self-designate a target for an LGB (Laser Guided Bomb). However, the A-10 can drop LGBs with the the help of another aircraft (Buddy-Lase) or, when equipped with a targeting pod, Self-Lase.

The A-10 also initially lacked systems to compute target range or impact points, greatly limiting its ability to deliver weapons other than cannon and rocket fire (in direct, visual-range attacks) or the self-guided [[AGM-65 Maverick]] missile, whose own sensors displayed imagery in the A-10's cockpit. Often times this small monitor would provide the only source of imagery for missions that took place in dark environments. Much later in the 'Warthog's' career, the Low-Altitude Safety and Targeting Enhancement (LASTE) upgrade provided computerized weapon-aiming equipment, an autopilot, and ground-collision warning system. The A-10 is now compatible with [[night-vision]] goggles for low-light operation. In 1999, aircraft began to be given [[Global Positioning System]] navigation systems.

==Operational service==
[[Image:Usaf.thunderbolt2.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|An A-10 Thunderbolt II in flight fully loaded with armaments]]

The first unit to receive the A-10 Thunderbolt II was the [[355th Tactical Training Wing]], based at [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]], Arizona in March [[1976 in aviation|1976]].

A-10s were initially an unwelcome addition to the arsenal in the eyes of Air Force brass. The Air Force prized the high-flying, high-performance [[F-15]] and [[F-16]] jets, and were determined to leave the dirty work of close air support to Army [[helicopters]].

The planes proved their mettle in the [[Persian Gulf War]] in 1991, destroying more than 1,000 tanks, 2,000 military vehicles and 1,200 artillery pieces. Five A-10s were shot down during the war (a number of those by [[ZSU-23-4 Shilka|ZSU-23-4 Shilka]]), far fewer than military planners expected. A-10s had a mission capable rate of 95.7 percent, flew 8,100 sorties and launched 90 percent of the [[AGM-65 Maverick]] missiles.

In the 1990s many A-10s were shifted to the &quot;[[forward air control]] (FAC)&quot; role and redesignated O/A-10. In the FAC role the 'Warthog' is typically equipped with up to six pods of 5 inch (127&amp;nbsp;mm) Zuni rockets, usually with smoke or [[white phosphorus]] warheads used for target marking. They remain fully combat capable despite the redesignation.

A-10s again saw service in the 1999 [[Kosovo War]], in later stages of the 2001 [[U.S. invasion of Afghanistan|invasion of Afghanistan]] from an air base at [[Bagram]], including [[Operation Anaconda]] in March 2002, and in the [[2003 Iraq War|2003 Iraq war]].  Sixty A-10s were deployed in Iraq; one was shot down near [[Baghdad International Airport]] by Iraqi fire late in the campaign.

A-10 pilots have been involved in a number of notorious '[[friendly fire]]' incidents.  In the [[Gulf War]] of 1991 an A-10 attacked two [[British Army]] [[Warrior Tracked Armoured Vehicle|Warrior Infantry Fighting Vehicles]] (out of 37 parked up), killing nine soldiers. Two [[FV107 Scimitar|British Scimitar]] armoured reconnaissance vehicles were attacked by an A-10 in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq War]] of 2003.  They were also involved in a friendly fire incident with a U.S. Marine [[Amphibious Assault Vehicle]] at the Battle of Nasiriyah during the opening stages of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom|Operation IRAQI FREEDOM]].

The A-10 is scheduled to stay in service with the USAF until 2028, when it may be replaced by the [[F-35 Joint Strike Fighter|Joint Strike Fighter]]. Beginning in 2005 the entire A-10 fleet is being  upgraded to the &quot;C&quot; model that will include improved FCS, ECM, and the ability to carry smart bombs. However, the A-10 could stay in service indefinitely due to both its low cost and its unique capabilities which the Joint Strike Fighter simply cannot incorporate such as its cannon, ruggedness, and slow flying capabilities.

==Nicknames==
====Friendly Forces====
The A-10 Thunderbolt II received the nickname &quot;[[Warthog]]&quot; and dates back to Fairchild-Republic's initial deliveries. The name was derived from the report of the main gun, which has a surprisingly low pitch and sounds much like the snorting or grunting of a hog. This coupled with the A-10's lack of aesthetics and &quot;thick skin&quot; earned it the nickname &quot;[[Warthog]]&quot;.

====Enemy Forces====
During Desert Storm, captured Iraqi soldiers referred to A-10 as 'the silent gun'.  The rounds hit their target before the target heard the report of the gunfire.

==Trivia==
The [[GAU-8/A 30mm Avenger Cannon|GAU-8 Avenger cannon]] is said to produce almost the same amount of force as one of the A-10's engines, leading to a persistent military legend that if enough bullets could be carried and fired in a long burst, the plane would stop flying (or move backwards, in some versions of the legend). Using the specs from the [http://www.gdatp.com/products/lethality/gau-8a/gau-8.htm GAU-8/A product homepage], the recoil force of the GAU-8/A is measured to an average of 10,000 [[pound-force|lbf]] (45 kN). While the recoil force is considerable, the cannon is employed only in short bursts to protect the barrel cluster from overheating. Even if both engines were stopped and the jet was gliding unpowered, firing the cannon will not bring it to a stop in midair, only slow it down much in the same manner as if an airbrake was deployed.

Of further note on the impressive cannon recoil force, the A-10's nosewheel gear assembly is situated in the less than optimal off-centre-line position (immediately starboard of the gun). This design feature was necessary to accommodate the GAU-8 in the centre-line position as off-centre placement would result in potentially catastrophic yaw forces on firing the cannon.

The A-10 was the inspiration for the [[COBRA Rattler]] aircraft seen in the 1980s cartoon series GI Joe, as well as the [[Autobots|Autobot]] [[Powerglide (Transformers)|Powerglide]] in the [[The Transformers]].

[[Image:AC-130.jpg|250px|right|thumb|An AC-130, illustrating the port-side armament.]]

The '''AC-130 Gunship''' is an armed variant of the [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[C-130 Hercules]]. Manufacturing is a cooperation between [[Boeing]] and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]].
 
The primary missions of the [[United States Air Force]]'s '''AC-130H Spectre''' and '''AC-130U Spooky''' [[gunship]]s are [[close air support]], [[air interdiction]], and force protection. Missions in close air support are troops in contact, [[convoy]] [[escort]] and urban operations. Air interdiction missions are conducted against planned targets or targets of opportunity. Force protection missions include [[air base]] [[Defense (military)|defense]] and facilities defense.
 
==Equipment==
 
These heavily armed aircraft incorporate side-firing weapons integrated with sophisticated sensor, navigation and fire control systems to provide targeted firepower or area saturation whilst spending long periods flying over their target area at [[night]] and in adverse [[weather]]. The sensor suite consists of a [[television]] sensor, [[infrared]] sensor, and [[radar]]. These sensors allow the gunship to visually or electronically identify friendly ground forces and targets in most conditions. The AC-130U is equipped with the [[AN/APQ-180]], a [[synthetic aperture radar]] for long-range target detection and identification. The gunship's navigational devices include the [[inertial navigation]] systems and [[global positioning system]]. The AC-130U employs technologies developed in the [[1990 in aviation|1990s]] and can attack two targets simultaneously. It also has twice the [[munitions]] capacity of the AC-130H.

==History==
[[Image:AC-130 firing night.gif|right|250px|thumb|Weapons fire during a night mission.]]
* '''First flight:''' AC-130H: [[1966 in aviation|1966]] ''' (AC-130U: [[20 December]] [[1990 in aviation|1990]])
* '''Entered service:''' AC-130H: [[1972 in aviation|1972]]  (AC-130U: [[1995 in aviation|1995]])

The AC-130 gunship has a combat history dating to the [[Vietnam War]], where it replaced the [[AC-47 Spooky|AC-47]] and the [[AC-119 gunship|AC-119]]. Gunships destroyed more than 10,000 trucks and were credited with many crucial close air support missions. During [[Invasion of Grenada|Operation Urgent Fury]] in [[Grenada]] in [[1983 in aviation|1983]], AC-130s suppressed enemy air defense systems and attacked ground forces enabling the successful assault of the Point Salines Airfield via [[airdrop]] and air land of friendly forces. The AC-130 aircrew earned the [[Lt. Gen. William H. Tunner Award]] for the mission.
 
AC-130s also had a primary role during [[Operation Just Cause]] in [[Panama]] in [[1989 in aviation|1989]] when they destroyed [[Military of Panama|Panama Defense Force]] headquarters and numerous command and control facilities. Aircrews earned the [[Mackay Trophy]] for the most meritorious flight of the year and the [[Tunner Award]] for their efforts.
 
During Operation [[Desert Storm]], AC-130s provided close air support and force protection (air base defense) for ground forces. Gunships were also used during operations [[Operation Restore Hope]] and [[United Shield]] in [[Somalia]], providing close air support for [[United Nations]] ground forces. More recently, gunships played a pivotal role in supporting the [[NATO]] mission in [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]]. The AC-130H provided air interdiction against key targets in the [[Sarajevo]] area.
 
In [[1997 in aviation|1997]], gunships were diverted from [[Italy]] to provide combat air support for U.S. and allied ground troops during the evacuation of American noncombatants in [[Albania]]. Gunships also were part of the buildup of U.S. forces in [[1998 in aviation|1998]] to convince [[Iraq]] to comply with U.N. weapons inspections. Gunships were later used in the [[U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]] and the [[2003 Iraq War]].
 
====Current deployment====
 
The AC-130H is produced at a cost of $132.4 million U.S. Dollars, and the AC-130U is produced at a cost of $190 million U.S. Dollars (fiscal [[2001 in aviation|2001]] constant dollars).  Currently there are eight AC-130H and thirteen AC-130U aircraft in active duty service.

The AC-130 gunship series is one of the most expensive aircraft ever made due to its unique nature.  In all deployments these aircraft are to be escorted by two [[F-15 Eagle]]s each, flying [[combat air patrol]] due to the value of both the aircraft and its mission.

==Civilian casualties and controversy==
 
The use of gunships in general and the AC-130 in particular has been controversial at times.  Although the onboard systems are effective at identifying targets, it is unable to reliably tell whether those targets are civilians or military.  Incidents of attacks on demonstrations[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Apr2003/n04162003_200304161.html] and weddings[http://foi.missouri.edu/whistleblowing/uswarned.html] have been explained by celebratory firing of small-caliber weapons (e.g., [[AK-47]]s). Further, in combat areas such as [[Vietnam]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]], fighters tend to be mixed with, or are in fact a part of the local population, often claimed to be a deliberate use of civilians as &quot;[[human shield]]s&quot;.  This intermingling of population with fighters means that attacks on military targets risk civilian casualties, since it is impossible to distinguish un-uniformed combatants from noncombatants.

The greater accuracy of attacks from the AC-130 has been claimed [http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/1019/p3s1-usmi.htm] to reduce accidental casualties compared to high-level bombing.

      <comment>[[Emil Artin]] as originator of theorem (presumably)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[abstract algebra]], an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] is called '''alternative''' if (''xx'')''y''=''x''(''xy'') and ''y''(''xx'')=(''yx'')''x'' for all ''x'' and ''y'' in the algebra, that is, if the multiplication is [[alternativity|alternative]].

Equivalently, an algebra is alternative if and only if the [[subalgebra]] generated by any two of its elements is [[associative]]. The equivalence of the two definitions is known as '''Artin's theorem''', after [[Emil Artin]].

For any two elements ''x'' and ''y'' in an alternative algebra another simple identity holds: (''xy'')''x'' = ''x''(''yx''). This is called the ''flexible law''.

Every [[associative algebra]] is obviously alternative, but so too are some non-associative algebras such as the [[octonion]]s. The [[sedenion]]s are not alternative.

Alternativity in algebras is a condition weaker than associativity but stronger than [[power associativity]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[economics]], '''arbitrage''' is the practice of taking advantage of a state of imbalance between two or more [[market]]s: a combination of matching deals are struck that exploit the imbalance, the profit being the difference between the [[market price]]s.  When used by academics, an arbitrage is a transaction that involves no negative cash flow at any probabilistic or temporal state and a positive cash flow in at least one state.  A person who engages in arbitrage is called an '''arbitrageur'''. The term is mainly applied to trading in [[financial instruments]], such as [[bond]]s, [[stock]]s, [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and [[currency|currencies]].

If the market prices do not allow for profitable arbitrage, the prices are said to constitute an '''arbitrage equilibrium'''. An arbitrage equilibrium is a precondition for a [[general equilibrium|general economic equilibrium]].

[[Statistical arbitrage]] is an imbalance in expected values.  A casino usually has a statistical arbitrage in every game of chance played, even though it could lose money on any single game.

== Conditions for arbitrage ==
Arbitrage is possible when one of three conditions is met:

#The same asset does not trade at the same price on all markets (&quot;the law of one price&quot;). 
#Two assets with identical cash flows do not trade at the same price.
#An asset with a known price in the future does not today trade at its future price [[discount | discounted]] at the [[risk-free interest rate]] (or, the asset does not have negligible costs of storage; as such, for example, this condition holds for grain but not for [[security (finance)|securities]]).

:See [[rational pricing]], particularly [[rational pricing#Arbitrage mechanics|arbitrage mechanics]], for further discussion.

== Examples ==
* Suppose that the [[exchange rate]]s (after taking out the fees for making the exchange) in London are £5 = $10 = ¥1000 and the exchange rates in Tokyo are ¥1000 = £6 = $10.  Converting $10 to £6 in Tokyo and converting that £6 into $12 in London, for a profit of $2, would be arbitrage.  In reality, this &quot;triangle arbitrage&quot; is so simple that it almost never occurs.  But more complicated foreign exchange arbitrages, such as the spot-forward arbitrage (see [[Interest Rate Parity]]) are much more common.

*One example of arbitrage involves the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]]. When the price of a stock on the NYSE and its corresponding [[futures contract]] on the CME are out of sync, one can buy the less expensive one and sell the more expensive.  Because the differences between the prices are likely to be small (and not to last very long), this can only be done profitably with computers examining a large number of prices and automatically exercising a trade when the prices are far enough out of balance. The activity of other arbitrageurs can make this risky. Those with the fastest computers and the smartest mathematicians take advantage of series of small differentials that would not be profitable if taken individually.

*If you can buy items at one price at a [[factory outlet]] and sell them for a higher price on an internet [[auction]] [[website]] such as [[eBay]], you can exploit the imbalance between those two markets for those items.

*Economists use the term &quot;global labor arbitrage&quot; to refer to the tendency of manufacturing jobs to flow towards whichever country has the lowest wages per unit output at present and has reached the minimum requisite level of political and economic development to support [[industrialization]].  At present, many such jobs appear to be flowing towards [[People's Republic of China|China]], though some which require English are going to [[India]].

*Sports arbitrage - numerous [[internet]] [[bookmakers]] offer odds on the outcome of the same event.  Any given bookmaker will weight their odds so that no one [[customer]] can cover all outcomes at a profit against their books.  However, in order to remain competitive their margins are usually quite low.  Different bookmakers may offer different odds on the same outcome of a given event; by taking the best odds offered by each bookmaker, a customer can under some circumstances cover all possible outcomes of the event and assure that they receive a small risk-free profit.

*[[Exchange-traded fund]] arbitrage - Exchange Traded Funds allow authorized participants to exchange back and forth between shares in underlying securities held by the fund and shares in the fund itself, rather than allowing the buying and selling of shares in the ETF directly with the fund sponsor. ETFs trade in the open market, with prices set by market demand. An ETF may trade at a premium or discount to the value of the underlying assets. When a significant enough premium appears, an arbitrageur will buy the underlying securities, convert them to shares in the ETF, and sell them in the open market. When a discount appears, an abitrageur will do the reverse. In this way, the arbitrageur makes a low-risk profit, while fulfilling a useful function in the ETF marketplace by keeping ETF prices in line with their undelying value. 

==Price convergence==
Arbitrage has the effect of causing prices in different markets to converge. As a result of arbitrage, the currency [[exchange rate]]s, the price of [[commodities]], and the price of securities in different markets tend to converge to the same prices, in all markets, in each category. The speed at which prices converge is a measure of market efficiency. Arbitrage tends to reduce [[price discrimination]] by encouraging people to buy an item where the price is low and resell it where the price is high, as long as the buyers are not prohibited from reselling and the transactions cost of buying, holding and reselling are small relative to the difference in prices in the different markets.

Arbitrage moves different currencies toward [[purchasing power parity]]. As an example, assume that a car purchased in [[United States of America|America]] is cheaper than the same car in Canada. Canadians would buy their cars across the border to exploit the arbitrage condition. At the same time, Americans would buy US cars, transport them across the border, and sell them in Canada. Canadians would have to buy American Dollars to buy the cars, and Americans would have to sell the Canadian dollars they received in exchange for the exported cars. Both actions would increase demand for US Dollars, and supply of Canadian Dollars, and as a result, there would be an appreciation of the US Dollar. Eventually, if unchecked, this would make US cars more expensive for all buyers, and Canadian cars cheaper, until there is no longer an incentive to buy cars in the US and sell them in Canada.
More generally, international arbitrage opportunities in [[commodity|commodities]], goods, [[security|securities]] and [[currency|currencies]], on a grand scale, tend to change [[exchange rate]]s until the [[purchasing power]] is equal.

In reality, of course, one must consider taxes and the costs of travelling back and forth between the US and Canada. Also, the features built into the cars sold in the US are not exactly the same as the features built into the cars for sale in Canada, due, among other things, to the different emissions and other auto regulations in the two countries. In addition, our example assumes that no duties have to be paid on importing or exporting cars from the USA to Canada.
Similarly, most [[asset]]s exhibit (small) differences between countries, and [[transaction cost]]s, taxes, and other costs provide an impediment to this kind of arbitrage.

Similarly, arbitrage affects the difference in interest rates paid on government bonds, issued by the various countries, given the expected depreciations in the currencies, relative to each other (see [[Interest Rate Parity]]).

== Risks ==
Arbitrage transactions in modern securities markets involve fairly low risks. Generally it is impossible to close two or three transactions at the same instant; therefore, there is the possibility that when one part of the deal is closed, a quick shift in prices makes it impossible to close the other at a profitable price. There is also counter-party risk, that the other party to one of the deals fails to deliver as agreed; though unlikely, this hazard is serious because of the large quantities one must trade in order to make a profit on small price differences. These risks become magnified when [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]] or borrowed money is used. 

Another risk occurs if the items being bought and sold are not identical and the arbitrage is conducted under the assumption that the prices of the items are correlated or predictable. In the extreme case this is risk arbitrage, described below. In comparison to the classical quick arbitrage transaction, such an operation can produce disastrous losses.

In the [[1980s]], [[risk arbitrage]] became common. In this form of [[speculation]], one trades a security that is clearly undervalued or overvalued, when it is seen that the wrong valuation is about to be corrected by events. The standard example is the stock of a company, undervalued in the stock market, which is about to be the object of a takeover bid; the price of the takeover will more truly reflect the value of the company, giving a large profit to those who bought at the current price&amp;mdash;if the merger goes through as predicted. Traditionally, arbitrage transactions in the securities markets involve high speed and low risk. At some moment a price difference exists, and the problem is to execute two or three balancing transactions while the difference persists (that is, before the other arbitrageurs act). When the transaction involves a delay of weeks or months, as above, it may entail considerable risk if borrowed money is used to magnify the reward through leverage.  One way of reducing the risk is through the illegal use of inside information, and in fact risk arbitrage with regard to [[leveraged buyout]]s was associated with some of the famous financial scandals of the 1980s such as those involving [[Michael Milken]] and [[Ivan Boesky]].

'''Ammunition''' is a generic [[military]] term meaning (the assembly of) a [[projectile]] and its [[gunpowder|propellant]]. It is derived through [[French language|French]] from the [[Latin]] ''munire'' (to provide). See also [[munition]].

== Glossary ==
*Small projectiles, like those fired from [[rifle]]s and [[handgun]]s (collectively known as small arms), are called [[bullet]]s.
*A &quot;round&quot; is a unit of ammunition per person firing; for small arms this is the combination of bullet, propellant, primer and cartridge case.
*Large [[caliber]] [[gun]]s often fire explosive-filled projectiles known as [[shell (projectile)|shell]]s, the equivalent non-explosive projectile is a ''shot'' (see [[artillery]]).  
*Large numbers of small projectiles intended to be fired all at once in a single discharge are also called shot; hand-held guns designed for this type of ammunition are generally known as [[shotgun]]s. 
*[[Dud]]s are ammunition that fail to work as intended.

== General information ==
[[Image:cartridges.jpg|thumb|[[5.56 mm caliber|5.56 mm]] (223 Remington) ammunition]]
The design of the ammunition is determined by its purpose; anti-personnel ammunition is often designed to break up or tumble inside the target, in order to maximize the damage done. Anti-personnel shells contain [[shrapnel]] and are designed to explode in mid-air, so its fragments will spread over a large area. Armor-piercing ammunition tends to be hard, sharp, and narrow, often with [[lubrication]]. Incendiary projectiles include a material such as [[phosphorus|white phosphorus]] which burns fiercely. [[Tracer ammunition|Tracer]] ammunition emits light as it travels, allowing the gunner to see the path of bullets in flight while using a [[machine gun]].

Popular types of military rifle and [[machine-gun]] ammunition include the [[5.45 mm caliber|5.45 mm]], [[5.56 mm caliber|5.56 mm]], and [[7.62 mm caliber|7.62 mm]]. [[tank|Main battle tanks]] use [[KE-penetrator]]s to combat other MBTs and [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s, and HE-Frag (High Explosive-Fragmentation) for [[soft target]]s such as [[infantry]]. 

Ammunition, particularly that of small arms, is specified by an extremely wide range of designations derived from metric and English measurements, commercial firms' private systems, and the different requirements of armies of different countries. For example, the same round in the US Army was termed .30 (inch) but in the British Army was termed .303 (inch) during the First and Second World Wars; although there was at the time some difference in the inches used by the two countries, that was not enough to make for the difference. German firms in the late twentieth century have decided to make &quot;all-metric&quot; ammunition, a refinement of existing designs. 

[[Match-grade]] ammunition is of exceptionally good quality, intended for target shooting competition.

The components of ammunition intended for rifles and [[ordnance]] may be divided into these categories:
* [[explosive|explosives]] and [[gunpowder|propellants]]
* [[projectile]]s of all kinds
* [[cartridge (weaponry)|cartridges]]

== Storage ==
=== Historical (circa World War I) ===
[[Image:M60andsoldierwithammoinnam.jpg|thumb|250px|A soldier mans an [[M60 machine gun]], linked 7.62 mm rounds are draped over the tree]]

These general conditions apply to the storage of ammunition in [[fortress]]es. Here the positions for the [[ammunition dump|magazine]] and ammunition stores are so chosen as to afford the best means of protection from an enemy's fire. Huge earth [[parapet]]s cover these buildings, which are further strengthened, where possible, by [[traverse]]s protecting the entrances. For the purpose of filling, emptying, and examining [[cannon]] cartridges and shell, a [[laboratory]] is generally provided at some distance from the magazine. The various stores for explosives are classified into those under magazine conditions (such as magazines, laboratories, and cartridge stores) and those with which these restrictions need not be observed (such as ammunition and shell stores). The interior walls of a magazine are lined, and the floors laid so that there may be no exposed [[iron]] or [[steel]]. At the entrance, there is a lobby or barrier, inside which persons about to enter the magazine change their clothes for a special suit, and their boots for a pair made without nails. In an ammunition or shell store these precautions need not be taken except where the shell store and the adjacent cartridge store have a common entrance; persons entering may do so in their ordinary clothes. A large work may have a main magazine and several subsidiary magazines, from which the
stock of cartridges is renewed in the cartridge stores attached to each group of guns or in the expense cartridge stores and cartridge recesses. The same applies to main ammunition stores which supply the shell stores, expense stores, and recesses.

The supply of ammunition are either for [[gun]]s forming the movable armament or for guns placed in permanent positions. The movable armament will consist of guns and [[howitzer]]s of small and medium caliber, and it is necessary to arrange suitable expense cartridge stores and shell stores close to the available positions. They can generally be constructed to form part of the permanent work in the projected face of traverses or other strong formations, and should be arranged for a twenty-four hour supply of ammunition. These stores are refilled from the main magazine every night under cover of darkness. Light [[railway]]s join the various positions. The guns mounted in permanent emplacements are divided into groups of two or three guns each, and usually each group will require but one calibre of ammunition. A cartridge store, shell store and a general store, all well ventilated, are arranged for the especial service of such a group of guns. In the cartridge store the cylinders containing the cartridges are so placed and labeled that the required charge, whether reduced or full, can be immediately selected.

In the shell store, the common shell are separated from the armour-piercing or [[shrapnel]]. Each nature of projectile is painted in a distinctive manner to render [[identification]] easy. The fuzes and tubes are placed in the general store with the tools and accessories belonging to the guns. The gun group is distinguished by some letter and the guns of the group by numerals; thus &lt;nowiki&gt;A/1&lt;/nowiki&gt; is number one gun of group A. The magazine and shell stores are also indicated by the group letter, and so that mistakes, even by those unaccustomed to the fort, may be avoided, the passages are pointed out by finger posts and direction boards. For the immediate service of each gun, a few cartridges and projectiles are stored in small receptacles (called cartridge and shell recesses respectively) built in the parapet as near the gun position as practicable. In some cases, a limited number of projectiles may be placed close underneath the parapet if this is conveniently situated near the [[breech]] of the gun and not exposed to [[hostile fire]].

In order to supply the ammunition sufficiently rapidly for the efficient service of modern guns, [[hydraulic]], [[electric]], or hand-power, [[hoist]]s are employed to raise the cartridges and shell from the cartridge store and shell store to the gun floor, whence they are transferred to a derrick or loading tray attached to the mounting for loading the gun.

Projectiles for [[British ordnance terms#BL|BL]] guns above 6 inch (152 mm) calibre are stored in shell stores ready filled and fuzed standing on their bases, except shrapnel and high-explosive shell, which are fuzed only when about to be used. Smaller sizes of shells are laid on their sides in layers, each layer pointing in the opposite direction to the one below to prevent [[injury]] to the driving bands. Cartridges are stored in [[brass]] corrugated cases or in [[zinc]] cylinders. The corrugated cases are stacked in layers in the magazine with the mouth of the case towards a passage between the stacks, so that it can be opened and the cartridges removed and transferred to a leather case when required for transport to the gun. Cylinders are stacked, when possible, vertically one above the other. The charges are sent to the gun in these cylinders, and provision is made for the rapid removal of the empty cylinders.

The number and nature of rounds allotted to any fortress depends on questions of [[policy]] and location, the degrees of resistance the nature of the works and personnel could reasonably be expected to give, and finally on the nature of the armament. That is to say, for guns of large calibre three hundred to four hundred rounds per gun might be sufficient, while for light QF guns it might amount to one thousand or more rounds per gun.

=== Modern Era ===
Modern ammunition includes not only shells for tube artillery and [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s, but increasingly aircraft-delivered [[bombs]], [[smart bombs]], [[rockets]] and other explosive-bearing projectiles.  The destructive power and lethality of these systems is difficult to appreciate.  A single [[cluster bomb]], deliverable by any of the above systems, can sow grenade-sized bomblets across a 100 yard (90m) [[football]]-sized field in sufficient density to kill any persons present, even in trenches and wearing body armor.

See [[ammo dump]] for discussion of modern ammunition storage facilities.

== Supply of ammunition in the field ==
With every successive improvement in military arms there has necessarily been a corresponding modification in the method of supplying ammunition and in the quantity required to be supplied. When hand-to-hand weapons were the principal implements of battle, there was no such need. But in the [[Middle Ages]], the [[archery|archers]] and crossbowmen had to replenish the shafts and bolts expended in action, and during a [[siege]], [[rock (geology)|stone]] bullets of great size, as well as heavy [[arrow]]s, were freely used. The [[missile]]s of those days were however interchangeable, and at the [[battle of Towton]] ([[1461]]), part of the [[War of the Roses]], the commander of the [[York]]ist archers induced the enemy to fire arrows in order to obtain them for firing back. This interchangeability of war material was even possible for many centuries after the invention of firearms. At the [[battle of Liegnitz]] ([[1760]]) a general officer was specially commissioned by [[Frederick the Great]] to pack up and send away, for [[Prussia]]n use, all the [[musket]]s and ammunition left on the field of battle by the defeated [[Austria]]ns.

Captured material is utilized whenever possible at the present time. In the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], the [[Japan]]ese went so far as to prepare beforehand spare parts for the [[China|Chinese]] guns they expected to capture. Though it is rare to find a modern army trusting to captures for arms and ammunition; almost the only instance of the practice is that of the [[Chilean Civil War]] ([[1891]]) in which the army of one belligerent was almost totally dependent upon this means of replenishing stores of arms and cartridges. But what was possible with weapons of comparatively
rough make is no longer to be thought of in the case of modern arms.

The [[Lee-Metford]] bullet of 0.303 inch (7.7 mm) diameter can scarcely be used in a rifle of smaller caliber, and in general the minute [[accuracy]] of parts in modern weapons makes interchangeability almost impossible. Further, owing to the rapidity with which, in modern arms, ammunition is expended, and the fact that, as battles are fought at longer ranges than formerly, more shots have to be fired in order to inflict heavy losses, it is necessary that the reserves of ammunition should be as close as possible to the troops who have to use them. This was always the case even with the older firearms, as, owing to the great weight of the ammunition, the [[soldier]] could only carry a few rounds. Nevertheless it is only within the past seventy years that there has grown up the elaborate system of ammunition supply which now prevails in all regularly organized armies. That which is described in the present article is the [[United Kingdom|British]], as laid down in the official [[Combined Training]] ([[1905]]) and other manuals. The new system designed for stronger divisions, and others, vary only in details and nomenclature.

==Ammunition for infantry==
Ammunition for infantry refers to the [[ammunition]] carried by a typical foot ([[infantry]]) [[soldier]]. Someone serving in the infantry generally carries, in pouches, [[bandolier]]s, etc., one hundred rounds of [[small arms|small-arms]] ammunition (S.A.A.), and it is usual to supplement this,
when an action is imminent, from the regimental reserve (see below).
Like any trade, the proper tools are necessary for the task at hand. Infantry need to be provided with the weapons and ammunition to deal with the expected threat, be it another foot soldier, a mounted warrior, armoured vehicle or aircraft.

===History===
Every reduction in the [[caliber]] (size) of the [[rifle|rifle's]] ammunition means an increase in the number of rounds carried. One hundred rounds of the [[Martini-Henry]] ammunition
weighed 10 pounds 10 ounces (4.8 kg); the same weight gives 155 rounds of 0.303 in (7.7 mm) ammunition and at 0.256 in (6.5 mm) the number of rounds is still greater. 
The regimental reserves were historically carried in six S.A.A. carts and on eight [[pack animal]]s. The six carts are distributed, one as reserve to the
machine gun, three as reserve to the battalion itself, and two as part of the brigade reserve, which consists therefore of eight carts. The brigade reserve communicates directly with the brigade ammunition columns of the [[artillery]] (see below). The eight pack animals follow the eight companies of their battalion. These, with two out of the three battalion carts, endeavour to keep close to the firing line, the remaining cart
being with the reserve companies. Men also are employed as carriers, and this duty is so onerous that picked men only are
detailed. Gallantry displayed in bringing up ammunition is considered indeed to justify special rewards. The amount of
S.A.A. in regimental charge is 100 rounds in the possession of each soldier, 2000 to 2200 on each pack animal, and 16,000
to 17,600 in each of four carts, with, in addition, about 4000 rounds with the machine gun and 16,000 more in the fifth cart.

===Current small arms ammunition===
Currently, every army of an internationally recognized country (except those who rely on others for defense, such as [[Andorra]], and those that do not have a true army, such as the [[Vatican City]]) has adopted [[assault rifle]]s as the main infantry weapon.

In western ([[NATO]]) forces, the [[7.62 NATO|7.62 mm NATO]] round has been mostly replaced by the lighter [[5.56 x 45 mm NATO|5.56 mm NATO]] round, which is better suited for automatic fire than the larger round and each soldier can carry more ammunition. The larger [[caliber]] ammunition is still retained where range and weight of shot is important eg [[machine gun]]s and [[sniper rifle]]s.

Other nations, especially forces with former ties to the [[Soviet Union]] tend to use rifles related to or devleoped from the [[AK-47]] with similar sized rounds to the NATO ones.

=== Anti-tank ===
The tank made horse mounted cavalry obsolete and while an infantryman could deal with a horse-borne enemy new weapons were needed to damage a tank or other vehicle or penetrate and wound the crew. The first anti-tank weapons given to infantry were based on small arms, for example the [[anti-tank rifle]]. As even the lighter designs of tank carried more armour the limit of a man-portable rifle that could fire a round with sufficient kinetic energy to penetrate the armour was reached. The introduction of the [[shaped charge]] warhead gave the infantry a weapon that used chemical energy rather than kinetic to beat the armour and in a focussed way which made them more effective than large grenades. When propelled by a rocket, the shaped charge gained range as well. Weapons such as the Bazooka or Panzerfaust were never small but they were suitable for infantry use - though they often had to be used at close range where they could be aimed accurately at the vehicles weak points. Post World War 2, the advent of the missile delivered both great range and accuracy and provided infantry with a weapon that could reliably destroy the heaviest tanks at long distances.

=== Anti-aircraft ===
Today's infantryman can deploy sophisticated multi-spectral man-portable surface-to-air missiles equipped with the ability to reject decoys and defeat counter-measures. In Somalia it was demonstrated that slow moving/stationary aircraft at low altitudes could be defeated with unguided anti-armour infantry weapons. It is also true that aircraft are relatively delicate machines, filled with highly flammable fuel, and since their first usage in World War I a plane can be brought down by single bullet striking something vital. The main weaknesses of ammunition provided to infantry to deal with aircraft are limited range and small warheads, both due to the necessity that such weapons remain portable by men on foot. The premier SAM for infantry is the FIM-92 Stinger MANPADS (Man Portable Air Defence System), provided as an all-up round in a canister it is attached to a launcher unit and is ready to expend. Numerous other missiles in this class exist from different nations of origin. Infantry machine guns and rifles may improve their ability against aircraft by utilising tracer ammunition, to allow the aimer to better gauge the lead aim necessary to strike his target. Weapons developed primarily for anti-tank roles can add proximity fusing to increase the probability of a kill by having the warhead detonate nearby the target with having to make contact.

==Large weapon ammunition==
See Main article, [[Shell (projectile)]], for information on the various types of shell and shot.

Modern artillery ammunition is generally of two types: separate loading and semi-fixed.  Semi-fixed ammunition (rounds) appear in the form of a [[projectile]] mated with a cartridge case which contains  the [[propellant]] and they resemble small arms rounds.

The canister is outfitted with a primer on its base which fires upon contact from the firing pin. [[Gunpowder]], precision machined to burn evenly, is contained inside of cloth bags that are numbered. US/NATO 105mm howitzers use semi-fixed ammunition, containing seven powder bags referred to as increments or charges. Putting the powder in bags allows the howitzer crew to remove the increments when firing at closer targets. The unused increments are disposed of by burning in a powder pit at a safe distance from the guns.

Above a certain size, semi-fixed rounds are impracticable; the weight of the whole assembly is either too much to be carried effectively. In this case separate loading ammunition is used: the projectile and propelling charge are supplied and loaded separately. The projectile is rammed home in the chamber, the powder charge(s) are loaded (usually by hand), then the breech is closed and the primer is inserted into the primer holder on the back the breech.  Separate loading ammunition is typically used on 155mm and larger howitzers. Several propellant types are available for 155mm howitzer.

All normal projectiles arrive at the weapon with a plug in the [[Fuse (explosives)|fuze]] well on the nose of the projectile. Using a special fuze wrench, the plug is unscrewed and a fuze is screwed in. The decision as to which type of fuze to use is made by the fire direction center and carried out by the gun crew.

The armaments fitted to early tanks were contemporary field or naval artillery pieces and used the same ammunition. When tank versus tank combat became more important, the trend became that anti-aircraft artillery pieces (designed to fire high velocity shells to altitude) were often adapted to tank use where a gun specifically made for the vehicle was not available. equally as the armour applied to tanks increased, ammunition for tank use paralleled that of anti-tank guns. 
Current tank gun ammunition is a single fixed round (&quot;shell&quot; and charge combined in a single piece) for quick load, the charge is in a combustible case - so there is no empty cartridge to be removed and stored in the turret and the &quot;shell&quot; is a saboted shot, a shaped charge or sensor fuzed warhead.

== Naval ammunition ==
The ranges at which engagements are conducted by warships are typically much greater than that at which land warfare is observed. The targets are also generally machines, not men. Naval ammunition is therefore optimized for great velocity (to reach those great ranges, to hit aircraft flying at altitude and also with the benefit of reducing the lead that has to be applied to hit a distant moving target) and to disable said machines, rather than rending human flesh. Naval gun ammunition of WWII vintage came in two main varieties, armour piercing shells to attack hardened warships or [[high explosive incendiary]] shells (with point detonating fuzes to start fires on ships, or mechanical time fuzes designed to fragment and create clouds of shrapnel to defeat aircraft). With the demise of the armoured warship, contemporary naval gun ammunition is solely the high explosive variety, but new fuzing and guidance options are available to increase lethality, especially against high speed missile or aircraft threats.

== Fuzes==
Common artillery fuzes include point detonating, delay, time, and [[Proximity fuze | proximity (variable time)]]. Point detonating fuzes detonate upon contact with the ground. Delay fuzes are designed to penetrate a short distance before detonating. Time fuzes, as the name implies, detonate a certain time after being fired in order to achieve an air burst above the target. Time fuzes are set to the tenth of a second. [[Proximity fuze | Proximity or variable time fuzes]] contain a simple radio [[transceiver]] activated a set time after firing to detonate the projectile when the signal reflected from the ground reaches a certain strength, designed to be 7 meters above the ground. Fuzes are armed by the rotation of the projectile imparted by the rifling in the tube, and usually arm after a few hundred rotations.

__NOTOC__
In the [[U.S. Air Force]], '''AMMO''' is the common [[nickname]] for the Munitions Systems Specialist career field, (AFSC 2W0X1, previously 461X0.) 

AMMO is responsible for maintaining the Air Force's entire munitions [[stockpile]]. Various duties include shipping and receiving, building, testing, operating, protecting, inspecting, storing and performing maintenance on all types of munition systems, both conventional and [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]]. AMMO troops can also expect to learn to operate and maintain a wide variety of equipment and electronic gear, from 40 foot tractor-trailer combination vehicles and all terrain 10,000 pound forklifts, to small arms weapons, to [[AGM-65]] guidance testing units and computer databases. AMMO troops often work daily with many versions of [[F-4]], [[F-15]], [[F-16]], [[F-22]], [[F-117]], [[B-1 Lancer|B-1]], [[B-2 Spirit|B-2]], [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]], [[A-10]], and [[AC-130]] aircraft, along with rarer opportunities to support aircraft from sister services, such as the [[A-6]], [[F-14]], [[F-18]] and [[AV-8]], and even aircraft from other nations. 

Once a new recruit graduates from Air Force Basic Military Training at [[Lackland Air Force Base]], [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[Texas]], he or she is initiated into the world of AMMO during a 9 week school at [[Sheppard Air Force Base]], also in Texas. Upon graduation from tech school, the new AMMO troop either ships to his or her first assignment, or, if their first assignment is overseas, they can opt to take around two weeks of leave before shipping overseas.

Being AMMO is like being in a world separated from the rest of the Air Force. Due to security and obvious safety concerns with the possibility of millions of pounds of explosives accidentally [[cooking off]] and damaging a large portion of a base's facilities, the bomb dump is usually well isolated from the rest of base. At some bases, such as Andersen AFB in [[Guam]], the ride to work can take as long as twenty minutes, compared to a 4 or 5 minute commute for people in most other career fields.

Such isolation, as well as the fact that many people don't realize the extreme danger an AMMO troop faces at work every day while working with tons of [[explosives]], has allowed AMMO to attain its dubious reputation of being the Air Force's hardest drinking, wildest, and most mischievous bunch. Working out of sight often means being out of mind, and this has lead to things often getting done &quot;the AMMO way&quot;, versus &quot;the Air Force way&quot;. The isolation and dangerous work environment have created a tight bond amongst AMMO troops, and led to the infamous &quot;If You Ain't Ammo, You Ain't Shit!&quot; ([[IYAAYAS]]) attitude. The &quot;black sheep&quot; label given AMMO is worn with pride.

While AMMO troops can expect to perform a wide range of daily duties, they can also look forward to being stationed at an equally broad range of bases.  

The wide range of daily duties stems from the fact of AMMO having nine separate and distinct working areas within the career field.  

These are:

Equipment Maintenance - &quot;Trailer Shop&quot; - the hub of all maintenance on the job-specific trailer equipment that is unique to AMMO, such as the MHU-141 and the MHU-110. 

PGM - Precision Guided Munitions, or &quot;Missile Shop&quot; - fairly self-explanatory; maintenance of missiles and guided bomb packages. 

Flightline Delivery - &quot;Line-D&quot;, or &quot;Line Swine&quot; when referencing personnel (ex. &quot;That jet needs AMMO - call the line swine.&quot;)  Line-D drivers are dispatched by Munitions Control (see below) and are responsible for the safe and expedient handling and delivery of munitions to aircraft.  Drivers are also held responsible for the accounting of their movements and their transactions via radio and paper logs.

Conventional Maintenance - Simply called &quot;Conventional&quot;, this office works the unguided side of AMMO, dealing with everything that their base's aircraft can carry, from chaff and flares to cannon ammunition and regular unguided &quot;dumb bombs&quot;.

Munitions Control - The nerve center.  Nothing happens without the controllers knowing since they are the office that dispatches workorders to all other areas.  Supervision relies heavily on good controllers to give them quick, efficient reports of what's happening.  Controllers tend to be more senior AMMO troops and have diverse backgrounds in AMMO.

Storage and Handling - Works closely with Inspection and Conventional to deliver large quantities of raw materials for both inspections and bomb build excercises.  Storage troops will often be found driving 18-wheel tractor trailers and forklifts, ranging in capacity from 2 to 25 tons, transporting various munitions items for the respective clientele.

Inspection - All munitions items at various times need to be inspected for safety and compliance with technical instructions.  Specialized NCOs called Munitions Inspectors accomplish this.  Inspectors attend an Inspector school, which lasts approximately 3 weeks and most times is conducted at the AMMO Schoolhouse, located at Sheppard AFB, Texas.

CAS/AFK - Sometimes labeled as separate areas, CAS stands for Combat Ammunition System.  CAS troops perform inventories, keep storage plans, and update movements of munitions within the storage area.  In layman's terms, they are accountants for explosives.  Sometimes derisively referred to as &quot;CAS-holes&quot;.

There are positions for AMMO troops at more bases worldwide than airman in most other career fields in the Air Force.

'''Amnesty''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''amnestia'', oblivion) is an act of justice by which the supreme power in a state restores those who may have been guilty of any offence against it to the position of innocent persons.  It includes more than [[pardon]], in as much as it obliterates all legal remembrance of the offence.

Amnesties, which, in the [[United Kingdom]], may be granted by the crown alone, or by act of [[British Parliament|Parliament]], were formerly usual on coronations and similar occasions, but are chiefly exercised towards associations of political criminals, and are sometimes granted absolutely, though more frequently there are certain specified exceptions.  Thus, in the case of the earliest recorded amnesty, that of [[Thrasybulus]] at [[Athens]], the thirty tyrants and a few others were expressly excluded from its operation; and the amnesty proclaimed on the restoration of [[Charles II of England]] did not extend to those who had taken part in the execution of his father.  Other celebrated amnesties are that proclaimed by [[Napoleon]] on [[March 13]], [[1815]], from which thirteen eminent persons, including [[Talleyrand]], were excepted; the [[Prussia|Prussian]] amnesty of [[August 10]], [[1840]]; the general amnesty proclaimed by the emperor [[Franz Josef I of Austria]] in [[1857]]; the general amnesty granted by [[President of the United States]] [[Andrew Johnson]] after the [[American Civil War]] in [[1868]]; and the French amnesty of [[1905]].  The last act of amnesty passed in [[Great Britain]] was that of [[1747]], which proclaimed a pardon to those who had taken part in the '45 [[Jacobite Rising]].

==Related uses of the term==

* '''Amnesty''' is sometimes now the term used to denote cases of pardon by a country where offenses are not stricken from the record and individuals proclaimed innocent. Instead, those individuals receive some lesser sentence in response to an admission of guilt.

* The term '''amnesty''' is also used to describe any initiative where individuals are encouraged to turn over illicit items to the authorities, on the understanding that they will not be prosecuted for having been in possession of those items. A common use of such amnesties, is to reduce the number of firearms or other weapons in circulation.

* '''Amnesty''', when used in the context of [[immigration]], is a law or regulation which allows [[illegal immigrant]]s to obtain legal residency.  Amnesties can be created by a number of mechanisms, whether by executive order, or statute passed by the legislature.  The amnesty need not be called &quot;amnesty&quot; to have the effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Amicable numbers''' are two [[number]]s so related that the [[addition|sum]] of the proper [[divisor]]s of the one is equal to the other, [[1 (number)|unity]] being considered as a proper divisor but not the number itself. Such a pair is ([[Two hundred twenty|220]], [[Two hundred eighty-four|284]]); for the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110, of which the sum is 284; and the proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142, of which the sum is 220. Amicable numbers were known to the [[Pythagoreans]], who accredited them with many mystical properties.

A pair of amicable numbers constitutes an [[aliquot sequence]] of [[Periodic function#Periodic sequences|period]] [[2 (number)|2]].

A general formula by which these numbers could be derived was invented circa [[850]] by [[Thabit ibn Qurra]] ([[826]]-[[901]]): if 
:''p'' = 3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, 
:''q'' = 3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;1,
:''r'' = 9&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;2''n''-1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, 
where ''n'' &gt; 1 is an [[integer]] and ''p'', ''q'', and ''r'' are [[prime number]]s, then 2''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;pq'' and 2''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;r'' are a pair of amicable numbers. This formula gives the amicable pair (220, 284), as well as the pair (17,296, 18,416) and the pair (9,363,584, 9,437,056). The pair (6232, 6368) are amicable, but they cannot be derived from this formula. In fact, this formula produces amicable numbers for ''n'' = 2, 4, and 7, but for no other values below 20,000.

In every known case, the numbers of a pair are either both [[even]] or both [[odd]], though there is no known reason why an even-odd pair could not exist. Also, every known pair shares at least one common [[factor]]. It is not known whether a pair of [[coprime]] amicable numbers exist, though if they do, their [[Product (mathematics)|product]] must be greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;67&lt;/sup&gt;. Also, a pair of coprime amicable numbers cannot be generated by Thabit's formula (above), nor by any similar formula. 

Amicable numbers have been studied by [[Al Madshritti]] (died [[1007]]), Abu Mansur Tahir [[al-Baghdadi]] ([[980]]-[[1037]]), [[René Descartes]] ([[1596]]-[[1650]]), to whom the formula of Thabit is sometimes ascribed, C. Rudolphus and others. Thabit's formula was generalized by [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]]. 

If a number equals the sum of ''its own'' proper divisors, it is called a [[perfect number]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For the [[Bollywood]] movie called Aryan, see [[Aryan (movie)]].''

'''Aryan''' is an [[English language|English]] word derived from the [[Indian languages|Indian]] [[Vedic Sanskrit]] and [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] [[Avestan]] terms ''ari-'', ''arya-'', ''ārya-'', and/or the extended form ''aryāna-''. The [[Sanskrit]] and [[Old Persian]] languages both pronounced the word as ''arya-''. Beyond its use as the ethnic self-designation of the [[Proto-Indo-Iranian]]s, the meaning ''&quot;noble&quot;'' has been attached to it in  [[Sanskrit]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].

== Etymology ==
Indo-Iranian ''arya-'' descends from [[PIE]] {{PIE|*ar-yo-}}, a ''yo-''adjective to a root {{PIE|*ar}} &quot;to assemble skillfully&quot;, present in Greek ''harma'' &quot;chariot&quot;, Latin ''ars'' &quot;art&quot; etc.

In later times &quot;Arya&quot; referred to Indo-Iranian holy Kings and holy warriors [[raja]], [[kshatriya]] or [[Shah]] and thus &quot;nobles&quot; or of the &quot;nobility&quot; the protectors of [[Dharma]]. 

In the Rig Veda: 1:51

8 Discern thou well Aryas and [[Dasyu]]s;

9 Indra gives up the lawless to the devout man, destroying by the Strong Ones those who have no strength.

Here it tells us to discern the true Aryan, the Aryan is a devout man who follows the Aryan holy laws and so is victorious. The Dasyu is akin to the &quot;unbeliever&quot; and undevout.

The important Sanskrit lexicon [[Amarakosha]] (c. 450) defines ''[[Arya]]'' as:  &quot;An Arya is one who hails from a noble family, of gentle behavior and demeanor, good-natured and of righteous conduct. (''महाकुल कुलीनार्य सभ्य सज्जन साधवः'')&quot; However it does earlier seem to have been used to identify certain populations in distinction from others, in particular those clans who accepted proto-[[Vedic religion|Vedic]] and proto-[[Zoroastrian]] beliefs.

==Origins==
By the first half of the [[2nd millennium BC]], [[Indo-Aryans]] are believed to have arrived on the Iranian plateau and the Indian subcontinent (see [[Indo-Aryan migration]]). Indeed, the term Iran – in full ''Iran Shahr'' – is the modern outcome of an ancient ''Aryānām Xšaθra-'' meaning &quot;realm of the Aryans.&quot; Similarly, Northern India was referred to as [[Aryavarta]] in ancient times. The Aryan, or [[Indo-Iranian]] group of languages is divided into three branches: Indo-Aryan, Nuristani, and Iranian. In [[Middle Persian]], we find the term &quot;Aryāna-&quot; as &quot;Ērān&quot; and in [[Modern Persian]] as &quot;Īrān.&quot;  
However, there is much speculation as to origins of the Aryans as the land they supposedly entered first [[Indus Valley Civilization]] and their scripts remain undeciphered.

===Aryans: Religious Initiates===
The Hindu usage of the term &quot;Aryan&quot; has its roots in a tribe of people who received initiation of the [[Navjote]] in [[Zoroastrianism]] or [[Vedic]] [[upanayanam]]. In Vedic Hinduism the [[Brahmin]], [[Kshatriya]], [[Vaishya]]s who recieved this initiation were also called 'Aryan.' This allowed them to attain ''spiritual perfection'' and self mastery. When an Aryan was called &quot;pure&quot;, it meant spiritual purity.

In the Vedic religion, those who no longer received this initiation from Brahmin priests were considered &quot;fallen&quot; and were no longer considered &quot;Aryan&quot;. This led to various movements like [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] whose converts were also called 'Aryan' due to their purification rites through practice of meditation, self control and acts of virtue.

Collectively modern [[Hinduism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] are sometimes termed ''Aryan religions'', as conversion and initiation into them allows one to become Aryan or Noble.

===Uncertain Linguistic Derivations===

The adjective ''*aryo-'' was suggested as ascending to Proto-Indo-European as the self-designation of the speakers of Proto-Indo-European itself, and ''[[Éire]]'', the Irish name of [[Ireland]], was considered a cognate. It was also suggested that the Greek word &quot;aristos&quot;, as in &quot;[[aristocracy]]&quot; and other words such as &quot;[[heir]]&quot; and &quot;ehre&quot; (German for &quot;honour&quot;) were related to it, but these are now widely regarded as untenable, and while ''{{PIE|*ar-yo-}}'' is certainly a well-formed PIE adjective, there is no evidence that it was used as an ethnic self-designation outside the Indo-Iranian branch. In the 1850s [[Max Müller]] theorized that the word originated as a denotation of farming populations, since he thought it likely that it was related to the root {{PIE|*arh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, meaning &quot;to plough&quot;. Other 19th century writers, such as Charles Morris, repeated this idea, linking the expansion of PIE speakers to the spread of agriculturalists. Most linguists now consider {{PIE|*arh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} to be unrelated.

==Indo-Iranian==
''Main article: [[Indo-Iranians]].''

The most probable date for Proto-Indo-Iranian unity is roughly around [[2500 BC]]. In this sense of the word ''Aryan'', the Aryans were an ancient culture preceding both the Vedic and Iranian cultures.  Candidates for an archaeological identification of this culture are the [[Andronovo]] and/or [[Srubnaya]] Archaeological Complexes.    

===Indo-Aryan===
''See also [[Arya]], [[Indo-Aryans]], [[Indo-Aryan languages]], [[Indo-Aryan migration]], [[Aryan invasion theory]].''

There is evidence of speakers of Indo-Aryan in [[Mesopotamia]] around [[1500s BC|1500 BC]] in the form of loanwords in the [[Mitanni]] dialect of Hurrian, the speakers of which, it is speculated, may have once had an Indo-Aryan ruling class. The Indo-Aryans inhabiting northern India, the bearers of the [[Vedic civilization]] are sometimes called [[Vedic Aryans]]. 

Contemporary speakers of Indo-Aryan languages are spread over most of the northern [[Indian Subcontinent]]. The only Indo-Aryan branch surviving outside the Indian Subcontinent and the [[Himalayas]] is the [[Romani]] language, the language of the [[Roma people]].

===Iranian===
''See also [[Iranian peoples]], [[Iranian languages]], [[Achaemenid dynasty]]

Since ancient times, [[Persian people|Persians]] (Iranians) used the term ''Aryan'' to describe their lineage and their [[language]], and this [[tradition]] has continued into the present day amongst [[Modern world|modern]] [[Iran]]ians. In fact, the name Iran is a cognate of Aryan and means ''&quot;Land of the Aryans.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bartleby.com/61/99/A0449900.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nvtc.gov/lotw/months/february/indoIranianBranch.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://imp.lss.wisc.edu/~aoliai/languagepage/iranianlanguages.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Darius the Great]], King of [[Persian Empire|Persia]] ([[521 BC|521]]–[[486 BC]]), in an inscription in [[Naksh-i Rustam]] (near [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]] in present-day [[Iran]]), proclaims: ''&quot;I am [[Darius]] the great King… A [[Persia]]n, son of a Persian, an Aryan, having Aryan lineage...&quot;''. He also calls his language the &quot;Aryan language,&quot; commonly known today as [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]].

The word has become a [[term of art|technical term]] in the [[theology|theologies]] of [[Zoroastrianism]], but has always been used by [[Iran]]ians in the ethnic sense as well.  In 1967, Iran's [[Pahlavi]] [[dynasty]] added the title [[Āryāmehr]] ''&quot;Light of the Aryans&quot;'' to those of the [[monarch]], known at the time as the [[Shah|Shahanshah]] (''King of Kings'').

The term remains also a frequent element in modern Persian personal names, including ''Arya'' (a boy's name), ''Aryana'' (a common surname), ''Iran-dokht'' (Aryan daughter), ''Aryanpur'' (or ''Aryanpour''), ''Aryaramne'', among many others.

==Linguistic Terminology==

During the [[19th century]], following [[Max Müller]]'s '[[Aryan invasion theory]]', the term gained an added meaning, being used in the West to refer to what are now called the '[[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]', and, by extension, to the [[Indo-European studies|Indo-European speaking peoples]] as a whole. In linguistics, the term ''Aryan'' currently refers only to the [[Indo-Iranian]] language sub-family.

The [[Proto-Indo-Iranian]] language evolved into the family of [[Indo-Iranian languages]], of which the oldest-known members are [[Avestan]], [[Vedic language|Vedic]], and another Indo-AryanNew Haven, 1934)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Two [[law|legal]] concepts go by the name '''''barratry:''''' one in [[criminal law|criminal]] and [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]], the other in [[admiralty law]].

* In criminal and civil law, '''barratry''' is the act or practice of bringing repeated legal actions solely to harass.  Usually, the actions brought lack merit.  This action has been declared a crime in some jurisdictions. ''See also:'' [[champerty]], [[SLAPP]], [[vexatious litigation]],  [[abuse of process]], [[malicious prosecution]], [[forum shopping]].

* In [[admiralty law]], '''barratry''' is a fraudulent act committed by a master or crew of a vessel which damages the vessel or its cargo, including desertion, illegal [[scuttling]], and theft of the ship or [[cargo]].

A third meaning also exists: the buying and selling of positions within civil authority. This contrasts with  '''[[simony]]''', which is the buying and selling of positions within the church.

A '''bomber''' is a [[military aircraft]] designed to attack ground targets, primarily by dropping [[bomb]]s.

*[[Strategic bomber]]s are primarily designed for long-range strike missions against strategic targets such as supply bases, bridges, factories, and shipyards in order to damage an enemy's war effort.  Examples: [[B-17 Flying Fortress]], [[Avro]] [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]], [[B-52 Stratofortress]], [[Tupolev Tu-16]], [[Tupolev Tu-160]], [[Gotha G]].

*Tactical bombers are smaller aircraft that operate at shorter range, typically along with troops on the ground. This role is filled by many designs, including those listed below. In modern terms, anything combat aircraft is not a purpose-designed strategic bomber falls into this category.

*Ground-attack (or [[close air support]]) aircraft are designed to loiter over a battlefield and attack tactical targets, such as [[tank]]s, troop concentrations, etc.  Examples: [[Junkers Ju 87 Stuka|Stuka]], [[Ilyushin Il-2|Il-2 Shturmovik]], [[A-10 Warthog]], [[Sukhoi Su-25]].

*[[Fighter-bomber]]s(also called tactical fighters, strike fighters, and attack fighters) are multi-role combat aircraft which can (at least theoretically) be equipped for either air-to-air combat or air-to-ground combat. Many fighter bombers were also designed to engage in [[aerial combat]] immediately after attacking ground targets. Modern multi-role combat aircraft are designed to fulfull multiple roles due to budget restrictions as often as they are for versatility. Examples: [[Hawker Typhoon]], [[Sukhoi Su-7]], [[Republic F-105]], [[F/A-18 Hornet]], and the [[Panavia Tornado]].


[[image:b2.spirit.2.750pix.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[United States Air Force]] [[B-2 Spirit]] bomber]]

In the past, bombers were an obvious separate type, and often looked dramatically different from other types as well. This was due largely to the lack of power in [[aircraft engine]]s, meaning that in order to carry any reasonable warload, the designs had to carry multiple engines. The result was a much larger aircraft, one with a reasonable [[useful load fraction]] for the role. Engine power was so scarce that designs had to be tailored to one particular niche; during [[World War II]] there were [[dive bomber]]s, [[light bomber|light]], [[medium bomber|medium]] and [[heavy bomber|heavy]] bombers, and specialized ground attack designs.

Traditionally, bombers have carried only defensive armament, and are not designed to engage in combat with other aircraft.  They are relatively large and unmaneuverable (although some have been as fast or faster than contemporary fighters). Attack aircraft are smaller, faster, and more agile, but less so than a [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] when armed for a ground attack mission. They may carry air-to-air armament, but typically only for self-defense.

In modern air forces, the distinction between bombers, fighter-bombers, and attack aircraft has become blurry. Many attack aircraft, even ones that ''look'' like fighters, are optimized to drop bombs, with very little ability to engage in aerial combat. Indeed, the design qualities that make an effective low-level attack aircraft make for a distinctly inferior air superiority fighter, and vice versa. Conversely, many fighter aircraft, such as the [[F-16]], are often used as 'bomb trucks,' despite being designed for aerial combat. Perhaps the one meaningful distinction at present is the question of range: a bomber is generally a long-range aircraft capable of striking targets deep within enemy territory, whereas fighter bombers and attack aircraft are limited to 'theater' missions in and around the immediate area of battlefield combat. Even that distinction is muddied by the availability of [[aerial refueling]], which greatly increases the potential radius of combat operations.

The development of large strategic bombers stagnated in the later part of the [[Cold War]] both because of spiraling costs and the advent of the [[intercontinental ballistic missile]], which was felt to have equal [[deterrence|deterrent]] value while being much more difficult to intercept. The [[United States Air Force]] [[XB-70 Valkyrie]] program was cancelled for that reason in the early [[1960s]], and the later [[B-1 Lancer]] and [[B-2 Spirit]] aircraft entered service only after protracted political and development problems. Their high cost meant that few were built and the 1950s-designed B-52s continued in use into the 21st century. Similarly, the [[Soviet Union]] fielded the intermediate-range [[Tupolev Tu-22M]] in the [[1970s]], but the [[Mach number|Mach 3]] bomber project came to naught. The Mach 2 [[Tupolev Tu-160]] was built only in tiny numbers, leaving the earlier [[Tupolev Tu-16]] and [[Tupolev Tu-95]] heavy bombers of [[1950s]] vintage to soldier on into the 21st century. Meanwhile, the [[United Kingdom|British]] strategic bombing force largely came to an end with the phase-out of the [[V Bomber]] force (the last of which left service in [[1983 in aviation|1983]]. The only other nation that fields a strategic bombing force at present is the [[People's Republic of China]], which has a number of Chinese-built [[Tupolev Tu-16]]s.  

Plans in the US and Russia for successors to the current strategic bomber force remain only paper projects, and present political and funding pressures suggest that they are likely to for the foreseeable future. In the US, current plans call for the existing USAF bomber fleet to remain in service until the mid-to-late 2020s, with no replacement in sight.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about the various cue sports. In the United States, Billiards often denotes the gamut of cue games. Sometimes, however, &quot;billiards&quot; standing alone will refer to carom games played on a pocketless table, while games played on tables with pockets are referred to as pocket billiards or &quot;pool&quot;. By contrast, in some countries, &quot;billiards&quot; refers unambiguously to a specific game. For instance, in the United Kingdom, &quot;billiards&quot; denotes [[English billiards]] exclusively. Likewise, in the [[Netherlands]], billiards refers solely to [[Carambole billiards]].''
[[Image:Studenten Billard.JPG|right|thumb|300px|]] 
'''Billiards''' is a family of games played on a table, with a stick, known as a [[cue stick]], which is used to strike balls, moving them around the table. 

All billiard games are generally regarded to have evolved into indoor games from outdoor stick and ball games.{{ref|Stein}}  The word &quot;billiard&quot; may have evolved from the French word ''billart'', meaning &quot;mace&quot;, an implement, similar to a golf club, which was the forerunner to the modern cue.

The word &quot;pool&quot; generally refers to pocket billiard games such as [[Eight ball|8-ball]], [[Nine ball|9-ball]], [[Straight pool|straight pool]] and [[One pocket|one-pocket]].  The word &quot;pool&quot; comes from &quot;poolrooms,&quot; where people gambled off track on [[horse-racing|horse races]].  They were called poolrooms as money was &quot;pooled&quot; to determine the odds.  Because such rooms commonly provided billiard tables, pool became synonymous with billiards by association.  The terms &quot;pool&quot; and &quot;pocket billiards&quot; are now interchangeable.

==Equipment==
===Billiard balls===
[[Image:Billiards balls.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''pool balls'']]
The number, type, diameter, color, and pattern of [[Billiard ball]]s differ depending upon the specific billiards game being played.  In [[eight ball]], [[straight pool]], and related games, 16 balls are employed: fifteen colored &quot;[[Glossary of pool and billiards terms#Object ball(s)|object ball]]s&quot; and one white &quot;[[Glossary of pool and billiards terms#cue ball|cue ball]]&quot;.  Object balls 1-7 are solid-colored, and are respectively colored yellow, blue, red, purple, orange, green, and dark red or brown. Balls 9-15 are white, each with a single wide colored stripe that matches the corresponding solid ball; the 9-ball has a yellow stripe, the 10-ball a blue stripe, and so on.  The 8-ball is solid black. In the game of [[9-ball]], only object balls 1-9 are used. Regulation balls are 2{{fraction|1|4}} inches (57.15 mm) in diameter and weigh between 5{{fraction|1|2}} and 6 ounces (156 to 170 g). British pool also uses 16 balls, but they are not numbered, with the &quot;suits&quot; being divided into reds and yellows instead of stripes and solids (and shots are not &quot;called&quot; since there is no way to identify particular balls to be pocketed); the balls and the pockets on the table are usually slightly smaller (though larger than those of snooker (see below).

Other specific properties such as hardness, [[friction coefficient]] and resilience are very important. Such requirement are met today with balls cast from [[phenolic resin]].  Historically, balls were often made of clay and even elephant ivory for a period (see below for more detail). Coin-operated pool tables historically have often used either a larger (&quot;grapefruit&quot;) or denser (&quot;rock&quot;, typically ceramic) cue ball, such that its extra weight makes it easy to separate it from object balls (which are captured until the game ends and the table is paid again for another game) so that the cue ball can be returned for further play, should it be accidentally pocketed.  Modern tables usually employ a magnetic ball of regulation or near-regulation size and weight, since players have rightly complained for many decades that the heavy and often over-sized cue balls do not &quot;play&quot; correctly.

Some balls used in televised pool games are colored differently to make them distinguishable on television monitors. The 4 ball used in such games is colored pink instead of purple, while the 7 ball is colored sienna (or a lighter shade of brown) rather than brown. The stripes on the 12 and 15 balls are colored the same way. Likewise, cue balls used for televised matches may depart from the norm by having spots or stripes on their surface so that spin placed on them is evident to viewers.

In [[snooker]], there are fifteen red balls, six colored balls (yellow, green, brown, blue, pink, and black), and one white cue ball. The red balls are typically not numbered, though the six colored balls often are, and can easily be mistaken at first glace for pool balls (the design is similar, but the number does not match pool's scheme).  Snooker balls are normally 2{{fraction|1|16}} inches (52.4 mm) in diameter.

In the carom games such as straight billiards (&quot;straight rail&quot;), [[Carambole billiards|three-cushion billiards]] and balkline, as well as English billiards, there are two cue balls and a red ball. One of the cue balls is typically white and the other one is either yellow or white with a red dot. These balls are normally 2{{fraction|3|4}} inches (69.9 mm) in diameter.

Billiard balls were originally made from [[ivory]], imported from Africa. In the mid-19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, in an amazing bit of accidental [[environmentalism]], the billiard industry realized that the supply of elephants (their primary source of ivory) was limited.  They challenged inventors to come up with an alternative material that could be manufactured.  [[John Wesley Hyatt]] answered the call by inventing [[cellulose]] nitrate in 1870, branded under the name celluloid, the earliest industrial plastic. Subsequently, to fix the problem of cellulose nitrate instability, the industry experimented with various other synthetic materials for billiards balls such as [[bakelite]] and other plastic compounds. Eventually [[phenolic resin]] became the industry standard and is virtually the only billiard ball material used today.

===Tables===
There are many sizes and styles of pool and [[billiards table|billiard table]]s. Generally, tables are perfect [[rectangles]] &amp;mdash; twice as long as they are wide. Most pool tables are known as 7-, 8-, or 9-footers, referring to the length of the table's long side. Snooker and English billiard tables are 12 feet long on the longest side. Pool halls tend to have 9-foot tables and cater to the serious pool player. Bars will typically use 7-foot tables which are often coin-operated. Formerly, 10-foot tables were common, but such tables are now considered antique collectors items; a few, usually from the late 1800s, can be found in up-scale pool halls from time to time.

The length of the pool table will typically be a function of space, with many homeowners purchasing an 8-foot table as a compromise. High quality tables are mostly 9-footers, with a bed made of three pieces of thick slate to prevent warping and changes due to humidity. Smaller bar tables are most commonly made with a single piece of slate. Pocket billiards tables normally have six pockets, three on each side (four corner pockets, and two side pockets).  

All types of tables are covered with billiard cloth (often called &quot;felt&quot;, but actually a woven wool or wool/nylon blend called [[Baize|baize]]). Bar or tavern tables, which get a lot of play, use &quot;slower&quot;, more durable cloth. Good quality pool cloth is &quot;faster&quot; (i.e. provides less friction, allowing the balls to roll farther), and the best quality pool cloth is made from [[worsted|worsted wool]]. Snooker table cloth traditionally has a nap (consistent fiber directionality) and balls behave differently when rolling against the direction of the nap.  The cloth of the billiard table is typically green reflecting its origin{{ref|Shamos}} (and thus the name of the pool movie ''[[The Color of Money]]'', referring to the color of American currency notes).

===Cues===
(''See also [[Cue stick]]'')

Billiards games are played with a stick known as a cue.  A cue is usually either a one piece tapered stick or a two piece stick divided in the middle by a joint of metal or phenolic resin. High quality cues are generally two pieces and are made of a hardwood, generally maple for billiards and ash for snooker.   

The &quot;butt&quot; end of the cue is of larger circumference and is intended to be gripped by a player's hand.  The &quot;shaft&quot; of the cue is of smaller circumference, usually tapering to an 11-14 millimeter terminus called a ferrule, where a leather tip is affixed to make final contact with balls. The leather tip, in conjunction with chalk, can be used to impart spin to the cue ball when not being hit in its center.  

Cheap cues are generally one piece cues made of ramin or other low quality wood with inferior tips of various materials (usually plastic). A quality cue can be expensive and may be made of exotic woods and other expensive materials which are artfully inlaid in decorative patterns.  Skilled players may use more than one cue during a game, including a separate cue for the opening break shot and another, shorter cue with a special tip for jump shots.

===The mechanical bridge===

The mechanical bridge, sometimes called a &quot;rake&quot; or simply &quot;bridge&quot; and known as a &quot;rest&quot; in the UK, is used to extend a player's reach on a shot where the cue ball is too far away for normal hand bridging. It consists of a stick with a grooved metal or plastic head which the cue slides on. Many amateurs refuse to use the mechanical bridge based on the perception that to do so is unmanly. However, many aficionados and professionals employ the bridge whenever the intended shot so requires. [[Image:Billiard chalk 20050724 001.jpg|thumb|130px|Billiard chalk]]

===Chalk===

Chalk is applied to the tip of the cue stick, ideally between every shot, to increase the tip's friction coefficient so that when it impacts the cue ball on a non-center hit, no miscue (unintentional slippage between the cue tip and the struck ball) occurs. The quality of chalk varies greatly from brand to brand, which can significantly affect play. High humidity can also impair the effectiveness of chalk.  Cuetip chalk is often not actually the substance typically referred to as &quot;[[chalk]]&quot;, but some proprietary compound, frequently with a [[silicate]] base. &quot;Chalk&quot; may also refer to hand chalk, used to lubricate the cue and bridge hand during shooting (many players prefer talcum powder or a slick pool glove because of the long-term abrasive effect of actual carbonate chalk on the shaft of the cue).

==Position play==

In both carom and pocket billiards, an immensely important part of the game on each shot is the exercise of control over the final resting position of the cue ball. 

In carom games an advanced player's aim on most shots is to leave the cue ball and the object balls in position such that the next shot is of a less difficult variety to make the requisite carom, and so that the next shot is in position to be manipulated in turn for yet another shot; ''ad infinitum''. 

Similarly, in many pocket billiard games, an advanced player's aim is often to manipulate the cue ball so that it is in position to pocket a chosen next ball and so that that next shot can also be manipulated for the next shot; ''ad infinitum''. Whereas in the carom games, manipulation of the object balls position is crucial as well, in pool this is normally not as large a factor, as, on a successful shot, the ball has left the table's playing surface. Many shots in the game of one-pocket, however, have this same added object ball control factor. 

If a player is not attempting to score or pocket, depending on the game, then the goal is usually to exercise control over the cue ball to leave some type of [[Glossary of pool and billiards terms#safety|safety]] to make it more difficult for the opponent to score or pocket. 

In order to control the cue ball on a shot, a player must master a wide variety of techniques, and have a well-founded conceptual grasp of the mechanics involved.

As stated by [[George Fels]], 'pool's poet laureate': &quot;The mere pocketing of a ball isn't that hard; in fact, it's relatively simple. What drives many, many players to distraction is the unpredictability of the cueball's path of travel...the game of billiards requires you to drive a ball someplace; pool, in any form, mostly asks you to stop a ball someplace. In either case, you'll fare much better when you understand the how and why of a ball's getting from one place to another.&quot; {ed by the Chief of Staff. Operational elements of the Bulgarian Army include: '''Bulgarian Land Forces''' ([[army]]), '''Bulgarian Navy''' ([[navy]]), and the '''Bulgarian Air Forces''' ([[air force]]).

The [[patron saint]] of the Bulgarian Army is [[St. George]], and [[Valor Day]] ([[May 6]], also known as St. George's Day) has long been celebrated as Valor and Army Day. It is an official holiday in Bulgaria.

After the country became a [[NATO]] member in April 2004, the [[Bulgarian Ministry of Defense]] has begun a new downsizing, modernization, and reform program (known as [[PLAN 2004]]) that will result in the adoption of a smaller force structure of around 50,000 personnel, based upon a [[rapid reaction force]] and two additional corps headquarters, all with subordinate brigades.

== History of the Bulgarian Army ==
== General Staff ==
Currently headed by Chief of Staff [[General Nikola Kolev]], the General Staff is responsible for the military and operational command of the Bulgarian Army and its 3 major branches.

== Land Forces ==

[[Image:Bulgarian_land_forces.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Bulgarian Land Forces exercise]]
[[Image:BMP-23 CM.jpg|thumb|BMP-3 Bulgarian in Iraq]]
The Land Forces are functionally divided into '''Active''' and '''Reserve Forces'''. Their main functions include deterrence, defense, [[peace]] support and [[crisis management]], humanitarian and rescue missions, as well as social functions within Bulgarian society.

The Active Forces mainly have peacekeeping and defensive duties, and are further divided into Deployment Forces, Immediate Reaction, and Main Defense Forces. The Reserve Forces comprise of Enhancement Forces, Territorial Defense Forces, and Training Grounds. They deal with planning and reservist preparation, armaments and equipment storage, training of formations for active forces rotation or increase in personnel.

[[Image:Bulgarian_land_forces_training.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Bulgarian Land Forces in training for winter combat]] During peacetime the Land Forces maintain permanent [[combat]] and [[mobilization]] readiness. They become part of multinational military formations in compliance with [[international treaties]] Bulgaria is a Party of, participate in the preparation of the population, the national economy and the maintenance of wartime reserves and the [[infrastructure]] of the country for defense.

In times of crisis the Land Forces' main tasks relate to participation in operations countering [[terrorism|terrorist activities]] and defense of strategic facilities (such as [[nuclear power]] plants and major industrial facilities), assisting the security forces in proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]], illegal armaments traffic and international terrorism.

In case of low- and medium-intensity military conflict the Active Forces that are part of the Land Forces participate in carrying out the initial tasks for the defense of the [[territorial integrity]] and [[sovereignty]] of the country. 

In case of a military conflict of high intensity the Land Forces, together with the Air Force and the Navy, form the defense group of the Bulgarian Army aiming at countering aggression and protection of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country.

[[Bulgaria]] has generally good relations with its neighbors and has proved to be a constructive force in the region under [[socialism|socialist]] and [[democracy|democratic]] governments alike. Promoting regional stability, Bulgaria hosted a Southeast European Foreign Ministers meeting in July [[1996]], and an [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] conference on [[Black Sea]] cooperation in November [[1995]]. Bulgaria also participated in the 1996 South [[Balkans|Balkan]] Defense Ministerial in [[Albania]] and is active in the Southeast European Cooperative Initiative.

With their close historical, cultural, and economic ties, Bulgaria seeks a mutually beneficial relationship with [[Russia]], on which it is largely dependent for energy supplies. Sporadic negotiations are underway among [[Greece]], Bulgaria, and Russia for construction of a gas pipeline from [[Burgas]] on the [[Black Sea]] to [[Alexandroupolis]] to transport [[Caspian Sea]] oil.

Bulgaria's [[EU]] Association Agreement came into effect in [[1994]], and Bulgaria formally applied for full EU membership in December 1995. During the [[1999]] EU summit in [[Helsinki]], the country was invited to start membership talks with the Union. These are currently completed, and [[January 1]], [[2007]], has been set as Bulgaria's accession date. In 1996, Bulgaria acceded to the [[Wassenaar Arrangement]] controlling exports of weapons and sensitive technology to countries of concern and also was admitted to the [[World Trade Organization]]. Bulgaria is a member of the [[Zangger Committee]] and the [[Nuclear Suppliers Group]]. After a period of equivocation under a socialist government, in March 1997 a [[UDF]]-led caretaker cabinet applied for full [[NATO]] membership, which became a reality in April 2004. Talks are underway with the [[United States]] for possible military bases and training camps of the U.S. Army in Bulgaria, as part of the Pentagon's restructuring plan.

Bulgaria joined NATO's [[Partnership for Peace]] in 1994 and applied for NATO membership in 1997. During the November [[2002]] [[Prague]] Summit Bulgaria was one of seven former socialist countries invited to join the Alliance. Bulgaria became a member of NATO in April 2004. The country is also working toward NATO compatibility in communications and training, and has established a Peacekeeping Training Center.

In [[2003]], Bulgaria was elected as a non-permament member of the [[UN Security Council]], proving to be one of 3 closest [[United States|U.S.]] allies during the [[Iraq]]i Crisis, together with the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] and [[Spain]]. Bulgaria also presides the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] in 2004.

==Illicit drugs==

==Libya==
In the late 1990s a [[Libya]]n [[children's hospital]] was the site of an [[outbreak]] of [[HIV]] infection that spread to over 400 patients. Libya blamed the outbreak on [[AIDS scandal in Libya|Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor]], who were arrested and eventually sentenced to death. The international view is that Libya has used the medics as [[scapegoat]]s for poor hygiene conditions, and [[Bulgaria]] and other countries including the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]] have repeatedly called on Tripoli to release them. [[As of]] [[2005]], the case remains unresolved, and is the source of increasing tensions with Bulgaria, as well as an obstacle to continuing the process of improved relations with the West.

[[Burkina Faso]] (formerly Upper Volta) is a landlocked [[Sahel]] country that shares borders with six nations. It is normally bright yellow on a map.  It lies between the [[Sahara]] Desert and the [[Gulf of Guinea]], south of the loop of the [[Niger River]]. The land is green in the south, with forests and fruit trees, and desert in the north. Most of central Burkina Faso lies on a [[savanna]] plateau, 198-305 meters (650-1,000 ft.) above sea level, with fields, brush, and scattered trees. Burkina Faso's game preserves--the most important of which are [[Arly]], [[Nazinga]], and [[W National Park]]--contain [[Panthera leo|lion]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[hippopotamus]], [[monkey]]s, [[warthog]]s, and [[antelope]]s. Tourism is not well developed.

Annual [[rainfall]] varies from about 100 centimeters (40 in.) in the south to less than 25 centimeters (10 in.) in the extreme north and northeast, where hot desert winds accentuate the dryness of the region. Burkina Faso has three distinct [[season]]s: warm and dry (November-March), hot and dry (March-May), and hot and wet (June-October). Rivers are not navigable.

[[Burkina Faso]]'s 10 million people belong to two major [[West Africa]]n cultural groups--the [[Voltaic]] and the [[Mande]]. The Voltaic are far more numerous and include the [[Mossi]], who make up about one-half of the population. The Mossi claim descent from warriors who migrated to present-day Burkina Faso and established an empire that lasted more than 800 years. Predominantly farmers, the Mossi are still bound by the traditions of the [[Mogho Naba]], who hold court in [[Ouagadougou]].

About 5,000 [[Europe]]ans reside in Burkina Faso.

Most of Burkina's people are concentrated in the south and center of the country, sometimes exceeding 48 per square kilometer (125/sq. mi.). This population density, high for [[Africa]], causes annual migrations of hundreds of thousands of Burkinabe to [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and [[Ghana]] for seasonal agricultural work. About a third of Burkinabe adhere to traditional African religions. The introduction of [[Islam]] to Burkina Faso was initially resisted by the Mossi rulers. [[Christianity|Christian]]s, predominantly [[Catholic]]s, are largely concentrated among the urban elite.

Few Burkinabe have had formal education. Schooling is free but not compulsory, and only about 29% of Burkina's primary school-age children receive a basic education. The [[University of Ouagadougou]], founded in [[1974]], was the country's first institution of higher education. The Polytechnical University in [[Bobo-Dioulasso]] was opened in [[1995]].

'''Politics of Burkina Faso''' takes place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Burkina Faso]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a pluriform multi-party system. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and parliament. The party system is dominated by the [[Congress for Democracy and Progress]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

== Political history ==
In [[1990]], the [[Popular Front]] held its first National Congress, which formed a committee to draft a national [[constitution]]. The constitution was approved by [[referendum]] in [[1991]]. In [[1992]], [[Blaise Compaoré]] was elected [[president]], running unopposed after the opposition [[boycott]]ed the election because of Compaoré's refusal to accede to demands of the opposition such as a sovereign National Conference to set modalities. The opposition did participate in the following year's legislative elections, in which the [[ODP/MT]] won a majority of seats.

The government of the Fourth Republic includes a strong presidency, a [[prime minister]], a Council of Ministers presided over by the president, a two-chamber National Assembly, and the judiciary. The legislature and judiciary are independent but remain susceptible to outside influence.

In [[1995]], Burkina held its first multiparty municipal elections since independence. With minor exceptions, balloting was considered free and fair by the local [[human rights]] organizations which monitored the contest. The president's ODP/MT won over 1,100 of some 1,700 councillor seats being contested.

In February [[1996]], the ruling ODP/MT merged with several small opposition parties to form the [[Congress for Democracy and Progress]] (CDP). This effectively co-opted much of what little viable opposition to Compaoré existed. The remaining opposition parties regrouped in preparation for [[1997]] legislative elections and the [[1998]] presidential election. The 1997 legislative elections, which international observers pronounced to be substantially free, fair, and transparent, resulted in a large CDP majority--101 to 111 seats.

The president is elected by popular vote for a seven-year term and may serve unlimited terms. The prime minister is appointed by the president with the consent of the legislature.

==Legislative branch==
The '''[[National Assembly of Burkina Faso|National Assembly]]''' (''Assemblée Nationale'') has 111 members, elected for a five year term by [[proportional representation]].

{{Campaignbox Wars of the Roses}}

The '''Battle of Bosworth''' or '''Bosworth Field''' was an important battle during the [[Wars of the Roses]] in [[15th century]] [[England]]. It was fought on [[22 August]], [[1485]] between the [[House of York|Yorkist]] [[List of monarchs of England|King]] [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], the last of the [[Plantagenet]] dynasty, and the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] contender for the crown, [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor, 2nd Earl of Richmond]] (later King Henry VII). It ended in the defeat and death of Richard and the establishment of the [[Tudor dynasty]]. Historically, the battle is considered to have marked the end of the Wars of the Roses, although further battles were fought in the years that followed as Yorkist [[pretender|pretenders]] unsuccessfully sought to reclaim the crown. (Strictly, Tudor's earlier [[treason]]s had caused him to be stripped of the Richmond title, until he took [[The Crown]] and gave the title back to himself.)...

==The Campaign and its politics==
Henry had landed in [[Pembrokeshire]], the county of his birth, on [[7 August]] with a small force&amp;mdash;consisting mainly of [[France|French]] [[Mercenary|mercenaries]]&amp;mdash;in an attempt to claim the throne of England. Richard III had fought similar battles with Lancastrian usurpers in the past, but this one would be his last. Although Henry did not have his opponent's [[military]] experience, he was accompanied by his uncle, [[Jasper Tudor, 1st Duke of Bedford|Jasper Tudor, 1st Earl of Pembroke]] (later 1st Duke of Bedford) and [[John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford]], each of them being a brilliant and seasoned [[soldier]]. Henry gathered supporters in the course of his journey through his father's native [[Wales]], and by the time he arrived in the [[Midlands]], he had amassed an army of an estimated 5,000 men.  The King, by contrast, could command nearly 8,000. The decisive factor in the battle was to be the conduct of the Stanley brothers&amp;mdash;[[William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)|Sir William Stanley]] and [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby|Thomas Stanley, 2nd Baron Stanley]], the latter being Henry's stepfather. Richard had good cause to distrust them, but was dependent on their continued loyalty.  

The battlefield site, now open to the public, is close to [[Sutton Cheney]] and [[Market Bosworth]] in [[Leicestershire]]. The actual site of the battle has been the topic of often contentious debate among professional and amateur historians, with a compelling case being made for situating the battle closer to the villages of [[Dadlington]] and [[Stoke Golding]], although most are agreed that Richard's encampment the night before the battle was indeed on [[Ambion Hill]]. Another school of thought is that the battle actually took place at [[Merevale]], just above [[Atherstone]] in [[Warwickshire]]; certainly  reperations were made by the king to Atherstone after the battle.  [[Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland]], with Lord Stanley and Sir William Stanley and their troops, watched the beginning of the engagement as the rest of Richard's army fought Henry's French mercenaries and loyal exiles. The Stanleys seem to have taken up a position some distance away from the two main armies. 

The two notorious vacillators in 1469&amp;ndash;71 were the young [[John Talbot, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury]], and the older more experienced Lord Stanley. They acted with a circumspection that bordered on deceitfulness, consistently holding back from final commitment to either side, and always keeping on good terms with the winners. Richard had taken hostages to ensure that, even if Talbot and Stanley did not join him, they would at least remain neutral during the battle.

==The Battle==
The battle lasted about two hours, and began well for the king. Unfortunately for him, Sir William Stanley chose to enter the fray on Henry's side, with Lord Thomas Stanley abstaining from the conflict all together.

Richard reached [[Ambion Hill]] first and his troops were well-rested going into the battle, while Henry's men had trouble lining up on the rough ground below (it is not clear why). Richard might have charged then, possibly slaughtering the disorganised Lancastrians, but he missed his chance. When Henry finally got ready, his men used [[cannon]] and [[arrow|arrows]] to force Richard to come down from his hilltop. When Richard did, he called for Lord Northumberland, who commanded the right wing of Richard's army, to join in with fresh forces. But Northumberland refused, holding his forces back from action. Although he was captured on the day, he was soon released and confirmed in all his titles and lands by the new King Henry VII. But it was the decision of Lord Stanley, waiting nearby, that tipped the battle's outcome in favor of Henry. 

After Richard's commander, [[John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk]], was slain, and before the waiting armies of Lords Stanley and Northumberland chose sides, Richard attempted a valiant, suicidal [[Charge (warfare)|charge]] against Henry, who had stayed well clear of most of the fighting. In the attack, Richard killed Henry's standard bearer, William Brandon. But while Richard was within sight of Henry, Lord Stanley's army moved, surrounding Richard and the men of his Household. Thus was Richard cut down. He was 32 years of age. 

Richard of York was the second and last English king to die in battle ([[Harold II of England|Harold Godwinson]] at [[Hastings]], [[1066]], killed by the [[Normans]], was the first). He was the only king from the north, and the last of the [[Plantagenet]] kings. His body was ignominiously treated by the victors.

The battle proved to be decisive in ending the long-running [[medieval]] series of [[English Civil Wars]] later be to known as the [[Wars of the Roses]], although the last battle was actually to be fought at [[Battle of Stoke Field|Stoke]] two years later ([[1487]]).

==Consequences==

Henry Tudor was crowned as [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]], marking the beginning of the 118-year reign of the [[Tudor dynasty]] in [[England]]. He immediately sought to backdate his administration to a date prior to the battle of Bosworth Field in order to attaint for [[treason]] men who had fought for the former King Richard of York.

Henry VII was in fact outlawed and barred from his own inheritance, and was under [[Attainder]] when he seized the English Throne in 1485. Henry's [[coronation]] conveniently nullified the attainder. Following this, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] made the declaration that any who had opposed King Henry at Bosworth were to be considered traitors.

Lord Northumberland was killed at one of his Yorkshire residences by a mob protesting over high taxes for the defence of [[Brittany]] against France on [[April 28]], [[1489]]. Another reason for the mob's actions was his part in the downfall and death of Richard III who remained popular in [[Yorkshire]].

==Location==
For several years after the event the battle was called the '''Battle of Redemore''' and it was some time before the more famous name was used. This has led to the theory that the battle was ''not'' fought on Ambion Hill but on a reedy moor in the same area. People have long been researching to try to discover the actual site of this battle, work which has continued in the first decade of the 21st century.

==Popular culture==

The Battle is a key setting in [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]], and much of the mythology surrounding it seems to derive from inventions of Shakespeare for [[dramatic license]], which were otherwise unrecorded in the century before the play was written. In the play, Richard is unhorsed after his charge, and cries out &quot;A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!&quot;, and his [[crown]] was retrieved by Henry from a [[Crataegus|hawthorn]] [[shrub|bush]]. Richard would not have worn his crown but may have worn a [[circlet]] on his helmet, that his men may recognize him.

The battle is also the setting for the first episode of the first series of [[Blackadder]], in which the comic protagonist accidentally kills Richard, saying in realization, &quot;Oh my God, it's Uncle Richard.&quot;

The [[flowering plant]] [[family (biology)|family]] '''Brassicaceae''', also called '''Cruciferae''', is known as the '''mustard family''' or '''cabbage family'''. Agricultural plants in the mustard family are also known as '''cole crops'''; ''cole'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''caulis'' (stem), as does the [[German language|German]] ''Kohl''. 

The family contains species of great economic importance, providing much of the world's [[winter vegetable]]s.  These include [[cabbage]], [[broccoli]], [[cauliflower]], [[brussels sprout]]s, [[collard]]s, and [[kale]] (all cultivars of one species, ''[[Brassica oleracea]]''), [[Chinese kale]], [[rutabaga]] (also known as Swedish turnips or swedes), [[seakale]], [[turnip]]s, [[radish]] and [[Kohl Rabi|kohl rabi]]. Other well known members of the Brassicaceae include [[rapeseed]] ([[canola]] and others), [[mustard seed]], [[horseradish]], [[wasabi]] and [[watercress]]. 
The most intensely studied member of the Brassicaceae is the [[model organism]] ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''.

The family was formerly named '''Cruciferae''' (&quot;cross-bearing&quot;), because the four [[petal]]s of their flowers are reminiscent of crosses. Many botanists still refer to members of the family as &quot;crucifers&quot;. According to [[ICBN]] Art. 18.5 (St Louis Code) Cruciferae is to be regarded as validly published, and is thus an accepted alternate name.

==Use as food==

The importance of this Family for food crops has lead to its selective breeding throughout history.  Brassica oleracea, a plant of Atlantic Europe and the Mediterranean, is the precursor to Cabbage, Brussels Sprouts, Broccoli, Kohlrabi, Cauliflower, Kale, and most recently [[Broccoflower]], a hybrid of Broccoli and Cauliflower.

&lt;br&gt;

==Distribution and description==
The mustard family is concentrated in the [[temperate]] regions and reaches maximal diversity around the [[Mediterranean]] area. It contains over 350 genera and about 3000 species. 

The family consists of [[herbaceous]] plants with annual, bi-annual and perennial lifespans. Members of this family often have alternate (rarely opposite) leaves. Most members share a suite of [[glucosinolate]] compounds that has a typical pungent odor usually associated with cole crops. 

Whilst some members have seeds with a high [[erucic acid]] content, making these unsafe to eat in large doses, all members of this family are edible.

Below a table is presented to compare the canons of these denominations (other faiths are not currently included) for both the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[New Testament]]. A detailed discussion of the differences is found in the article on [[Biblical canon]].

It should be noted that the [[Greek Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], and [[Eastern Catholic]] churches may have minor differences in the list of accepted books. The list given here for these churches is the most broad list of canonical books &amp;mdash; that is, if at least one eastern church accepts the book, it is included in the list here. The books included by the Roman Catholic Church are universally included in the eastern canons.

Prior to Montgomery taking command, the history of the campaign in North Africa had resembled a series of see-saws; both sides won battles but neither gained a decisive advantage. Montgomery had noted this and was determined not to fight until he could win a decisive victory. Montgomery put into action his beliefs in the  detailed planning and training of his troops.  He was also given more armour than Auchinleck had received so that by the time El Alamein began, the 8th Army had over 800 of the latest American-built tanks.  

By [[23 October]], the largest British artillery barrage of the Second World War started, Montgomery was confident he would win — but by a ruthless battle of tactical surprise and then gradual mutual attrition, rather than by manoeuvre. Montgomery called this the &quot;killing match&quot;. The battle was won through application of overwhelming firepower, while pinning German units in place. By [[2 November]], Rommel wanted to retreat, but [[Hitler]] ordered a 'victory or death' stand. It was ignored as German units fled, leaving more than 30,000 infantry to surrender. It was the first large-scale, decisive allied land victory of the war.  

Montgomery was [[Order of the Bath|knighted]] and promoted to full [[general]]. Montgomery's subsequent slow and steady advance as the Germans retreated hundreds of miles towards their bases in [[Tunisia]] used the logistical and firepower advantages of the British Army while avoiding manoeuvre battles. It also gave the Allies an indication the tide of war had genuinely turned in North Africa. Montgomery kept the initiative, applying superior strength when it suited him, forcing Rommel out of each successive defensive position. When Montgomery encountered fiercer frontal opposition than he had anticipated at [[Mareth]], he was forced to switch his major effort into an outflanking inland pincer, backed by low-flying RAF fighter-bomber support in a demonstration of British [[blitzkrieg]]. This was a harbinger of what ground forces could achieve when working closely in tandem with co-operative airforces.

This campaign demonstrated the battle-winning ingredients of morale, co-operation of all arms including the air forces, first-class logistical back-up and clear-cut orders. This approach is Montgomery's legacy to modern field command.

The next major Allied attack was [[Operation Husky]], the invasion of [[Sicily]]. It was in Sicily that Montgomery's famous tensions with US commanders really began. Montgomery managed to recast plans for the Allied invasion, in general making the plan more cautious. Inter-allied tensions grew as the American commanders [[George S. Patton|Patton]], and [[Omar Bradley|Bradley]], took umbrage at what they perceived as Montgomery's attitudes and boastfulness. They resented him, while accepting his skills as a general. 

Montgomery continued to command Eighth Army during the landings on the mainland of Italy itself. Shortly thereafter he was recalled to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] to take part in planning [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of [[Normandy]]. Montgomery assumed command of [[British 21st Army Group|21st Army Group]] before the Normandy invasion and commanded that formation for the rest of the war in Europe.

===Normandy===
Montgomery's role in modifying the plans for [[Operation Overlord]] was crucial. He immediately recommended that the plan be expanded from a three-Division attack to a five-Division attack. As with his takeover of the 8th Army, Montgomery travelled frequently to his units, raising morale and ensuring training was progressing. 

During the [[Battle of Normandy|D-Day invasion]], and for several months afterwards, Montgomery commanded all allied ground forces: British, Canadian and American. Allied troops became generally bogged down.  The key to the battle was the French city of Caen. Caen had been an objective on D-Day, and Montgomery's original plan called for a steady Allied advance with a breakthrough in the east.  In Normandy the British Second Army faced the most open terrain in the east, but also the bulk of the German armour, including most of the [[Waffen SS]] Panzer divisions that were present on the Western Front. The US First Army, in the west, faced the very difficult [[bocage]] terrain, but less high-quality German opponents.  As a result, it actually took until mid-August to capture Caen. This provoked criticism both from his American counterparts and from some senior British officers, especially the Deputy [[SHAEF]] Commander, [[Arthur Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder|Tedder]], an [[Air Marshal]]. 
 
When the original plan failed, Montgomery and his subordinates improvised a number of operations including [[Villers-Bocage]], [[Operation Epsom]], [[Operation Charnwood]], [[Operation Goodwood]], and [[Operation Cobra]], which eventually suceeded in a breakout. 

===Advance to the Rhine===
The preponderance of American troops in the European theatre made it a political impossibility for the Ground Forces Commander to be British.  Eisenhower himself took over Ground Forces Command while continuing as Supreme Commander, with Montgomery reverting to command of 21st Army Group, consisting mainly of British and Canadian units.  Montgomery bitterly resented this change, even though it had been agreed before the D-Day invasion. [[Winston Churchill]] had Montgomery promoted to [[Field Marshal]] by way of compensation.

Montgomery's tempestuous personality and tactlessness throughout the war nearly led to fissures in the Allied high command.  Montgomery was able to persuade Eisenhower to adopt his strategy of a single thrust to the [[Ruhr area|Ruhr]], which manifested itself in [[Operation Market Garden]]. Operation Market Garden led to the defeat of the [[British 1st Airborne Division|1st Airborne Division]] outside [[Arnhem]]. When first shown the plans the British Lieutenant General [[Frederick Browning]] is alleged to have said, &quot;I think we might be going [[A Bridge Too Far|a bridge too far]].&quot; but there is no evidence for this. However, Montgomery insisted that all his battles ran according to his plans despite evidence to the contrary, even claiming that [[Operation_Market_Garden#Legacy|Arnhem]] had been a 90% success.

A further criticism is that the opportunity to destroy the German 15th Army as it retreated across the [[Scheldt]] was missed. As a result, 80,000 troops crossed in good order and prevented the use of [[Antwerp]] until the [[Canadian 1st Army]] had completed several long and costly [[Battle of the Scheldt|clearance operations]]. 

On the [[4 May|4th May]] [[1945]] on [[Lüneburg|Lüneburg Heath]] Montgomery accepted the surrender of German forces in northern Germany, Denmark, and The Netherlands.

==Character and controversy==
Montgomery was a complex man.  On the one hand though far from flawless he was a great and successful general through hard work, a refusal to conform to dead tradition, and an open, clear and sensitive mind.  He was a humane man and was capable of inspiring great loyalty among his staff and his troops. These men defended him with great passion even after the war, as the British historian [[Richard Holmes (military historian)|Richard Holmes]] discovered when he was critical of Montgomery. Much of his sometimes-criticised caution sprung from his regard for human life and a desire not to throw the lives of his troops away in the manner of the generals of the [[World War I|First World War]]. Montgomery thought that one of the most important roles for a military commander was to motivate his men to fight, that military command is `a great human problem'. 

On the other hand, he was personally a difficult man.  Montgomery did not get on with his contemporaries and mostly associated with junior officers.  He was insensitive, conceited, and boastful.  He was not an easy man to know socially and not loyal to the staff officers serving immediately under him.  It can be argued that his failures happened when he allowed his desire for personal glory to taint his planning, causing him to abandon his usual caution.  

Often it was Montgomery's statements about battles, as much as his actual conduct of it, that have formed the basis of the controversy. In his career, Montgomery's orders to his subordinates were clear and complete, yet with his superiors his communications could be opaque and incomplete.  So, in Normandy he gave the impression to Eisenhower and others that he was attempting a breakout, while playing down this possibility in his actual orders to his subordinates.  For example, shortly before [[Operation Goodwood]], he removed Falaise as an objective, but did not forward these new orders to [[SHAEF]].  He later claimed that his goal all along had been to pin down the bulk of the German armour around Caen, allowing U.S. forces (also under his command) to conduct the breakout. The practical result though was that the Allies under Montgomery's command inflicted a decisive defeat on the Germans, essentially destroying the German Army in Normandy, taking Paris, encircling large numbers of Germans in the [[Falaise Gap]], and setting the stage for a rapid advance to the German border. 

His relations with some of the American generals (especially [[George S. Patton|Patton]] and [[Omar Bradley|Bradley]]) degenerated to mutual loathing.  This caused a crisis immediately after the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. On [[January 7|7th January]], [[1945]] Montgomery held a press conference in which he downplayed the role of the American generals, especially Patton, in the Allied victory at the [[Battle of the Bulge]], in which he had under his command General [[Courtney Hodges]]' 1st Army, temporarily detached from the US 12th Army Group. This caused some degree of controversy, and resentment from Americans who felt that Montgomery held back his forces too long, and did not recognize that the bulk of the fighting was done by the American forces. A slanted version broadcast by German radio added to the insult.

An alternative view is that Eisenhower recognised the organisational wisdom of Montgomery being responsible for the northern flank of the German incursion. Following Bradley's failure to adequately guard against the German attack, he (Bradley) objected vehemently to American troops being transferred to the command of a British general, and had to be bluntly over-ruled by Eisenhower (&quot;Well, Brad, those are my orders&quot;). The relevant ''US History'' notes: &quot;''Eisenhower and Smith (Eisenhower's Chief of Staff) were acutely aware of the smouldering animosity towards the British in general and Montgomery in particular which existed in  the Headquarters of the 12th Army Group and 3rd Army, not to mention the chronic anti-British sentiments which might be anticipated from some circles in Washington.''&quot;

The criticisms of Montgomery were made with this background of personal animosity.  Monty supported his American formations; the Army commanders Hodges and Simpson were glad for this. The battlefront was reorganised, reinforced and supplied. The three generals then waited for the Germans to exhaust themselves.  This waiting for the right moment did not appeal to Bradley or Hodges, however.In the meantime, [[George S. Patton|Patton]], who believed that the more the Germans advanced, the more they would eventually lose, prepared for an immediate counter-attack. 

Monty then further angered his American colleagues and superior. In a memo to Eisenhower, he proposed that he should again be made Commander Ground Forces and implicitly criticised recent conduct of the war. At a time when American confidence had been shaken and nerves were raw, this was unwise. Eisenhower, encouraged by Tedder, was on the point of dismissing Montgomery, when [[Beddell Smith]] and Monty's own Chief of Staff, Major-General [[Freddie de Guingand]] pointed that this would be both politically unwise and difficult to justify. De Guingand was able to convince Monty of the impact of his words (of which he was apparently unaware) and Monty wrote an apology to Eisenhower. The moment passed.

It was in this climate of opinion that Monty held his press conference. His comments, as reported, gave further great offence, as mentioned above. Eisenhower commented in his memoirs: &quot;''I doubt if Montgomery ever came to realise how resentful some American commanders were. They believed he had belittled them - and they were not slow to voice reciprocal scorn and contempt''&quot;.  

For the record, Monty's press conference statements included the following eulogy on the American soldier: 
:&quot;''I first saw him in battle in Sicily and I formed a very high opinion of him. I saw him again in Italy. He is a very brave fighting man, steady under fire and with that tenacity in battle which marks the first-class fighting soldier. I have a great affection and admiration for the American soldier. I salute the brave fighting men of America. I never want to fight alongside better soldiers. I have tried to feel that I am almost an American soldier myself so that I might take no unsuitable action or offend them in any way ... Runstedt was really beaten by the good fighting qualities of the American soldier and by the team work of the Allies.''&quot; 

On Eisenhower, he said: 
:&quot;''The captain of our team is Eisenhower. I am absolutely devoted to Ike; we are the greatest of friends. It grieves me when I see uncomplimentary articles about him in the British press; he bears a great burden, he needs our fullest support, he has the right to expect it and it is up to all of us to see that he gets it.''&quot;. 

Montgomery subsequently recognised his error and later wrote: &quot;''I think now that I should never have held that press conference. So great were the feelings against me on the part of the American generals that whatever I said was bound to be wrong. I should therefore have said nothing.''&quot;

Montgomery's performance during the battles in northern Europe was criticised by many who considered his plans unimaginative and too rigid (including [[Gerd_von_Rundstedt|von Rundstedt]]). This overlooks the strengths and weaknesses of each side, and Montgomery's critics may sometimes fail to take note of this.  He was most successful with well planned attacks with overwhelming forces, such as at [[El Alamein]] that took advantage of his Army's strengths. Montgomery's defenders attributed his caution to the fact that he commanded mostly British and Canadian forces which were limited in number and not easily replaced, which meant that he could not afford to sacrifice them needlessly. He was also determined to avoid the waste of men that he had seen in the [[World War I]]. His American counterparts, Bradley and Patton, in contrast, could call upon almost inexhaustible supplies of manpower from the United States.

==Later life==
After the war, Montgomery was created 1st [[Viscount Montgomery of Alamein]] in [[1946]].  His reputation was tarnished over two decades after his death by evidence of [[racism]] with the 1999 revelation of previously secret papers from 1947-1948 when he held the position of [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]]. During that period he was strictly enjoined to silence about his views, which were contrary to British policy, and agents were assigned to vet his public appearances for compliance.

Montgomery was chairman of the governing body  of [[St John's School]], [[Leatherhead]], [[Surrey]]  from [[1951]] to [[1966]]. He promoted it, raised money for it and gave generously of his own time and wealth.

He was deputy supreme commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO]]) forces from 1951 to 1958.  

Montgomery's memoirs were considered by some to be overly critical of his wartime comrades. His friendship with [[Eisenhower]], always tenuous, was ended with their publication. 

In [[1967]], Montgomery campaigned against the legalisation of [[homosexuality]] in the [[United Kingdom]] arguing that the ''[[Sexual Offences Act 1967]]'' was a &quot;charter for buggery&quot; and that &quot;this sort of thing may be tolerated by the French, but we're British - thank God.&quot; Ironically, a [[2001]] book, ''The Full Monty'' ISBN 0140283757 by Montgomery's official biographer and long-time friend, [[Nigel Hamilton]], alleged that the general was a &quot;repressed homosexual&quot; who had &quot;quasi love affairs&quot; with numerous young men and boys which fell short of sexual intimacy.[http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4142165,00.html]  However there is not any evidence to any physical relationship, and Montgomery's ten year marriage was a happy and loving one.  

Montgomery died in [[1976]] and was interred in the Holy Cross Churchyard, [[Binsted]], [[Hampshire]].  His portrait (by [[Frank O. Salisbury]], [[1945]]) is in the [[National Portrait Gallery]].

'''Herman Boerhaave''' ([[Voorhout]], [[December 31]], [[1668]] - [[Leyden]], [[September 23]], [[1738]]) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[humanist]] and [[physician]] of European fame. He is regarded as the founder of the clinical teaching and of the modern academic [[hospital]]. His main achievement was to demonstrate the relation of symptoms to lesions.

He was born at [[Voorhout]] near [[Leiden]]. Entering the [[University of Leiden]] he took his degree in philosophy in 1689, with a dissertation ''De distinctione mentis a corpore'', in which he attacked the doctrines of [[Epicurus]], [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]. He then turned to the study of medicine, in which he graduated in 1693 at [[University of Harderwijk|Harderwijk]] in [[Gelderland]]. In [[1701]] he was appointed lecturer on the institutes of medicine at Leiden; in his inaugural discourse, ''De commendando [[Hippocrates|Hippocratis]] studio'', he recommended to his pupils that great physician as their model.

In [[1709]] he became professor of [[botany]] and medicine, and in that capacity he did good service, not only to his own university, but also to botanical science, by his improvements and additions to the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden|botanic garden of Leiden]], and by the publication of numerous works descriptive of new species of plants. In 1714, when he was appointed rector of the university, he succeeded [[Govert Bidloo]] in the chair of practical medicine, and in this capacity he introduced the modern system of clinical instruction. Four years later he was appointed to the chair of chemistry also. In [[1728]] he was elected into the [[French Academy of Sciences]], and two years later into the [[Royal Society]] of London. In 1729 declining health obliged him to resign the chairs of chemistry and botany; and he died, after a lingering and painful illness, at Leiden.

His reputation so increased the fame of the University of Leiden, especially as a school of medicine, that it became popular with visitors from every part of Europe. All the princes of Europe sent him pupils, who found in this skillful professor not only an indefatigable teacher, but an affectionate guardian. When [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] went to Holland in [[1715]], to instruct himself in maritime affairs, he also took lessons from Boerhaave. His reputation was not confined to Europe; a Chinese mandarin sent him a letter addressed to &quot;the illustrious Boerhaave, physician in Europe,&quot; and it reached him in due course. 

==Personal Life==
On [[September 14]] [[1710]], Boerhaave married Maria Drolenvaux, the daughter of the rich merchant, Alderman Abraham Drolenvaux. They had four children, of whom one daughter, Maria Joanna, lived to adulthood [http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/2404.html]. In 1722, he began to suffer from an extreme case of [[gout]], recovering the next year.

His principal works are:
*''Institutiones medicae'' (Leiden, 1708)
*''Aphorismi de cognoscendis et curandis morbis'' (Leiden, 1709), on which his pupil and assistant, [[Gerard van Swieten]] (1700-1772) published a commentary in 5 vols.
*''Elementa chemiae'' (Paris, 1724).

      <contrGreece]], in [[49 BC]]. Caesar, for lack of a fleet, solidified his control over the western Mediterranean &amp;mdash; [[Spain]] and [[North Africa]], specifically, before assembling ships to follow Pompey.

An indecisive winter ([[49 BC|49]]&amp;ndash;[[48 BC]]) of blockade and siege followed.  Pompey eventually pushed Caesar into [[Thessaly]] and attacked at Pharsalus.  Caesar began the battle with a smaller, but veteran, force.  Pompey's troops were more numerous, but far less experienced.  Moreover, Pompey's senatorial allies disagreed with Pompey over whether to fight at Pharsalus, and pushed Pompey into a quick decision.

==Prelude==

After [[Pompey]] and the [[Roman Senate]] fled over to [[Greece]] to avoid Caesar's invasion of [[Italy]], they began to prepare an army to defend themselves in Greece.  Caesar therefore marched overland through southern [[France]] meanwhile, blockading what is now [[Marseille]], and managing to assemble a small fleet.  After crushing Pompey's forces in [[Spain]], Caesar focused once again on Pompey and his troops in Greece.  Pompey had a fleet, as well as much support from all Roman [[provinces]] and [[Client state|client states]] east of Italy.  Caesar, however managed to cross the Adriatic in the winter with [[Marc Antony]] following a little later, because Caesar lacked ships.  Although Pompey had a larger army, he recognized that Caesar's was more experienced, and could prove victorious in a pitched battle. Instead, Pompey waited Caesar's troops out, attempting to starve them by cutting off Caesar's supply lines. After a disastrous attack on Pompey's camp at [[Dyrrhachium]], Caesar was forced to pull away. Pompey did not immediately follow up on his success; but urged on by his senatorial allies, he confronted Caesar near Pharsalus.

Caesar had the following legions with him:
* Legions of veterans from the [[Gallic wars]] &amp;ndash; Caesar's favourite legion, [[Legio X Gemina|X ''Equestris'']], and those later known with the names of [[Legio VIII Augusta|VIII ''Augusta'']], [[Legio IX Hispana|IX ''Hispana'']], and [[Legio XII Fulminata|XII ''Fulminata'']]
* Legions levied for the civil war &amp;ndash; legions later known as [[Legio I|I ''Germanica'']], [[Legio III Gallica|III ''Gallica'']], and [[Legio IV Macedonica|IV ''Macedonica'']]

==Battle==

Both commanders realized that if one army was able to flank the other and force them to fight on two sides, they would probably win. As such, both commanders put a substantial amount of effort into ensuring that the other would be unable to 'sneak around to the back'. The battle was held with the [[Enipeus|River Enipeus]] to Caesar's left, ensuring that neither side would be able to move around the other army on Caesar's left. The most important part of the battle was to happen on Caesar's right. Pompey hoped to win by using his superior cavalry to mount a two-front attack on Caesar's forces. As such, he placed a large contingent of cavalry on Caesar's right, with light forces consisting of [[sling (weapon)|slinger]]s (''funditores'') and [[archery|archer]]s (''sagitarii''). Caesar placed his cavalry on his right, with the fourth battle line in reserve behind it.

===Deployment===

Caesar opened the battle with three battle lines, and a fourth in reserve. [[Mark Antony]] was given command of Caesar's troops by the river. The center of Caesar's army was commanded by [[Domitius Calvinus]]. The commander of the right wing of Caesar's army was [[Publius Sulla]], while [[Ahenobarbus]] commanded the right side of Pompey's force. Caesar was greatly-outnumbered in cavalry. To make matters worse for Caesar, [[Titus Labienus]] controlled the far-left wing of Pompey's army. Titus Labienus had been one of Caesar's legion commanders in Gaul, and knew Caesar better than any other general on the field that day. Light and heavy infantry were deployed near the river on both sides. The majority of the battle was a clash between heavy infantry.

===Conflict===

When the two generals had finished deploying their troops, the heavy infantry began to close. Pompey ordered his soldiers not to charge (against the standards of the day) in an effort to tire out Caesar's troops; however, this tactic backfired as Pompey's multi-lingual forces were unable to receive orders easily, and Caesar's troops stopped halfway, leaving Pompey's troops confused. Caesar's veteran centurions, forseeing Pompey's trap, stopped halfway on their charge, and allowed their lines to rest. Pompey's fresh legionaries and Caesar's veteran troops created a stalemate in the center. By the river, the [[light infantry]] skirmished, before the [[Roman legion|heavy infantry]] closed. Titus Labienus led a cavalry charge, and succeeded in pushing back Caesar's cavalry and light infantry. However, when confronted by Caesar's fourth line of heavy infantry, Labienus' charge was pushed back, and the light infantry and cavalry of Pompey's right were pushed into the foothills of [[Mount Dogandzis]]. Caesar's fourth battle line wheeled into Pompey's rear at the same moment when Caesar pushed a fresh line of troops into battle. Now facing Caesar's fresh third line at the center of the battle and the attack from behind from Caesar's fourth line, Pompey saw that his defeat was at hand. Caesar deployed his experienced ''pilae'', the javelin throwers, against the threat of the large cavalry force of Pompey, telling them to thrust their javelins at the riders instead of throwing them. Pompey fled the battle while his troops were defeated under pressure. Caesar ransacked Pompey's camp, and took control of the remainder of Pompey's army.

==Aftermath==

Pompey fled from Pharsalus to [[Egypt]], where he was assassinated on the order of [[Pharaoh]] [[Ptolemy XIII]].  The Battle of Pharsalus ended the wars of the [[First Triumvirate]], and left Caesar 'supreme commander' of the Roman World.  Caesar spent the next few years 'mopping up' remnants of the [[Senatorial Faction]].  After finally completing this task, he was assassinated in a conspiracy arranged by [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Hindu scriptures}}
The '''Bhagavad Gita''' ([[Sanskrit]]: '''&amp;#2349;&amp;#2366;&amp;#2327;&amp;#2357;&amp;#2342;&amp;#2381; &amp;#2327;&amp;#2368;&amp;#2340;&amp;#2366;''' - ''Bhāgavad G&amp;#299;tā'') is revered as a sacred text of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Hindu philosophy|philosophy]]. The name 'Bhagavad Gita', when translated into [[English Language|English]], literally means 'Song of God'. Its written format is that of a poem which is 700 verses long, originating from the famous [[puranic]] [[Epic poetry|epic]] [[Mahabharata]] (''Bhishma Parva'' chapters 23 &amp;ndash; 40).

Commonly referred to as ''The Gita'', it is a conversation between [[Krishna]] and [[Arjuna]] which takes place on a battlefield, just prior to the start of a [[Kurukshetra war|climactic war]]. During the conversation, [[Krishna]] proclaims that he is God Himself ([[Bhagavan]]), and at the request of [[Arjuna]], displays his [[divine]] form, which is described as [[Eternity|timeless]], that leaves the latter awestruck. The conversation summarizes a number of different [[Yoga|Yogic]] and [[Vedantic]] philosophies, explaining the meaning and purpose of life and existence. The Bhagavad Gita refers to itself as an '[[Upanishad]]', and is sometimes called ''G&amp;#299;topani&amp;#351;ad''.

It is not exactly clear when the Bhagavad Gita was written. Astronomical [http://www.boloji.com/astro/00325.htm evidence] cited in the Mahabharata place the incidents upon which the Gita is based in the year [[3137 BCE]], while the [[Purana]]s suggest a date of ''c.'' [[1924 BCE]]. Scholars place the actual writing of the Gita in the latter half of the [[1st millennium BC]] (roughly [[4th century BC]]), making it a contemporary of the older [[Upanishad]]s.

==Background==
[[Image:Gita1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Krishna]] to [[Arjuna]]: ''Behold My mystic opulence!''
&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''Artwork © courtesy of [http://www.krishna.com The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust]''&lt;/small&gt;]] 
The discourse on the Bhagavad Gita begins before the start of the climactic battle at [[Kurukshetra_war|Kurukshetra]]. It begins with the [[kshatriya]] prince [[Arjuna]], as he becomes filled with doubt on the battlefield. Realising that his enemies are his own relatives, beloved friends, and revered teachers, he turns to his charioteer and [[Guru|guide]], Sri [[Krishna]] (an [[avatar]] of Sri [[Vishnu]]), for advice.

[[Krishna]] counsels [[Arjuna]], beginning with the tenet that the human [[Soul]] is immortal, and human death on the battlefield is just the shedding of the body, but the soul is permanant. Krishna goes on to expound on the yogic paths of devotion, action, meditation and knowledge. Fundamentally, the Bhagavad Gita proposes that true enlightenment comes from growing beyond identification with the [[Ego]], the little Self, and that one must identify with the Truth of the immortal Self, (the soul or [[Atman]]), the ultimate Divine Consciousness. Through detachment from the personal Ego, the [[Yogi]], or follower of a particular path of [[Yoga]], is able to transcend his mortality and attachment from the material world, and see the Infinite (the [[Brahman]]).

To demonstrate the infinity of the unknowable [[Brahman]], Krishna grants Arjuna the boon of cosmic vision (albeit temporary), and allows the prince to see Him in all his Divine Glory. He reveals that He is fundamentally both the ultimate essence of ''Being'' in the universe, and also its material body. This is called the [[Vishvarupa]]/Viratrupa.

==The Scripture of Yoga==
The Gita addresses the discord between the senses and the intuition of cosmic unity. It speaks of the Yoga of equanimity, a detached outlook. The term Yoga covers a wide range of meanings, but in the context of the Bhagavad Gita, describes a unified outlook, serenity of mind, skill in action, and the ability to stay attuned to the glory of the Self (Atman), which is of the same essence as the basis of Being (Brahman). According to Krishna, the root of all suffering and discord is the agitation of the mind caused by desire. The only way to douse the flame of desire is by stilling the mind through discipline of the senses and the intellect.

However, abstinence from action is regarded as being just as detrimental as extreme indulgence. According to the Bhagavad Gita, the goal of life is to free the mind and intellect from their complexities, and to focus them on the glory of the Self, by dedicating one's actions to the divine. This goal can be achieved through the Yogas of meditation, action, devotion and knowledge.The Gita describes the best Yogi as one who constantly thinks of God.

Krishna summarizes the Yogas through eighteen chapters. There are four kinds of Yoga - Raja Yoga or ''Psycho-Physical Meditation'', Bhakti Yoga or ''Devotion'', Karma Yoga or ''Selfless Action'', and Jnana (pronounced ''gyaan'') Yoga or ''Self Transcending Knowledge''.

While each path differs, their fundamental goal is the same - to realize Brahman (the ''' ''Divine Essence'' ''') as being the only truth, that the body is temporal, and that the ''Supreme Soul'' ([[Paramatman]]) is infinite. Yoga's aim ([[nirvana]] or [[moksha]]) is to escape from the cycle of reincarnation through realization of oneness with the ultimate reality. There are three stages to self-realisation enunciated from the Bhagavad Gita:

1. Brahman - The impersonal universal energy

2. Paramatma - The Supreme Soul sitting in the heart of every living entity.

3. Bhagavan - God as a personality, with a transcendental form.

Here are some quotations from Krishna that make up history's first real yoga text and give comprehensive definitions of the four principle yogas: 

===On The Goal Of Yoga===
&quot;When the mind comes to rest, restrained by the practice of Yoga, and when beholding the Self, by the Self, he is content in the Self.&quot; [http://vedabase.net/bg/6/20] &quot; He who finds his happiness within, his delight within, and his light within, this yogi attains the bliss of Brahman, becoming Brahman.&quot; 

===On Bhakti Yoga===
Put simply, Bhakti Yoga is ''Service in Love and Devotion to God'' (Krishna in the context of the Bhagavad Gita). 

&quot;I consider the Yogi-devotee - who lovingly contemplates on Me with supreme faith, and whose mind is ever absorbed in Me - to be the best of all the Yogis&quot;. [http://vedabase.net/bg/6/47]
&quot;After attaining Me, the great souls do not incur rebirth in this miserable transitory world, because they have attained the highest perfection.&quot; [http://vedabase.net/bg/8/15]
&quot;... those who, renouncing all actions in Me, and regarding Me as the Supreme, worship Me... For those whose thoughts have entered into Me, I am soon the deliverer from the ocean of death and transmigration, Arjuna. Keep your mind on Me alone, your intellect on Me. Thus you shall dwell in Me hereafter.&quot; [http://vedabase.net/bg/12/6]
&quot;And he who serves Me with the yoga of unswerving devotion, transcending these qualities [binary opposites, like good and evil, pain and pleasure] is ready for liberation in Brahman.&quot; [http://vedabase.net/bg/14/26]
&quot;Fix your mind on Me, be devoted to Me, offer service to Me, bow down to Me, and you shall certainly reach Me. I promise you because you are My very dear friend.&quot; [http://vedabase.net/bg/18/65]
&quot;Setting aside all meritorious deeds (Dharma), just [[surrender (religion)|surrender]] completely to My will (with firm faith and loving contemplation). I shall liberate you from all sins. Do not fear.&quot; [http://vedabase.net/bg/18/66]

===On Karma Yoga===
Karma Yoga is essentially ''Acting, or doing one's duties in life as per his/her [[dharma]], or duty, without concern of results'' - a sort of constant sacrifice of action to the Supreme. It is action done without thought of gain. In a more modern interpretation, it can be viewed as duty bound deeds done without letting the nature of the result affecting ones actions. It is said that the results can be of 3 types - as aimed for, opposite of what is aimed for, or a mixture of these. If one can perform his duties (as prescribed in the [[Vedas]]) without any anticipation of the result of his actions, he is bound to succeed. It includes, but is not limited to, dedication of one's chosen profession and its perfection to God. It is also visible in community and social service, since they are inherently done without thought of personal gain. 

'''Example:''' If one is playing tennis on the tennis court, his duty is to play as well as he can. If he is a [[Karma Yogi]], the loss of a few points will not hamper his enthusiasm and energy for the rest of the game, but if he is not, then he will start getting tense, nervous, self-conscious, etc. and is then bound to make mistakes and lose anyway. This is a simple example of Karma Yoga for a [[layman]].

Krishna advocates [[Nishkam Karma Yoga]] (the Yoga of Selfless Action) as the ideal path to realize the Truth. Allocated work done without expectations, motives, or thinking about its outcomes tends to purify one's mind and gradually makes an individual fit to see the value of reason and the benefits of renouncing the work itself. These concepts are vividly described in the following verses:

:&quot;To action alone hast thou a right and never at all to its fruits;let not the fruits of action be thy motive; neither let there be in thee any attachment to inaction&quot; -- ''verse 47, Chapter 2-Samkhya theory and Yoga practise''

:&quot;Fixed in yoga, do thy work, O Winner of wealth(Arjuna), abandoning attachment, with an even mind in success and failure, for evenness of mind is called yoga&quot; -- ''verse 48, Chapter 2-Samkhya theory and Yoga practise''

:&quot;With the body, with the mind, with the intellect, even merely with the senses, the Yogis perform action toward self-purification, having abandoned attachment. He who is disciplined in Yoga, having abandoned the fruit of action, attains steady peace...&quot; [http://vedabase.net/bg/5/11]

In order to achieve true liberation, it is important to control all mental desires and tendencies to enjoy and sense pleasures. The following verses illustrate this:
:''Verses 62,63, chapter 2- Samkhya theory and Yoga practise''
:&quot;When a man dwells in his mind on the object of sense, attachment to them is produced. From attachment springs desire and from desire comes anger.&quot;

:&quot;From anger arises bewilderment, from bewilderment loss of memory; and from loss of memory, the destruction of intelligence and from the destruction of intelligence he perishes&quot;

===On Jnana Yoga===
Jnana Yoga is a process of learning to discriminate between what is real and what is not, what is eternal and what is not. Through a steady advancement in realization of the distinction between Real and the Unreal, the Eternal and the Temporal, one develops into a ''Jnana Yogi''. This is essentially a path to God through knowledge and discrimination, and has been described as being the &quot;shortest, and steepest&quot; path to God - the most difficult one.

&quot;When he perceives the various states of being as resting in the One, and from That alone spreading out, then he attains Brahman. / They who know, through the eye of knowledge, the distinction between the field and the knower of the field, as well as the liberation of beings from material nature, go to the Supreme.&quot; [http://vedabase.net/bg/13/31].

===On Raja Yoga===
Raja Yoga is the stilling of the mind and body through meditating techniques, geared at realizing one's true nature. This practice was later described by [[Patanjali]] in his [[Yoga Sutras]].

&quot; Establishing a firm seat for himself in a clean place... having directed his mind to a single object, with his thought and the activity of the senses controlled, he should practice yoga for the purpose of self-realization. Holding the body, head and neck erect, motionless and steady, gazing at the tip of his own nose and not looking in any direction, with quieted mind, banishing fear, established in the brahmacharin vow of celibacy, controlling the mind, with thoughts fixed on Me, he should sit, concentrated, devoted to Me. Thus, continually disciplining himself, the yogin whose mind is subdued goes to nirvana, to supreme peace, to union with Me.&quot; [http://vedabase.net/bg/6/11]

==Influence of Bhagavad Gita==
In many ways seemingly a heterogeneous text, the Gita is a reconciliation of many facets and schools of Hindu philosophy of both Brahmanical (i.e., orthodox Vedic) origin, and the parallel ascetic and Yogic traditions. It comprises primarily Vedic (as in the four Vedas, as opposed to the Upanishads/Vedanta), Upanishadic, Sankhya and Yogic philosophies. It has stood the test of time, bringing together all four thought systems by taking their largely cohesive, common ideologies and backgrounds into the powerful [[Sanskrit]] verse of one text.

It had always been a creative text for Hindu priests and [[yogi|Yogis]]. Although not strictly part of the 'canon' of Vedic writings, almost all Hindu sects draw upon the Gita as authoritative. Some claim that it may have been inserted into the Mahabharata at a later date, but this is only natural as it sounds more like an Upanishad (which are commentaries that followed the Vedas) in thought than a Purana (histories), of which tradition the Mahabharata is a part.

For its religious depth, quintessential Upanishadic and Yogic philosophy and beauty of verse, the Bhagavad Gita is one of the most compelling and important texts of the Hindu tradition. It is one of the world's greatest religious and spiritual scriptures.

For the Vedantic schools of Hindu philosophy , it is one of the three foundation texts (Sanskrit: Prasthana Trayi, literally three points of departure)( the other two being the [[Upanishad]]s and [[Brahma Sutra]]s). Every such school is required to have a commentary on the three. The oldest available commentary is from [[Adi Shankara]] but he mentions older commentators. He is followed by classical commentators like Anandagiri, Shridhara Swami, Madhusudana Saraswati, [[Ramanuja]], [[Madhavacharya]], [[Nimbarka]], [[Vallabha]] and [[Dnyaneshwar]]. While the traditional text commented upon by many scholars including Adi Shankara and Ramanuja, consists of 700 verses, there exists a recension of the text from Kashmir with additional 15 verses. The renowned philosopher [[Abhinavagupta]](10-11th century CE) has written a commentary on this recension called Gitartha-Samgraha. Other ancient and medieval scholars (like [[Vedanta Desika]] in the Tatparya-Chandrika) seem to be aware of such additional verses but prefer to comment on the popular 700 verses.

Among the great sages and philosophers who have drawn inspiration from the Bhagavad Gita is Sri [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]], who initiated public singing of the &quot;Hare Krishna&quot; mantra.

American physicist and director of the Manhattan Project J. Robert Oppenheimer, upon witnessing the world's first atomic blast in 1945, is reported to have misquoted &quot;I have become Death, the shatterer of worlds,&quot; [12].

The dynamic [[Swami Vivekananda]], the follower of Sri [[Ramakrishna]] was known for his seminal commentaries on the four Yogas - Bhakti, Jnana, Karma and Raja Yoga. He drew from his knowledge of the Gita to expound on these Yogas. [[Swami Sivananda]] advises the aspiring Yogi to read verses from the Bhagavad Gita every day. [[Paramahamsa Yogananda]], writer of the famous &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;, viewed the Bhagavad Gita as one of the world's most divine scriptures, along with the ''Four Gospels of Jesus''.

[[Mahatma Gandhi]] derived great moral strength from Bhagavad gita, which is evident in his words:
:&quot;The Geeta is the universal mother. I find a solace in the Bhagavadgeeta that I miss even in the Sermon on the Mount. When disappointment stares me in the face and all alone I see not one ray of light, I go back to the Bhagavad Gita. I find a verse here and a verse there , and I immediately begin to smile in the midst of overwhelming tragedies - and my life has been full of external tragedies - and if they have left no visible or indelible scar on me, I owe iced was a bomb strike next to the despatch riders' entrance, shifting the whole of Hut 4 (the Naval Intelligence hut) two metres on its base. The bomb was thought to have been intended for [[Bletchley railway station]].

The first government visitors to Bletchley Park described themselves as members of ''Captain Ridley's shooting party''. The intelligence produced from decrypts at Bletchley was eventually code-named &quot;[[ULTRA]]&quot;.

When the United States joined the war, a small number of American cryptographers were posted to Bletchley Park.

==Cryptanalysis==

Among the famous [[mathematician]]s and [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]]s working there, perhaps the most influential and certainly the best-known in later years was [[Alan Turing]]. In 1943, the [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], the world's first programmable digital electronic computer, was designed at Bletchley Park by [[Max Newman]] and his team. The computer was designed and built to help break the [[FISH (cryptography)|Fish Cyphers]], in particular the [[Lorenz cipher]]. [[Tommy Flowers]] of the [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|British Post Office]], whose crew actually built the computer(s) at its [[Post Office Research Station|Dollis Hill]] facility.

Some 9,000 people were working at Bletchley Park at the height of the codebreaking efforts in January 1945&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1998, pp. 175-176&lt;/ref&gt;, and over 10,000 worked at some point during the war&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1998, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;. They were selected for various intellectual achievements{{fact}}, whether they were chess champions, crossword experts, polyglots or great mathematicians. Some of them completed a five-year course in Japanese in just six months{{fact}}.

The Bletchley Park effort was comparable in influence to other WWII-era technological efforts, such as the cryptographic work at [[Arlington Hall]], the [[Naval Communications Annex]] (both in Washington, DC, and both in commandeered private girls' schools), the development of sophisticated microwave [[radar]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s [[Radiation Lab]], and the [[Manhattan Project]]'s development of [[nuclear weapon]]s{{fact}}.

==After the war==

At the end of the war, much of the equipment used and its blueprints were destroyed. Although thousands of people were involved in the decoding efforts, the participants remained silent for decades about what they had done during the war, and it was only in the 1970s that the work at Bletchley Park was revealed to the general public. After the war, the site belonged to several owners, including [[British Telecom]], the Civil Aviation Authority&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art9678.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; and PACE ([[Property Advisors to the Civil Estate]]). The post-war successor organisation to GC&amp;CS, GCHQ, ended training courses at Bletchley Park in 1987.

By 1991, the site was nearly empty and the buildings were at risk of demolition to make room for property development. The Bletchley Park Trust was formed on [[13 February]] [[1992]] in order to further the maintenance of the site as a museum devoted to the codebreakers. The site opened to visitors in 1993, with the museum officially inaugurated in July 1994. The trust is volunteer-based and relies on public support to continue its efforts. The current director of the trust, Christine Large, was appointed in March 1998.

A team headed by Tony Sale has undertaken a reconstruction of a [[Colossus computer]] in H block&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/lorenz/rebuild.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;. Another team has undertaken a rebuild of the [[bombe]], led by John Harper&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jharper.demon.co.uk/bombe1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Image:Hut6.jpg|right|thumbnail|Hut 6 in 2004.]]
The huts were designated by numbers; in some cases, the hut numbers became associated as much with the work which went on inside the buildings as with the buildings themselves. Because of this, when a section moved from a hut into a larger building, they were still referred to by their &quot;Hut&quot; code name. 

Some of the hut numbers, and the associated work, are:

[[Image:Nuremberg Chronicle Venerable Bede.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Depiction of Bede from the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]], [[1493]].]]

'''Bede''' ([[Latin]] ''Beda''), also known as '''Saint Bede''' or, more commonly, the '''Venerable Bede''' (ca. [[672]] or [[673]] &amp;ndash; [[May 27]], [[735]]), was a [[monasticism|monk]] at the [[Northumbria]]n [[monastery]] of Saint Peter at [[Wearmouth]], today part of [[Sunderland]], and of its companion monastery, Saint Paul's, in modern [[Jarrow]].  He is well known as an author and scholar, whose best-known work, ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' (''The Ecclesiastical History of the English People'') gained him the title &quot;The father of [[History of England|English History]]&quot;. Bede wrote on many other topics, from [[music]] and [[meter (music)|metrics]] to [[Scripture]] commentaries.  

He is also the only Englishman in [[Dante]]'s [[Divine Comedy#Paradiso|Paradise]] and the only English [[Doctor of the Church]].

==Life==
Almost all that is known of life is contained in a notice added by himself to his ''Historia'' (v.24), which states that he was placed in the monastery at Wearmouth at the age of seven, that he became [[deacon]] in his nineteenth year, and [[priest]] in his thirtieth, remaining a priest for the rest of his life. It is not clear whether he was of [[nobility|noble birth]]. He was trained by the [[abbot|abbots]] [[Benedict Biscop]] and [[Ceolfrid]], and probably accompanied the latter to Jarrow in [[682]]. There he spent his life, finding his chief pleasure in being always occupied in learning, teaching, or writing, and zealous in the performance of monastic duties. There likewise he died and was buried, but his bones were, towards the beginning of the [[11th century]], removed to [[Durham Cathedral]]. 

Bede became known as ''Venerable Bede'' soon after his death, but this was not linked to consideration for [[Canonization|sainthood]] by the [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic Church]]. His scholarship and importance to Catholicism were recognised in [[1899]] when he was declared a [[Doctor of the Church]] as '''''St Bede The Venerable'''''.

==Work==
His works show that he had at his command all the learning of his time. It was thought that the library at Wearmouth-Jarrow was between 300-500 books, making it one of the largest in England. It is clear that Biscop made strenuous efforts to collect books on his extensive travels. Bede was proficient in [[Church father|patristic]] literature, and quotes [[Pliny the Younger]], [[Virgil]], [[Lucretius]], [[Ovid]], [[Horace]], and other [[classical antiquity|classical]] writers, but with some disapproval. He knew some [[Greek language|Greek]] but no [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. His [[Latin language|Latin]] is generally clear and without affectation, and he was a skillful story-teller. However, his style can be considerably more obscure in his Biblical commentaries.

Bede practiced the [[allegory|allegorical]] method of interpretation, and was by modern standards credulous concerning the miraculous; but in most things his good sense is conspicuous, and his kindly and broad sympathies, his love of truth and fairness, his unfeigned piety, and his devotion to the service of others combine to make him an exceedingly attractive character.

Bede's writings are classed as scientific, historical, and theological. The scientific include treatises on [[grammar]] (written for his pupils), a work on natural phenomena (''De rerum natura''), and two on [[chronology]] (''De temporibus'' and ''De temporum ratione''). Bede made a new calculation of the [[age of the earth]] and began the practice of dividing the Christian era into BC and AD. He has also been credited with adjusting the Gregorian calendar such that only one out of every four century-years are leap years ([http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:ixl8ttL2sGoJ:beakman.com/beakman/news/022700/022700.html+%22%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;strip=1 Google cache of source article]). Interestingly, Bede wrote that the Earth was round &quot;like a playground ball&quot;, contrasting that with being &quot;[[Flat earth|round like a shield]]&quot;.

===''Historia Ecclesiastica''===
The most important and best known of his works is the ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]],'' giving in five books and 400 pages the history of [[England]], ecclesiastical and political, from the time of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] to the date of its completion ([[731]]). The first twenty-one chapters, treating of the period before the mission of [[Augustine of Canterbury]], are compiled from earlier writers such as [[Orosius]], [[Gildas]], [[Prosper of Aquitaine]], the letters of [[Pope Gregory I]], and others, with the insertion of legends and traditions. 

After [[596]], documentary sources, which Bede took pains to obtain, are used, as well as oral testimony, which he employed with critical consideration of its value. He cited his references and was very concerned about the sources of all his sources, which created an important historical chain. He is credited with inventing [[footnote|footnoting]].  Due to his innovations like footnoting he was accused of heresy at the table of Bishop Wilfred, although the actual accusation was for miscalculating the age of the world, his chronology being contrary to the calculation of the time. The controversy is linked to footnoting because Bede cited another source in a note, rather than opining himself; others misunderstood the significance of citing another source.

===Other historical and theological works===
Circa the [[8th century|8th century AD]], he created a method of referring to years prior to the [[Christian era]] (''anno Domini''), which monk [[Dionysius Exiguus]] created in the [[6th century]]. He named it '''''Ante Christum Natum''''' (a.C.n.) and this was later translated to English as '''''Before Christ''''' (B.C.).

His re-editing of the [[Vulgate]] [[Bible]] was of immense importance, and was the official version of the Bible for the whole of Western Christendom until the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and was used by the [[Catholic]] church until [[1966]]. 

[[Image:Venbedes.jpg|frame|&quot;The Venerable Bede Translates John&quot; by J. D. Penrose]]

Rather than copying from any one source, he researched from several sources to create single volume bibles, a practice which was highly unusual for the time: previously, the Bible had circulated as separate books. Arguably this work of Bede has had a much greater and wider influence than his ''History of the English People''. He also worked on translations of parts of the Bible into [[Old English language|Old English]], although unfortunately these have not survived.

His other historical works included lives of the abbots of Wearmouth and Jarrow, as well as lives in verse and prose of [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|St. Cuthbert of Lindisfarne]]. The most numerous of his writings are theological, and consist of commentaries on the books of the Old and New Testaments, homilies, and treatises on detached portions of Scripture.

His last works, completed on his deathbed, were a translation into Old English of the [[Gospel of John]], and, perhaps, a [[#Vernacular poetry|vernacular poem]] on the [[Last Judgment|final judgment]].

===Vernacular poetry===
According to his disciple Cuthbert, Bede was also ''doctus in nostris carminibus'' (&quot;learned in our song&quot;). Cuthbert's letter on Bede's death, the ''Epistola Cuthberti de obitu Bedae'', moreover, commonly is understood to indicate that Bede also composed a five line vernacular poem known to modern scholars as ''Bede’s Death Song'' (text and translation [[#colgraveandmynors1969|Colgrave and Mynors 1969]]):

:Canebat autem sententiam sancti Pauli apostoli dicentis “Horrendum est incidere in manus Dei uiuentis,” et multa alia de sancta scriptura, in quibus nos a somno animae exurgere praecogitando ultimam horam admonebat. In nostra quoque lingua, ut erat doctus in nostris carminibus, dicens de terribili exitu animarum e corpore:
::Fore ðæm nedfere      nænig wiorðe
::ðonc snottora      ðon him ðearf siæ
::to ymbhycgenne      ær his hinionge
::hwæt his gastæ      godes oððe yfles
::æfter deað dæge      doemed wiorðe.

:And he used to repeat that sentence from [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] “It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God,” and many other verses of Scripture, urging us thereby to awake from the slumber of the soul by thinking in good time of our last hour. And in our own language,&amp;mdash;for he was familiar with English poetry,&amp;mdash;speaking of the soul’s dread departure from the body:
::Facing that enforced journey, no man can be
::More prudent than he has good call to be,
::If he consider, before his going hence,
::What for his spirit of good hap or of evil 
::After his day of death shall be determined.

As [[Opland]] notes, however, it is not entirely clear that Cuthbert is attributing this text to Bede: most manuscripts of the letter do not use a finite verb to describe Bede’s presentation of the song, and the theme was relatively common in Old English and Anglo-Latin literature. The fact that Cuthbert’s description places the performance of the Old English poem in the context of a series of quoted passages from Sacred Scripture, indeed, might be taken as evidence simply that Bede also cited analogous vernacular texts (see [[#opland1980|Opland 1980]], 140-141). On the other hand, the inclusion of the Old English text of the poem in Cuthbert’s Latin letter, the observation that Bede “was learned in our song,” and the fact that Bede composed a Latin poem on the same subject all seem to suggest that his connection to the vernacular poem was stronger than mere quotation. By citing the poem directly, Cuthbert seems to be implying that its specific wording was in some way important, either as a vernacular poem endorsed by a scholar who generally appears to have frowned upon secular entertainment (see [[#mccready1994|McCready 1994]], esp. 14-19) or as a direct quotation of Bede’s final original composition (see [[#opland1980|Opland 1980]], 140-141, for a discussion of some of the implications of this passage).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Boston tea party.jpg|thumb|300px|This 1846 lithograph has become a classic image of the Boston Tea Party.]]
The '''Boston Tea Party''' was a protest by the [[Colonists]] against [[Great Britain]] in which they destroyed many crates of [[tea]] on ships in [[Boston Harbor]].  The incident, which took place on [[December 16|16 December]] [[1773]], has been seen as helping to spark the [[American Revolution]].

==Background==
The [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] of [[1765]] and the [[Townshend Acts]] of [[1767]] angered colonists regarding British decisions on taxing the colonies with no representation in the Westminster Parliament (&quot;no taxation without representation&quot;). One of the protesters was [[John Hancock]]. In [[1768]], his ship ''Liberty'' was seized by customs officials and he was charged with smuggling. He was defended by [[John Adams]] and the charges were eventually dropped. However, Hancock later faced several hundred more indictments.  

Hancock organized a boycott of tea from [[China]] sold by the [[British East India Company]], whose sales in the colonies then fell from 320,000lb to 520lb. By [[1773]], the company had large debts, huge stocks of tea in its warehouses and no prospect of selling it becauash;16,000 tons, a speed of 13&amp;ndash;18 [[knot (speed)|knot]]s, and an armament of four &quot;big guns&quot;, usually 12&quot; (305mm) in bore diameter, in two centreline turrets, fore and aft, plus a heavy intermediate battery of typically eight 8&quot; guns carried in double turrets on the superstructure corners, and a secondary battery of smaller guns.  The 12&quot; mains and 8&quot; intermediates were generally used for battleship to battleship combat, while the secondaries (typically 7&quot; to 5&quot;) were reserved for smaller threats, [[cruiser]]s and the new [[destroyer]]s.  A small number of designs, including the American [[Kearsarge class battleship|''Kearsarge'']] and [[Virginia class battleship|''Virginia'']] classes, experimented with all or part of the 8&quot; intermediate battery superimposed over the 12&quot; primary, with less than stellar results (nearly universally, recoil factors resulted in the 8&quot; battery being completely unusable).  Turrets, armour plate, and steam engines were all improved over the years, and [[torpedo]] tubes were introduced. However, events in 1906 sparked off another naval arms race.

===&quot;All-big-guns&quot;===
In [[1905]] the [[Russia]]n Navy was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Tsushima]] by the modern [[Japan]]ese Navy, which was equipped with the latest battleships.  The events of the battle revealed to the world that only the biggest guns mattered in modern naval battles.  As secondary guns grew in size, spotting gun splashes (and aiming) between main and secondary guns became problematic.  The Battle of Tsushima demonstrates that damage from the main guns was much greater than secondary guns.  In addition, the battle demonstrated the practicability of gun battles beyond the range of secondary guns (12,000 yards).

[[Image:IJN Satsuma.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy|IJN]]'s [[Japanese battleship Satsuma|''Satsuma'']], the first ship to be designed and laid down as an &quot;all-big-gun&quot; battleship]]

The United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom all realized this and launched plans for all-big-gun ships. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s ''[[Japanese battleship Satsuma|Satsuma]]'' was the first battleship in the world to be designed and laid down as an all-big-gun battleship, although gun shortages only allowed her to be equipped with four of the twelve 12-in guns that had been planned.

The United Kingdom, led by the efforts of the [[First Sea Lord]] (head of the [[Admiralty]]), [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]], took the lead and completed [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|''Dreadnought'']] in only 11 months. ''Dreadnought'' carried ten 12-inch guns in 5 turrets, and was powered not by reciprocating engines, but by revolutionary (for large ships) [[steam turbines]].  Previous ships powered by reciprocating steam engines were, in practice, limited by engine vibration to 18 knots. Even at that speed vibration limited aiming ability and the engines wore out quickly. ''Dreadnought'' had a top speed of 21 knots. It was the first of the new breed of &quot;all-big-gun&quot; battleships.  Major naval powers raced to build their own dreadnoughts to avoid being overtaken by the United Kingdom.  The Royal Navy, labouring under the expectation that it should be able to match any two of its competitors combined, began demanding increasingly unaffordable sums from the government for dreadnought construction.  The government, already burdened with financial crises caused by the [[Second Boer War]] and a voting population demanding more government expenditure on welfare and public works, could not afford to squander precious money on even more dreadnoughts, allowing rival navies (particularly the [[Kaiserliche Marine]]) to catch up with the United Kingdom's battleship forces.  Even after ''Dreadnought'''s commission, battleships continued to grow in size, guns, and technical proficiency as countries vied to have the best ships.  By [[1914]] ''Dreadnought'' was outmoded. This expensive arms race would not end until the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of [[1922]]. This treaty limited the number and size of battleships that each major nation could possess.

[[Image:HMS_Dreadnought_1906_H63367.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|HMS ''Dreadnought'']]

With advances in [[gun laying]] and aiming, engagement ranges had increased from 1000 yards or less to 6000 yards or more over the previous few years, in part as a consequence of the devastating, but short-ranged firepower of the recently invented [[torpedo]].  This had caused a move away from mixed calibre armament, as each calibre required a different aiming calibration, something which unnecessarily complicated gunnery techniques.  At longer ranges, the higher maximum rate of fire of the smaller calibres was negated by the need to wait for shell splashes before firing the next salvo and the determination of those from the other calibres. This negated the advantage of small-calibre guns; heavier weapons were effectively as fast and packed a much greater punch.

The French navy solved the problem of identifying the results of individual ships in a clever way; each ship added color to its shells.{{fact}} Other nations adopted this measure as well.

Partially as a consequence of this new philosophy, and partially as a consequence of its powerful new turbine engine, ''Dreadnought'' dispensed completely with the smaller calibre secondary armament carried by her immediate predecessors, allowing her to carry more heavy calibre guns than any other battleship built up to that time. She carried ten 12-inch guns mounted in five turrets; three along the centreline (one forward and two aft) and two on the wings, giving her twice the broadside of anything else afloat.  The first large warship equipped with [[steam turbine]]s, she could make 21 [[knot (speed)|knots]] in a calm sea, allowing her to outrun existing battleships (with a typical speed of 18 kts).  Her armour was strong enough that she could conceivably go head-to-head with any other ship afloat in a gun battle and win.

Although there were some problems with the ship &amp;mdash; the design's [[wing turrets]] strained the hull when firing broadsides, and the top of the thickest armour belt lay below the waterline when the ship was fully loaded &amp;mdash; ''Dreadnought'' was so revolutionary that battleships built before her were afterward known as &quot;pre-Dreadnoughts&quot;, and those following as &quot;Dreadnoughts&quot;. Vessels built within a few years that were bigger and mounted more powerful guns were referred to as &quot;Superdreadnoughts&quot;.  In a stroke, ''Dreadnought'' had made all existing battleships obsolete; including those of the Royal Navy, which embarked on a programme of building ever-more-powerful Dreadnought designs.

National pride in the early 20th Century was largely based on how many of these ships a navy had, and details were published in the newspapers for the public to avidly follow; the naval arms race which ''Dreadnought'' sparked, especially between the United Kingdom and the young German empire, was to create powerful shockwaves.  Whereas Germany before the commissioning of ''Dreadnought'' had been behind the British Empire by more than twenty battleships of the highest class, they were now behind by only one.

''Dreadnought'' was powered with steam turbines, which enabled her to sustain a higher maximum speed for longer, and with less maintenance than her [[triple-expansion engine]] powered predecessors.  Being more compact, the turbines also allowed for a lower hull, which had the side-effect of reducing the amount of armour the ship had to carry. Although turbines had been used in [[destroyer]]s for some years previously, ''Dreadnought'' was the first large warship to use them.  As a consequence of the turbines, ''Dreadnought'' was actually slightly cheaper than the previous [[Lord Nelson class battleship|''Lord Nelson'' class]] of pre-Dreadnoughts. 

The American [[South Carolina class battleship|''South Carolina'' class]] battleships were begun before ''Dreadnought'', and had most of her features, except for the steam turbines; however, their final design was not completed before ''Dreadnought,'' and their construction took much longer. Smaller than ''Dreadnought'' at 16,000 tons standard displacement, they carried eight 12 inch guns in four twin turrets arranged in superfiring pairs fore and aft along the centreline of the keel.  This arrangement gave ''South Carolina'' and her sister ''Michigan'' a broadside equal to ''Dreadnought's'' without requiring the cumbersome [[wing turrets]] that were a feature of the first few British dreadnought classes.

===The superdreadnought===
[[Image:2nd Battle Squadron.jpg|thumb|300px|''Orion''-class battleships in line]]

The arrival of superdreadnoughts is not as clearly identified with a single ship in the same way that the dreadnought era was initiated by HMS ''Dreadnought''.  However, it is commonly held to start with the British [[Orion class battleship|''Orion'' class]], and for the German navy with the [[König class battleship|''König'']]s.

The ''Orions'' were just one step in a breathtakingly rapid evolution that ''Dreadnought'' had initiated.  What made them &quot;super&quot; was the unprecedented jump in displacement of 2,000 tons over the previous class, the introduction of the heavier 13.5&amp;nbsp;inch (343&amp;nbsp;mm) gun, and the distribution of all the main armament on the centreline of the keel .  Thus, in the four years that separated the laying down of ''Dreadnought'' and [[HMS Orion (1910)|''Orion'']], displacement had increased by 25%, and weight of broadside had doubled.

Superdreadnoughts also incorporated, during construction, the latest technical gunnery advances. Thus they received director control, designed from the outset with larger observation positions with range finders and electrical repeaters aloft, mechanical calculators and predictors in protected positions below, and very advanced alignment and correction devices for the guns.

The design weakness of super dreadnoughts, which distinguished them from post-Great War designs, was armour disposition.  Their design placed emphasis on vertical protection which was needed in short range battles.  These ships were capable of engaging the enemy  at 20,000 metres, but were vulnerable to the angle of fire that came at such ranges.  Post-war designs typically had 5 to 6 inches of deck armour to defend against this dangerous, plunging fire.  Lack of underwater protection was also a weakness of these pre-World War I designs which were devleoped only as the threat of the torpedo became real.

The superdreadnoughts that were built had been surpasssed by designs developed during the Great War. Any remaining that served in World War II had all either received extensive modifications, or were a source of extreme anxiety because of their vulnerability to more modern battleships, or both.

==World War I==
[[Image:British Grand Fleet 2.jpg|thumb|300px|British Grand Fleet during WWI]]

A naval [[arms race]] had been ongoing between [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]] since the [[1890]]s.  The building of ''Dreadnought'' actually helped Germany in this, as instead of having a lead of 15 or so ships of the latest type, the United Kingdom now had a lead of just one.  Furthermore, the United Kingdom 's policy of maintaining a navy larger than the world's second and third largest navies combined was becoming unsustainably expensive.  All other battleship navies switched over in the next few years to building Dreadnought-type ships as well.

At this point in time, the [[Royal Navy]] of the United Kingdom had ruled the seas for several centuries, but the German emperor [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] and his naval minister, [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], set out to change that, in part for strategic reasons, but mainly due to a simple desire to challenge the United Kingdom.  The culmination of this race led to a stalemate in [[World War I]].  The [[High Seas Fleet|German High Seas Fleet]] and the [[British Grand Fleet]] were too valuable to be risked in battle and so both spent the majority of the war in port, waiting to respond should the other go to sea.  Paradoxically, the ships were too valuable (strategically, at least) to leave at port, and too expensive to use in battle. Apart from some operations in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] against Russia, Germany's main fleet limited itself to making battlecruiser raids on the British east coast, in an attempt to lure part of the British fleet out so that it could be defeated by the waiting High Seas Fleet. In their turn, the British made sweeps of the [[North Sea]], and both sides laid extensive [[Naval mine|minefield]]s.  Although there were several naval battles, the only engagement between the main British and German fleets was the abortive [[Battle of Jutland]], a German tactical victory of sorts (fourteen British ships were sunk to eleven German, although the High Seas Fleet fled the field) but a British strategic victory, as although the German fleet was not destroyed it took longer to come back to operational status than the British and mostly remained in port for the rest of the war.

After World War I, the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice with Germany]] required that most of the High Seas Fleet be interned at [[Scapa Flow]], [[Scotland]].  Most of these ships were subsequently [[Scuttling|scuttled]] by their German crews on [[21 June]] [[1919]] just before the formal surrender of Germany.  As far as the German sailors were concerned, they were undefeated; it was felt that their ships should not fall into the hands of the British.

==World War II==
[[Image:Yamatotrials.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']] and her sister ship [[Japanese battleship Musashi|''Musashi'']] were the largest battleships in history. (1941)]]

With the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of [[1922]], the major navies of the world scaled back their battleship programs, with numerous ships on all sides scrapped or re-purposed. With extensions, that treaty lasted until [[1936]], when the major navies of the world began a new arms race.  Famous ships like [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']], [[HMS Prince of Wales (1939)|''Prince of Wales'']] and [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']] were all launched in the next few years.  During the conflict naval warfare evolved quickly and battleships lost their position as the principal ships of the fleet.  Most new-build World War II battleships had similar layouts, typically equipped with three triple turrets of 14&quot; to 16&quot; caliber (18.1&quot; in the mighty ''Yamatos'') in a &quot;2-A-1&quot; layout, and the superstructure flanked with secondary guns of 4-6&quot; caliber.  The big guns of ''Yamato'' were intended to outmatch any armor in the world, even the sophisticated and tough armor of the American and British battleships, but in practice they were no more powerful than the 16&quot; guns of the American WW2 battlewagons.

In the early stages of the [[Second Battle of the Atlantic|battle of the Atlantic]], Germany's surface units threatened the Atlantic convoys supplying the United Kingdom, so the British surface units devoted themselves to protecting the convoys, and seeking out and trying to destroy the German ships, as well as lying in wait at Scapa Flow.  The German battleship raiders recorded early successes, with [[German battlecruiser Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] and [[German battlecruiser Gneisenau|''Gneisenau'']] surprising and sinking the aircraft carrier [[HMS Glorious|HMS ''Glorious'']] off western Norway in June [[1940]].  A subsequent cruise in the North Atlantic netted the ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' 22 ships.  On [[24 May]] 1941 during an attempt to break out into the North Atlantic, ''Bismarck'' sank the [[battlecruiser]] [[HMS Hood (1918)|HMS ''Hood'']].  The Royal Navy hunted down ''Bismarck''; an attack by [[Fairey Swordfish|Swordfish]] biplanes torpedo-bombers from the [[aircraft carrier]] [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|''Ark Royal'']] disabled her steering and allowing the British heavy units to catch up.  Instead of further attacks by aircraft, on Monday [[27 May]] the Royal Navy's battleships [[HMS King George V (1939)|''King George V'']] and [[HMS Rodney (1925)|''Rodney'']] with 2 cruisers and a number of destroyers engaged her with guns and torpedoes.  In an eighty-eight minute battle, the ''Bismarck'' was reduced to a floating hulk and then sank after her crew set off scuttling charges.

Battleships were also involved in the battle for control the Mediterranean.  At the [[Battle of Taranto]] in November 1940, Swordfish aeroplanes from [[HMS Illustrious (R87)|HMS ''Illustrious'']] attacked the Italian fleet at their base at Taranto.  For the loss of two aircraft, the Royal Navy effectively sank one battleship and disabled two others.  The success of this raid inspired the Japanese plan to attack [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] which entered the planning stage three months later.  At the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]], [[27 March|27]]&amp;ndash;[[29 March]] 1941, three Italian heavy cruisers were surprised and destroyed in a brief battle with British battleships force near Crete.  However, technology was overtaking the battleship.  A battleship's big guns might have a range of thirty miles, but the [[aircraft carrier]] had aircraft with ranges of several hundred miles, and [[radar]] was making those attacks ever more effective.  ''Bismarck'' was crippled by obsolete [[Fairey Swordfish|Swordfish]] torpedo bombers from [[HMS Victorious (R38)|''Victorious'']] and [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|''Ark Royal'']].  The Soviet dreadnought [[Soviet battleship Petropavlovsk|''Petropavlovsk'']] and Italian [[Italian battleship Roma (1940)|''Roma'']] were sunk by German air attacks.  The British battleship [[HMS Prince of Wales (1939)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']] and her battlecruiser consort [[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS ''Repulse'']] were sunk by [[Mitsubishi G4M|Japanese torpedo bombers]] while operating in the defence of Malaya (Malaysia and Singapore).  ''Prince of Wales'' became the first battleship to be sunk by aircraft while able to defend itself in open water.

[[D-Day]] saw battleships in the role of coastal bombardment in support of an amphibious landing on a hostile, fortified shore . Several older battlewagons came into their own, not only knocking out coastal guns which threatened transports and landing craft, but also hitting troop and tank concentrations, and railway marshalling yards.  [[HMS Ramillies (1916)|HMS ''Ramillies'']] fired 1,002 15&quot; shells at shore targets as well as driving off German aircraft, [[E Boat]] and [[destroyer]] attacks.

The Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941 sank or damaged most of the U.S. Pacific Fleet's battleships, but the three aircraft carriers were not in port and so escaped damage. Six months later, it was those carriers that were to turn the tide of the Pacific War at the [[battle of Midway]].  As the war progressed, battleships became festooned with anti-aircraft weapons such as the [[Bofors 40 mm gun|40mm Bofors gun]].  Nonetheless, the advent of air power spelled doom for the battleship.
[[Image:Pennsylvania Lingayen.jpg|thumb|300px|[[USS Pennsylvania (BB-38)|''Pennsylvania'']] leading [[USS Colorado (BB-45)|''Colorado'']], [[USS Louisville (CA-28)|''Louisville'']], [[USS Portland (CA-33)|''Portland'']], and [[USS Columbia (CL-56)|''Columbia'']] into [[Lingayen Gulf]], [[Philippines]], January [[1945]].]]

Battleships in the Pacific ended up primarily performing shore bombardment and anti-aircraft defense for the carriers.  The largest battleships ever constructed, Japan's ''Yamato'' and [[Japanese battleship Musashi|''Musashi'']], were sunk by aircraft attacks long before they could come within striking range of the American fleet.  The last active German battleship, [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']], had lurked until late into the war in Norwegian fjords protected by anti-submarine defences and shore based anti-aircraft guns.  A daring attempt by Britsh mini-subs to sink her covertly failed, but it was still finally damaged there and sunk by [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] aircraft using [[Tallboy bomb]]s.

&lt;!--subs weren't a threat--&gt;

The second half of World War II saw the last battleship duels. [[USS Massachusetts (BB-59)|''Massachusetts'']] fought Vichy French battleship [[Jean Bart (1949-1961)|Jean Bart]] on [[27 October]],[[1942]].  In the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal|Battle of Guadalcanal]] on [[November 15]] [[1942]], the United States battleships [[USS South Dakota (BB-57)|''South Dakota'']] and [[USS Washington (BB-56)|''Washington'']] fought and destroyed the Japanese battleship [[Japanese battleship Kirishima|''Kirishima'']].  In the [[Battle of North Cape]], on [[26 December]] [[1943]], [[HMS Duke of York (1940)|HMS ''Duke of York'']] and destroyers sank the German ''Scharnhorst'' off [[Norway]].  And in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] on [[25 October]] [[1944]] six battleships, led by admiral [[Jesse Oldendorf]] of the US 7th Fleet sank the Japanese admiral [[Shoji Nishimura]]'s battleships [[Japanese battleship Yamashiro|''Yamashiro'']] and [[Japanese battleship Fuso|''Fuso'']] during the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]].

Nevertheless, the [[Battle of Samar]] on [[25 October]] [[1944]] during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] proved that battleships still were a lethal weapon.  Only the indecision of Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]] saved the American aircraft carriers of &quot;Taffy 3&quot; from being pounded to the bottom by gunfire of [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']], [[Japanese battleship Kongo|''Kongo'']] and [[Japanese battleship Nagato|''Nagato'']] and their cruiser host. Miraculously, only [[USS Gambier Bay|''Gambier Bay'']] and four destroyers were lost due to surface action.

As a result of the changing technology, plans for even larger battleships, the American [[Montana class battleship|''Montana'' class]] and Japanese [[Super Yamato class|&quot;Super ''Yamato''&quot; class]], were cancelled.  At the end of the war, almost all the world's battleships were decommissioned or scrapped. It is notable that most battleship losses occurred while in port. No battleship was lost to heavy bombers on the open seas, which was considered the most grave aerial peril to battleships prior to WWII due to [[Billy Mitchell]] and the [[SMS Ostfriesland|''Ostfriesland'']] experiment.  The [[Italian battleship Roma (1940)|''Roma'']] was sunk by a [[Precision-guided munition|guided bomb]], a [[Fritz X]], while underway to surrender.  Instead, the true aerial peril to battleships came from small, one to three-man [[dive bomber]]s and [[torpedo bomber]]s like the [[SBD Dauntless]] and [[TBF Avenger]].

==Post World War II==
After World War II, several navies retained battleships, but they were now outclassed by carriers. The Italian [[Italian battleship Giulio Cesare|''Giulio Cesare'']] was taken by the Soviets as reparations and renamed ''Novorossiysk''; it was sunk by a German mine in the Black Sea [[29 October]] [[1955]].  The two [[Doria class battleship|''Doria'' class]] ships were scrapped in the late 1950s.  The French [[French battleship Lorraine|''Lorraine'']] was scrapped in 1954, [[French battleship Richelieu|''Richelieu'']] in 1964 and [[French battleship Jean Bart|''Jean Bart'']] in 1970.  The United Kingdom's four surviving [[King George V class battleship (1939)|''King George V'' class]] ships were scrapped towards the end of the 1950s, and [[HMS Vanguard (1944)|''Vanguard'']] followed around 1960.  All other surviving British battleships had been scrapped in the late 1940s.  The Soviet Union's ''Petropavlovsk'' was scrapped in 1953, [[Soviet battleship Sevastopol|''Sevastopol'']] in 1957 and [[Soviet battleship Gangut|''Gangut'']] in 1959, Brazil's [[Brazilian battleship Minas Gerais|''Minas Gerais'']] was scrapped in 1954 (sister ship [[Brazilian battleship Sao Paulo|''Sao Paulo'']] sank en route to the breakers during a storm in 1951), [[Argentina]] kept its two [[Rivadavia class battleship|''Rivadavia'' class]] ships until 1956, Chile kept ''Almirante Latorre'' (formerly HMS ''Canada'') until 1959, and the Turkish battlecruiser ''Yavuz'' (formerly the German [[SMS Goeben|''Goeben'']], launched in 1911) was scrapped in 1976 after an offer to sell it back to Germany was refused.  Sweden had several small coastal defense battleships, one of which, ''Gustav V'', survived until 1970.  The Russians also scrapped four large incomplete cruisers in the late 1950s, whilst plans to build new battleships were abandoned following the death of Stalin in 1953.  There were also some old sailing battleships still used as housing ships or storage depots.  Of these, all but HMS ''Victory'' were sunk or scrapped by 1957.

[[Image:Missouri missile.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] launches a [[Tomahawk missile]].]]

The battleships gained a new lease of life in the U.S. Navy as fire support ships.  Shipborne artillery support is considered by U.S. Marine Corps as more accurate, more effective and less expensive than aerial strikes.  Radar and computer controlled gunfire can be aimed with pinpoint accuracy to target.  The United States recommissioned all four [[Iowa class battleship|''Iowa'' class]] battleships for the [[Korean War]] and [[USS New Jersey (BB-62)|''New Jersey'']] for the [[Vietnam War]].  These were primarily used for shore bombardment. As part of [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[John F. Lehman]]'s effort to build a [[600-ship Navy]], and in response to the commissioning of ''Kirov'' by the Soviet Union the United States recommissioned all four ''Iowa'' class battleships.  These were modernized to carry [[Tomahawk missile]]s, with ''New Jersey'' seeing action bombarding [[Lebanon]], while [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|''Missouri'']] and [[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)|''Wisconsin'']] fired their 16-inch (406&amp;nbsp;mm) guns at land targets and launched missiles in the [[Gulf War]] of 1991.  ''Wisconsin'' served as the TLAM strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of [[Operation Desert Storm]] and firing a total of 24 TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign.  This will most likely be the last combat action ever by a battleship.

All four ''Iowas'' were decommissioned in the early [[1990s]], making them the last battleships to see active service.  ''Missouri'', and ''New Jersey'' are now museums at [[Pearl Harbor]] and [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden, N.J.]] respectively.  ''Wisconsin'' also functions as a museum (at [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk, Va.]]), but is still on the [[Naval Vessel Register|NVR]], and the public can only tour the deck, with the rest of ship closed off.  [[USS Iowa (BB-61)|''Iowa'']] (at [[Suisun Bay]]) and ''Wisconsin'' are in the [[United States Navy reserve fleets|Naval Reserve Fleet]], and could be re-activated.

From the late 1970s onwards, the [[Soviet Union]] (later Russia) built four large nuclear-powered [[Kirov class battlecruiser|''Kirov'' class]] missile cruisers (''Raketny Kreyser'' (Rocket Cruiser)), one of which is still operational [[as of 2005]].  Their introduction had been one of the factors leading to the reactivation of the four ''Iowas''.  The ships, while comparatively big for a cruiser, are not battleships in the traditional sense; they adhere to the design premise of a large missile [[cruiser]] and lack traditional battleship traits such as heavy armor and significant shore bombardment capability.  For example, at ~26,000 tons displacement they are near double the [[Krasina class cruiser|''Krasina'' class]] missile cruisers (~11,000 tons), but half the ''Iowa'' class (~55,000 tons).

Battleships still in existence as museums include the American [[USS Massachusetts|USS ''Massachusetts'']], [[USS North Carolina (BB-55)|''North Carolina'']], [[USS Alabama (BB-60)|''Alabama'']] and [[USS Texas (BB-35)|''Texas'']], the British [[Mary Rose|HMS ''Mary Rose'']], [[HMS Victory|''Victory'']] and [[HMS Warrior (1860)|''Warrior'']], the Japanese [[Japanese battleship Mikasa|''Mikasa'']], the Swedish [[Regalskeppet Vasa|''Vasa'']], the Dutch [[HNLMS Buffel|''Buffel'']] and [[HNLMS Schorpioen|''Schorpioen'']], and the Chilean [[Huáscar (ship)|''Huascar'']]. (See [[:Category:Museum ships]] for other museum ships).

USS ''Iowa'' and USS ''Wisconsin'' are maintained in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act of [[1996]], which includes the following battleship readiness requirements:

# List and maintain at least two ''Iowa'' class battleships on the Naval Vessel Register that are in good condition and able to provide adequate fire support for an amphibious assault;
# Retain the existing logistical support necessary to keep at least two ''Iowa''-class battleships in active service, including technical manuals, repair and replacement parts, and ordnance; and
# Keep the two battleships on the register until the Navy certified that it has within the fleet an operational surface fire support capability that equals or exceeds the fire support capability that the ''Iowa''-class battleships would be able to provide for the Marine Corps' amphibious assaults and operations ashore. (Section 1011) [http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/bb-61.htm Source]

Current plans in the United States Navy call for keeping ''Iowa'' and ''Wisconsin'' on the register until the naval surface fire support gun and missile development programs achieve operational capability, which is expected to occur sometime between [[2003]] and [[2008]].  If and when ''Iowa'' and ''Wisconsin'' are removed from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] there is a high probabilty that interest groups will request that they be placed on donation hold and transferred for use as museums.

The longterm plan to remove ''Iowa'' and ''Wisconsin'' and donate them as museum ships is not without controversy; the [[United States Marine Corps]] has fought to get both battleships reinstated.  The USMC believes that the naval surface fire support gun and missile programs will not be able to provide adequate fire support for an amphibious assault or onshore operations; additionally, the USMC does not think that the Navy's [[DD(X)]] destroyer program will be an acceptable replacement for the battleships, and points out that the DD(X) will not be available until 2013 in any event.

Refurbishing ''Iowa'' and ''Wisconsin'' has been priced at either $430 million for a 14-month program or $500 million for a 10-month program.

==Fictional appearances==
The term &quot;battleship&quot; often makes an appearance in military-oriented [[science fiction]], where they often occupy a role similar to their historical one.  It should be noted that some writers have come to believe &quot;battleship&quot; is synonymous with &quot;[[warship]]&quot;, and thus we see strange classifications like &quot;light battleship&quot; or &quot;small battleship&quot;.  Sometimes the futuristic battleships are large [[Starship|starships]] operating in outer space, rather than the open ocean.

Like [[Aircraft Carriers in Fiction|aircraft carriers]], conventional ocean-going battleships both fictional and real have also made frequent appearances in fictionalized accounts.

:Then said Gangleri: &quot;What is the way to heaven from earth?&quot;

:Then Hárr answered, and laughed aloud: &quot;Now, that is not wisely asked; has it not been told thee, that the gods made a bridge from earth to heaven, called Bifröst? Thou must have seen it; it may be that ye call it 'rainbow.' It is of three colors, and very strong, and made with cunning and with more magic art than other works of craftsmanship. But strong as it is, yet must it be broken, when the sons of Múspell shall go forth harrying and ride it, and swim their horses over great rivers; thus they shall proceed.&quot; 

:Then said Gangleri: &quot;To my thinking the gods did not build the bridge honestly, seeing that it could be broken, and they able to make it as they would.&quot; 

:Then Hárr replied : &quot;The gods are not deserving of reproof because of this work of skill: a good bridge is Bifröst, but nothing in this world is of such nature that it may be relied on when the sons of Múspell go a-harrying.&quot; - [http://www.northvegr.org/lore/prose/021024.php Brodeur's translation]

'''Battlecruisers''' were large [[warships]] of the first half of the [[20th century]]. They evolved from [[armored cruiser]]s and in terms of ship classification they occupy a grey area between [[cruiser]]s and [[battleship]]s. Generally, battlecruisers were similar in layout and armament to battleships but with significantly less armour allowing for gains in speed. However, different nations built to widely different designs. Some battlecruisers were smaller than battleships while others were larger than contemporaneous battleships. The chief similarity was the role specification. They were designed to hunt down and outgun smaller warships (or merchant ships in the case of the [[pocket battleship]]s), and outrun larger warships that they could not outgun. Battlecruisers became obsolete in World War 2 as advances in design and technology allowed ''fast battleships'' to be developed, which combined or even exceeded the best features of World War 1 ''battlecruisers'' and ''slow battleships''.  

Originally, to achieve this, they deviated from the standard practice of providing a ship with sufficient armour to protect against its own guns. The weight saving from the reduced armour allowed more powerful engines to be fitted. This idea was mainly conceived by British [[Admiral]] [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]] who believed &quot;speed is the best protection&quot;. Fisher's idea centred on battlecruisers operating with the fleet, the intention being that they would hunt down enemy cruiser squadrons and evade the battleships. However, as technology developed, design philosophy changed and led to the upgrade or creation of a more heavily armoured class with less powerful guns. They were given different labels, but essentially performed the same task.

==First battlecruisers==
[[Image:Inv.jpg|thumb|250px|[[HMS Invincible (1908)|HMS ''Invincible'']], one of Britain's first battlecruisers]]

The first battlecruisers came from the [[Royal Navy]]. The same committee, instigated by Jackie Fisher, that produced the ''Dreadnought'' had been charged with the design of a new armoured cruiser.  Compared to the most recent of the RN's cruisers they were quite different. They had 12 inch guns instead of 9.2, a displacement similar to ''Dreadnought'' but twice the power to give 25 knots. These were [[HMS Inflexible (1908)|''Inflexible'']], [[HMS Invincible (1908)|''Invincible'']] and [[HMS Indomitable (1907)|''Indomitable'']], all completed in [[1908]]. They achieved speed at the expense of protection. They had armour 6 or 7 inches (150 to 180 mm) thick along the side of the hull and over the gunhouses, whereas a comparable battleship of the period had armour 11 or 12 inches (280 to 300 mm) thick. Originally thought of as simply a new type of [[armored cruiser]] (their armour was the same as that of the older armoured cruisers'), they were then designated &quot;dreadnought cruisers&quot;. A tendency to think of them as somehow partially equal to a battleship led to the unofficial title &quot;battleship cruisers&quot; which led to ''battlecruisers'' in 1912. These early ships had a top speed of 26 knots (48 km/h) compared to 20 to 21 knots (37 to 39&amp;nbsp;km/h) for contemporary battleships. They were armed with 11&amp;nbsp;in (German) or 12 in (British) (281 or 305 mm) guns, just like battleships. Soon after the British, the Germans started building their own battlecruisers, starting with [[SMS Von der Tann|''Von der Tann'']] of [[1911]]. ''Von der Tann'' and most later German battlecruisers had 280 mm (11 in) guns, which were reckoned to be the equivlent to the British 12-inchers. They benefitted from the wider dockyards that they were built in. This allowed them to be built with a broader beam than the British ships giving rise to better protection in terms of both armour and internal layout than the British battlecruisers.

During the course of the First World War Fisher had a plan for operations in the [[Baltic Sea]] which required another radically different cruiser. These became known as &quot;large light cruisers&quot; - big ships (22,000 tons and some 750 ft long) with even less protection than the battlecruisers but carrying a few battleship calibre guns. One of the these was to carry 18-inch guns; albeit only two singly in turrets fore and aft. In the event, the planned Baltic operations never materialised and the three &quot;large light cruisers&quot; laid down [[HMS Furious (1916)|HMS ''Furious'']]   [[HMS_Glorious_%2877%29|''Glorious'']] and [[HMS_Courageous_%2850%29|''Courageous'']] would find use elsewhere.

==First World War==

===Battle of Heligoland Bight===
{{main|Battle of Heligoland Bight}}

A force of British light cruisers and destroyers entered the Heligoland Bight to attack German shipping during [[World War I]]. When they met opposition from German cruisers, [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Admiral Beatty]] took his squadron of four battlecruisers into the bight and turned the battle, ultimately sinking three German light cruisers and killing the German commander, Rear Admiral [[Leberecht Maass]].

===Battle of the Falklands===
{{main|Battle of the Falkland Islands}}

The original battlecruiser concept proved successful at the Battle of the Falkland Islands when the British battlecruisers [[HMS Inflexible (1907)|''Inflexible'']] and [[HMS Invincible (1907)|''Invincible'']] did precisely the job they were intended for when they annihilated a [[Germany|German]] cruiser squadron commanded by Admiral [[Maximilian von Spee|Maximilian Graf Von Spee]] in the South Atlantic Ocean.

===Battle of Dogger Bank===
[[Image:SMS Seydlitz.jpg|thumb|250px|[[SMS Seydlitz|SMS ''Seydlitz'']] was heavily damaged in the [[battle of Jutland]].]]
{{main|Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)}}

The vulnerability of the battlecruiser began to become apparent at the Battle of Dogger Bank, during which the German flagship [[SMS Seydlitz|''Seydlitz'']] escaped destruction only by emergency flooding of her after magazines. The Germans learned from the near-disaster and instituted improved protection. The British remained unaware of the weakness, to their great misfortune at the Battle of Jutland.

===Battle of Jutland===
{{main|Battle of Jutland}}

At the Battle of Jutland 18 months later, both British and German battlecruisers were employed as fleet units. The British battlecruisers became engaged with both their German counterparts, the battlecruisers, and then German battleships before the arrival of the battleships of the [[British Grand Fleet]]. The result was a disaster for the Royal Navy's battlecruiser squadrons: [[HMS Invincible (1907)|''Invincible'']], [[HMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']] and [[HMS Indefatigable (1909)|''Indefatigable'']] exploded with the loss of all but a handful of their crews. The better armoured German battlecruisers fared better in part due to poor performance of British shells although [[SMS Lützow|''Lützow'']] was damaged and had to be scuttled, and [[SMS Seydlitz|''Seydlitz'']] was heavily damaged. No British or German battleship was sunk during the battle with the exception of the old German [[pre-dreadnought]] ''Pommern''.

==Inter-war years==
===Post-war developments===
Following the end of World War I many navies re-evaluated their ship designs. This led to a number of changes as many nations chose to reduce their battlecruiser fleet following the [[Washington Naval Treaty|Washington Naval Arms Limitation Treaty]] rather than scrap valuable battleships.

====British designs====
The British had planned 4 fast battleships, the [[G3 battlecruiser]]s, which were cancelled by the Washington treaty after the war. They would have been superior to any World War One battleship and the battlecruiser name came from their high speed and armour relative to the planned [[N3 battleship]]s they would serve alongside. The [[Royal Navy]] de-emphasized battlecruisers in the original sense of the word and all but three were scrapped by the mid-1930s. In the Royal Navy, the term was applied to ships with heavy armour, but that were still capable of speeds in excess of 25 knots. [[HMS Hood (51)|HMS ''Hood'']], launched in [[1918]], was the last British battlecruiser to be completed, her three sisters of the [[Admiral class battlecruiser|Admiral class]] were cancelled. However, ''Hood'' was completed with armour that was thought to be capable of resisting her own weapons, the classic measure of a &quot;balanced&quot; battleship and her armour weaknesses were recognised and tackled to some extent during refits - the onset of the [[Second World War]] preventing her last planned rebuild. The other two battlecruisers retained, [[HMS Renown (1916)|HMS ''Renown'']] and ''Repulse'' were modernised significantly in a series of refits between 1920 and 1939.
Of the three specialist battlecruisers, &quot;large light cruisers&quot; in the Royal Navy's terms, ships of stubstantial size but with only the armour of light cruisers intended to be armed with a few battleship calibre guns for operations in the Baltic [[HMS Furious (1916)|''Furious'']] had already been converted to an aircraft carrier during the war. [[HMS_Glorious_%2877%29|''Glorious'']] and [[HMS_Courageous_%2850%29|''Courageous'']] too big and too heavily armed to fir in with the treaty definition of cruisers, followed rather than being scrapped.

====Japanese Designs====
[[Image:Japanese battleship Kongo.jpg|thumb|250px|Japanese battlecruiser [[Japanese battleship Kongo|''Kongo'']] in [[World War I]], before conversion to a &quot;fast battleship&quot;.]]

* The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] improved the four battlecruisers of the [[Japanese battleship Kongo|''Kongo'' class]] by increasing the elevation of the guns to 40 degrees, adding anti-torpedo bulges and additional armour, and building on a &quot;pagoda&quot; mast. The 3,800 tons of additional armour slowed their speed, but between 1933 and 1940 replacement of heavy equipment and an increase in the length of the hull by 26ft (8m) allowed them to get up to 30 knots once again. They were reclassified as &quot;fast battleships&quot;, although their armour and guns still fell short compared to surviving World War 1-era battleships in American or British navies.  In battle against true fast battleships of the [[South Dakota class battleship|''South Dakota'']] and [[North Carolina class battleship|''North Carolina'']] classes, the &quot;fast battleship&quot; refit would prove inferior to the real thing.

* The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] scrapped three of the four ''Amagi'' class battlecruisers (which were under construction), and converted the fourth, [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']], into an [[aircraft carrier]] in 1927.

====US Designs====
The [[United States Navy]] retasked two battlecruiser hulls as aircraft carriers: [[USS Lexington (CV-2)|USS ''Lexington'']] and [[USS Saratoga (CV-3)|''Saratoga'']] were both designed as battlecruisers (the hull designations were originally CC-1 and CC-3) but converted part-way through construction, although this was only considered marginally preferable to scrapping the hulls outright (the remaining four: ''Constellation'', ''Ranger'', ''Constitution'' and ''United States'' were indeed scrapped). The ''Lexington'' class battlecruisers if completed would have been closer in concept to the later fast battleships, being both swift and well-armored without sacrificing firepower.  They were planned to be armed with 16&quot; guns and armored against light battleship-caliber weapons; the engines required to propel these vessels at 33 knots (their design speed) made them into fast, flexible and tough aircraft carriers with large growth margins. The heavy use of ''Saratoga'' during World War II, however (at one point she and ''Enterprise'' were the only carriers in the Pacific), precluded her from having a postwar career: Severe and repeated bomb and torpedo damage took their toll and by 1946 the hull was simply worn out.

===Rearmament===
As war became more likely nations began to rebuild their forces. At first lip-service was paid to the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], but as war became more likely the designs became more ambitious. 

====German designs====
*The German pocket battleships (German:''Panzerschiffe'' - ''armored ship'': [[German battleship Deutschland|''Deutschland'']], [[German battleship Admiral Scheer|''Admiral Scheer'']], and [[German battleship Admiral Graf Spee|''Admiral Graf Spee'']]), built to meet the 10,000 ton [[displacement (fluid)|displacement]] limit of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], were another attempt at a battlecruiser-like concept. Rather than construct a lightweight battleship which sacrificed protection in order to attain high speed, the pocket battleships were relatively small vessels with only six 11 inch (280&amp;nbsp;mm) guns &amp;mdash; essentially large [[heavy cruiser]]s. They attained fairly high speeds of 26 knots (52&amp;nbsp;km/h), and reasonable protection, while staying close to the displacement limit, by using welded rather than riveted construction, triple main armament [[turret]]s, and replacing the normal [[steam turbine]] power with a pair of massive 9 cylinder [[diesel engine]]s driving each propeller shaft. They were later reclassified as &quot;heavy cruisers&quot;, having heavier guns and armour than regular heavy cruisers at the cost of speed. Unfortunatley, they were outclassed by British WW1-era true battlecruisers in speed, weaponry, and protection. 

*Two more ships were built later in the 1930s, the [[German battlecruiser Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] and [[German battlecruiser Gneisenau|''Gneisenau'']], which were considerably more powerful. At 38,900 tons full load they were somewhat larger than the French ''Dunkerque'' class and very well armoured. They were designed to carry six 15 inch (380mm) guns in three twin turrets, but for various reasons they were stuck with nine 11 inch (280mm) guns in three triple turrets instead (it was planned to rearm them during the war, but this plan was abandoned). The Royal Navy categorised them as battlecruisers since they followed the Imperial German Navy design lineage of trading off gun size for protection and speed. The German Navy nonetheless categorised them as battleships.

====French designs====
As a response to the German pocket battleships the French decided to build the [[French battleship Dunkerque|''Dunkerque'' class]] in the 1930s. They were labelled &quot;fast battleships&quot; and were armed with 13 inch (330mm) guns arranged in two quadruple turrets located forward. They were considerably larger, faster and more powerfully armed than the ships they were designed to hunt. This last design illustrated inter-war technological developments. The ultimate limit on ship speed was drag from the water displaced (which increases as a cube of speed) rather than weight, so heavier armor slowed [[World War II]] battleships by only a couple of knots (4&amp;nbsp;km/h) over their more lightly armored brethren. Heavy guns mounted on fast and well armoured ''fast battleships'' invalidated the concept of the battlecruiser as a ship class in its own right, although the development of the [[aircraft carrier]] overshadowed all big-gun vessels including the ''fast battleship''.

==Second World War==
===Commerce raiding===
In the early years of the war the German ships each had a measure of success hunting merchant ships in the [[Atlantic]]. The [[pocket battleships]] were deployed alone and sank a number of vessels, causing disruption to the trade routes which supplied the [[UK]]. They were pursued by the [[Royal Navy]] and on one occasion, at the [[Battle of the River Plate]] in 1939, the hunter became the hunted. Allied battlecruisers such as [[HMS Renown|''Renown'']], [[HMS Repulse|''Repulse'']], [[French battleship Dunkerque|''Dunkerque'']] and [[French battleship Strasbourg|''Strasbourg'']] were employed on operations to hunt down the commerce raiding German battlecruisers, but they rarely got close to their targets. The exception was when the [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] was sent out as a raider and was intercepted by [[HMS Hood (1918)|HMS ''Hood'']] in May [[1941]]. However, the modern German battleship was not suitable prey for the elderly British battlecruiser and the ''Bismarck’s'' 15 inch shells caused a magazine explosion reminiscent of the [[Battle of Jutland]]. Only three men survived. 

The [[German battlecruiser Gneisenau|''Gneisenau'']] and the [[German battlecruiser Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] hunted together and were initially successful at commerce raiding, sinking the British armed merchant cruiser ''Rawalpindi'' in 1939. Following repairs from damage during the [[Norwegian campaign]], the two battlecruisers set out commerce raiding once again in 1941 and sank 22 merchant ships. They returned to [[Brest, France|Brest]] in northern [[France]] but found this port was vulnerable to [[Royal Air Force]] attacks and were obliged to return to [[Germany]]. They did so in the [[Channel Dash]], a daring and successful run up the [[English Channel]]. However, they were both damaged and although ''Scharnhorst'' was repaired, ''Gneisenau'' was damaged again in [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] bombing raids and was eventually disarmed and sunk as a blockship. [[German battlecruiser Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] was employed once more to attack commerce and attempted to raid the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]] in December 1943. However, she was cornered by the battleship [[HMS Duke of York (17)| HMS ''Duke of York'']] at the [[Battle of North Cape]] and sunk on [[26 December]] [[1943]].

The use of battlecruisers as commerce raiders was curtailed following an attack by the [[German pocket battleship Admiral Scheer|''Admiral Scheer'']] on a convoy guarded by the [[HMS Jervis Bay (F40)|HMS ''Jervis Bay'']], an armed merchant cruiser. It persuaded the British [[Admiralty]] that convoys had to be guarded by battleships (or battlecruisers) and subsequently the smaller German ships were forced away from their quarry. Additionally, the air gap over the North Atlantic closed, [[Huff-Duff]] (radio triangulation equipment) improved, airborne [[History of radar#Magnetron|centimetric radar]] was introduced and convoys received [[escort carrier]] protection. The results of some of these developments were illustrated by the successful defence of convoys at the [[Battle of the Barents Sea]] and the [[Battle of the North Cape]].

===Norwegian campaign===
[[Image:Gneisenau-18.jpg|thumb|220px|German battlecruisers in a Norwegian port in June 1940]]

The [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Kriegsmarine]] both deployed battlecruisers during the [[Norwegian Campaign]] in April [[1940]]. The [[German battlecruiser Gneisenau|''Gneisenau'']] and the [[German battlecruiser Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] both engaged [[HMS Renown (1916)|HMS ''Renown'']] and although they had stronger armour than their counterpart, the British ship could hit them harder and at a longer range. They disengaged after ''Gneisenau'' sustained damage. 

Later in the campaign they returned and sunk the light [[aircraft carrier]] [[HMS Glorious|HMS ''Glorious'']] (a converted battlecruiser herself) and her destroyer escort. One of the destroyers succeeded in damaging the ''Scharnhorst'' with a torpedo, and later a submarine did the same to ''Gneisenau'', forcing both ships to spend several months in repair. The [[pocket battleship]] [[Lutzow|''Lutzow'']] was similarly damaged by [[HMS Spearfish (S95)|HMS ''Spearfish'']] during the campaign.

===Mediterranean===
The French battlecruisers had fled to North Africa following the [[Battle of France|fall of France]]. In [[July]] [[1940]] [[Force H]] under Admiral [[James Somerville]] was ordered to force their surrender or destroy them. The [[French battleship Dunkerque|''Dunkerque'']] was damaged by shells from [[HMS Hood (51)|HMS ''Hood'']] at [[Mers-el-Kebir]] but escaped to join the [[French battleship Strasbourg|''Strasbourg'']] at [[Toulon]]. Both ships were scuttled on [[27 November]] [[1942]], although ''Strasbourg'' was raised and used by the Italian navy before being sunk again in an air attack on [[18 August]] [[1944]].

===Pacific War===
The first battlecruiser to see action in the Pacific War was [[HMS Repulse (1916)|''Repulse'']] when she was sunk near [[Singapore]] on [[December 10]] [[1941]] whilst in company with [[HMS Prince of Wales (1939)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']]. She had received a refit to give extra anti-aircraft protection and extra armour between the wars, however despite these additions and her agility, without aerial protection she was unable to avoid the continuous waves of Japanese torpedo bombers indefinitely.

The Japanese ''Kongo'' class &quot;fast battleships&quot; were used extensively as carrier escorts for most of their wartime career. However, in the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] on [[12 November]] the [[Japanese battleship Hiei|''Hiei'']] was sent out to bombard US positions. She was badly damaged by gunfire from US cruisers and destroyers. She was attacked by US aircraft from Guadalcanal’s American held airfield the next day and left to sink north of [[Savo Island]]. A few days later on [[15 November]] [[1942]] [[Japanese battleship Kirishima|''Kirishima'']], engaged the U.S. battleships [[USS South Dakota (BB-57)|''South Dakota'']] and [[USS Washington (BB-56)|''Washington'']], and was scuttled following damage from 75 hits inflicted by the ''Washington''. In contrast ''South Dakota'' survived 42 hits and was back in operation four months later. The [[Japanese battleship Kongo|''Kongo'']] survived the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], but was eventually sunk on [[21 November]] [[1944]] in the [[Formosa Strait]] by three [[torpedo]]es from the U.S. [[submarine]] [[USS Sealion (SS-315)|''Sealion'']].  [[Japanese battleship Haruna|''Haruna'']] was involved in bombardment operations at Guadalcanal, the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] and the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]]. She was attacked by American carrier aircraft of [[Task Force 38]] and [[B-24]] bombers of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] while at [[Kure]] on [[28 July]] [[1945]] and sank at her moorings.

===New US designs===
[[Image:Uss alaska cb.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[USS Alaska (CB-1)|USS ''Alaska'']], one of the [[United States Navy]]'s few &quot;large cruisers&quot;]]
Part way through the war the US built the two [[Alaska class cruiser|''Alaska'' class]] &quot;large cruisers&quot;, [[USS Alaska (CB-1)|''Alaska'']] and [[USS Guam (CB-2)|''Guam'']]. They were designed to hunt down the Japanese [[heavy cruiser]]s. They were built to cruiser standards, with a cruiser-like secondary battery and no torpedo defense system. Their percentage of armor tonnage at 16% was similar to that of contemporary cruisers and far less than that of true battlecruisers and battleships (the HMS Hood had 33%, while the German Bismarck had 40% weight in armor). Their protection was not able to withstand fire from their own caliber of gun. As with the never-completed [[Lexington class aircraft carrier|''Lexington'' class battlecruisers]], the ''Alaska'' class ships were an outgrowth of contemporary American cruiser design, rather than being a new battlecruiser class to occupy the middle ground between heavy cruisers and fast battleships. 

However, they resembled contemporary battleships in appearance and tonnage, with the familiar 2-A-1 main battery, massive columnar mast and cluster of 5&quot;/38 DP guns along the sides of the superstructure. The easiest way to tell the ''Alaska'' class ships from the battleships was by the dual 5&quot;/38 mount superfiring over the fore and aft main batteries.

Like the contemporary [[Iowa class battleship|''Iowa''-class]] fast battleships, their speed made them ultimately more useful as carrier escorts and bombardment ships than as the sea combatants they were developed to be, as well as the ignominious defeat of the fleets of Japanese heavy cruisers that were their ''raison d'être''. (In fact, the majority of Japanese heavy cruisers were sunk by aircraft or submarines instead of surface combat.) A planned additional four ships of the ''Alaska'' class were cancelled after the war.

Along with [[HMS Renown (1916)|''Renown'']], the two ''Alaskas'' were the only &quot;battlecruisers&quot; to survive the war (not including Turkish ''Yavuz'' - ex [[SMS Goeben]], which did not fight during the war).

==Cold War designs==
The Soviet Union planed to build several large cruiser classes, that would be a response for ''Scharnhorst'', then ''Alaska'' classes in the 1940s and early 1950s, but these plans were abandoned. In Russia, they were called &quot;heavy cruisers&quot; (''thyazholyi kreyser'').

The first design were project 69 (''Kronshtadt'') cruisers, with 35,240 tons standard load, 9 guns 305 mm and a speed of 32 knots. Two ships were laid in 1939. In 1940 it was decided to complete them according to the project 69I, with 6 guns 380 mm, bought in Germany, but the German attack on the USSR put an end to these plans and all works were canceled in a favour of more useful ship types, like submarines.

Next design were project 82 (''Stalingrad'') cruisers, with 36,500 tons standard load (42,300 tons full load), 9 guns 305 mm and a speed of 35 knots. Three ships were laid in 1951-52, but after Stalin's death they were canceled in April 1953. Apart from high costs, the main reason was, that gun-armed ships became obsolete with an advent of guided missiles. Only a central armoured hull section of the first cruiser ''Stalingrad'' was launched in 1954 and then used as a target for rockets.
[[Image:Soviet Battlecruiser Kirov.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Kirov'', the lead ship of her class of battlecruiser]]

The Soviet [[Kirov class battlecruiser|''Kirov'' class]] of ''Raketny Kreyser'' (Rocket Cruiser), displacing approximately 26,000 tons, is classified as a battlecruiser in the 1996-7 edition of ''[[Jane's Fighting Ships]]'', even though in actuality they are very large missile cruisers. Their classification as battlecruisers arises from their displacement, which is roughly equal to that of a [[World War I]] [[battleship]], and the fact that they possess more firepower than nearly every other surface ship. However, the ''Kirov''-class lacks the heavy armour that distinguishes battlecruisers from regular cruisers and they are classified as &quot;heavy rocket cruisers&quot; in Russia. There were four members of the class completed, [[Soviet battlecruiser Kirov|''Kirov'']], [[Soviet battlecruiser Frunze|''Frunze'']], [[Soviet battlecruiser Kalinin|''Kalinin'']], and [[RFS Pyotr Velikiy|''Yuri Andropov'']]. As the ships were named after Communist personalities, after the fall of the USSR they were given traditional names of the Imperial Russian Navy, respectively ''Admiral Ushakov'', ''Admiral Lazarev'', ''Admiral Nakhimov'' and ''Petr Velikiy''. Due to budget constraints three members of this class have been decomissioned, although one is reportedly still running off parts cannibalised from the other three ships.

==Problems with the idea==
In practice, battlecruisers rarely saw the type of independent action for which they were designed. The increase in gunnery technology was so swift in the years following [[1905]], that there was a blurring of the distinction between the [[battleship]] and battlecruiser. At [[Battle of Jutland|Jutland]] the guns on [[David Beatty, 1st Earl_Beatty|Beatty's]] flagship, [[HMS Lion (1910)|HMS ''Lion'']] were 13.5 inch, which was larger than most [[High Seas Fleet|German]] and many [[British Grand Fleet|British]] battleships. 

In most cases, the temptation to add extra big guns to the main fleet proved hard to resist. As a result, battlecruiser squadrons were added to the [[line of battle]] &amp;mdash; a role for which they were not designed and one that exposed them to great risk. The armour on a battlecruiser remained that of (or slightly more than) a normal cruiser. Thus the ships could dish out a lot more punishment than they could absorb. Any advantage they had in speed was lost when locked into formation at the speed of  the slowest battleship in the line of battle. Heavy shells from opposing capital ships could easily penetrate their thinner armour. During Jutland, both British and German battlecruisers scored hits on each other. The British ships came off poorly, where the German ships' faired better due to better internal protection and poor performace of the British shells.
 
In the Second World War, large fleet actions did not happen. Battlecruisers were paired with battleships in roles such as raiding (German), convoy escort, or as part of task forces. In operations where battlecruisers did fight battleships, such as ''Hood'' and  ''Bismarck'', ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Duke of York'', ''Kirishima'' and ''Washington'', the battlecruiser was destroyed by gunfire. They were equally vulnerable to aircraft, and during [[World War II]] many were lost in this way.

==Science fiction==
In [[science fiction]], the meaning of the word &quot;battlecruiser&quot; is generally somewhat different. Usually it denotes a vessel more comparable to the fast battleships of World War II: A large, fast and tough vessel with both high firepower and enough protection to dish out and take considerable amounts of damage. In [[Star Trek]], [[Klingon]] &quot;battlecruisers&quot; often menaced the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Starship ''Enterprise'']] - which was classified as a &quot;[[list of fictional spaceborne heavy cruisers|heavy cruiser]]&quot;, and just as often faced her on even terms.  In many Science Fiction universes, a Battlecruiser is either a ship specifically in-between a [[Heavy Cruiser]] and a [[Battleship]] in design, without the specific requirement that it can either outgun or evade any other capital ship, or the term is interchangable with &quot;heavy cruiser,&quot; with the distinction that the &quot;good guys&quot; use heavy cruisers and the &quot;bad guys&quot; use battlecruisers.

'''Robert James Lee Hawke''' (born [[9 December]] [[1929]]) was an [[Australia]]n trade union leader and politician and the 23rd [[Prime Minister of Australia]]. 

After a decade as leader of the Australian union movement, he entered politics and was Prime Minister within three years. He became by far the longest-serving [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] Prime Minister, and was second-longest-serving Prime Minister overall until December [[2004]], when [[John Howard]] overtook him. Despite his record, critics continued to dismiss him as a [[populist]], whose focus on &quot;consensus&quot; has resulted in the abandonment of many traditional Labor values.

==Early life==

Hawke was born in [[Bordertown, South Australia|Bordertown]], a small town in [[South Australia]] near the Victorian border. His father was a [[Congregationalist]] minister; his uncle, [[Albert Hawke]], was Labor [[Premier of Western Australia]] between [[1953]] and [[1959]] and was a close friend of Labor Prime Minister [[John Curtin]], who was in many ways Bob Hawke's [[role model]]. Hawke's mother, Ellie, had an almost messianic belief in her son's destiny and this contributed to his supreme self-confidence throughout his career.

Hawke was raised in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and attended the high school [[Perth Modern School]] and completed undergraduate degrees in Law and Arts (economics) at the [[University of Western Australia]]. He joined the Labor Party in [[1947]], selected as a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]] in [[1953]] and went to [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] to complete a Bachelor of Letters at [[University College, Oxford|University College]] with a thesis on wage-fixing in Australia. 

His academic achievements were possibly outweighed by the notoriety he achieved as the holder of a world record for the fastest consumption of beer: two and a half pints in eleven seconds. In his memoirs, Hawke suggested that this single feat may have contributed to his political success more than any other, by endearing him to a voting population with a strong beer culture.

On his retu involved the deployment of tactical stations armed with Bomarc missiles along the east and west coasts of [[North America]] and the central areas of the continent. BOMARC and [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] were phased out in the late sixties as they were ineffective and costly.  

The Bomarcs were capable of carrying conventional or [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] warheads.  Their intended role in defence was in an intrusion prevention perimeter. Bomarcs aligned on the eastern and western coasts of North America would theoretically launch and disintegrate enemy bombers before the bombers could drop their payload on industrial regions.

The name Bomarc was conceived as a merge of the two organisations who played the most prominent roles in its creation: [[Boeing]] and the [[Michigan Aeronautical Research Center]] (MARC).  It was originally designated F-99, imagined as being equivalent to a fighter, but was quickly redesignated &quot;IM&quot; for Interceptor Missile, retaining the -99 series number.

The &quot;Bomarc IM-99A&quot; was the first production Bomarc missile.  It had an operational radius of 200 miles, and was designed to fly at [[Mach number|Mach]] 2.5-2.8 at a cruising altitude of 60,000 feet. It was 14.2 m (46.6 ft) long and weighed 7,020 kg (15,500 lb). A [[rocket]] engine boosted the Bomarc to Mach 2, and then its [[ramjet]] engines would take over for the remainder of the flight. 

The &quot;Super Bomarc IM-99B&quot; was the 99A's successor, with improvements to its operational parameters.  It was capable of striking targets within a radius of 400 miles, and able to fly at Mach 4 as high as 100,000 feet. It was 13.7 m (45 ft) long and weighed 7,250 kg (16,000 lb).

[[International Business Machines|IBM]] designed an additional component to this, called SAGE, which allowed for remote launching of the Bomarc missiles.

At the height of the program, there were 14 Bomarc sites located in the United States, and two in Canada.

The Bomarc Missile Program was highly controversial in Canada. The [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] government of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[John George Diefenbaker]] initially agreed to deploy the missiles, and controversially scrapped the [[Avro Arrow]] interceptor program arguing that the missile program made the Arrow unnecessary.   

Initially, it was unclear whether the missiles would be equipped with nuclear warheads. Once their use as nuclear weapons became known in [[1960]], a debate ensued about whether Canada should accept nuclear weapons. Ultimately, the Diefenbaker government decided that the Bomarcs should be equipped with conventional warheads. The dispute split the Diefenbaker [[Canadian Cabinet|Cabinet]], and led to the collapse of the government in [[1963]]. The Opposition [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] argued in favour of accepting nuclear warheads, and, after winning the [[Canadian federal election, 1963|1963 election]], the new Liberal government of [[Lester Pearson]] proceeded to accept nuclear warheads, with the first being deployed on [[December 31]], [[1963]]. 

[[Pierre Trudeau]], who was at the time a member of the [[New Democratic Party]], witheringly attacked Pearson for the decision. While he was forced to reverse himself when he decided to run as a candidate for the Liberals in the [[Canadian federal election, 1965|1965 election]], he remained unenthusiastic. Shortly after becoming prime minister in [[1968]], he announced that the missiles would be phased out by [[1971]]. 

Although a number of IM-99/CIM-10 Bomarcs have been placed on public display, concerns about the possible environmental hazards of the thoriated magnesium structure of the airframe have resulted in several being removed from public view.  Radiation contamination from a fire at [[McGuire AFB]], N.J., that destroyed an active Bomarc-A airframe on the launch pad on June 7, [[1960]], resulted in that area remaining off-limits to the present day.  The nuclear warhead was not activated in this [[Broken Arrow]] accident, however.

Fld. 9. As of mid-April [[2005]], the suspect missile was still stored in a secure compound behind the Armaments Museum.)

      <comment>Changed link from Negro River to Rio Negro</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Rio Branco''' is the principal [[affluent]] of the [[Rio Negro]] from the north; it is enriched by many streams from the sierras which separate [[Venezuela]] and [[Guyana]] from [[Brazil]]. Its two upper main tributaries are the [[Urariquira River|Urariquira]] and the [[Takutu River|Takutu]]. The latter almost links its sources with those of the [[Essequibo River|Essequibo]].

The Branco flows nearly south, and finds its way into the Negro through several channels and a chain of lagoons similar to those of the latter river. It is 350 miles long, up to its Urariquira confluence. It has numerous islands, and, 235 miles above its mouth, it is broken by a bad series of rapids.

As far as our server can handle it, we like to increase traffic to [[Wikipedia]]: it helps improving the quality and quantity of the content and increases the total amount of joy and other utility it has for people. This page lists ways of doing this.

----

Let's talk about how to increase traffic to Wikipedia, of both readers and writers--that is now going to become one of the main focuses of my Wikipedia work.  So I want your help!  How can we increase &quot;membership&quot; in Wikipedia--both readers ''and'' new writers?

Let's brainstorm.  Please, add an idea below, or help develop ideas.  (Sometimes, a really great new idea is a slight variation on a just-OK old idea.)

Also, if you do any work that you think someone else might inadvertently replicate, can you please write it down here somehow (as on the [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/Encyclopedia links solicited|Encyclopedia links solicited]] page)?  Thanks! --[[User:Larry Sanger|Larry Sanger]]

==Urban poster campaign==
See [[meta:Wikimedia urban postering campaign]]!

==Brainstormin'==
* How about we do something like [[Spread Firefox]]? We could start our own publicity campaign, and if we ever get something like the NYT ad or the Firefox coins (see article) then I get the feeling wikipedia use would go WAY up! :D
[[User:203.59.117.99|203.59.117.99]] 08:35, 22 August 2005 (UTC)
* Solicit links from (mentioning [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia banners and logos]]):
** Websites with substantial traffic, like [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/About.com|About.com]] (see [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/Big traffic links solicited|Big traffic links solicited]])
** People with lists of encyclopedias (see [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/Encyclopedia list links solicited|Encyclopedia list links solicited]])
** People with encyclopedia-type websites (see [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/Encyclopedia links solicited|Encyclopedia links solicited]])
** Best-of websites and similar resources (see [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/Best of sites links solicited|Best of sites links solicited]])
** Web sites for authors, films, whatever. There's always a list of links. Add a link to the Wikipedia Stephen King page to Stephen King web sites, to the Japan page on Japan web sites, and so on. 

* for individual articles, solicit links from:
** related resources (particularly if we mention them in ''external links'')
** directories such as [[LookSmart]], [[Open Directory Project]] and [[Yahoo!]]

* Get people to add article review requests to [[User:Larry Sanger/Review requests]]; find reviewers for those articles.

* Approach websites that might want free content, and help them to get their hands on Wikipedia's; this is something Bomis programmers and volunteers could work on.  Maybe after we're running Magnus' PHP code?

* Post announcements on mailing lists.  But of what sort?  Obviously, we want to avoid spam.
** Start ''and continue'' discussions about Wikipedia articles (for this, the help of Wikipedians will be necessary)
** Simply announce the existence of Wikipedia, soliciting help.  I think this is actually plausible.
** Recruit fans for specific areas of Wikipedia. For example, someone could drop by a [[Star Trek]] newsgroup and mention that our pages need work. I bet we'd have a huge Star Trek section in no time...

* Possible solicitation letters:
**[[/Sample solicitation]]
**[[/Another sample solicitation]]
**[[/Sample solicitation 3]]
**[[/Skeptical solicitation]]

* Post announcements on newsgroups.  But try to be careful to go slowly through them--make sure the post is specially-tailored to whatever group you post to.  A good strategy is to pick a Wikipedia article, point out a few problems with it, and post a link to the article, inviting people to make changes.  If you have posted an announcement to a newsgroup, will you please list it here: [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/Newsgroups|Newsgroups]]. If you don't know much about newsgroups, go to http://groups.google.com.

* Contact webmasters who have content-rich sites.  Get them excited about Wikipedia, and invite them to make their content part of something great.

* Increase production of pages that are of interest to the search engines.  '''Look at [http://50.lycos.com/ the Lycos 50] and the [http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist.html Google Zeitgeist] and make sure that there are articles on all those topics.'''  I would say that writing some simple short biographies of famous people would help. It will help when we have reliable and regularly updated stats on what is popular.  One interesting thing about this is that other people may follow suit so that there is a &quot;trend&quot; on the site.

* Increase the standing of Wikipedia with Bomis.  (There is a bug in the system which means that Wikipedia articles are not returned as often as they could be.  We're working on this.)

* Work to get additional press coverage, following up on the NYT article as best we can.  [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/Ideas for articles about Wikipedia and other press events|Ideas for articles about Wikipedia and other press events]].

* Write a scholarly article about &quot;Empirical studies in social epistemology&quot; and get it published.

* Write to authors of good books on subjects we need help on and invite them to write an article on Wikipedia. 

* Schools. Speak to any teachers you know and have them set up an exercise where their students write on various topics that are untouched. Students get school credit for their work, obviously and also get excited about participating. I've told my mother (who teaches grade 4), and her students are planning to do articles about australian mammals, some as-yet-untouched countries, etc.

* Promote free content: Whenever you make a post on other content sites, include a statement that your content is GFDL, public domain, or whatever...

* Get slashdotted once in a while.  For example submit article to Slashdot when we reach 150,000 articles, 200,000, etc...  [[User:Dgrant|dave]] 15:48 18 Jul 2003 (UTC)

* Add an [[RSS (protocol)|RSS]] feed to syndicate the content. See [[meta:RDF spool]]

* Would it be possible to make a subscription to an &quot;Article of the Day&quot; email. So someone subscribes and then every day they get a different entry in their mailbox. This is something that websters.com and dictionary.com do for &quot;word of the day&quot; definitions. It would probably need someone to take charge of it and select which entries go out (the random link too often goes to a stub or a disabmiguation page) I'll ([[user:MrWeeble]]) volunteer. It shouldn't be too hard to do - there's plenty of free (as in speech as well as in beer) software for this kind of thing 

*Just tell people about Wikipedia- like one-on-one

* Suggest publications that came with CD or DVD to include converted static dump of Wikipedia (including viewer applications, if required) in their CD or DVD. Even better, suggest them to write an article about Wikipedia too.

(The above is just a start!  Please add to the list!)

== Wikipedia Evangelism ==
Hi, I've mentioned this before and thought I'd mention it again. As I'm browsing the pedia I find articles that might interest friends/coworkers. I pop them a link in a quick hello message and ask them if they confirm the accuracy of the content...the response so far has been first one of wonder, then awe, then enthusiasm! And it's been a nice way to relate to some folks I'm not often in contact with. Anyway, I searched for [[evangelism]] and came up with nada around the 'pedia. Is there a place for sharing an evangelical/ 'help us' message of [[wikipedia]]? --[[User:DennisDaniels|dgd]]

There's some stuff at [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership]]. (Hint which wouldn't help here but may in general: after searching, go to the &quot;Power search&quot; box at the bottom of the screen and check the box for the 'Wikipedia' namespace. You'll get various about, help, documentation, etc pages that aren't supposed to show up when you're searching for encyclopedia articles.) Also check the [[m:Main Page|Meta-wikipedia]] where we keep general project discussion and misc stuff. --[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion]] 20:42 Oct 22, 2002 (UTC)

How about doing what a lot of news web pages do?  They have a box at the bottom, &quot;Send this article to a friend&quot; with some kind of java mailer to ship it off and a box for you to add a signed message. [[User:Ortolan88|Ortolan88]]
:I like that idea too. Especially, and I know this would require more overhead, but a way to keep my list of folks in memory so I don't have to open my email client (which may not be available esp, as I'm a student and working on diff. machines).
:How about mailto:root@localhost?Subject=Main%20Page&amp;Body=Look%20at%20http%3A//www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page] ? The text needs to be changed, but it takes no more work than the Edit this page link to add at the bottom. Use a form with input text or a [[JavaScript]] inputbox() to an e-mail, then add subject=&lt;title&gt;&amp;body=Look%20at%20&lt;url-to-title&gt; to the mailto.

Wikimedia should run a Wikipedia advertisement competition. As far as I can tell, WikiPedia has no advertisements. I am on a college campus and one group I am associated with advertises for lots of free software (Firefox and OpenOffice mostly) that is useful to college students. We would definitely put up some Wikipedia posters if there were a couple simple advertisements we could print out. This should be done similarly to how the logo contests were. If the contests are run, the purpose should be to get at least four advertisements: fliers for letter/A4 paper in both black &amp; white and color and posters for tabloid/A3 paper in both black &amp; white and color, so that it is easy for people to print them off and put them up on bulletin boards and the like. (If advertisements are available and I cannot find them, they should be made much more obvious.) --[[User:Jamethknorth|Jamethknorth]] 02:25, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

==Invitation Letter==
Last weekend, I went to a number of places where there were guided tours, and that got me thinking...''it would be nice if this person could contribute their knowledge of this place to Wikipedia...''

I think there should be a standard letter to invite people to share their knowledge with Wikipedia, for when you come across someone who knows a lot about something.

Or does a simlar thing already exist?  What do you think?  [[User:RealGrouchy|RealGrouchy]] 00:03, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)

: I think it's a great idea. There's some sample solicitation letters linked from [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership]]. [[User:Matt Crypto|&amp;mdash; Matt]] 02:02, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)
 
Okay, so obviously I checked it out.  Can someone draft a copy that can be printed out and handed to people (maybe like two to a page?).  If nobody does, then I'll probably make one in time.  [[User:RealGrouchy|RealGrouchy]] 17:39, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)

==Don't lose new and existing members!==

There are a lot of great ideas for bringing in new members here. But don't forget that, once they're here, we want to keep them! [[America Online]] is a great case study of how focusing too much on new members and not enough on serving existing members can actually ''lose'' overall membership. Wikipedia must be an useful, easy, and pleasurable experience for new users. The droves of contributors ensure that &quot;useful&quot; is not a problem, at least as far as content goes. To make it &quot;easy&quot;, more attention needs to be paid the initial interface learning curve for newbies. Both &quot;pleasurable&quot; and &quot;useful&quot; are significantly impacted by outrageously long response times and frequent server down time, so we must be careful not to bring in new people faster than we can fix these ongoing problems. Give a person a bad taste in their mouth from their first experience with Wikipedia, and we may not see them again. (That's why I never went back to Ask Jeeves!, Encylopedia Britannica, and many other search and reference sites after finding more reliable ones.) -- [[User:Jeffq|Jeff Q]] 17:55, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)

:I know what you mean.  I still consider myself a 'new member', but I spend a lot of time just looking through the hordes of confusing help pages before I made my first edit (I have never used the sandbox).  Luckily, I added an entry to my user page telling people that I am a new user, and asking for suggestions, and someone told me what they felt was the most important tips and links.

: Now, I do things with more ease, because I can look at pages I've created (esp images) and see how others have edited my work, and I can adapt to that format in new pages.  However, I'm a follow-the-instructions kind of guy; we should have procedural stuff to tell people what they need to know about different things, like editing a page, and adding an image, etc. [[Wikipedia:Picture tutorial]] is a good example. - [[User:RealGrouchy|RealGrouchy]] 23:14, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)

::I think Wikipedia does a pretty good job of explaining all the pieces that one needs to do various things. The problem is perhaps more the sheer size and quantity of things one should learn to feel truly Wiki-knowledgeable. I'm always coming across useful pages by accident. I just ran into [[Wikipedia:Style and How-to Directory]], some items of which I've read before, and some I've picked up by Wiki-osmosis, but I suspect this will give me another boost along the learning curve. I have two tips about the Sandbox I hadn't noticed mentioned anywhere:
::# Most of the time, what you're testing is completely demonstrated in &quot;Show preview&quot;, so you don't even need to worry about overwriting the main Sandbox &amp;mdash; just keep your Edit window open until you're done, then Cancel or just close it.
::# I ran across another Wikipedian (I forgot who) who had created their own Sandbox at User:&lt;username&gt;/Sandbox. It's easy to create such a page, and you never have to worry about what's in the main Sandbox or that someone might overwrite it, plus you can save stuff for extended testing.
::I'll bet there are similar &quot;best practices&quot; tips scattered around, maybe even not so scattered. It's hard to know with some much to learn and find. But that's a Good Thing, mostly. -- [[User:Jeffq|Jeff Q]] 00:05, 10 Jun 2004 (UTC)

:There is a real need to make inforamtion about the project, especially help pages more ordered and useful. To give an example although I can find many pages which tell me that I can have a personal Sandbox there is no documentation on how to achieve this. There isn't even a forum where newbies can post a question and get an answer to their problem/request from someone more experienced, or if it exists it is not well publicised.--[[User:ChemRad|ChemRad]] 13:56, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)

==From Wikipedia:Publicity==
There are numerous ways you can help publicize [[Wikipedia]], and thereby get more people to edit your work and make this into a real live encyclopedia.  Just think--in a few years, Wikipedia is probably going to be ''amazing.''  (Feel free to add to this list.)

* Ask people to read and help:

A &quot;decisive battle&quot; is one of particular importance; often by bringing hostilities to an end, such as the [[Battle of Hastings]], or as a turning point in the fortunes of the [[belligerent]]s, such as the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. A decisive battle can have [[political]] as well as military impact, changing the balance of power or boundaries between countries.  The concept of the &quot;decisive battle&quot; became popular with the publication in [[1851]] of [[Edward Creasy]]'s ''[[The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World]]''.  British [[military historian]]s [[J.F.C. Fuller]] (''The Decisive Battles of the Western World'') and [[B.H. Liddell Hart]] (''Decisive Wars of History''), among many others, have written books in the style of Creasy's work.

== The differences among land battles throughout history ==
There is an obvious difference in the way battles have been fought throughout time. Early battles were probably fought between rival hunting bands as disorganized mobs. However, during the [[Battle of Kadesh]], the first documented battle, in 1275 BC, actual discipline was instilled in both armies. This continued through the Ancient Times and the [[Middle Ages]]. However, during the many wars of the [[Roman Empire]], [[barbarians]] continued using mob tactics. As the [[Age of Enlightenment]] dawned, armies began to fight in highly diciplined lines. Each would follow the orders from their officers and fight as a single unit instead of individuals. Each army was successively divided into [[regiments]], [[battalions]], [[Company (military unit)|companies]], and [[platoons]]. These armies would march, line up, and fire in divisions. [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], on the other hand, did not fight in lines and utilizing instead guerrilla tactics. The [[Americans|United States of America]] during the [[American Revolution]] also followed suit. Europe, during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], continued using diciplined lines, continuing into the [[American Civil War]]. A new style, during [[World War I]], known as [[trench warfare]], developed nearly half a decade later. This also lead to [[radio]] for communication between batallions. Chemical warfare also emerged with the use the use of poisonous gas during [[World War I]] and the [[Austro-Prussian War]]. By [[World War II]], the use of the smaller divisions, platoons and companies, became much more important as precise operations became vital. Instead of the locked trench warfare of World War I, during World War II, a dynamic network of battles developed where small groups encountered other platoons. As a result, elite squads became much more recognized and distinguishable. Vehicle warfare also developed with an astonishing pace with the advent of the [[tank]], replacing the archaic cannons of the Enlightenment Age. Artillery has since gradually replaced the use of frontal troops. Modern battles now continue to resemble that of World War II, though prominent innovations have been added. Indirect combat through the use of aircraft and missiles now comprise of a large portion of wars in place of battles, where battles are now mostly reserved for capturing cities.

== The difference of naval battles throughout history ==
One significant difference of modern naval battles as opposed to earlier forms of combat is the use of [[marines]], which introduced amphibious warfare. Today, a marine is actually an infantry regiment that sometimes fights soley on land and is no longer tied to the navy. A good example of an old naval battle is the [[Battle of Salamis]]. Most ancient naval battles were fought by fast ships using the [[battering ram]] to sink oppsing feets or steer close enoguh for boarding in hand-to-hand combat. Troops were often actually used to storm enemy ships as used by [[ancient Rome|Romans]] and [[pirates]]. This tactic was usually used by civilizations that could not beat the enemy with ranged weaponry. Another invention in the late [[Middle Ages]] was the use of [[Greek fire]] by the Byzantines, which was used to light enemy fleets on fire. Empty demolition ships utilized the tactic to crash into opposing ships and set it afire with an explosion. After the invention of cannons, naval warfare became useful as support units for land warefare.  During the [[19th Century]], the development of mines led to a new type of naval warfare. The [[ironclad]], first used in the [[American Civil War]], resistant to cannons, soon made the wooden ship obsolete. The invention of a [[U-Boat]], that is, submarine, during [[World War I]] by the [[Germany|Germans]] brought naval warefare to both above and below the surface. With the development of aircraft during [[World War II]], battles were fought in sky as well as below the ocean. [[Aircraft carriers]] have since become the central unit in naval warfare, acting as a mobile base for lethal aircraft.

== Aerial battles throughout history ==
Although the use of aircraft has for the most part always been used as a supplement to land or naval engagements, since their first major military use in World War I aircraft have increasingly taken on larger roles if warfare.  During World War I, the primary use was for reconaissance, and small-scale bombardment, using ineffectual hand-dropped bombs.  Aircraft began becoming much more prominent in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and especially World War II.  Aircraft design began specializing, primarily into two types: bombers, which carried explosive payloads to bomb land targets or ships; and fighter-interceptors, which were used to either intercept incoming aircraft or to escort and protect bombers (engagements between fighter aircraft were known as [[dog fights]].  Some of the more notable aerial battles in this period include the [[Battle of Britain]] and the [[Battle of Midway]].

Another important use of aircraft came with the development of the [[helicopter]], which first became heavily used during the Vietnam War, and still continues to be widely used today to transport and augment ground forces.

Today, direct engagements between aircraft are rare - the most modern fighter-interceptors carry much more extensive bombing payloads, and are used to bomb precision land targets, rather than to fight other aircraft.  Anti-aircraft batteries are used much more extensively to defend against incoming aircraft than interceptors.  Despite this, aircraft today are much more extensively used as the primary tools for both army and navy, as evidenced by the prominent use of helicopters to transport and support troops, the use of aerial bombardment as the &quot;first strike&quot; in many engagements, and the replacement of the battleship with the aircraft carrier as the center of most modern navies.

== Battle naming ==
[[Image:Battle of Gibraltar 1607.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''[[Battle of Gibraltar]]'' of [[1607]] by [[Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom]].]]

Battles are almost invariably named after some feature of the battlefield [[geography]], such as the name of a town, forest or river.  Occasionally battles are named after the date on which they took place, such as [[The Glorious First of June]].  In the [[Middle Ages]] it was considered important to settle on a suitable name for a battle which could be used by the [[chronicler]]s.  For example, after [[Henry V of England]] defeated a French army on [[25 October]], [[1415]], he met with the senior French [[herald]] and they agreed to name the battle after the nearby [[castle]] and so it was called the [[Battle of Agincourt]].  In other cases, the sides adopted different names for the same battle, such as the [[Battle of Gallipoli]] which is known in Turkey as the [[Battle of Çanakkale]].  Some place names have become [[synonymous]] with the battles that took place there, such as [[Passchendaele]], [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] or [[Battle of the Alamo|the Alamo]].  [[Military operation]]s, many of which result in battle, are given [[codename]]s, which are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of the type or the location of the battle. [[Operation Market Garden]] and [[Operation Rolling Thunder]] are examples of battles known by their military codenames.

When a battleground is the site of more than one battle in the same conflict, the instances are distinguished by [[ordinal number]], such as the [[First Battle of Bull Run|First]] and [[Second Battle of Bull Run|Second Battles of Bull Run]].  An extreme case are the twelve [[Battle of the Isonzo|Battles of the Isonzo]] &amp;mdash; [[First Battle of the Isonzo|First]] to [[Twelfth Battle of the Isonzo|Twelfth]] &amp;mdash; between [[Italy]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] during the First World War.

Some battles are named for the convenience of [[military historian]]s so that periods of combat can be neatly distinguished from one another.  Following the First World War, the British Battles Nomenclature Committee was formed to decide on standard names for all battles and subsidiary actions.  To the soldiers who did the fighting, the distinction was usually academic; a soldier fighting at [[Beaumont Hamel]] on [[13 November]] [[1916]] was probably unaware he was taking part in what the committee would call the &quot;[[Battle of the Ancre]]&quot;.

Many combats are too small to merit a name.  Terms such as &quot;action&quot;, &quot;skirmish&quot;, &quot;firefight&quot;, &quot;raid&quot; or &quot;offensive patrol&quot; are used to describe small-scale battle-like encounters.  These combats often take place within the time and space of a battle and while they may have an objective, they are not necessarily &quot;decisive&quot;.  Sometimes the soldiers are unable to immediately gauge the significance of the combat; in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Waterloo]], some British officers were in doubt as to whether the day's events merited the title of &quot;battle&quot; or would be passed off as merely an &quot;action&quot;.

== The effects of a battle ==
Battles have both personal and political effects.  The personal effect of a battle can be a psychological or a physical effect; a psychological effect is on the minds of the participants. For example, many battle-survivors have nightmares &lt;!-- about wars such as the [[Korean War]] or [[World War II]]. --&gt; or abnormal reactions to certain sights or sounds.  The physical effects of battle on survivors can include scars, amputations, lesions, loss of hearing, blindness, and paralysis.

Battles also affect [[politics]].  A decisive battle that is won can cause one side to surrender &amp;ndash; or that same victory can be a [[Pyrrhic Victory]]. A decisive victory can force one side to submit to the interests of the victor, perhaps by ceding territory or changing policies.  Battles have been fought in [[civil wars]] to decide the fate of [[monarchs]] and different political factions.  Examples include the [[War of the Roses]] and the [[Jacobite Uprisings]].  Battles have also affected such things as the continuance of a war. An example is the [[Battle of Inchon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Berry Berenson''' (née '''Berinthia Berenson''', a.k.a. '''Berry Perkins'''), ([[April 14]], [[1948]] &amp;ndash; [[September 11]], [[2001]]), was a U.S. model, actress and photographer. She was best known as the wife of actor [[Anthony Perkins]], from 1973 until his death in 1992.  She was also the mother of actor [[Oz Perkins]], and Elvis Perkins.

Following a successful modelling career, Berenson had a number of minor roles in big budget movies, including ''[[Cat People (1982 film)|Cat People]]'', before starring opposite [[Jeff Bridges]] in ''Remember My Name''. She then developed a career in photography, shooting many photos for the covers of [[Life magazine]], as well as fashion pictures for ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine.

She died at age 53 in the [[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack]] on board [[American Airlines flight 11]]. She had been returning from a holiday on [[Cape Cod]] to her [[California]] home.

Born into distinguished American and European families, she was the younger daughter of Robert L. Berenson, a U.S. diplomat of Lithuanian-Jewish descent whose original family name was Valvrojenski. Her mother was Countess Marisa de Wendt de Kerlor, also known as Gogo Schiaparelli, a socialite of Italian, Swiss, and Egyptian ancestry (she is now Marchesa Cacciapuoti di Giugliano). Berry Berenson's maternal grandmother was the Paris fashion designer [[Elsa Schiaparelli]], and her sister was actress and model [[Marisa Berenson]]. She was also a great-great-niece of [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]], an Italian astronomer who believed he had discovered the supposed [[Martian canal|canals of Mars]], a great-great-niece of art expert [[Bernard Berenson]] (1865&amp;ndash;1959), and a great-great-niece of Senda Berenson (1868&amp;ndash;1954), an athlete and educator who was one of the first two women elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame.

'''Botany''' is the [[Scientific method|scientific study]] of plant[[life]]. As a branch of [[biology]], it is also sometimes referred to as '''plant science(s)''' or '''plant biology'''. Botany covers a wide range of scientific disciplines that study the [[growth]], [[reproduction]], [[metabolism]], [[morphogenesis|development]], [[phytopathology|diseases]], [[ecology]], and [[evolution]] of [[plant|plants]].

[[Image:US long grain rice.jpg|right|thumb|Nearly all the food we eat comes (directly and indirectly) from plants like this American long grain rice.]]

==Scope and importance of botany==
As with other life forms in biology, plant life can be studied from different perspectives, from the [[molecular biology|molecular]], [[genetics|genetic]] and [[biochemistry|biochemical]] level through [[organelle]]s, [[cell biology|cells]], [[biological tissue|tissues]], [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s, individuals, plant [[population]]s, and [[biodiversity|communities]] of plants. At each of these levels a botanist might be concerned with the classification ([[taxonomy]]), structure ([[anatomy]]), or function ([[plant physiology|physiology]]) of plant life.


Historically, botany covers all organisms that were not considered to be [[animal]]s. Some of these &quot;plant-like&quot; organisms include [[fungi]] (studied in [[mycology]]),  [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[viruses]] (studied in [[microbiology]]), and [[algae]] (studied in [[phycology]]). Most algae, fungi, and microbes are no longer considered to be in the plant kingdom. However, attention is still given to them by botanists, and bacteria, fungi, and algae are usually covered in introductory botany courses. 

So why study plants? Plants are a fundamental part of life on earth. They  generate the [[oxygen]], [[food]], [[fibre]]s, fuel and medicine that allow higher life forms to exist. Plants also absorb [[carbon dioxide]], a significant [[greenhouse gas]], through [[photosynthesis]]. A good understanding of plants is crucial to the future of human societies as it allows us to:
* Feed the world
* Understand fundamental life processes
* Utilise medicine and materials
* Understand environmental changes

===Feed the world===
Virtually ''all'' of the food we eat comes from plants, either directly from [[staple food]]s and other [[fruit]] and [[vegetables]], or indirectly through [[livestock]], which rely on plants for [[fodder]]. In other words, plants are at the base of nearly all [[food chain]]s, or what ecologists call the first [[trophic level]]. Understanding how plants produce the food we eat  is therefore important to be able to ''feed the world'' and provide [[food security]] for future generations, for example through [[plant breeding]]. Not all plants are beneficial to humans, [[weeds]] are a considerable problem in [[agriculture]] and botany provides some of the basic science in order to understand how to minimise their impact. [[Ethnobotany]] is the study of this and other relationships between plants and people.

[[Image:mendel.png|frame|left|[[Gregor Mendel]] laid the foundations of genetics from his studies of plants.]]

===Understand fundamental life processes===
Plants are convenient organisms in which fundamental life processes (like [[cell division]] and [[protein synthesis]] for example) can be studied, without the ethical dilemmas of studying animals or humans. The [[mendelian inheritance|genetic laws of inheritance]] were discovered in this way by [[Gregor Mendel]], who was studying the way [[peas|pea]] shape is inherited. What Mendel learnt from studying plants has had far reaching benefits outside of botany. Additionally, [[Barbara McClintock]] discovered '[[transposon|jumping genes]]' by studying [[maize]]. These are a few examples that demonstrate how botanical research has an ongoing relevance to the understanding of fundamental biological processes.

===Utilise medicine and materials===
Many of our [[medication|medicinal]] and [[recreational drugs]], like [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[caffeine]], and [[nicotine]] come directly from the plant kingdom. [[Aspirin]], which originally came from the [[bark]] of [[willow]] trees, is just one example. There may be many [[drug discovery|novel cures for diseases]] provided by plants, waiting to be discovered. Popular [[stimulant]]s like [[coffee]], [[chocolate]], [[tobacco]], and [[tea]] also come from plants. Most [[Alcoholic beverage|alcoholic beverages]] come from [[fermentation|fermenting]] plants such as [[hops]] and [[grapes]].

Plants also provide us with many natural materials, such as [[cotton]], [[wood]], [[paper]], [[linen]], [[vegetable oil]]s, some types of [[rope]], and [[rubber]]. The production of [[silk]] would not be possible without the cultivation of the [[mulberry]] plant. [[Sugarcane]] and other plants have recently been put to use as sources of [[biofuel]]s, which are important alternatives to [[fossil fuel]]s.

===Understand environmental changes===
Plants can also help us understand changes in on our environment in many ways. 

*Understanding [[habitat destruction]] and [[endangered species|species extinction]] is dependent on an accurate and complete catalogue of plant [[systematics]] and [[taxonomy]].
*Plant responses to [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]] can help us monitor problems like the [[ozone depletion]]. 
*[[palynology|Analysing pollen]] deposited by plants [[geologic timescale|thousands or millions of years ago]] can help scientists to reconstruct past climates and predict future ones, an essential part of [[climate change]] research.
*Recording and analysing the timing of plant [[biological life cycle|life cycles]] are important parts of [[phenology]] used in climate-change research.
*[[Lichens]], which are sensitive to atmospheric conditions, have been extenisvely used as [[pollution]] indicators.

In many different ways, plants can act a bit like the '[[canary|miners canary]]', an ''early warning system'' alerting us to important changes in our environment. In addition to these practical and scientific reasons, plants are extremely valuable as recreation for millions of people who enjoy [[gardening]], [[horticulture|horticultural]] and [[herb|culinary]] uses of plants every day.

==History==

===Early botany (before 1945)===
[[Image:Botany.jpg|thumb|right|The traditional tools of a botanist.]]
Among the earliest of botanical works, written around [[300 B.C.]], are two large treatises by [[Theophrastus]]: ''On the History of Plants'' (''[[Historia Plantarum]]'') and ''On the Causes of Plants''. Together these books constitute the most important contribution to botanical science during antiquity and on into the Middle Ages. The Roman medical writer [[Dioscorides]] provides important evidence on Greek and Roman knowledge of medicinal plants.

In 1665, using an early microscope, [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[cell (biology)|cells]] in [[cork (material)|cork]], a short time later in living plant tissue. The German [[Leonhart Fuchs]], the Swiss [[Conrad von Gesner]], and the British authors [[Nicholas Culpeper]] and [[John Gerard]] published herbals that gave information on the medicinal uses of plants.

===Modern botany (since 1945)===
A considerable amount of new knowledge today is being generated from studying [[model organisms|model plants]] like ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''. This mustard weed was one of the first plants to have its [[genome]] sequenced. The sequencing of the rice genome and a large international research community have made [[rice]] the de facto [[cereal]]/[[grass]]/[[monocot]] model. Another grass species, [[Brachypodium distachyon]] is also emerging as an experimental model for understanding the genetic, cellular and molecular biology of temperate grasses. Other commercially important staple foods like [[wheat]], [[maize]], [[barley]], [[rye]], [[millet]] and [[soybean]] are also having their genomes sequenced. Some of these are challenging to sequence because they have more than two [[haploid]] (n) sets of [[chromosome]]s, a condition known as [[polyploid|polyploidy]], common in the plant kingdom. The &quot;Green Yeast&quot; ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'' (a single-celled, green [[alga]]) is another plant model organism that has been extensively studied and provided important insights into cell biology.

=controlled the guns via remote. The B-52H replaced the quad .50's with a single 20 mm M61A1 Vulcan which offered much greater defensive fire power.  In the mid-1990s, the tail gun was removed from all of the B-52H aircraft to reduce weight and because a gun is ineffective against guided-missile firing fighter aircaft.
**The G and H models are distinguishable from previous models due to their shorter (by 8 feet) vertical tailplane.  This configuration had previously been tested on a B-52A.  
**The H model is distinguishable from all previous variants by having visually different engine pods.  The B-52H uses [[TF33-3]] turbofan engines, which provided 20% greater range, 70% more thrust and are considerably quieter than the [[J57]] engine which had been used on all previous variants

==USAF Stations==
The '''B-52''' is stationed at two USAF bases

* [[Barksdale AFB]] in [[Louisiana]]
* [[Minot AFB]] in [[North Dakota]]

==Trivia==
* Among its crew, the B-52 is affectionately known as the &quot;BUFF&quot;, an acronym for &quot;Big Ugly Fat Fucker&quot; (or &quot;Big Ugly Fat Fellow&quot; in more polite company).

* The BUFF carries a total fuel load of about 300,000 pounds (roughly 50,000 US gallons).

* BUFF flies unlike other aircraft.  It takes off nose-low or level.  This looks strange to most pilots, who are used to seeing aircraft take off nose-high.  BUFF handles unlike other aircraft because it turns by means of [[spoiler (aeronautics)|spolier]]s instead of [[aileron]]s.  Despite the fact that an aircraft of this massive size, power and weight necessitates [[hydraulic]]ally-boosted control surfaces, it requires a surprisingly high level of physical force on the part of the pilots.

* Each B-52 has a name.  Usually the maintenance crew chief has the privilege of naming her (aircraft and ships are regarded as female).  Some of the more interesting names are &quot;The Need for Speed&quot;, &quot;Heavy Metal II&quot;, &quot;Conceived for Liberty&quot;, &quot;Death from Above&quot;, and &quot;Night Stalker&quot;. One is even named &quot;Memphis Belle IV,&quot; in honor of the original [[Memphis Belle]], a [[Boeing B-17]] Flying Fortress.

* BUFF has small wingtip [[landing gear]] which do not touch the ground except when the aircraft is fully loaded with fuel and weapons.

* The B-52's skin looks wrinkled when the aircraft is on the ground.  However, in flight, the wrinkles disappear and she becomes smooth.

* BUFF's means of [[de-icing]] its wings in flight is simple and effective.  The wings are built to flex, thereby breaking off ice. Without a full fuel and weapons load, the wings can flex up to 15 feet.  This is normal.

* The B-52 was built for war, not for comfort.  The crew compartment (cockpit) is quite cramped, especially when Instructors (in addition to the primary crew) are flying.  There is a bunk on H models, but not on previous ones. B-52 crews joke that Boeing put the cockpit in as an afterthought.

* The aircraft has so much longitudinal stability that it has demonstrated controlled flight while missing much of its vertical stabilizer. 

* The B-52 was built for men (not women) to fly; therefore, the only toilet facilities on board are a urinal on the lower deck (just ahead of the bomb bay) and a potty (lined with a plastic garbage bag) on the upper deck. There is no curtain or door on these.  

* BUFF has a very small oven which can warm food for the crew.  The only drinking water is carried in coolers.  There is no sink or shower.  

* The B-52's landing gear has to be turned at an angle (&quot;crabbed&quot; in aeronautical terms) when landing in a crosswind.  The gear is made to point down the runway while the nose of the plane points into the wind.  Pilots call this &quot;crosswind crab.&quot;  This is made possible by a complex, but highly reliable, hydraulic system.  The ability to crab enables the BUFF to land in conditions which would force other aircraft to go somewhere else.

* A hairstyle known as the &quot;[[B-52 (hairstyle)|B-52]]&quot;, because of its resemblance to the nose cone of this aircraft, was popular in the 1950s, [[1960s|60s]] and [[1970s|70s]]. The musical band [[The B-52's]] were named after the B-52 hairstyle members of the band wear.

* BUFF's radar is so powerful that it can kill small animals when the aircraft is on the ground. (It is hazardous to human beings, too.)

* There is a [[cocktail]] named for the B-52, the [[B-52 shooter]].

* The B-52 bomber gained notoriety after [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' [[Cold War]] black comedy movie. The cockpit of the plane is one of only four movie settings.  The Air Force refused to allow Stanley Kubrick permission to photograph the cockpit interior; he developed his B-52 cockpit by extrapolating from photos of a B-52 interior published in a British flying magazine.  His guess was so accurate that his production company was later investigated by the Department of Defense.

* At the time of ''Dr. Strangelove'' and for some time in the 1960s the Strategic Air Command (SAC) did fly airborne alert (Chrome Dome) with weapons on board awaiting the &quot;Go Code&quot;.  B-52s were positioned in the air 24/7 to immediately respond to the [[National Command Authority]]. For example, missions from Homestead AFB, Miami, FL flew to orbit-on-station over the Adriatic Sea, refueled over Spain both going and coming (there was one notorious collision/crash on this route in [[1967]]), and landed in Miami 26 hours later.  During 22 hours of this time the B-52H could turn and immediately strike all six targets in southern Russia (without additional [[air refueling]]).

* The NASA B-52B Mothership, NASA tail number 008, was retired from active service with NASA on [[17 December]], [[2004]], after almost 50 years flying service.  This was the B-52 famous for dropping such aerospace research vehicles as the [[X-15]], [[X-24]], [[HiMAT]], Lifting Body vehicles, [[X-43]], and others.  It was the oldest active B-52 at the time, having first flown on [[June 11]], [[1955]], and entering service with NASA in 1959. It was the last B-52B in service (for that matter, the last B-52 in service of any type other than the H model).

* The B-52's longevity is marked by the fact that in at least one family of airmen, the grandfather, father, and son have all served as B-52 crew.

* The [[ejection seat]]s for the lower-deck crewmembers, the [[Navigator]] and [[Radar]] Navigator (more commonly called [[Bombardier]]), eject downwards from the bottom of the plane.  Because of this, these crewmembers cannot eject below 900 feet above the ground.  The upper-deck crewmembers (Pilot, Copilot, and Electronic Warfare Officer) have seats which can eject them upwards.  Therefore, their seats work at any any [[altitude]], as long as the [[airspeed]] is at least 90 [[knot (speed)|knots]], which is necessary to jettison the hatches above the ejection seats. 

* In the early 1980s Boeing submitted an unsolicited proposal for a &quot;Super B-52&quot;. It would have offered upgraded engines, improved electronics and avionics and vastly improved ergonomics for the crew. The plan was considered but dropped in favor of the B-1B that was then being considered to replace the then-20+ year old B-52G/H fleet.

* On the night of [[December 27]], [[1972]], [[North Vietnam]]ese pilot and future [[cosmonaut]] [[Pham Tuan]] became the first person ever to shoot down a US B-52 bomber, during the [[Vietnam War]]. The bomber had been circling the [[Hanoi]] sky during the US campaign called [[Operation Rolling Thunder]].

* As part of the 1991 [[Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty]] between the United States and Russia, 365 B-52Gs were flown to the [[Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center]] at [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]] in Arizona. The bombers were stripped of all usable parts, then unceremoniously chopped into five pieces by a 13,000-pound steel blade dropped from a crane. The modern-day [[guillotine]] crashed down four times on each plane, severing the mammoth wings and leaving the fuselage in three pieces.  The ruined B-52s remained in place for three months in order for orbiting Russian satellites to confirm the bombers had been destroyed, after which they were sold for scrap at 12 cents a pound.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''biped''' (BY-ped) meaning &quot;two feet&quot; ([[Latin]] ''bi'' = two + ''ped'' = foot) is an animal that travels across surfaces supported by two [[Leg (anatomy)|legs]].

==Bipedalism in general==
Bipedal locomotion is [[walking]], [[running]], and [[standing]] on two legs. Energy-efficient means of standing bipedally involve constant adjustment of balance, and of course these must avoid [[feedback|overcorrection]].

Efficient walking complicates these issues, as it entails tipping slightly off-balance forward and to the side, and correcting balance with the right timing.

Running is an inherently continuous process, in contrast to walking; a bipedal creature or device, when efficiently running, is in a constant state of falling forward, that is maintained as relatively smooth motion only by repeatedly &quot;catching oneself&quot; with, again, the right timing, but in the case of running only delaying the nearly inevitable fall for the duration of another step.

The phenomenon of &quot;tripping&quot; is also informative in this regard.  One popular way to think of it is as having one's leg pulled out from under them.  In fact, however, merely stopping the movement of one leg of a walker, and merely slowing one leg of a runner, is sufficient to amount to tripping them.  They were already &quot;falling&quot;, and preventing the tripped leg from aborting that fall is sufficient to cause bipeds to collapse to the ground.

Engineers who study bipedal walking describe it as a repeatedly interrupted fall.

==Animals and humans==

Many animals, including humans, have [[evolution|evolved]] bipedalism, with anatomical adaptations constituting the required mechanical systems and neurological adaptations the control-system ones.  

As to anatomy, contrast in [[domestication|domesticated]] [[poultry]] the meaty [[drumstick (poultry)|drumstick]] and thigh, against the small and bony wing. The technique of [[weight lifting|power-lifter]]s highlights the similar difference in dimensions, even in untrained humans, between the [[muscle]]s of the thigh and the upper arm.  This difference is extreme: the large muscle in the human upper arm is the [[biceps]], which bends the arm at the elbow; few people know the name of, or pay any attention to, the muscle that is used to straighten the arm (the [[triceps]]); the [[quadriceps]] and [[hamstring]] muscles of the thigh are both so crucial to bipedal activities, that each alone is much larger than even a well-developed biceps.

The famous knee jerk (or [[patellar reflex]]) emphasizes the necessary bipedal control system: the only function served by the nerves involved being connected as they are is to ensure quick response to imminent disturbance of erect posture; it not only occurs without conscious mental activity, but also involves none of the nerves which lead from the leg to the brain.

A less well-known aspect of bipedal [[neuroanatomy]] can be demonstrated in human infants who have not yet developed toward the ability to stand up.  They can nevertheless run with great dexterity, provided they are supported in a vertical position and offered the stimulus of a moving treadmill beneath their feet.

Human walking is composed of several separate processes:
* rocking back and forth between feet
* pushing with the toe to maintain speed
* combined intruption in rocking and ankle twist to turn
* shortening and extending the knees to prolong the &quot;forward fall&quot;

===Evolution of bipedalism===
Bipedalism and associated traits can offer a species several advantages:
*Some evolutionary biologists have suggested that a crucial stage in the evolution of some or all bipeds was the ability to stand, which generally improves the ability to see (and perhaps otherwise detect) distant dangers or resources.
*In vertebrate species, for whom evolution of additional limbs would be an enormous genetic change, it can serve to free the front limbs for such other functions as manipulation (in primates) and flight (in birds).
*In some species with predominantly prone locomotion and often inability to stand erect while stationary,  bipedal behavior appears only for rapid motion, &quot;rearing up&quot; on their hind legs.
*Humans are generally thought to have evolved bipedalism either through living on plains (the [[Savanna Theory]]), or wading like their semi-bipedal wading cousins the [[bonobo]] chimps, the lowland gorillas  and [[Proboscis Monkey|proboscis monkey]]s, the [[Aquatic ape theory|Aquatic Ape Theory]], which would provide the advantage of keeping the head above water for breathing in addition to the first point.

Many animals that do not use [[bipedal locomotion]] in nature can be trained to walk on hind legs. This includes dogs, elephants, horses and pretty much every [[mammal]] or [[reptile]] that has 4 legs. Some animals can also be trained to walk on front limbs, although this method lacks any practical benefits, save for [[gymnastic]] versatility for spectacle.

Humans too, can learn to walk using their arms for aid, or solely their arms ([[handstand]]). This is unusual and requires neurological and physical adaptation like many physical movements, otherwise they can result in injury due to lack of protection by astrophied or unbalanced muscles not developed for or genetically inclined for the movement.

Primates usually use both forms of locomotion - bipedal and walking on all fours, though there has been one recorded case of a macaque switching to bipedal walking completely after recovering from a serious illness, and at least one example of a captive chimp who only walked upright, [[Oliver the chimp|Oliver]].

===Bipedal biological taxa===
Biological examples of bipedality beyond [[human]]s and other [[primate]]s are mostly [[vertebrates]].  [[Bird]]s are bipeds, whether flying or [[ratite]], and the [[ostrich]] and kin demonstrate that not even ''large'' bipeds have to be [[mammal]]s.  Another mammalian group of bipeds are the [[kangaroo]]s. 

The pattern of bipedality only in the form of &quot;reared-up&quot; running can be seen in some of the [[cockroach]]es, and in at least one genus of [[lizard]] (the [[Basiliscus (genus)|basilisk lizards]]) that can run across the surface of water.

A biped also has the ability to breath whilst it runs. Humans usually take a breath every other stride when their aerobic system   is functioning. During a sprint, at which point the anaerobic system kicks in, breathing slows until the anaerobic system can no longer sustain a sprint. 

Bipeds are almost exclusively [[Landform|terrestrial]] animals, perhaps because the advantages of erect motion are offset, for [[aquatic animal]]s, by the greater resistance to motion, in dense and somewhat viscous water in contrast to air, incurred by presenting a large cross-sectional area perpendicular to the direction of motion. Obvious exceptions to this rule include several animals which are partially bipedal, semi-aquatic mammals, including the bonobo and proboscis, and also the [[raccoon]], which does not walk on its hind feet but often stands erect, or squats in water to use its hands to manipulate food and rocks/sticks.

Another bird which exhibits a bipedal posture is the penguin, whose efficiency in water is far greater than that on land; noticeaon of 6 fixed .50-calibre machine guns. Fourteen hundred B-25Gs and B-25Hs were built.

The last produced version, the B-25J, was somewhere between the B-25C and the B-25H.  It maintained much of the fixed armament of the B-25H, but the solid nose was replaced by a ‘greenhouse’ one seen on earlier models, though 800 B-25Js were converted to a solid nose version.  It also featured improved engines.  A total of 4318 B-25Js were built.

The B-25 was a safe and forgiving aircraft to fly. With an engine out, 60° banking turns into the dead engine were possible and control could be easily maintained down to 145 mph (230 km/h). The tricycle landing gear made for excellent visibility while taxiing. It was also an amazingly sturdy aircraft. One well-known B-25C from [[321st Bomb Group]] was nicknamed &quot;Patches&quot; because its crew chief painted all [[flak]] hole patches with [[zinc chromate]]. By the end of the war, the aircraft had completed over 300 missions, was belly-landed half a dozen times, and had over 400 patched holes. The airframe was so bent that straight-and-level flight required 8° of left [[aileron]] trim and 6° of right rudder, causing the aircraft to &quot;crab&quot; sideways across the sky. The biggest complaint about the B-25 was the high level of noise and most pilots with significant time in the type ended up with [[hearing loss]] (Higham 1978).

An interesting characteristic of the B-25 was that its range could be extended by using one-quarter flaps. Since the aircraft typically cruised in a slight nose-high attitude, about 40 US gallons (150 l) of fuel was below the fuel pickup and thus unavailable. The flaps gave the aircraft a more level attitude thus slightly extending the range (Higham 1975).

The B-25 was occasionally called &quot;Baker Two Bits.&quot;

== De-icing tests ==
In [[1942 in aviation|1942]], two B-25Cs were converted to test aircraft to investigate de-icing and anti-icing equipment; they were redesignated the XB-25E and XB-25F.  The XB-25E (nicknamed ‘Flamin’ Maimie’) used engine exhaust gases circulated through chambers in the wing to melt ice.  The XB-25F used insulated electrical coils, to heat metal surfaces.  Both were tested extensively until [[1944 in aviation|1944]]; the XB-25E system was extremely reliable and more practical than the XB-25F system.

While the results of tests on the XB-25E were promising, no aircraft during World War II was built that utilised that system.  It is a common method today.  Most prop planes used by the [[United States Air Force]] use so-called ‘piccolo tubes’ that run along the leading edges of the wings.  Hot air bled from the engine is blown through those tubes, and melts any ice that may form on the wing.

The further history of the XB-25F is unknown, but the sole XB-25E (42-32281) was scrapped.

== XB-28 ==
A descendant of the B-25 was the [[XB-28 Dragon]], meant to be a high-altitude version of the B-25.  Despite this premise, the actual aircraft evolved to be little like the Mitchell.  It was much more similar to the [[B-26 Marauder]].

== Variants and Design stages ==
*'''[http://www.wpafb.af.mil/museum/research/bombers/b3-2.htm B-25]'''&amp;mdash;The first version of the B-25 delivered.  It was so badly needed that no prototype stages were ordered.  The first nine planes were built with constant [[dihedral]] angle.  Due to low stability, the wing was redesigned so that the dihedral angle was eliminated on the outboard section.  (&amp;times;24)
*'''[http://www.wpafb.af.mil/museum/research/bombers/b3-3.htm B-25A]'''&amp;mdash;Version of the B-25 modified to make it combat ready; additions included [[self-sealing fuel tank]]s, crew armour, and an improved tail gunner station.  No changes were made in the armament.  Redesignated obsolete (RB-25A designation) in [[1942 in aviation|1942]].  (&amp;times;40)
*'''[http://www.wpafb.af.mil/museum/research/bombers/b3-4.htm B-25B]'''&amp;mdash;Tail gunner eliminated; dorsal and ventral turrets added, each with a pair of .50-calibre [[machine gun]]s.  The ventral turret was retractable, but the increased drag still reduced the cruise speed by 30 mph (48 km/h). 23 were delivered to the RAF as the '''Mitchell Mk I'''.(&amp;times;120)
*'''[http://www.wpafb.af.mil/museum/research/bombers/b3-5.htm B-25C]'''&amp;mdash; Improved version of the B-25B: upgraded from [[Wright R-2600]]-9 radials to R-2600-13 radials; deicing and anti-icing equipment was added; the navigator received a sighting blister; and nose armament was increased to two .50-calibre [[machine gun]]s, one fixed and one flexible. The B-25C model was the first mass produced B-25 version; it was also used in the [[United Kingdom]] as the '''Mitchell II''', and in [[Canada]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[The Netherlands]], and [[Soviet Union|Russia]].  First mass-produced B-25.  (&amp;times;1625)
*'''[http://www.wpafb.af.mil/museum/research/bombers/b3-6.htm B-25D]'''&amp;mdash;  Identical to the B-25C.  The only difference was that the B-25C was made in [[Inglewood, California]] whereas the B-25D was made in [[Kansas City, Kansas]].  First flew on [[1942 in aviation|1942]] [[January 3]].  (&amp;times;2290)
*'''[http://www.wpafb.af.mil/museum/research/bombers/b3-7.htm XB-25E]'''&amp;mdash;Single B-25C modified to test de-icing and anti-icing equipment that circulated exhaust from the engines in chambers in the leading and trailing edges and empennage.  The plane was tested for almost two years, beginning in [[1942 in aviation|1942]]; while the system proved extremely effective, no planes were built that used it before the end of [[World War II]].  Many prop planes today use the XB-25E system.  (&amp;times;1, converted)
*'''[http://www.wpafb.af.mil/museum/research/bombers/b3-8.htm XB-25F]'''&amp;mdash;A modified B-25C that tested the use of insulated electrical de-icing coils mounted inside the wing and empennage leading edges as a de-icing system.  The hot air de-icing system tested on the XB-25E was more practical.  (&amp;times;1, converted)
*'''[http://www.wpafb.af.mil/museum/research/bombers/b3-9.htm XB-25G]'''&amp;mdash;Modified B-25C in which the transparent nose was replaced by a solid one, with two fixed .50-calibre [[machine guns]] and a 2.95-calibre (75 mm) M4 Cannon, the largest weapon ever carried on an American bomber.  (&amp;times;1, converted)
*'''[http://www.wpafb.af.mil/museum/research/bombers/b3-10.htm B-25G]'''&amp;mdash;To satisfy the dire need for ground-attack and strafing aircraft, the B-25G was made following the success of the prototype XB-25G.  The production model featured increased armour and a greater fuel supply than the XB-25G.  One B-25G was passed to the British, who gave it the name '''Mitchell II''' that had been used for the B-25C.  (&amp;times;420)
*'''[http://www.wpafb.af.mil/museum/research/bombers/b3-11.htm B-25H]'''&amp;mdash;An improved version of the B-25G.  It featured two more fixed .50-calibre machine guns in the nose, and four in fuselage-mounted pods; the heavy M4 cannon was replaced by a lighter 2.95-calibre (75 mm) T13E1.  (&amp;times;1000)
*'''[http://www.wpafb.af.mil/museum/research/bombers/b3-12.htm B-25J]'''&amp;mdash;The last production model of the B-25, often called a cross between the B-25C and the B-25H.  It had a transparent nose, but many of the delivered planes were modified to have a solid nose.

'''Bengali''' or '''Bangla''' (বাংলা ''{{IAST|Bāṇlā}}'') is an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] [[language]] of [[South Asia]] that evolved as a successor to the [[Sanskrit]], [[Pāli|Pali]], and [[Prakrit]] languages. ''Bengali'' is the [[English language|English]] word for the name of the language and for its speakers; in Bengali, the language itself is called ''Bangla'' (pronounced: {{IPA2|'baŋla}}), a term that now has greater currency in English. From this point forward, ''Bangla'' will be used to refer to the language.

With more than 200 million [[first language|native speakers]], it is the fourth or fifth [[List of languages by total speakers|most widely spoken language]] in the world (after [[Mandarin (linguistics)|Mandarin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]] and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu)]]. It is also the fourth most spoken language in terms of native speakers [http://www2.ignatius.edu/faculty/turner/languages.htm]. Bangla is the second most commonly spoken language in India (after Hindi). Along with [[Assamese]], it is geographically the most eastern of the [[Indo-European languages]].

As a result of the [[Bengal renaissance]] in the 19th and 20th centuries, much of [[India|India's]] most famous literature, poetry, and lyrics are in Bangla; the works of [[Rabindranath Tagore]] (the first Asian to be awarded a [[Nobel Prize]]), for example, are in Bangla. Many of the reformist religious, philosophical, and political movements that began in that era were led by Bengalis.

==Classification and Related languages==
Bangla is an [[List_of_Eastern_Indo-Aryan_languages|Eastern]] [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] language of the [[Indo-European language family|Indo-European]] language family.

[[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Oriya language|Oriya]], and [[Maithili language|Maithili]], three other languages belonging to the [[List_of_Eastern_Indo-Aryan_languages|Maghadan]] Branch of the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] [[language family]], are very closely related to Bangla. Standard [[Assamese]], [[Oriya]], and Bangla are considered by some to be nearly [[Mutually intelligible languages|mutually intelligible]]; some local [[dialect|dialects]] of one language bear a striking resemblance to one or more dialects of the other two languages.

[[Sylheti language|Sylheti]], Chittagonian, and [[Chakma]] are some of the many languages that are often considered dialects of Bangla. Although these languages are mutually intelligible with neighboring dialects of Bangla, they would not be understood by a native speaker of Standard Bangla.

==Geographic distribution==
Bangla is native to the region of eastern [[South Asia]] known as [[Bengal]], which comprises [[Bangladesh]] and the [[India|Indian]] state of [[West Bengal]]. More than 98% of the total population of Bangladesh speak Bangla as a native language. It is the official language in Bangladesh and one of the official languages in the Indian states of West Bengal and Tripura.  There are significant Bangla-speaking communities in the Indian states of [[Assam]] and [[Tripura]] and in immigrant populations in the [[Western world| West]] and the [[Middle East]]. The national anthems of both [[Jana Gana Mana|India]] and [[Amar Shonar Bangla|Bangladesh]] are written in Bangla. 

===Official status===
Bangla is the official language of Bangladesh and one of the 23 regional languages recognized by the Union of India. It is the official language of the state of West Bengal and the co-official language of the state of Tripura.

===Spoken and literary variants===
Like many languages of South Asia, Bangla exhibits a strong case of [[diglossia]] between the formal, written language and the vernacular, spoken language. The two standard written forms of Bangla, '''Shadhubhasha''' and '''Choltibhasha''', stand in sharp contrast with the spoken forms of Bangla, often referred to as '''Ancholik Bangla''' &quot;Regional Bangla&quot;.

Shadhubhasha (literally, &quot;language of sages&quot;) adheres to an archaic form of Medieval Bangla and to a heavily Sanskrit-like vocabulary.  Songs like the Indian national anthem ''Jôno Gôno Môno'' (by [[Rabindranath Tagore]]) and the national song of India ''Bônde Matôrom'' (by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay (Chatterjee)) were actually composed in highly refined Shadhubhasha. However, Shadhubhasha is not spoken in commonplace settings and confined to literary and formal contexts.

Choltibhasha (literally, &quot;the current or running language&quot;) comprises the standard pronunciation of Bangla and thus serves as the basis for the [[orthography]] of most Bangla writing today. It is modeled on the form of the dialect spoken in the Shantipur region in [[Nadia district]], [[West Bengal]] &lt;ref name=&quot;morshed&quot;&gt; Morshed, Abul Kalam Manjoor, [http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/D_0212.htm Article on Bangla dialects], [[Banglapedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; and districts bordering on the lower reaches of the [[Hooghly River]]. However, a variety of regional dialects is to be found.

===Dialects===
While the standard form of Bangla does not show much variation across the Bengali-speaking areas of South Asia, the regional variants of Bangla are vastly dissimilar from one another. Spoken Bangla stretches across what is called a [[dialect continuum]], where neighboring dialects tend to be very similar, while speakers of dialects from opposite ends of the continuum would not be able to understand one another.

Bangla is typically divided into eight major dialect groups: Western, Southwestern, West-Central, Northern, Bahe, Eastern, Ganda, and Vanga.

Kharia Thar and Mal Paharia are closely related to Western Bangla dialects, but are typically classified as separate languages. Similarly, Rajbangshi and Hajong are considered separate languages, although they are very similar to Northern Bangla dialects. [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]], closely related to Eastern Bangla, is often considered a separate language. Chittagonian and [[Chakma]] are heavily influenced by the neighboring [[Tibeto-Burman languages]], and are also typically considered separate languages from Bangla.

During standardization of Bangla in the late [[19th century|19th]] and early [[20th century]], the cultural elite were mostly from West Bengal, especially [[Kolkata]] (formerly [[Calcutta]]). To this day, the accepted standard language in both West Bengal and [[Bangladesh]] is based on the West-Central dialect of the 19th century Kolkata elite. This has helped create a state of diglossia in most of Bangladesh, with many speakers familiar with or fluent in both the regional dialect of their community and the standard West-Central dialect used in the media.

==Writing system==
''Main article: [[Bengali script]]''

Bangla is written in the Bangla [[abugida|alphasyllabary]] (also called ''syllabic alphabet'' or ''abugida''), a [[Brahmic family|Brahmic]] script similar to the [[Devanagari]] alphasyllabary used for [[Hindi]], [[Sanskrit]], and many other [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic]] languages. The Bangla alphasyllabary is a [[cursive]] script with 12 [[vowel]] characters and 52 [[consonant]] characters. As in all alphasyllabaries, every consonant in the Bangla script can come with what is called an &quot;embedded&quot; or &quot;inherent&quot; vowel sound. For example, the simple letter ম can represent the consonant ['''m'''] in a word like কম [kɔ'''m'''] &quot;less&quot;. However, in another word, the same letter ম can represent the sequences ['''mɔ'''] or ['''mo'''], as in মত ['''mɔ'''t̪] &quot;opinion&quot; and মন ['''mo'''n] &quot;mind&quot;, respectively, with no added symbol for the vowels ['''ɔ'''] or ['''o''']. If the consonant sound is followed by some other vowel sound in the pronunciation, this can be written by writing a variety of vowel diacritics above, below, before, after, or around the consonant they belong to. Vowels not associated with a consonant (for example, vowels at the beginning of a word) are written with separate symbols. To emphatically indicate that a consonant is not pronounced with the embedded vowel, an extra [[diacritic]] may be added below the consonant.  [[consonant cluster|Consonant clusters]] are t ideological and propaganda interest in defending the city which bore his name. During the [[Russian Civil War]] he played a prominent role in the Red defense of the city, then known as Tsaritsyn, from White forces. Also, the Red Army, at this stage of the war, was less capable of highly mobile operations than the German army. The prospect of combat inside a large urban area, which would be dominated by infantry and artillery, minimized the Red Army's disadvantages against the Germans.  

==The battle opens ==
The start of Operation Blau had been planned for late May 1942. However, a number of German and [[Romania]]n units that were involved in Blau were then in the process of [[Siege of Sevastopol (1942)|besieging Sevastopol]] on the [[Crimea|Crimean Peninsula]]. Delays in ending the siege pushed back the start date for Blau several times, and the city did not fall until the end of June. A smaller action was taken in the meantime, pinching off a Soviet [[salient]] in the [[Second Battle of Kharkov]], which resulted in the pocketing of a large Soviet force on [[22 May]].

Blau finally opened as Army Group South began its attack into southern Russia on [[June 28]], [[1942]]. The German offensive started well. Soviet forces offered little resistance in the vast empty steppes, and started streaming eastward in disarray. Several attempts to form defensive lines failed when other German units [[flank|flanked]] Soviet defensive lines. Two major pockets were formed and destroyed, the first northeast of Kharkov on [[June 2]], a second around [[Millerovo]], [[Rostov Oblast]] a week later.

Meanwhile the 2nd [[Hungary|Hungarian]] Army and the 4th Panzer Army had launched an [[Battle of Voronezh (1942)|assault on Voronezh]], capturing the city on [[5 July]].

The initial advance of the 6th Army was so successful that Hitler intervened, and ordered the 4th Panzer Army to join Army Group South (A) to the south. A massive [[traffic jam]] resulted when the 4th Army and the 6th Army both required the few roads in the area. Both armies were stopped dead while they attempted to clear the resulting mess of thousands of vehicles. The delay was long, and it is thought that it cost the advance at least one week. With the advance now slowed, Hitler changed his mind and re-assigned the 4th Panzer back to the attack on Stalingrad.

By the end of July the Germans had pushed the Soviets across the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]]. At this point the Germans established defensive lines using the Armies of their [[Italy|Italian]], Hungarian and Romanian allies. The 6th Army was only a few dozen kilometers from Stalingrad, and the 4th Panzer, now to their south, turned north to help take the city. To the south, Group A was pushing far into the Caucasus, but their advance slowed. Group A's forces were deployed far to the south and provided no support to Group B in the north.

Now German intentions became clear to the Soviet commanders: in July Soviet plans were developed for the defense in Stalingrad. Soviet troops still moving eastward before the Germans offensive were ordered into Stalingrad. The eastern border of Stalingrad was the broad Volga river, and over the river additional Soviet units were deployed. This combination of units became the newly formed 62nd Army under the command of [[Vasily Chuikov]]. Its mission was to defend Stalingrad at all costs.

==The battle in the city==
[[Image:Streetfight_Stralingrad01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Urban warfare|Streetfighting]] inside Stalingrad]]

Stalin forbade civilians from leaving the city on the premise that their presence would encourage greater resistance from the city's defenders. Civilians including women and children were put to work building [[trench]]works and protective fortifications. A massive German [[Aerial bombing|air bombardment]] on [[23 August]] caused a [[firestorm]], killing thousands of civilians and turning Stalingrad into a vast landscape of rubble and burnt ruins. Eighty percent of the living space in the city was destroyed. The burden of the initial fighting for the city proper fell on the 1077th [[Anti-aircraft]] regiment: a unit made up mainly of young women [[volunteer]]s who had no training on engaging ground targets. Despite this and with no support available from other Soviet units the AA gunners stayed at their posts and took on the advancing panzers. The 16th Panzer Division reportedly had to fight the 1077th's gunners &quot;shot for shot&quot; until all 37 AA batteries had been destroyed or overrun. &lt;!-- Source 1) Beevors Stalingrad 2) http://stalingrad-info.com/stalingrad1942.htm --&gt; By the end of August, Army Group South (B) had finally reached the Volga to the north of Stalingrad. Another advance to the river south of the city followed. In the initial phase the Soviet defence relied extensively on &quot;Workers [[militia]]s&quot; composed of workers not directly involved in war production. For a short period, [[Tank]]s continued to be produced and manned by volunteer crews of factory workers. They were driven directly from the factory floor to the front line, and legend has it that they were not even painted.

By [[1 September]], [[1942]], the Soviets could only supply their forces in Stalingrad by perilous crossings of the Volga. Amid the debris of the now wrecked city, the Soviet 62nd Army formed defense lines, with strongpoints situated in houses and factories. Fighting in the city was fierce and desperate. Stalin's [[Order No. 227]] of [[July 27]] [[1942]] had decreed that all those who retreated or otherwise left their positions without orders to do so could be summarily shot. &quot;Not a step back!&quot; was the [[slogan]]. The Germans pushing forward into Stalingrad suffered heavy casualties. Soviet reinforcements were shipped across the river Volga from the eastern bank under constant bombardment by German artillery and planes. The life expectancy of a newly arrived Soviet private in the city dropped to less than twenty-four hours. German [[military doctrine]] was based on the principle of [[Combined arms|combined-arms team]]s and close co-operation by [[tank]]s,[[infantry]], [[Military engineer|engineers]], [[artillery]]; and [[Ground attack aircraft|ground-attack aircraft]]. To counter this, Soviet commanders adopted the simple expedient of always keeping the front lines as close together as physically possible. Chuikov called this tactic &quot;hugging&quot; the Germans. This tactic put the German infantry in the position of having to fight on their own or be endangered by their own supporting fire; it neutralized German close air support and weakened their artillery support. Bitter fighting raged for every street, every factory, every house, basement and staircase. The Germans, calling this unseen [[Urban warfare|urban warfare]] ''Rattenkrieg'' (&quot;rat-war&quot;), bitterly joked about having captured the kitchen but still fighting for the living-room.

Fighting on [[Mamayev Kurgan]], a prominent blood-soaked hill above the city, was particularly merciless. The height changed hands many times. During one Soviet counter-attack to recapture Mamayev Kurgan, the Soviets lost an entire division of 10,000 men in one day. At the Grain Elevator, a huge grain processing complex dominated by a single enormous silo, combat was so close that Soviet and German soldiers could hear each other breathe. Combat at the Grain Elevator went on for weeks until the German army reduced the position. In another part of the city, an [[apartment building]] defended by a Soviet [[platoon]] under the command of [[Yakov Pavlov]] was turned into an impenetrable [[fortress]]. The building, later called &quot;[[Pavlov's House]]&quot;, oversaw a square in the city centre. The soldiers surrounded it with minefields, set up machine-gun positions at the windows, and breached the walls in the basement for better communications.

[[Image:Stalingrad-a.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Soviet soldiers fighting in the ruins of Stalingrad, 1942]]

With no end to the fighting in sight, the Germans started transferring [[heavy artillery]] to the city, including several gigantic 600&amp;nbsp;mm [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]]. The Germans made no effort to send a force across the Volga, allowing the Soviets to build up a large number of artillery batteries there. Soviet artillery on the Eastern bank of the Volga continued to place German positions under fire. The Soviet defenders used the resulting ruins as defensive positions. German tanks found movement difficult in the heaps of rubble up to eight meters high. If they still were able to move forward, they were taken under close-range Soviet [[anti-tank]] fire from building wrecks. 

[[Soviet sniper]]s also successfully used the ruins to hide in. They inflicted heavy casualties on the Germans. The most successful sniper was only identified as &quot;Zikan&quot;, being credited with 224 kills by [[November 20]], [[1942]]. [[Vasily Grigoryevich Zaitsev]] was credited with 149 kills during the battle.

For both Stalin and Hitler, the battle of Stalingrad became a prestige issue, in addition to the real strategic significance of the battle. The Soviet command moved the [[Red Army]]'s strategic reserves from the [[Moscow]] area to the lower Volga, and transferred aircraft from the entire country to the Stalingrad region. The strain on both military commanders was immense: Paulus developed an uncontrollable tic in his eye, while Chuikov experienced an outbreak of [[eczema]] that required him to bandage his hands completely. The troops on both sides faced the constant strain of close-range combat.  

In November, after three months of carnage and slow and costly advance, the Germans finally reached the river banks, capturing 90% of the ruined city and splitting the remaining Soviet forces into two narrow pockets. In addition, ice-floes on the Volga now prevented boats and tugs from supplying the Soviet defenders across the river. Nevertheless the fighting, especially on the slopes of Mamayev Kurgan and inside the factory area in the northern part of the city, continued as fiercely as ever. The battles for the [[October_Revolution|Red October]] steel factory, the Dzerzhinsky tractor factory and the Barrikady gun factory became world famous. While Soviet soldiers defended their positions and took the Germans under fire, factory workers repaired damaged Soviet tanks and other weapons in the direct vicinity of the battlefield, sometimes on the battlefield itself.

During the siege the German, Hungarian, and Romanian armies protecting Army Group South (B)'s [[flank]]s had pressed their [[headquarter]]s for support. The 2nd Hungarian Army (consisting of mainly ill-equipped and ill-trained units) were given the task of defending a 200&amp;nbsp;km section of the front north of Stalingrad. This resulted in a very thin line of defense with some parts where 1-2km stretches were being guarded by a single [[platoon]]. Soviet forces held several points on the south bank of the river and presented a potentially serious threat to Army Group South (B). However, Hitler was so focused on the city itself that requests from the flanks for support were refused. The chief of the German High Command [[OKW]], [[Franz Halder]], expressed concerns about Hitler's preoccupation with the city, pointing at the Germans' weak flanks. Hitler replaced Halder in mid-October with General [[Kurt Zeitzler]].

In Autumn the Soviet general [[Georgy Zhukov]], responsible for strategic planning in the Stalingrad area, concentrated massive Soviet forces in the steppes to the north and south of the city. The German northern flank was particularly vulnerable, since it was defended by [[Hungarian Army|Hungarian]] and [[Romanian Army|Romanian]] units which suffered from inferior equipment and low [[morale]]. Zhukov's plan was to keep pinning the Germans down in the city, and then to punch through the overstretched and weakly defended German flanks and to surround the Germans inside Stalingrad. The operation was code-named &quot;[[Operation Uranus|Uranus]]&quot; and launched in conjunction with [[Operation Mars]], which was directed at [[Army Group Center]].

On [[November 19]], [[1942]] the Red Army unleashed Uranus. The attacking Soviet units under the command of General [[Nikolai Vatutin]] consisted of three complete armies, the 1st Guards Army, 5th Tank Army, and 21st Army, including a total of 18 infantry [[Division (military)|division]]s, eight tank [[brigade]]s, two [[Mechanized force|motorized]] brigades, six [[cavalry]] divisions and one anti-tank brigade. The preparations for the attack could be heard by the Romanians, who continued to push for reinforcements, only to be refused again. Thinly spread, outnumbered and poorly equipped, the 3rd Romanian Army, which held the northern flank of the German 6th Army, was shattered after a one-day defense.

On [[November 20]], a second Soviet offensive (two armies) was launched to the south of Stalingrad, against points held by the Romanian 4th Army Corps. The Romanian forces collapsed almost immediately. Soviet forces raced west in a [[pincer movement]], and met two days later near the town of [[Kalach]], sealing the ring around Stalingrad. The Soviets thought they had trapped less than 100,000 Germans; in fact about 250,000 German and Romanian soldiers, as well as some [[Croatia]]n units and volunteer subsidiary troops were encircled in the pocket. Not all German soldiers from the 6th Army were trapped: 50,000 were brushed aside outside the pocket. The encircling Red Army units immediately formed two defensive fronts: one facing 'inward' to defend against breakout attempt by the surrounded Germans, the other facing 'outward' to defend against any relief attempt.  

Hitler had already declared in a public speech on [[September 30]] that the German army would never leave the city. At a meeting shortly after the encirclement, German army chiefs pushed for an immediate breakout to a new line on the west of the Don. [[Hermann Göring]] instead claimed that the [[Luftwaffe]] could supply the 6th Army with an &quot;air bridge.&quot; This would allow the Germans in the city to fight on while a relief force could be assembled, a plan that had been used successfully a year earlier at the [[Demyansk Pocket]] on a much smaller scale (an army corps versus an entire army). The German Sixth Army was the largest unit of this type in the world, almost twice as large as a regular German army. Also trapped in the &quot;pocket&quot; was a corps of the Fourth Panzer Army. It should have been clear that supplying the pocket by air was impossible: the Luftwaffe's carrying capacity after the [[Battle of Crete]] had not been reinforced, and the maximum 300 tonnes they could deliver a day would be less than the 500 needed by the pocket. However, Hitler backed Göring's plan and re-iterated his order of &quot;no surrender&quot; to his trapped armies.

The air supply mission failed almost immediately. Heavy Soviet anti-aircraft fire and fighter interceptions led to the loss of many German transport aircraft. The winter weather reduced the flying efficiency of the Geram air force. In general only 10 percent of the needed supplies could be delivered. Those transport planes which made it would evacuate technical specialists and sick or wounded men when taking off from the besieged enclave. The 6th Army slowly starved. [[Aviator|Pilot]]s were shocked to find the troops assigned to offloading the planes too exhausted and hungry to unload food.

Soviet forces consolidated their positions around Stalingrad, and fierce fighting to shrink the pocket began. An attack by a German battlegroup formed to relieve the trapped armies from the South, ''[[Operation Wintergewitter]]'' (&quot;Winter Storm&quot;) was successfully fended off by the Soviets in December. The full impact of the harsh Russian winter set in. The Volga froze solid, allowing the Soviets to supply their forces in the city more easily. The trapped Germans rapidly ran out of heating fuel and medical supplies, and thousands started dying of [[frostbite]], [[malnutrition]] and [[disease]].

In January the Soviets launched a second offensive, [[Operation Saturn]], which attempted to punch through the Axis army on the Don and take [[Rostov-on-Don|Rostov]]. If successful, this offensive would have trapped the remainder of Army Group South in the Caucasus. The Germans set up a &quot;mobile defense&quot; in which small units would hold towns until supporting armor could arrive. The Soviets never got close to Rostov, but the fighting forced von Manstein to extract Group A from the Caucasus and restabilize the frontline some 250&amp;nbsp;km away from the city. The 6th Army was now beyond all hope of German reinforcement. The German troops in Stalingrad were not told this, however, and continued to believe that reinforcements were on their way. Some German officers requested that Paulus defy Hitler's orders to stand fast and instead attempt to break out of the Stalingrad pocket. Paulus refused, as he abhorred the thought of disobeying orders.

==Soviet victory==
[[Image:Paulus_POW.jpg|thumb|right|300px| German POWs: The staff of Field Marshal Paulus]]

The Germans inside the pocket retreated from the [[suburb]]s of Stalingrad to the city itself. The loss of the two [[airfield]]s at Pitomnik and Gumrak meant an end to air supplies and to the evacuation of the wounded. The Germans were now literally starving, and running out of [[ammunition]]. Nevertheless they continued to resist stubbornly, partly because they believed the Soviets would execute those who surrendered. In particular, the so-called &quot;HiWi&quot; troops, ex-Soviets fighting for the Germans, had no illusions about their fate if captured. The Soviets, in turn, were initially surprised by the large number of German forces they had trapped, and had to reinforce their encircling forces. Bloody [[urban warfare]] began again in Stalingrad, but this time it was the Germans who were pushed back to the banks of the Volga.

Hitler promoted Paulus to ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' on [[January 30]], [[1943]] (the 10th anniversary of Hitler coming to power). Since no German [[field marshal]] had ever been taken prisoner, Hitler assumed that Paulus would fight on or take his own life. Nevertheless, when Soviet forces closed in on Paulus' headquarters in the ruined [[ State_Universal_Store|GUM]] department store, Paulus surrendered. The remnants of the German forces in Stalingrad surrendered on [[February 2]] [[1943]]; 91,000 tired, ill and starving Germans were taken captive. To the delight of the Soviet forces and the dismay of the Reich, the prisoners included 22 generals. Hitler was angry at the Field Marshall's surrender and confided that &quot;Paulus stood at the doorstep of eternal glory but made an about-face&quot;.

Only 6,000 of the 91,000 German [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] survived their captivity and returned home. Already weakened by disease, starvation and lack of medical care during the encirclement, they were sent to [[labour camp]]s all over the Soviet Union, where most of them died of overwork and malnutrition. A handful of senior officers were taken to [[Moscow]] and used for propaganda purposes. Some, including Paulus, signed anti-Hitler statements which were broadcast to German troops. General [[Walther von Seydlitz-Kurzbach]] offered to raise an anti-Hitler army from the Stalingrad survivors, but the Soviets did not accept this offer. It was not until 1955 that the last of the handful of survivors were [[repatriated]].

The German public was not officially told of the disaster until the end of January 1943, though positive reports in the German propaganda media about the battle had stopped in the weeks before the announcement. It was not the first major setback of the German military, but the crushing defeat at Stalingrad was unmatched in scale. On [[February 18]] the [[minister]] of [[propaganda]], [[Joseph Goebbels]], gave his famous [[Sportpalast speech]] in Berlin, encouraging the Germans to accept a [[total war]] which would claim all resources and efforts from the entire population.

By any measure the battle of Stalingrad was arguably the largest single battle in human history. It raged for 199 days. Numbers of casualties are difficult to compile owing to the vast scope of the battle and the fact the Soviet government didn't allow estimates to be run for fear the cost would have proven too high. In its initial phases, the Germans inflicted heavy casualties on Soviet formations, however, the Soviet counter strike cut off and annihilated the entire 6th Army (which was exceptionally strong) and parts of the 4th Panzer Army. Various [[scholar]]s have estimated the Axis suffered 850,000 casualties of all types among all branches of the German armed forces and its allies: 400,000 Germans, 200,000 Romanians, 130,000 Italians, 120,000 Hungarians were killed, wounded or missing. An unusually high proportion of total German casualties were killed and captured (96,000 of whom were prisoners). In addition, and as many as 50,000 [[turncoat]] Soviets were killed or captured by the Red Army. Soviet military losses are disputed. According to archival figures, the Red Army suffered 478,741 men killed and 650,878 wounded (for a total of 1,129,619). These numbers, however, include a wide scope of operations. More than 40,000 Soviet civilians died in Stalingrad and its suburbs during a single week of aerial bombing as the 6th and 4th  armies approached the city; the total number of civilians killed in the regions outside the city is unknown. In all, a total of anywhere from 1.7 million to 2 million Axis and Allied casualties resulted from the battle, making it by far the largest in human history.

For the heroism of the Soviet defenders of Stalingrad, the city was awarded the title [[Hero City]] in 1945. After the war, in the 1960s, a colossal [[monument]] of &quot;[[Mother Motherland|Mother Russia]]&quot; was erected on [[Mamayev Kurgan]], the hill overlooking the city. The statue forms part of a [[War memorial|memorial]] complex which includes ruined walls deliberately left the way they were after the battle. The Grain Elevator, as well as [[Pavlov's House]], the apartment building whose defenders eventually held out for two months until they were relieved, can still be visited. One may, even today, find bones and rusty metal splinters on Mamayev Kurgan, symbol of both the human suffering during the battle and the successful yet costly resistance against the German invasion.

'''Bodhidharma''' ([[Sanskrit]]: बोधिधर्म
[[Chinese language|Chinese]] &amp;#33769;&amp;#25552;&amp;#36948;&amp;#25705;, 
[[pinyin]] '''Pútídámó''' or simply '''Dámó'''; [[Wade-Giles]] 
'''Tamo'''; [[Japanese language|Japanese]] &amp;#12480;&amp;#12523;&amp;#12510;, 
'''[[Daruma]]''', [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: ''Bồ-đề-đạt-ma''), also known as the '''[[Tripitaka]] [[Dharma]] Master''', 
was a legendary [[Buddhist]] [[monk]].
Bodhidharma is traditionally held in Shaolin mythology to be the founder of the [[Chan]] school of [[Buddhism]] (known in [[Japan]] and the West as [[Zen]]), 
and the [[Shaolin]] school of [[Chinese martial arts]].

==Biography==
The major sources about Bodhidharma's life conflict with regard to his origins, the chronology of his journey to [[China]], his death, and other details.One proposed set of birth and death dates is c. [[440]]&amp;ndash;[[528]] CE; another is c. [[470]]&amp;ndash;[[543]] CE.

===Biographical details from the ''Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang'' (547) by Yang Xuanzhi===
The earliest historical record of Bodhidharma was compiled in 547 by [[Yang Xuanzhi]], the ''[[Luoyang Qielanji|Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang]]'', in which Yang identifies Bodhidharma as a [[Persians|Persian]] Central Asian ([[Wade-Giles]]: ''po-szu kuo hu-jen'') (Broughton, 1999, p. 54, p.138).

&lt;blockquote&gt;At that time there was a monk of the Western Region named Bodhidharma, a Persian Central Asian. He traveled from the wild borderlands to China. Seeing the golden disks [on the pole on top of Yung-ning's [[stupa]]] reflecting in the sun, the rays of light illuminating the surface of the clouds, the jewel-bells on the stupa blowing in the wind, the echoes reverberating beyond the heavens, Bodhidharma sang its praises.  He exclaimed:  &quot;Truly this is the work of spirits.&quot;  He said:  &quot;I am 150 years old, and I have passed through numerous countries.  There is virtually no country I have not visited.  But even in India there is nothing comparable to the pure beauty of this monastery.  Even the distant Buddha realms lack this.&quot;  He chanted homage and placed his palms together in salutation for days on end.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yongning was built in 516 and destroyed in 526, dating Bodhidharma's exultation to these years.

===Biographical details from the ''Biography'' of Bodhidharma by Tanlin===
Bodhidharma's disciple [[Tanlin]] identifies his master as [[South_India#The people|South Indian]] (Broughton, 1999, p. 8).

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Dharma Master was a South Indian of the Western Region. He was the third son of a great Indian King....His ambition lay in the Mahayana path, and so he put aside his white layman's robe for the black robe of a monk....Lamenting the decline of the true teaching in the outlands, he subsequently crossed distant mountains and seas, traveling about propagating the teaching in Han and Wei.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Biography'' is part of the ''[[Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices]]'', which [[Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki]] found in 1935 by going through the [[Mogao_Caves|Dunhuang]] collection of the Chinese National Library.

===Biographical details from the ''Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks'' (645) by Daoxuan===
The entry for Bodhidharma is almost entirely drawn from the first two sections of the ''Long Scroll'' (Tanlin's ''Biography'' and the ''Two Entrances'', traditionally attributed to Bodhidharma himself), to which [[Daoxuan]] added the following:
; Caste background : Daoxuan writes that Bodhidharma's father is [[Brahmin]]. However, as a king, he is more likely to have been from the [[Kshatriya]] [[caste]] ([[Varma]]).
; Age : Daoxuan takes his figure for Bodhidharma's age from the ''Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang''.
; The duration of Daoyu and Huike's service to Bodhidharma : Tanlin's original says &quot;several&quot; years. Daoxuan gives a figure of &quot;four or five&quot;.
; The route of Bodhidharma's journey : Tanlin's original says only that Bodhidharma &quot;crossed distant mountains and seas&quot; on the way to his ultimate destination, [[Northern_Wei_Dynasty|the northern Chinese kingdom of Wei]]. In Daoxuan's account, Bodhidharma travels to by sea to [[North_China_and_South_China|southern China]] and then makes his way north, eventually crossing the [[Yangtze River]], according to legend, on a reed.
; The date of Bodhidharma's journey : Daoxuan says that Bodhidharma makes landfall in [[Song_Dynasty_(420-479)|the southern Chinese kingdom of Song]], making his arrival in China no later than that kingdom's fall to [[Qi_Dynasty|Qi]] in [[479]].
; Bodhidharma's death : Bodhidharma dies at Luo River Beach. His interment by Huike on a bank of the river, possibly in a cave, is unusual because masters of Bodhidharma's reputation typically receive elaborate funerals. According to Daoxuan's chronology, Bodhidharma must have died before 534, when the Northern Wei falls, because Huike leaves Luoyang for Ye at that point. The use of the Luo River Beach as an execution grounds suggests that Bodhidharma may have died in the mass executions at Heyin in 528. A report in ''[[Taishou shinshuu daizoukyou]]'' states that a Buddhist monk was among the victims.

[[Image:Bodhidarma.jpg|thumb|left|This Japanese scroll calligraphy of '''Bodhidharma''' reads &amp;#8220;Zen points directly to the human heart, see into your nature and become [[Buddha]]&amp;#8221;.  It was created by [[Hakuin Ekaku]] ([[1685]] to [[1768]])]]

===Biographical details from the ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'' (952)===
The version of the Bodhidharma legend found in the ''[[Zutangji|Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall]]'' follows Daoxuan but is distinguished by the following:
* Bodhidharma's master Prajnatara, 27th Chan Patriach
* Bodhidharma's birth name Bodhitara
* Bodhidharma makes landfall not during the [[Song_Dynasty_(420-479)|Song period]] of southern China but in 527 during the [[Liang Dynasty]]. According to the ''Anthology'', Bodhidharma's voyage from India to China took three years.
* Before crossing the Yangtze River en route to Wei, Bodhidharma visits the Liang court in present-day [[Nanjing]], but leaves soon after his uncompromising doctrines end up offending [[Emperor_Wu_of_Liang_China|Emperor Wu]].
* Bodhidharma dies at the age of 150 and is buried on Mount Xiong'er to the west of Luoyang. Three years later in the [[Pamir Mountains]], Songyun, an envoy of one of the later Wei kingdoms, encounters Bodhidharma, who is on his way back [[West]]. Bodhidharma, carrying a single sandal, predicts that Songyun's ruler has died, which is borne out upon Songyun's return. Bodhidharma's tomb is opened and only a single sandal is found inside. The nine years of meditation after his departure from the Liang court in 527 mean that Bodhidharma's death can take place no earlier than 536, but his encounter with the Wei diplomat mean that his death can take place no later than 554, three years before the fall of the [[Western_Wei_Dynasty|last Wei kingdom]].

==Spiritual approach==
[[Image:CentralAsianBuddhistMonks.JPG|thumb|220px|Blue-eyed Central Asian Buddhist monk, possibly Bodhidharma, forming the &quot;Vitarka&quot; [[mudra]] (Symbol of teaching/ discussion of the [[dharma]]), in the direction of a disciple East-Asian monk. Eastern [[Tarim Basin]], China, 9th-10th century.]]
Tradition holds that Bodhidharma's chosen sutra was the  [[Lankavatara Sutra]], a development of the [[Yogacara]] or &quot;Mind-only&quot; school of Buddhism established by the [[Gandhara]]n half-brothers [[Asanga]] and [[Vasubandhu]].  He is described as a &quot;master of the Lankavatara Sutra&quot;, and an early history of Zen in China is titled &quot;Record of the Masters and Disciples of the Lankavatara Sutra&quot; (Chin. Leng-ch'ieh shih-tzu chi).  It is also sometimes said that Bodhidharma himself was the one who brought the Lankavatara to Chinese Buddhism. 

Bodhidharma's approach tended to reject devotional rituals, doctrinal 
debates and verbal formalizations, in favour of an intuitive grasp of 
the &quot;Buddha mind&quot; within everyone, through [[meditation]]. In contrast 
with other Buddhist schools such as [[Pure Land]], Bodhidarma 
emphasized personal [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], rather than the promise 
of [[heaven]].

Bodhidharma also considered spiritual, intellectual and physical excellence as an indivisible whole necessary for enlightenment.
Bodhidharma's mind-and-body approach to enlightenment ultimately 
proved highly attractive to the [[Samurai]] class in Japan, who made 
[[Zen]] their way of life, following their encounter with the 
martial-arts-oriented Zen [[Rinzai School]] introduced to Japan by 
[[Eisai]] in the [[12th century]].

According to legend, he developed two exercise regimens for the monks of the Shaolin Monastery&amp;mdash;the “Yi Jin Jing” (Muscle Change Classic) and the  “Xi Sui Jing” (Marrow Washing Classic)&amp;mdash;which supposedly became the basis of the [[Shaolin (martial arts)|Shaolin style]] of [[Kung fu|Kung Fu]] and subsequently an important influence on the [[martial art]]s of [[East Asia]] in general.
However, it is difficult to determine the veracity of the Shaolin legend.
The ''[[Taiping Guangji|Extensive Records of the Taiping Era]]'' record that, prior to Bodhidharma's arrival in China, monks practiced wrestling for recreation.
Shaolin monastery records state that two of its very first monks, Hui Guang and Seng Chou, were expert in the martial arts years before the arrival of Bodhidharma. 
The exercises attributed to Bodhidharma are consistent with Chinese [[qigong]] exercises and look little like Indian forms of bodywork like [[yoga]].
Scholarship by Chinese martial arts historians has demonstrated that the [[Yijinjing|Yijin jing]] and Xisuijing are most likely Ming dynasty (1368-1644) texts due to the presence of technical terminology from the Daoist &quot;inner alchemy&quot; (neidan) tradition which reached its maturity in the Song.  This argument is summarized by modern historian Lin Boyuan in his ''Zhongguo wushu shi'' as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As for the “Yi Jin Jing” (Muscle Change Classic), a spurious text attributed to Bodhidharma and included in the legend of his transmitting martial arts at the temple, it was writtin in the Ming dynasty, in 1624 CE, by the Daoist priest Zining of Mt. Tiantai, and falsely attributed to Bodhidharma.  Forged prefaces, attributed to the Tang general Li Jing and the Southern Song general Niu Hao were written.  They say that, after Bodhidharma faced the wall for nine years at Shaolin temple, he left behind an iron chest; when the monks opened this chest they found the two books “Xi Sui Jing” (Marrow Washing Classic) and “Yi Jin Jing” within.  The first book was taken by his disciple Huike, and disappeared; as for the second, “the monks selfishly coveted it, practicing the skills therein, falling into heterodox ways, and losing the correct purpose of cultivating the Real.  The Shaolin monks have made some fame for themselves through their fighting skill; this is all due to having obtained this manuscript.”  Based on this, Bodhidharma was claimed to be the ancestor of Shaolin martial arts.  This manuscript is full of errors, absurdities and fantastic claims; it cannot be taken as a legitimate source. (Lin Boyuan, ''Zhongguo wushu shi'', Wuzhou chubanshe, p. 183)&lt;/blockquote&gt;


While early legends associate Bodhidharma with Mt. Song, where the Shaolin temple is located, it is not until the 11th century that we see the appearance of a hagiographical record (in the &quot;Jingde Record of the Transmission of the Lamp,&quot; ''Jingde chuandeng lu'') explicitly associating Bodhidharma with the Shaolin temple.  No mention of Bodhidharma is found in any of the many stele inscriptions preserved at the Shaolin temple from the Tang dynasty.

Legend also associates Bodhidharma with the use of [[tea]] to maintain wakefulness in meditation (the origin of [[Chado]]), and favoured [[paradoxes]], [[conundrum]]s and provocation as a way to break intellectual rigidity (a method which led to the development of [[koan]]).

==Portrayals of Bodhidharma==
Throughout [[Buddhist art]], Bodhidharma is depicted as a rather 
ill-tempered, profusely bearded and wide-eyed barbarian.  He is 
described as &quot;The Blue-Eyed Barbarian&quot; in Chinese texts.

Chan texts also present Bodhidharma as the 28th Chan Patriarch, in an 
uninterrupted line starting with the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], 
through direct and non-verbal transmission.

==Legends==

===Encounter with Emperor Liang===
According to tradition, around 520, during the period of the [[Southern_dynasties|Southern Dynasties]], Bodhidharma was invited to an audience with [[Emperor_Wu_of_Liang_China|Emperor Wudi]] of the [[Liang Dynasty]].

When the Emperor asked him how much merit he had accumulated through building temples and endowing monasteries, Bodhidharma replied, &quot;None at all.&quot;

Perplexed, the Emperor then asked, &quot;Well, what is the fundamental 
teaching of [[Buddhism]]?&quot;

&quot;Vast emptiness, nothing sacred,&quot; was the bewildering reply.

&quot;Listen,&quot; said the Emperor, now losing all patience, 
&quot;just who do you think you are?&quot;

&quot;I have no idea,&quot; Bodhidharma replied.

With this, Bodhidharma was banished from the Court, and is said to 
have sat in [[meditation]] for the next nine years &quot;listening to the 
ants scream&quot;.

===Nine years of gazing at a wall===
Bodhidharma traveled to northern China, to the recently constructed [[Shaolin]] Monastery, where the monks refused him admission.
Bodhidharma sat meditating facing a wall for the next 9 years, boring holes into it with his stare.
Having earned the monks' respect, Bodhidharma was finally permitted to enter the monastery.
There, he found the monks so out of shape from lives spent hunched over scrolls that he introduced a regimen of exercises which later became the foundation of [[Shaolin (martial arts)|Shaolin kung fu]], from which many schools of [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese martial art]] claim descent.

Historically, it is unlikely that Bodhidharma invented [[kung fu]].
There are martial arts manuals that date back to at least the [[Han_dynasty|Han Dynasty]] ([[202 BCE]]&amp;ndash;[[220]] CE), predating both Bodhidharma and the Shaolin Temple.
The codification of the martial arts by monks most likely began with military personnel who retired to monasteries or sought [[sanctuary]] there.
Within the refuge of the monastery, unlike on an unforgiving battlefield, such individuals could, confident in their safety, exchange expertise and perfect their techniques.

===Bringing tea to China===
Japanese legends credit Bodhidharma with bringing [[tea]] to China.  
Supposedly, he cut off his eyelids while meditating, to keep from 
falling asleep.  Tea bushes sprung from the spot where his eyelids 
hit the ground.  It is said that this is the reason for tea being 
so important for meditation and why it helps the meditator to not fall asleep.
This legend is unlikely as tea use in China predates Chan Buddhism in China.
According to Chinese mythology, in 2737 BC the Chinese Emperor, Shennong, scholar and herbalist, was sitting beneath a tree while his servant boiled drinking water.
A leaf from the tree dropped into the water and Shennong decided to try the brew.
The tree was a wild tea tree.
There is an early mention of tea being prepared by servants in a Chinese text of 50 B.C. The first detailed description of tea-drinking is found in an ancient Chinese dictionary, noted by Kuo P'o in A.D. 350.

===Daruma dolls===
{{main|Daruma doll}}
It is also reported that after years of meditation, Bodhidharma lost the usage of his legs.  This legend is still alive in Japan, where legless [[Daruma]] dolls represent Bodhidharma, and are used to make wishes.

===Bodhidharma and Huike===
Bodhidharma was the first Zen [[patriarch]] of China.
All later Chinese and Japanese Zen masters trace their master-disciple lineage to him.
[[Huike]], who was to become the second patriach, was first ignored when he tried to approach him, and left outside in the snow, until he cut his own arm and offered it to the Master. (This is supposedly the origin of the famous 'one hand salute' of the monks who came after him).
Bodhidharma later transmitted to him the insignia of the patriarchs:  the robe, the Buddha's begging bowl, and a copy of the Lankavatara Sutra.

The legend of Huike's self-dismemberment is likely apocryphal. According to Daoxuan, wandering bandits cut off Huike's arm.

==The lineage of Bodhidharma and his disciples==
Although Bodhidharma is commonly said to have had two primary disciples (the monks Daoyu and Huike), a common voice in the &quot;Records&quot; of the ''Long Scroll'' is that of a Yuan, possibly identified with the nun Dharani who was said to have received Bodhidharma's flesh &amp;mdash; his bones having been received by Daoyu, and his marrow received by Huike.
A list of Bodhidharma's early students follows.

e previous nights's downpour had dried out sufficiently to take the weight of the French ordnance. The mud also hindered infantry and cavalry as they trudged into position. When the French artillery eventually opened fire on Wellington's ridge at around 11:35, the expected impact on the Allied troops was diminished by the soft terrain that absorbed the impact of many of the cannon balls. In addition, Wellington had characteristically placed the majority of the Allied army behind the ridgeline - a &quot;[[reverse slope defence]]&quot; - so as to shield the army from the expected barrage.

A crucial element of the French plan of battle was the expectation that Wellington would move his reserve to his right flank in defense of Hougomont. At one point, the French succeeded in breaking into the farm's courtyard before being repulsed, but their attacks on the farm were eventually unsuccessful, and Wellington did not need to use his reserve. Hougomont became a battle within a battle and, throughout that day, its defence continued to draw thousands of valuable French troops, under the command of Jerome Bonaparte, into a fruitless attack while all but a few of Wellington's reserves remained in his centre.

[[Image:Battle of Waterloo map.png|thumb|left|250px|Map of the battle.  French units are in blue, Anglo-Dutch units in red, Prussian in black.]]

At about 13:30, after receiving news of the Prussian advance to his right, Napoleon ordered Marshal Ney to send [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet (Napoleonic soldier)|d'Erlon]]'s infantry forward against Wellington's centre left passing to the east of the farm [[La Haye Sainte]]. The attack centred on the Dutch 1st Brigade commanded by Major-General [[Willem Frederik van Bylandt]], which was one of the few units placed on the forward slope of the ridge. After suffering an intense artillery bombardment and exchanging volleys with d'Erlon's leading elements for some nine minutes, van Bylandt's outnumbered soldiers were forced to retreat over the ridge and through the lines of General [[Thomas Picton]]'s division. Picton's division included veteran regiments from the [[Peninsular War|Peninsular campaign]] among which were the Highland regiments, some of the few battle-hardened regiments that remained with Wellington's British contingent at Waterloo. Picton's division moved forward over the ridgeline to engage d'Erlon. The British were likewise mauled by volley-fire and close-quarter attacks, but Picton's soldiers stood firm, eventually breaking up the attack by charging the French columns.
 
Cavalry formations were ordered to charge in support of the infantry attack; the Household Brigade (1st and 2nd Life Guards and Royal Horse Guards), the Union Brigade (Royals, [[Scots Greys]] and Inniskillings) and Vivian’s Hussar Brigade (10th and 18th Hussars and 1st Hussars, [[King's German Legion]]). The French assault was then driven off by the British heavy cavalry commanded by [[Henry William Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Uxbridge]] in the famous charge of the Scots Greys. The cavalry charge destroyed d'Erlon's column, but, rather than reform, they galloped on to attack French guns and were in turn counterattacked by French cavalry. Major-General [[William Ponsonby]], commanding the Union Brigade was killed. This spectacular event cost the heavy cavalry so dearly that, collectively, they played little part in the remainder of the battle. 

Meanwhile, the Prussians began to appear on the field. Napoleon sent his reserve, Lobau's VI corps and 2 cavalry divisions, some 15,000 troops, to hold them back. With this, Napoleon had committed all of his infantry reserves, except the Guard. 

When Napoleon unexpectedly left the field in the early afternoon (an incident disputed among historians), Ney, the epitome of French [[wikt:elan|élan]], mistook an Allied manoeuvre to reposition further back from the ridge as a general retreat. With no consultation, and without any participation by infantry or artillery, he ordered one cavalry regiment to advance, then another, then another until a massed assault of over 5,000 cavalry was thundering - and struggling - up the steep slope. Historian [[David Hamilton-Williams]] contends that as Napoleon had not left the field, and as the positioning of the cavalry before the attack took over an half hour, there was ample time to countermand Ney, leading him to the conclusion that the cavalry charge was ordered by the Emperor himself{{fact}}.

The cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the solid Allied infantry squares (four ranks deep with fixed bayonets - vulnerable to artillery or infantry, but deadly to cavalry), the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive counter-charges of the Allied Light Cavalry regiments and the Dutch Heavy Cavalry Brigade. After numerous fruitless attacks on the Allied ridge, the French cavalry was exhausted.  

The Prussians were already engaging the Imperial Army's right flank when [[La Haye Sainte]] fell to French combined arms (infantry, artillery and cavalry), because the defending [[King's German Legion]] had run out of amunition in the early evening. The Prussians had driven Lobau out of Plancenoit, which was on the extreme (Allied) left of the battle field. Therefore Napoleon sent his 10 battalion strong Young Guard to beat the Prussians back. But after very hard fighting the Young Guard was beaten back. Napoleon sent 2 battalions of Old Guard and after ferocious fighting they beat the Prussians out. But the Prussians had not been forced away far enough. Approximately 30,000 Prussians attacked Plancenoit again. The place was defended by 20,000 Frenchmen in and around the village. The Old Guard and other supporting troops were able to hold on for about one hour before a massive Prussian counter-attack kicked them out after some bloody street fighting lasting more than a half hour. The last to flee was the Old Guard who defended the church and cemetery. The French casualties at the end of the day were horrible; for example the 1er Tirailleurs of the Young Guard had 92% losses.

[[Image:sunken-road-at-waterloo.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The Sunken Road at Waterloo, by Stanley Berkley.]]

With Wellington's centre exposed by the French taking [[La Haye Sainte]], Napoleon committed his last reserve, the undefeated [[Imperial Guard]]. After marching through a blizzard of shell and shrapnel, the already outnumbered 5 battalions of middle guard defeated the allied first line, including British, Brunswick and Nassau troops. Meanwhile elements of General von Ziethen's 1st Prussian Army Corps had finally arrived helping to relieve the pressure on Wellington's left flank, thus allowing Wellington to strengthen his shaken centre. The French guard battalions marched on, and the situation became critical. Chassé's Netherlands division was sent forward. Chassé sent forward his artillery to halt the French advance. Their fire took the victorious grenadiers in the flank. This still couldn't stop the Guard's advance, so Chassé ordered his first brigade to charge the French. 

Meanwhile, to the west, 1,500 British Guards under [[Peregrine Maitland|Maitland]] were lying down to protect themselves from the French artillery. They rose as one, and devastated the shocked Imperial Guard with volleys of fire at point-blank range. The French chasseurs deployed to answer the fire. After 10 minutes of exchanging musketry the outnumbered French began wavering. This was the sign for a bayonet charge. But then a fresh French chasseur battalion appeared on the scene. The British guard retired with the French in pursuit - though the French in their turn were attacked by fresh British troops of Adam's brigade. 

The Imperial Guard, for the first time in history, fell back in disarray and chaos. A ripple of panic passed through the French lines - &quot;La garde recule. Sauve qui peut!&quot; (&quot;The Guard retreats. Save yourself if you can!&quot;). Wellington, judging that the retreat by the Imperial Guard had unnerved all the French soldiers who saw it, stood up in the stirrups on ''Copenhagen'', his favourite horse, and waved his hat in the air, signalling a general advance. The long-suffering Anglo-Allied infantry rushed forward from the lines where they had been shelled all day, and threw themselves upon the retreating French.

After its unsuccessful attack on the Allied centre, the French Imperial Guard rallied to their reserves of three battalions, (some sources say four) just south of ''La Haye Sainte'' for a [[last stand]] against the British. A charge from General [[Frederick Adam|Adam]]'s Brigade and an element of the 5th Brigade (The Hanoverian Landwehr (Militia) Osnabruck Battalion), both in the second Anglo-allied division under Lieutenant General Sir [[Henry Clinton (Napoleonic Wars)|Henry Clinton]], threw them into a state of confusion; those which were left in semi-coherent units fought and retreated towards ''La Belle Alliance''. It was during this stand that Colonel [[Hugh Halkett]] took the surrender of General [[Cambronne]]. It was probably during the destruction of one of the retreating semi-coherent squares from the area around ''La Haye Sainte'' towards ''[[La Belle Alliance]]'' that the famous retort to a request to surrender was made '''&quot;La Garde meurt, elle ne se rend pas!&quot;''' &quot;''The Guard dies, it does not surrender!''&quot;{{ref|Cambronne}}.  

[[Image:Field of Waterloo - Project Gutenberg eBook 11921.jpg|thumbnail|300px|The Field at Waterloo, as depicted in the 1851 Illustrated London Reading Book]]

At about same time as the Imperial Guard was thrown back, the Prussians finally drove the French out of the village of [[Plancenoit]] and Zieten's Corps entered the gap between d'Erlon and Lobau, essentially taking the French position from the rear. 

The whole of the French front started to disintegrate under the general advance of the Anglo-allied army and the Prussians following the capture of Plancenoit. The last coherent French force consisted of two battalions of the Old Guard stationed around the inn called ''La Belle Alliance''. This was a final reserve and a personal bodyguard for Napoleon. For a time Napoleon hoped that if they held firm the French Army could rally behind them. But as the retreat turned into a rout, they were forced to form squares as protection against the leading elements of allied cavalry. They formed into two squares, one on either side of ''La Belle Alliance''. Until he was persuaded that the battle was lost and he should leave, Napoleon commanded the square which was formed on rising ground to the (Allied) right of the inn. The Prussians engaged the square to the left, and General Adam's Brigade charged the square on the right, forcing it to withdraw. As dusk fell both squares retreated away from the battlefield towards France in relatively good order but the French artillery, and everything else belonging to them, fell into the hands of the British and Prussians. The retreating Guards were surrounded by thousands of fleeing Frenchmen who were no longer part of any coherent unit. British and Allied cavalry harried the fleeing French until about 23:00 hours. The Prussians, led by [[August von Gneisenau|General von Gneisenau]], pursued them throughout the night.

== Conclusion ==
At around 21:00 Wellington and Blücher met at Napoleon's former headquarters ''La Belle Alliance'', signifying the end of the battle.
Waterloo cost the Anglo-allied forces around 15,000 dead and wounded, and the Prussians some 7000. Napoleon lost 25,000 dead and injured. 8000 of his troops were taken prisoner.

After the French defeat at Waterloo and the final battle of the Napoleonic Wars at the [[Battle of Wavre]], Napoleon was deposed and remained at large for some time in France before surrendering to the British. He was subsequently exiled to [[Saint Helena]], where he died in [[1821]].

==The battlefield today==
[[Image:Waterloo Lion.jpg|thumb|200px|Lion Monument at Waterloo, erected by the Dutch on the spot where it is believed the Prince of Orange was wounded. ]] 
The current terrain of the battlefield is very different from what it would have been in 1815.  In [[1820]], the Dutch King [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] ordered the construction of a monument on the spot where it was believed his son, the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]], had been wounded.  A giant mound was constructed here, using 300,000 cubic meters of earth taken from other parts of the battlefield, including Wellington's sunken road.  Wellington, when visiting the site years later, allegedly complained &quot;they've spoiled my battlefield!&quot;

==Waterloo in popular culture==
* The phrase ''to meet one's Waterloo'' (or similar) has entered the English language as a word signifying a great test with a final and decisive outcome- usually a negative one, in recognition of Napoleon's defeat; e.g. [http://politics.guardian.co.uk/election2001/story/0,9029,506043,00.html], [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/sport/rugby.html?in_article_id=367609&amp;in_page_id=1780]. 
* &quot;The Adventures of Gerard&quot; (1903) by Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] contains a chapter &quot;How the Brigadier Bore Himself at Waterloo&quot;, about his fictional hero Brigadier [[Etienne Gerard]]. The chapter consists of two short stories which were originally published separately. [[Project Gutenberg]]:[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1644 The Adventures of Gerard] ([http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/8623 Audio Book])
* &quot;Waterloo: Sharpe's Final Adventure Campaign&quot; is a novel by [[Bernard Cornwell]], which sets his fictional hero [[Richard Sharpe (fictional character)|Richard Sharpe]] at the battle on the staff of the non-fictional [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]]. The book was later adapted for television by the [[ITV]] and starred [[Sean Bean]] as Sharpe.    
* ''[[Waterloo (movie)|Waterloo]]'' was an [[1970]] Italian-Russian film, directed by [[Sergei Bondarchuk]]. It was the story of the preliminary events and the battle, and is remembered for its lavish battle scenes.
* The band [[ABBA]] made a song titled ''[[Waterloo (English version)|Waterloo]]'' that won the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in 1974.
* The famous quote attributed to Wellington (&quot;The battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton&quot;) was certainly an invention; unlike his older brother, Wellington got poor grades at Eton; on one of his rare visits back there, the only athletic activities he could remember were skipping across a brook, and fisticuffs with a fellow student.
* In the video game [[Psychonauts]], [[Characters in Psychonauts#Fred Bonaparte|Fred Bonaparte]], an insane asylum employee and descendant of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], loses his sanity after continuously losing a game of &quot;Waterloo&quot; with a patient, and develops a split personality between himself and his forefather.
* In [[Blackadder]] Back and Forth, Lord Blackadder travels back in time and accidently kills Wellington before the battle of Waterloo; when he returns to the future England is full of French culture, so he time-travels once again to ensure that the Duke lives.
*Waterloo is a song by American Metal Band Iced Earth about the battle at Waterloo on the Album [[The Glorious Burden]], however it is only available on the 2 Disc Special Edition in America

Naturally-occurring toxins that can be used as weapons include [[Ricin]], [[SEB (virus)|SEB]], [[Botulism toxin]], [[Saxitoxin]], and many [[Mycotoxin]]s.

==Attacking crops and animals==
Biological warfare can also specifically target plants to destroy crops or defoliate vegetation.  The United States and Britain discovered plant growth regulators (i.e., [[herbicides]]) during the Second World War, and initiated a [[Herbicidal Warfare]] program that was eventually used in Malaya and Vietnam in counter insurgency.  Though [[herbicides]] are chemicals, they are often grouped with biological warfare as bioregulators in a similar manner as biotoxins.

The United States developed an anti-crop capability during the Cold War that used plant diseases ([[bioherbicide]]s, or [[mycoherbicide]]s) for destroying enemy agriculture.  It was believed that destruction of enemy agriculture on a strategic scale could thwart Sino-Soviet aggression in a general war.  Diseases such as [[wheat blast]] and [[rice blast]] were weaponized in aerial spray tanks and cluster bombs for delivery to enemy water sheds in agricultural regions to initiate epiphytotics (epidemics among plants).  When the United States renounced its offensive biological warfare program in 1969 and 1970, the vast majority of its biological arsenal was composed of these plant diseases.

Attacking animals is another area of biological warfare intended to eliminate animal resources for transportation and food.  In the First World War German agents were arrested attempting to inoculate draft animals with anthrax, and believed responsible for outbreaks of glanders in horses and mules.  The British tainted small feed cakes with anthrax in the Second World War as a potential means of attacking German cattle for food denial, but never employed the weapon.  In the 1950's the United States had a field trial with Hog Cholera.

==Protective measures==

The primary civil defense against biological weaponry is to [[hand washing|wash one's hands]] whenever one moves to a different building or set of people, and avoid touching door knobs, walls, the ground and one's mouth and nose.  Washing literally sends the germs down the drain.

More exotic methods include decontamination, usually done with household chlorine bleach (5% solution of [[sodium hypochlorite]]).  One useful decontamination is to leave shoes in an entranceway and make people wade and handwash in a footbath of bleach.  Another useful technique is to periodically decontaminate floors and door knobs.

Medical methods of civil defense include stockpiles of antibiotics and vaccines, and training for quick, accurate diagnoses and treatment.  Many weaponized diseases are unfamiliar to general practitioners.

Positive pressure shelters are possible but not cost-effective except for the most important installations.  This is because in most attacks, the agent will disperse in a long narrow ellipse downwind from the release point.  Persons outside the ellipse will not be affected except by secondary infection.  Persons within the release ellipse cannot be helped by civil defense measures.  They need medical diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible.

New wound dressings such as the [[biodressing]] are aiding the treatment possibilites of persons who sustain injury in areas contaminated by biological weaponry.

==The role of public health departments and disease surveillance==
It is important to note that all of the classical and modern biological weapons organisms are animal diseases, the only exception being smallpox.  Thus, in any use of biological weapons, it is highly likely that animals will become ill either simultaneously with, or perhaps earlier than humans.  Indeed, in the largest biological weapons &quot;accident&quot; known -- the anthrax outbreak in Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg) in the Soviet Union in 1979, sheep became ill with anthrax as far as 200 kilometers from the release point of the organism from a military facility in the southeastern portion of the city (known as Compound 15 and still off limits to visitors today).  

Thus, a robust surveillance system involving human clinicians and veterinarians may identify a bioweapons attack early in the course of an epidemic, permitting the prophylaxis of disease in the vast majority of people (and/or animals) exposed but not yet ill.  For example in the case of anthrax, it is likely that by 24 -36 hours after an attack, some small percentage of individuals (those with compromised immune system or who had received a large dose of the organism due to proximity to the release point) will become ill with classical symptoms and signs (including a virtually unique chest X-ray finding, often recognized by public health officials if they receive timely reports).  By making this data available to local public health officials in real-time, most models of anthrax epidemics indicate that more than 80% of an exposed population can receive antibiotic treatment before becoming symptomatic, and thus avoiding the high mortality of the disease.

The '''Book of Nehemiah''' is a book of the [[Hebrew Bible]], known to Jews as the [[Tanakh]] and to Christians as the [[Old Testament]].  It is historically regarded as a continuation of the [[Book of Ezra]].

Traditionally, the author of this book is believed to be [[Nehemiah]] himself; many modern scholars dispute this. There are portions of the book written in the first person (ch. 1-7; 12:27-47, and 13). But there are also portions of it in which Nehemiah is spoken of in the third person (ch. 8; 9; 10). Some, following the traditional attribution to Nehemiah, suppose that these portions may have been written by [[Ezra]] (of this, however, there is no distinct evidence), and had their place assigned them in the book probably by Nehemiah, as the responsible author of the whole book, with the exception of ch. 12:11, 22, 23. Other authors think that the historical order of events in both Ezra and Nehemiah has become jumbled, from which they conclude that at least the final arrangement and revision of their text must have occurred at a later period.

If Nehemiah was the author, the date at which the book was written was probably about [[431 BC|431]] - [[430 BC]], when Nehemiah had returned the second time to [[Jerusalem]] after his visit to [[Iran|Persia]].

The book consists of four parts:
#An account of the rebuilding of the wall of Jerusalem, and of the register Nehemiah had found of those who had returned from [[Babylon]] (ch. 1-7). 
#An account of the state of religion among the [[Jew]]s during this time (8-10). 
#Increase of the inhabitants of Jerusalem; the census of the adult male population, and names of the chiefs, together with lists of priests and [[Levite]]s (11-12:1-26). 
#Dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, the arrangement of the [[Second Temple|temple]] officers, and the reforms carried out by Nehemiah (12:27-ch. 13).

This book closes the history of the Old Testament, if [[Book of Esther|Esther]] is considered unhistorical. [[Malachi]] the prophet was possibly contemporary with Nehemiah.

:''For '''jer''', an alternate spelling for the reduced vowels in Common Slavic, see [[yer]].''
The '''Book of Jeremiah''', or '''Jeremiah''' (&amp;#1497;&amp;#1460;&amp;#1512;&amp;#1456;&amp;#1502;&amp;#1456;&amp;#1497;&amp;#1464;&amp;#1492;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1468; ''Yirmiyahu'' in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]), is a book that is part of the [[Hebrew Bible]], [[Judaism]]'s [[Tanakh]], and later became a part of [[Christianity]]'s [[Old Testament]]. It was originally written in a complex and poetic Hebrew (apart from verse 10:11, curiously written in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]), recording the words and events surrounding the life of the [[Jew]]ish [[prophet]] Jeremiah who lived at the time of the destruction of [[Solomon's Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]] during the fall of the [[Kingdom of Judah]] at the hands of [[Babylonia]].  

==Contents==

It consists of twenty-three separate and independent sections, arranged in five sub-sections or &quot;books&quot;. 

#The introduction, ch. 1. 
#Reproofs of the sins of the Jews, consisting of seven sections, (1.) ch. 2; (2.) ch. 3-6; (3.) ch. 7-10; (4.) ch. 11-13; (5.) ch. 14-17:18; (6.) ch. 17:19-ch. 20; (7.) ch. 21-24. 
#A general review of all nations, in two sections, (1.) ch. 46-49; (2.) ch. 25; with an historical appendix of three sections, (1.) ch. 26; (2.) ch. 27; (3.) ch. 28, 29. 
#Two sections picturing the hopes of better times, (1.) ch. 30, 31; (2.) ch. 32,33; to which is added an historical appendix in three sections, (1.) ch. 34:1-7; (2.) ch. 34:8-22; (3.) ch. 35. 
#The conclusion, in two sections, (1.) ch. 36; (2.) ch. 45.

In Egypt, after an interval, Jeremiah is supposed to have
added three sections, viz., ch. 37-39; 40-43; and 44.

The principal Messianic prophecies are found in 23:1-8;
31:31-40; and 33:14-26.

[[Jeremiah (prophet)|Jeremiah]]'s prophecies are noted for the frequent repetitions found in them of the same words and phrases and imagery. They cover the period of about 30 years. They are not recorded in the order of time. When and under what circumstances this book assumed its present form we know not.

==Prophecies of Jeremiah==
(From the [[public domain]] [[Jewish Encyclopedia]])

*A proclamation of the certain fall of Jerusalem made, according to the superscription to Zedekiah and the people, during the [[siege of Jerusalem]], i.e., about 588 B.C. (xxi. 1-10); 

*Prophecies against the kings of Judah in the time of Jehoiakim (608;xxi. 11-xxii. 19), completed by the passage xxii. 20-30, descriptive of the leading away of Jehoiachin into captivity (597); 

*threats against the &quot;unfaithful shepherds&quot; (i.e., the prophets), the promise of peace and of the real shepherd (after 597), and warnings against false prophets and godless priests (perhaps in the time of Jehoiakim; xxiii. 1-8, 9-40); 

*vision of the two baskets of figs, illustrating the fate of the captives and of those who were left behind, from the period after the first deportation by Nebuchadnezzar, in 597 (xxiv.); 

*threats of punishments to be inflicted on Judah and the surrounding nations, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, i.e., the year of the battle of Carchemish (605; xxv.); 

*the first of the historical passages recounting Jeremiah's prophecy in the Temple (comp. vii.), his arrest, his threatened death, and his rescue, in which connection the martyrdom of the prophet Uriah is briefly mentioned (xxvi.).

*Utterances from the time of Zedekiah (see § II.), with an appendix, the last connected prophecy of any length, in ch. xxxv., treating of the fidelity of the Rechabites and of the unfaithfulness of Judah. This dates from a somewhat earlier period, that of Jehoiakim (because certainly before 597), and thus forms a transition to the first passages of the narrative sections.

==Septuagint version==

The [[Septuagint]] version of this book is, in its arrangement and in
other particulars, different from others. The septuagint omits 10:6-8; 27:19-22; 29:16-20; 33:14-26; 39:4-13; 52:2, 3, 15, 28-30, etc. About 2,700 words in all of the original are omitted.

According to the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]], ''a comparison of the Masoretic text with the Septuagint throws some light on the last phase in the history of the origin of the Book of Jeremiah, inasmuch as the translation into Greek was already under way before the work on the Hebrew book had come to an end... The two texts differ above all in that the Septuagint is much shorter... Even if the text of the Septuagint is proved to be the older, it does not necessarily follow that all these variations first arose after the Greek translation had been made, because two different editions of the same text might have been in process of development side by side...''

==Qumran version==

The Book of Jeremiah has also been found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] in cave 4 in [[Qumran]]. One text is the hebrew variant of the [[Septuagint]] version. This may shed some light on why the Septaugint version differs from the [[masoretic]] version. It was previously thought that the difference was due to poor translation, but it is now thought by many that the masoretic version has been reworked, or that there were two versions of this book.

{{Books of the Old Testament}}
{{Books of Nevi'im}}
'''Isaiah''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] &amp;#1497;&amp;#64298;&amp;#1506;&amp;#1497;&amp;#1492;&amp;#1493; ''Yeshayahu'' or ''Y&amp;#601;&amp;scaron;a&amp;lsquo;&amp;#259;y&amp;#257;hû'') is a book of the Jewish [[Hebrew Bible]] as well as the Christian [[Old Testament]], containing prophecies attributed to [[Isaiah]].  This book is often seen by scholars as being divided into at least two sections. The first section, consisting of chapters 1-39, is generally accepted as being written by the prophet Isaiah of [[Jerusalem]], or by his followers who took down his words. The second section, chapters 40-66, is of more debatable origin, as will be described further below.

Isaiah’s messages assume we know something of the rest of the Bible, particularly the earlier books of the [[Old Testament]]. He affirms that God is determined to take and keep a people for himself. Isaiah sees this as self-evident, seeing as God bothered with an unattractive bunch of slaves in Egypt, who incessantly grumbled while he was rescuing them. The descendents were no better - they were the thankless unfaithful men and women of Isaiah’s time. It is only the covenant love of God that explains it.

God has determined to save and no one can stop him from doing it. He has chosen a people to praise and serve him, a people he calls out of bondage into a loving relationship with him. God has committed himself to these people and so they have hope who remain faithful to him (Isaiah 54:10 declares God’s steadfast resolve). The doctrine of election arises again in Isaiah. There is also the doctrine of the remnant – not all Israel are of Israel (see Isaiah 1:9 for example). Those who remain faithful are very few, like a flag-pole on a hilltop (Isaiah 30:17), or the stump of a tree that has been chopped down (6:13), gleanings or the few olives left at the top of a tree (17:6). But God will never cast his elect away (41:8-9, or 42:18-44:5).

== Content ==
The first 39 chapters of Isaiah consist primarily of prophecies of the judgments awaiting nations that are persecuting [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]].  These nations include Babylon, Assyria, Philistia, Moab, Syria, [[Israel]] (the northern kingdom), Ethiopia, Egypt, Arabia, and Phoenicia.  The prophecies concerning them can be summarized as saying that [[Tetragrammaton|God]] is the God of the whole earth, and that nations which think of themselves as secure in their own power and might will be conquered by other nations, at [[Tetragrammaton|God]]'s command.

The judgments, however, are not only against those who persecute Isaiah's country, [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]].  Chapters 1-5 and 28-29 prophesy judgment against [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] itself.  [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] thinks itself safe because of its covenant relationship with [[Tetragrammaton|God]], the God of all the earth.  However, [[Tetragrammaton|God]] tells [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], through Isaiah, that the covenant cannot protect them when they have broken it by idolatry, the worship of other gods, and by acts of injustice and cruelty, which oppose [[Tetragrammaton|God]]'s law.

Some exceptions to this overall foretelling of doom do occur, throughout the early chapters of the book.  Chapter 6 describes Isaiah's call to be a prophet of [[Tetragrammaton|God]].  Chapters 35-39 provide historical material about King [[Hezekiah]] and his triumph of faith in [[Tetragrammaton|God]].

Chapters 24-34, while too complex to characterize easily, are primarily concerned with prophecies of a &quot;[[Messiah]],&quot; a person anointed or given power by God, and of the [[Messiah]]'s kingdom, where justice and righteousness will reign.  This section is seen by Jews as describing an actual king, a descendant of their great king, David, who will make [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] a great kingdom and [[Jerusalem]] a truly holy city.  It is traditionally seen by [[Christianity|Christians]] as describing [[Jesus]], who was descended from David, and who, they believe, began a non-political kingdom of justice which will one day encompass the whole earth. At present, this kingdom has more reality in non-physical planes than in the material world.  A number of modern scholars believe that it describes, in somewhat idealized terms, King [[Hezekiah]], who was a descendant of David, and who tried to make [[Jerusalem]] into a holy city.

The prophecy continues with what some have called “The Book of Comfort” which begins in chapter 40 and completes the writing. In the first eight chapters of this book of comfort, Isaiah prophesies the deliverance of the [[Jew|Jews]] from the hands of the Babylonians and restoration of [[Israel]] as a unified nation in the land promised to them bm].  Some writers have suggested that the huge program cost may actually include costs for other [[black project]]s that remain classified.  The high per-unit cost may also be partially explained by the small number of planes produced coupled with a large research overhead in the B-2 program. 

These bombers were originally designed to deliver [[nuclear weapons]] during the [[Cold War]], and support for them dwindled as military spending declined. In May of [[1995 in aviation|1995]], in a study commissioned by Congress, the Institute For Defense Analysis concluded that after the demise of the [[Soviet Union]], there was no need for more B-2s.

==Combat==
[[Image:B-2 Spirit Night 2.JPG|thumb|right|330px|This Spirit was photographed in 2004 at [[Andersen Air Force Base]], [[Guam]].]]
The B-2 was derided by many as being too expensive to risk in combat. However, the aircraft has seen service in three separate campaigns.

Its first combat was during the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999. The aircraft performed well, and it introduced the satellite guided [[Joint Direct Attack Munition|JDAM]] bomb to the world as well. Since then the aircraft has seen combat over [[Afghanistan]] in [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and [[Iraq]] in [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Operation Iraqi Freedom]].

The missions to Afghanistan saw a first for the aircraft. After flying bombing missions over Afghanistan, the aircraft concerned landed at [[Diego Garcia]], were refueled and had a crew change before launching on another combat mission. This was taken a step further during the Iraq campaign when B-2s were actually based at Diego Garcia.

Later missions to Iraq were launched and returned to Whiteman AFB in Missouri. This resulted in missions lasting over 30 hours and even one mission of over 50 hours. B-2 crews have been used to pioneer sleep cycle research to improve combat crew performance over extended periods.

In the Pentagon's Operational Test and Evaluation 2003 Annual Report it noted that the B-2's overall mission capable rate for FY03 was still short of original requirements, primarily due to maintenance of the B-2's Low Observable materials. It also noted that the Defensive Avionics suite also had shortcomings in warning of pop-up threats.  Despite these problems the B-2 maintained a high mission-capable state for Operation Iraqi Freedom, dropping 583 JDAMs during the conflict. [http://pogo.org/m/dp/dp-2003-B2.pdf]

==Trivia==
*Weighing in at 2,300,000 [[Troy weight|troy ounces]] (71,668 kg), each B-2 cost over $950.00 per troy ounce ($30/g) which is just under double its weight in [[gold]].

*Most B-2s are named for states in the US, following the naming convention &quot;Spirit of [state].&quot;  The two exceptions are &quot;Spirit of America&quot; (AV-1) and &quot;Spirit of [[Kitty Hawk]]&quot; (AV-19).

*The B-2 simulator at Whiteman AFB has been dubbed &quot;Spirit of Hell&quot; by students who have endured marathon training sessions in it.

'''Beavers''' are semi-aquatic [[rodent]]s native to [[North America]] and [[Europe]].  They are the only members of the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Castoridae''', which contains a single [[genus]], '''''Castor'''''. [[genetics|Genetic]] [[research]] has shown the European and North American beaver populations to be distinct [[species]] and that [[hybrid]]ization is unlikely.

Beavers are best known for their natural trait of building [[dam]]s in [[river]]s and [[stream]]s, and building [[lodge]]s in the eventual artificial [[pond]].  They are the second largest rodents, after the [[capybara]].  
Beavers continue to grow throughout life. Adult [[specimen]]s weighing over 25 [[kilogram|kg]] (55 lb) are not uncommon.  Females are as large as, or larger than males of the same age, which is uncommon in most species.

==Species==
The [[European Beaver]] (''Castor fiber'') was hunted almost to [[extinction]] in [[Europe]], both for [[fur]], and for ''[[castoreum]]'', a [[secretion]] of its [[scent gland]] believed to have [[medicine|medicinal]] properties.  However, the beaver is now being re-introduced throughout Europe.  Several thousands live on the [[Elbe]], the [[Rhone River|Rhone]] and in parts of [[Scandinavia]].  They have been [[reintroduction|reintroduced]] in [[Bavaria]] and [[The Netherlands]] and are tending to spread to new locations.  The beaver finally became extinct in [[Great Britain]] in the [[sixteenth century]]: [[Giraldus Cambrensis]] reported in [[1188]] (''Itinerarium'' ii.iii) that it was to be found only in the [[Teifi]] in [[Wales]] and in one river in [[Scotland]], though his observations are clearly [[first hand]]. 

In [[October]] [[2005]], six European beavers were re-introduced to Britain in Lower Mill Estate in [[Gloucestershire]], and there are plans for re-introductions in [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]].[http://www.msn.co.uk/htx/returnofthebeaver/]

The [[American Beaver]] (''C. canadensis'') is the [[List of national animals|national animal]] of [[Canada]]; in fact, it is depicted on the [[Nickel (Canadian coin)|Canadian five-cent piece]] and was on the first Canadian [[postage stamp]], the Three Penny Beaver. However, in several areas of that country, it is considered a [[pest (animal)|pest]]. The American Beaver is also the state animal of [[Oregon]], the [[List of U.S. state mammals|state mammal]] of [[New York]] (after the historical emblem of [[New Netherland]]) and the mascot of [[Oregon State University]]. It is also a common school emblem for [[engineering]] schools, including the [[California Institute of Technology]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. It is also an emblem for [[London School of Economics]] and the name of its student newspaper - [[The Beaver]].

The extinct North American [[Giant beaver]] (''Castoroides ohioensis'') was one of largest rodents that ever [[evolution|evolved]]. It disappeared, with other large mammals in the [[Holocene extinction event]], about 10,000 years ago.

==Dams==
[[Image:Biber-Brahe.jpg|thumb|Beaver tree]]
The dams are created both as a protection against predators, e.g., coyotes, wolves and bears, and to provide easy access to food during winter. It is both the sound of water in motion and the current that stimulates the beavers to build. If for example a pipe is placed under the dam to drain it the beavers may stuff it with a tree trunk unless the pipe inlet is protected with a large cage-like filter. They  may repair any damage to the dam and build it higher as long as the sound is there, however, in times of high water, they often allow spillways in the dam to flow freely. Conversely, beavers will attempt to build dams in response to recordings of water flowing even in the absence of water.

The ponds created by well-maintained dams help isolate the beavers' home, their ''lodge'', also created from severed branches and mud. The lodge has underwater entrances to make entry nearly impossible for any other animal (however, [[musk rat|muskrats]] have been seen living inside beaver lodges with the beavers who made it).

Destroying a beaver dam without removing the beavers takes a lot of effort, especially if the dam is downstream of an active lodge. Beavers can rebuild such primary dams overnight, but may not defend secondary dams as vigorously.

Recent studies involving beaver habitual activities have indicated that beavers may respond to a array of stimuli, not just the sound of running water. In two experiments Wilson (1971) and Richard (1967, 1980) demonstrate that although beavers will pile material close to a loudspeaker emitting sounds of water running, they only do so after a considerable period of time. Additionally the beavers, when faced with a pipe allowing water to pass through their dam, eventually stopped the flow of water by plugging the pipe with mud and sticks. The beavers were observed to do this even when the pipe extended several meters upstream and near the bottom of the stream and thus produced no sound of running water.

Beaver dams can be disruptive; the flooding can cause extensive property damage, and when the flooding occurs next to a railroad roadbed, it can cause derailments by washing-out under the tracks, or when a beaver dam bursts and the resulting flash flood overwhelms a culvert.

Yet dam building activity restores wetlands, the land's most beneficial ecosystem.  Such wetland benefits include flood control downstream, biodiversity (by providing habitat for many rare as well as common species), and water cleansing, both by the breakdown of toxins such as pesticides and the retention of silt by beaver dams. The latter also reduces erosion as well as decreasing turbidity that is the limiting factor for aquatic life.

When objectionable beaver flooding occurs, modern water level control devices can be installed for a cost-effective and environmentally sound solution (www.BeaversWW.org).

==Danger signal==
When startled or frightened, a swimming beaver will rapidly dive while forcefully slapping the water with its broad tail.  This creates a loud 'slap', audible over large distances above and below water.  This noise serves as a warning to other beavers in the area.  Once a beaver has made this danger signal, all nearby beavers will dive and may not reemerge for some time.

==Fur trade==
Beaver pelts were used as [[barter]] by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in the [[17th century]] to gain [[Europe|European]] goods. They were then shipped back to [[Great Britain]] and [[France]] where they were made into clothing items. Widespread hunting and trapping of beavers lead to their endangerment. Eventually, the [[fur trade]] fell apart due to declining demand in Europe and the take over of trapping grounds to support the growing agriculture sector.

==Popular culture==
Popular western culture typically depicts the animal positively, as a good natured and industrious character such as Mr. and Mrs. Beaver who are important heroic characters in the classic [[fantasy novel]], ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]''.  Since the animal is a [[national symbol]] of [[Canada]], the animal is a favourite choice for depicting Canadians as furry characters and was chosen to be the [[mascot]] of [[1976 Summer Olympics ]] held in [[Montreal]] with the name &quot;Amik&quot; (&quot;friend&quot; in [[Algonquin language|Algonquin]]). The beaver's habits, habitat and conservation status (as of 1908) are recurring themes in ''[[The Tent Dwellers]]'', by [[Albert Bigelow Paine]].  Due to their engineering capabilities, they also serve as the mascots of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and the [[California Institute of Technology]].

==[[1911 encyclopedia]] text==
'''Beaver''', the largest European aquatic representative of the mammalian order RODENTIA, easily recognized by its large trowel-like, scaly tail, which is expanded in the horizontal direction. 

The word is descended from the Aryan name of the animal, cf. Sanskrit ''babhru's,'' brown, the great ichneumon, Lat. ''fiber,'' Ger. ''Biber,'' Swed. ''bäver,'' Russ. ''bobr';'' the root ''bhru'' has given &quot;brown,&quot; and, through Romanic, &quot;bronze&quot; and &quot;burnish.&quot;

The true beaver (''Castor fiber'') is a native of Europe and northern Asia, but it is represented in North America by a closely-allied species (''C. canadensis''), chiefly distinguished by the form of the nasal bones of the skull. 
[[Image:Beaver dam in Yellowstone.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Yellowstone National Park]].]]
Beavers are nearly allied to the [[squirrel]]s (Sciuridae), agreeing in certain structural peculiarities of the lower jaw and skull. In the Sciuridae the two main bones (tibia and fibula) of the lower half of the leg are quite separate, the tail is round and hairy, and the habits are arboreal and terrestrial. In the beavers or Castoridae these bones are in close contact at their lower ends, the tail is depressed, expanded and scaly, and the habits are aquatic. 

[[Image:Beaver dam in Tierra del Fuego.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Tierra del Fuego]].]]

Beavers have webbed hind-feet, and the claw of the second hind-toe double. They have poor eyesight, but a keen sense of hearing, smell, and touch.

In length beavers--European and American--measure about 2 ft. exclusive of the tail, which is about 10 inches long. They are covered with a fur to which they owe their chief commercial value; this consists of two kinds of hair--the one close-set, silky and of a greyish colour, the other much coarser and longer, and of a reddish brown. 

Beavers are essentially aquatic in their habits, never travelling by land unless driven by necessity. Formerly common in England, the European beaver has 
not only been exterminated there, but likewise in most of the countries of the continent, although a few remain on the [[Elbe]], the [[Rhone River|Rhone]] and in parts of Scandinavia. The American species 
is also greatly diminished in numbers from incessant pursuit for the sake of its valuable fur. 

Beavers are sociable animals, living in streams, where, so as to render the water of sufficient depth, they build dams of mud and of the stems and boughs of trees felled by their powerful incisor teeth. In the neighbourhood they make their &quot;lodges,&quot; which are roomy chambers, with the entrance beneath the water. The mud is plastered down by the fore-feet, and not, as often supposed, by the tail, which is employed solely as a rudder. 

They are mainly nocturnal, and subsist chiefly on bark and twigs or the roots of water plants. 

[[image:Beaver_dam_in_Fossil_Butte_NM-750px.JPG|thumb|left|250px|[[Fossil Butte National Monument]].]]

[[Image:Peche_2005-07-19_039.jpg|thumb|250px|A beaver lodge north of [[Saguenay, Quebec]].]]

The dam differs in shape according to the nature of particular localities. Where the water has little motion it is almost straight; where the current is considerable it is curved, with its convexity towards the stream. The materials made use of are [[driftwood]], [[willow|green willow]]s, [[birch]] and poplars; also mud and stones intermixed in such a manner as contributes to the strength of the dam; but there is no particular method observed, except that the work is carried on with a regular sweep, and that all the parts are made of equal strength.

&quot;In places,&quot; writes Hearne, &quot;which have been long frequented by beavers undisturbed, their dams, by frequent repairing, become a solid bank, capable of resisting a great force both of ice and water; and as the willow, poplar and birch generally take root and shoot up, they by degrees form a kind of regular planted hedge, which I have seen in some places so tall that birds have built their nests among the branches.&quot;

Their houses are formed of the same materials as the dams, with little order or regularity of structure, and seldom contain more than four old, and six or eight young beavers. It not unfrequently happens that some of the larger houses have one or more partitions, but these are only posts of the main building left by the builders to support the roof, for the apartments have usually no communication with each other except by water. 

[[Image:BeaverDam 8409.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Lassen Volcanic National Park]].]]

The beavers carry the mud and stones with their fore-paws and the timber between their teeth. They always work in the night and with great expedition. They cover their houses late every autumn with fresh mud, which, freezing when the frost sets in, becomes almost as hard as stone, so that neither [[wolf|wolves]] nor [[wolverine]]s can disturb their repose.

The favourite food of the American beaver is the [[water-lily]] (''Nuphar luteum''), which bears a resemblance to a [[cabbage]]-stalk, and grows at the bottom of lakes and rivers. Beavers also gnaw the bark of [[birch]], [[poplar]] and [[willow]] trees; but during the summer a more varied herbage, with the addition of berries, is consumed. 

When the ice breaks up in spring they always leave their embankments, and rove about until a little before the fall of the leaf, when they return to their old habitations, and lay in their winter stock of wood. They seldom begin to repair the houses till the frost sets in, and never finish the outer coating till the cold becomes severe. When they erect a new habitation they fell the wood early in summer, but seldom begin building till towards the end of August.

Castoreum is a substance contained in two pear-shaped pouches situated near the organs of reproduction, of a bitter taste and slightly foetid odour, at one time largely employed as a medicine, but now used only in [[perfume|perfumery]].

Fossil remains of beavers are found in the peat and other superficial deposits of England and the continent of Europe; while in the [[Pleistocene]] formations of England and Siberia occur remains of a giant extinct beaver, ''Trogontherium cuvieri'', representing a genus by itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:boudiccastatue.jpg|thumb|300px|Statue of Boudica near Westminster Pier]]'''Boudica''' (also written '''Boudicca''', '''Boadicea''', '''Buduica''', '''Bonduca''') (d. [[60]]/[[61]]) was a [[Queen regnant|queen]] of the [[Brythonic]] [[Celt|Celtic]] [[Iceni]] people of Norfolk in Eastern [[Roman Britain|Britain]] who led a major uprising of the tribes against the occupying forces of the [[Roman Empire]].  Upon the death of her husband the Icenian king [[Prasutagus]] (''circa'' 60), the Romans annexed his kingdom and brutally humiliated Boudica and her daughters, spurring her leadership of the revolt.

In [[60]] or [[61]], while governor [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]] was leading a campaign against the [[druids]] on the island of [[Anglesey]] in north [[Wales]], the Iceni and their neighbours, the [[Trinovantes]], rebelled, and lead by Boudica, destroyed the former Trinovantian capital and Roman ''[[colonia]]'' of Camulodunum ([[Colchester]]), and routed the Roman [[Legio IX Hispana|Legio IX ''Hispana'']] under [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]].  Boudica's army then burned to the ground the twenty-year-old settlement of [[Londinium]] ([[London]]) and destroyed [[Verulamium]] ([[St Albans]]), killing an estimated 70,000-80,000 people.  [[Roman emperor]] [[Nero]] briefly considered withdrawing Roman forces from the island, but ultimately Boudica was defeated at the [[Battle of Watling Street]] by the heavily outnumbered forces of Roman provincial governor [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]].

The chronicles of these events, as recorded by the historians [[Tacitus]]{{ref|Tacitus}} and [[Dio Cassius]]{{ref|Dio}}, were rediscovered during the [[Renaissance]] and led to a resurgence of Boudica's legendary fame during the [[Victorian era]], when [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] was portrayed as her &quot;namesake&quot;.  Boudica has since remained an important cultural symbol in the United Kingdom.

==Background==

===Boudica or Boadicea?===
Until relatively recently Boudica was better known as Boadicea, a name which probably derives from a mistranscription when a manuscript of Tacitus was copied in the [[Middle Ages]]. Her name takes many forms in various manuscripts, but was almost certainly originally Boudicca or Boudica, derived from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] word ''*bouda'', victory (cf. [[Irish language|Irish]] ''bua'', 'Buaidheach'', [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''buddug''). The name is attested in inscriptions as &quot;Boudica&quot; in [[Lusitania]], &quot;Boudiga&quot; in [[Bordeaux]] and &quot;Bodicca&quot; in Britain.{{ref|Bodicca}}

Based on later development of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Kenneth H. Jackson|Kenneth Jackson]] concludes that the correct spelling of the name is ''Boudica'', pronounced 'Bow-DEE-cah' (first syllable as in bow-and-arrow, ''i'' and ''a'' both long), although it is mispronounced by many as [b&amp;#363;-d&amp;#301;k'&amp;#601;].{{ref|Jackson}}

===Prasutagus' inheritance===
[[Image:EnglandNorfolk.png|thumb|right|150px|Location of modern Norfolk, once inhabited by the Iceni.]]Boudica's husband, [[Prasutagus]], was king of the [[Iceni]], who inhabited roughly what is now [[Norfolk]]. The Iceni were not at this stage part of the territory under direct Roman control, having voluntarily allied themselves to Rome following [[Claudius]]'s [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest]] of [[43]]. They were jealous of their independence, and had revolted in [[47]] when the then-[[Roman governors of Britain|governor]], [[Publius Ostorius Scapula]], threatened to disarm them.{{ref|disarm}} It is possible that Prasutagus was installed as a pro-Roman ruler following the suppression of this uprising. He lived a long life of conspicuous wealth, and, hoping to preserve his line, made the [[Roman emperor]] co-heir to his kingdom along with his two daughters.

It was normal Roman practice to allow allied kingdoms their independence only for the lifetime of their client king, who would agree to leave his kingdom to Rome in his will: the provinces of [[Bithynia]]{{ref|Bithynia}} and [[Galatia]]{{ref|Galatia}}, for example, were incorporated into the Empire in just this way. [[Roman law]] also allowed [[inheritance]] only through the male line. So when Prasutagus died his attempts to preserve his line were ignored and his kingdom was annexed as if it had been conquered. Lands and property were confiscated and nobles treated like slaves. According to [[Tacitus]], Boudica was flogged and her daughters raped. Dio Cassius says that Roman financiers, including [[Seneca the Younger]], chose this point to call in their loans. Tacitus does not mention this, but does single out the [[procurator]], [[Catus Decianus]], for criticism for his &quot;avarice&quot;. Prasutagus, it seems, had lived well on borrowed Roman money, and on his death his subjects had become liable for the debt.

==Boudica's uprising==

In [[60]] or [[61]], while the current governor, [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]], was leading a campaign against the [[druids]] on the island of [[Anglesey]] in north [[Wales]], the Iceni rebelled, along with their neighbours the Trinovantes, under Boudica's leadership.

[[Image:claud_1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A statue of Emperor Claudius]]Their first target was Camulodunum ([[Colchester]]), the former Trinovantian capital and now a Roman ''[[colonia]]''. The Roman veterans who had been settled there mistreated the locals, and a temple to the former emperor [[Claudius]] had been erected there at local expense, making the city a focus for resentment. The city was poorly defended and the rebels destroyed it, besieging the last defenders in the temple for two days before it fell. The future governor [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]], then commanding the [[Legio IX Hispana|Legio IX ''Hispana'']], attempted to relieve the city, but his forces were routed.

When news of the rebellion reached him, Suetonius hurried along [[Watling Street]] through hostile territory to [[Londinium]] ([[London]]). Londinium was a relatively new town, founded after the conquest of [[43]], but had grown to be a thriving commercial centre with a population of travellers, traders, and probably Roman officials. The procurator, Catus Decianus, likely had his office there. Suetonius considered giving battle there, but considering his lack of numbers and chastened by Petilius's defeat, decided to sacrifice the city to save the province. Londinium was abandoned to the rebels, who burnt it down, slaughtering anyone who had not evacuated with Suetonius ([[archaeology]] shows a thick layer of burnt debris covering coins and pottery dating before [[60]]{{ref|arch}}).  [[Verulamium]] ([[St Albans]]) was next to be destroyed. In the three cities destroyed, between seventy and eighty thousand people are said to have been killed.

===Romans rally===
{{see also|Battle of Watling Street}}
Suetonius regrouped with the [[Legio XIV Gemina|XIV ''Gemina'']], some ''vexillationes'' (detachments) of the [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix|XX ''Valeria Victrix'']], and any available auxiliaries. The [[prefect]] of [[Legio II Augusta|Legio II ''Augusta'']], [[Poenius Postumus]], ignored the call, but nonetheless the governor was able to call on almost ten thousand men. He took a stand at an unidentified location, probably in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] somewhere along [[Watling Street]], in a [[defile]] with a wood behind him. They were greatly outnumbered by the British rebels (who were 230,000 strong by now according to Dio Cassius) but superior Roman tactics and training won the day at the [[Battle of Watling Street]]. The [[Britons]] attempted to flee, but were impeded by the presence of their own families, whom they had stationed in a ring of wagons at the edge of the battlefield, and were slaughtered (The German king [[Ariovistus]] is reported to have made the same mistake in [[Julius Caesar]]'s ''[[Gallic Wars]]'').{{ref|Ariovistus}} Tacitus reports that &quot;according to one report almost eighty thousand Britons fell&quot; compared with only four hundred Romans. According to Tacitus, Boudica poisoned herself; Dio Cassius says she fell sick and died, and was given a lavish burial. She may well have been cremated which was the custom of many Celtic tribes at this time. This would also serve to save her body from being defiled and would explain why the remains have never been found.

===Location of her defeat===

The site of Boudica's battle is unknown. According to London legend it was at [[King's Cross, London|Kings Cross]] in London (a nearby street is named Battle Bridge Road), and that Boudica herself is buried under one of the platforms at [[Kings Cross railway station|Kings Cross Station]] (different sources list platforms eight, nine or ten as her supposed resting place) but, based on Tacitus, it is unlikely Suetonius returned to London. Most historians favour a site in the West Midlands. Kevin K. Carroll suggests a site close to [[High Cross, Leicestershire|High Cross]] in [[Leicestershire]], on the junction of Watling Street and the [[Fosse Way]], would have allowed the Legio II ''Augusta'', based at [[Exeter]], to rendezvous with the rest of Suetonius's forces.{{ref|HighCross}} [[Manduessedum]] ([[Mancetter]]), near the modern day town of [[Atherstone]] in [[Warwickshire]], has also been suggested.{{ref|Mancetter}}

Postumus, on hearing of the Roman victory, fell on his sword. Catus Decianus fled to Gaul and was replaced as procurator by [[Gaius Julius Alpinus Classicianus]]. Suetonius conducted punitive operations, but criticism by Classicianus led to an investigation headed by Nero's [[freedman]] [[Polyclitus (freedman)|Polyclitus]], and Suetonius was removed as governor, to be replaced by [[Publius Petronius Turpilianus]]. The historian [[Suetonius]] tells us the crisis had almost persuaded Nero to abandon Britain.{{ref|Suetonius}}

==Historical sources==
Tacitus, the most important Roman historian of this period, took a particular interest in Britain as [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]], his father-in-law and the subject of his first book, served there three times. He was a military [[tribune]] under Suetonius Paulinus, which almost certainly gave Tacitus an eyewitness source for Boudica's revolt.

Dio Cassius's sources are less certain. He is generally agreed to have based his account on that of Tacitus, but he simplifies the sequence of events and adds details, such as the calling in of loans, that Tacitus does not mention. He says of Boudica:

:&quot;Boudica was tall, terrible to look on and gifted with a powerful voice. A flood of bright red hair ran down to her knees; she wore a golden necklet made up of ornate pieces, a multi-coloured robe and over it a thick cloak held together by a brooch. She took up a long spear to cause dread in all who set eyes on her.&quot;

He reports that she committed all sorts of atrocities in the name of a goddess called [[Andraste]], who he claims is the British equivalent of [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]], the Roman goddess of victory. Boudica's own name means &quot;victory&quot;.

It is generally thought that [[Gildas]], in his [[6th century]] polemic ''[[De Excidio Britanniae]]'', alludes to Boudica in his typically oblique fashion as a &quot;treacherous lioness&quot;, although his general lack of knowledge about the real history of the Roman conquest of Britain makes this far from certain.{{ref|Gildas}}

==Cultural impact==
===History and literature===
By the [[Middle Ages]] Boudicca was forgotten. She makes no appearance in [[Bede]], the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' or [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[History of the Kings of Britain]]''. But the rediscovery of the works of Tacitus and Dio Cassius during the ''[[Renaissance]]'' allowed [[Polydore Virgil]] to reintroduce her into British history in [[1534]]. However he misinterpreted the &quot;Voadicea&quot; he found in Tacitus and the &quot;Bunduica&quot; in Dio Cassius as two separate women. Boudica's story was included in [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''Chronicles'' and inspired [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s younger contemporaries [[Francis Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] to write a play, ''[http://www.bibliomania.com/0/6/1/1975/frameset.html Bonduca]'', in [[1610]]. [[William Cowper]] wrote a popular poem, ''[http://www.bartleby.com/41/320.html Boadicea, an ode]'', in [[1782]].

It was in the [[Victorian era]] that Boudica's fame took on legendary proportions. [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] was seen as her &quot;namesake&quot;. Victoria's [[Poet Laureate]], [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], wrote a poem, ''[http://oldpoetry.com/poetry/8721/showline=1 Boadicea]''. A great bronze statue of Boudica in her war [[chariot]] (furnished with [[scythed chariot|scythes]] after [[Persian Empire|Persian]] fashion), together with her daughters, was commissioned by [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Albert]] and executed by [[Thomas Thornycroft]]. It was completed in [[1905]] and stands next to [[Westminster Bridge]] and the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]]. Ironically, the great anti-imperialist rebel was now identified with the head of the [[British Empire]].{{ref|Webster}}

===Modern fiction===

Boudica has inspired several novels: examples include [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]'s 1978 [[historical novel]] for children, ''Song for a Dark Queen'', and [[Manda Scott]]'s series of novels, ''Dreaming the Eagle'', ''Dreaming the Bull'', ''Dreaming the Hound'' and the forthcoming ''Dreaming the Serpent Spears''. [[Joyce Doré]] wrote ''Hemlock'', (ISBN 1898030197), a fictional account of the life of Boudica published in [[2002]], in which Boudica and her two daughters are taken to Rome, before [[Nero]], who makes her drink [[hemlock]]. Doré claims to be a [[psychic]] and to have based the book on her conversations with the historical characters.
The major American publisher Penguin has produced a recent book about Boudica called Warrior Queen, written by Australian novelist Alan Gold. It has been critically acclaimed.

===Films and television===
Boudica has been the subject of two feature films, [[1928]]'s ''Boadicea'', starring [[Phyllis Nielson-Terry]], and [[2003]]'s ''Boudica'', a [[television|TV]] film written by [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]] and starring [[Alex Kingston]]. A new film is planned for release in [[2006]] entitled [[Warrior (2006 film)|Warrior]], written by [[Brian Klugman]] and [[Lee Sternthal]], directed by [[Gavin O'Connor]], and produced by [[Mel Gibson]].{{ref|films}} A British TV series, ''[[Warrior Queen]]'', was made by [[Thames Television]] in [[1978]] starring [[Sian Phillips]] as Boudica and [[Nigel Hawthorne]] as Catus Decianus. Boudica was also featured in the fifth episode of one hour documentary [[Warrior Women]] on the discovery channel, hosted by New Zealand actress [[Lucy Lawless]].

===Music===
The Irish singer/songwriter [[Enya]] produced a song called &quot;Boadicea&quot; on her [[1992]] album ''[[The Celts]]''. This track was most famously sampled by the rap group [[The Fugees]] for their single &quot;Ready or Not&quot; (from [[1996]]'s ''[[The Score (album)|The Score]]''), and most recently by [[Mario Winans]] (featuring [[Puff Daddy|Sean &quot;P. Diddy&quot; Combs]]) on his song &quot;I Don't Wanna Know&quot; ([[2004]]). The track was also used in the [[soundtrack]] of the film ''[[Sleepwalkers]]''.

Scottish singer/songwriter [[Steve McDonald]] composed a biographical song called &quot;Boadicea&quot; on his [[1997]] album ''Stone of Destiny'', detailing her life and tragic death.{{ref|McDonald}} British rock band [[The Libertines]] refer to &quot;Queen Boadicea&quot; in their song &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;, indicating a belief that her spirit still lives on in Britons today.{{ref|Libertines}} The British metal band [[Bal-Sagoth]] have written a song entitled &quot;Blood Slakes the Sand at the Circus Maximus&quot; (found on the band's album ''Battle Magic'') which features an Iceni Warrior of Boudica's uprising being captured and brought back to Rome. Her name (always spelled &quot;Boudicca&quot;) returns in the song &quot;When Rides the Scion of the Storms&quot; of the same album.{{ref|Bal}}

[http://www.mercyground.com Faith and the Muse] produced a song, Boudiccea, in their most recent album, Burning Season. The song suggests that Boudiccea may have committed suicide by falling on her sword.{{ref|FaithAndTheMuse}}

===Other cultural references===
There have been scattered reports that the restless spirit of Boudica has been seen in the county of [[Lincolnshire]]. These reports, dating back to the mid-[[19th century]], claim Boudica rides her chariot, heading for some unknown destination, and many a traveller and motorist have claimed to have seen her. There has been some debate as to how long this has been going on. Some say that the queen's restless spirit has been appearing since her death, while other suggest that the revival of interest in Boudica's story in the 19th century might have summoned her spirit back to our world. As with all reports of ghostly activity, it is up to the individual to decide whether they are true or not.{{ref|ghost}}

In [[1984]], [[Judy Grahn]], in her book ''[[Another Mother Tongue]]'', claimed that Boudica was the origin of the present day English word &quot;bull dyke&quot; (a vulgar term for a [[lesbian]]); this is thought to be dubious.

In the [[1990s]], [[DC Comics]]' [[Green Lantern Corps]] included a member named Boodikka, portrayed as a fierce female warrior.

In 2003, an LTR [[retrotransposon]] from the [[genome]] of the human [[Schistosoma|blood fluke]] ''Schistosoma mansoni'' was named ''Boudicca''.{{ref|gene}}

On the afternoon of [[31 May]], Beatty and Hipper encountered each other, and in a running battle to the south Hipper drew the British into the path of the High Seas Fleet. Beatty turned and fled towards the Grand Fleet and from 18:30 until nightfall at about 20:30 the two huge fleets &amp;mdash; 250 ships &amp;mdash; were heavily engaged. Fourteen British and eleven German ships were sunk with great loss of life. Jellicoe tried to cut the Germans off from their base in the hope of continuing the battle in the morning, but under cover of darkness Scheer crossed the wake of the British fleet and returned to port.

Both sides claimed victory. The British had lost more ships and many more sailors, but Scheer's plan of destroying Beatty's squadrons had failed. For the remainder of the war, apart from brief sorties in August 1916 and April 1918, the High Seas Fleet stayed in port. They continued to pose a threat that required the British to keep their battleships concentrated in the North Sea, but they never again contested control of the seas. Instead, the German Navy turned its efforts and resources to [[unrestricted submarine warfare]].

==Background==
[[Image:British Grand Fleet 2.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[British Grand Fleet]] in parallel columns steaming in line ahead]]

===Naval tactics in 1916===
The general idea was that a fleet approaching battle should be in parallel columns moving in line ahead, as in this formation a fleet could maneuver with relative ease. Several short columns could change their heading faster than a single long column while maintaining formation. Also signals made with [[flag]]s or [[searchlight]]s from the flagship (usually placed at the head of the center column) could be seen by many ships. In a single column it would often take 10 minutes or more for a signal to be passed from the flagship at the front of the column to the last ship at the end, since smoke from the funnels often made it impossible to identify signals on ships behind the one directly ahead or behind, so every ship had to repeat the signal for the following one to understand. The time required for this was often doubled as most signals had to be confirmed by every ship before they could be executed. 

For the actual battle the fleet would deploy into a single column by the leading ships of the columns turning 90 degrees to port or starboard, the remaining ships following their leaders in succession, the column being formed at right angles to the original line of advance. To form the column into the right direction the fleet had to know from which direction the enemy was approaching before he could be seen by the [[battleship]]s, as this maneuver took longer than two fleets heading towards each other at high speed needed to come within fighting range. It was the task of the scouting forces, consisting of [[battlecruiser]]s and [[cruiser]]s, to find the enemy and report from where he approached in time and if possible deny the enemy's scouting force to obtain the same information.

Ideally the line of battleships would cross the path of the enemy column so that the maximum number of [[gun]]s could be brought to bear, while the enemy could only fire with the front [[turret]]s of the leading ships. Carrying out this classic maneuver of &quot;[[crossing the T]]&quot; was largely a matter of luck; more likely would be a heavy exchange between two fleets on roughly parallel courses.

===German plan===
The German naval strategy, according to Scheer, was:
:to damage the English Fleet by offensive raids against the naval forces engaged in watching and blockading the [[Heligoland Bight|German Bight]], as well as by [[naval mine|mine]]-laying on the British coast and [[submarine]] attack, whenever possible. After an equality of strength had been realised as a result of these operations, and all our forces had been got ready and concentrated, an attempt was to be made with our Fleet to seek battle under circumstances unfavourable to the enemy. 

Since in 1916 the High Seas Fleet had only 18 battleships to the Grand Fleet's 33 and the Germans were falling increasingly further behind as the war progressed, there was no chance of defeating the British in a head-to-head clash of battleships. Instead, they planned to divide and conquer: by staging raids into the North Sea they would lure out small British squadrons which could then be attacked and destroyed. Since the British [[Admiralty]], unknown to the Germans, had gained possession of the main German code books, German naval radio communications picked up could be decyphered, and the Admiralty was therefore usually quite well aware of German plans.

The plan for May 1916 was to station a large number of [[U-boat]]s off the British naval bases and lure Beatty's battlecruiser squadrons out by sending a fleet under Hipper to raid the coast of [[Sunderland]]. After attrition from the submarines, the British would be drawn by Hipper towards the German dreadnoughts under Scheer and destroyed.

===British response===
[[Image:Jutland campaign map.png|left|Fleet movements before and during the battle of Jutland, [[30 May]] to [[1 June]] [[1916]].]]

The British intercepted and decrypted a German signal on [[28 May]] ordering all ships to be ready to put to sea on the 30th. Further signals were intercepted and although they were not decrypted it was clear that a major operation was likely. The Grand Fleet of twenty-four [[battleship|dreadnoughts]] and three [[battlecruiser]]s left [[Scapa Flow]] under Jellicoe before Hipper left the [[Jade Estuary]] on [[30 May]]. Beatty's force of four dreadnoughts and six battlecruisers left the [[Firth of Forth]] on the same day, and Jellicoe's intention was to rendezvous ninety miles (145 km) &lt;!-- if the 'miles' are statute --&gt; west of the [[Skagerrak]] off the coast of [[Jutland]] and wait for the Germans.

===The fleets===
During the battle the actual force under Jellicoe was twenty-eight dreadnoughts and nine battlecruisers, while Scheer had sixteen dreadnoughts, five battlecruisers and six obsolete [[pre-dreadnought]]s. The British were superior in light vessels as well. In terms of weight of broadside the British had an advantage of 332,400&amp;nbsp;lb (151&amp;nbsp;tonnes) against 134,000&amp;nbsp;lb (61&amp;nbsp;t).

This British superiority was countered by certain technical factors: German [[gun]]nery was more accurate, in part because the British had adopted an inferior [[fire-control system|firing control]] design; German ships had thicker [[armour]] against torpedo attack and more water-tight doors; German [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armour-piercing shells]] were more effective than the British shells; and, vitally important, the British [[cordite]] [[propellant]] was oversensitive, and the British [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s were not well protected. The British also suffered from exceptionally poor communication between their ships.

==The battlecruiser action==
[[Image:Jutland battlecruiser action.png|right|]]
The German submarines were completely ineffective; they did not sink a single ship and provided no useful information as [[Reconnaissance|scout]]s. Jellicoe's ships proceeded to his rendezvous undamaged but misled by [[Admiralty]] [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] that the Germans were nine hours later than they actually were. 

At 14:20 on [[31 May]], scouts from Beatty's force reported enemy ships to the south-east: British light units, investigating a neutral Danish [[steamer]] which was sailing between the two fleets, were finding German scouts engaged in the same mission. Beatty moved to cut the German ships off from their base. The first shots of the battle were fired when [[HMS Galatea (1914)|''Galatea'']] of the British 1st Light [[Cruiser Squadron]] mistook two German [[destroyer]]s for cruisers and engaged them. ''Galatea'' was subsequently hit at extreme range by her German counterpart, [[SMS Elbing|''Elbing'']], of Rear Admiral Bodicker's Scouting Group II.

At 15:30, Beatty sighted Hipper's cruisers moving north-west (position 1 on map). Hipper promptly turned away to lead Beatty towards Scheer. Beatty, some three miles (5 km) &lt;!-- if the 'miles' are statute --&gt; from Admiral [[Hugh Evan-Thomas|Sir Hugh Evan-Thomas]]'s [[5th Battle Squadron]], turned to the enemy and signaled by flag for the 5th Battle Squadron to follow. Given the distance and visibility, the 5th could not read the flag signals; and as Beatty made no effort to communicate via [[light signal]] or [[radio]] [[telegraph]], the 5th continued on its original course for several minutes. At 15:45, after having the German ships within range for over ten minutes, and with both fleets roughly parallel at 15,000&amp;nbsp;yards (14&amp;nbsp;km), Beatty opened fire simultaneously with Hipper (position 2). Thus began the opening phase of the fleet action, known as the &quot;Run to the South&quot;.

Beatty ordered his ships to engage in a line, one British ship engaging with one German and his [[flagship]] [[HMS Lion (1910)|''Lion'']] doubling on the German flagship [[SMS Lützow|''Lützow'']]. However, due to a mistake on the British part, [[SMS Derfflinger|''Derfflinger'']] was left unengaged and free to fire without disruption, while [[SMS Moltke|''Moltke'']] drew fire from two battlecruisers. The Germans drew first blood. Hipper's five battlecruisers promptly registered hits on three of the six British battlecruisers.  Nearly 10 minutes passed before the British managed to score their first hit. The first near-disaster of the battle occurred when a 12 inch (305 mm) salvo from [[SMS Lützow|''Lützow'']] wrecked &quot;Q&quot; turret of Beatty's [[flagship]] [[HMS Lion (1910)|''Lion'']]. Dozens of crewmen were instantly killed, but a far larger catastrophe was averted when Major [[Francis John William Harvey|Francis Harvey]] of the [[Royal Marines]], the mortally wounded turret commander, ordered the magazine doors shut and the magazine flooded, thereby preventing the fickle propellant from setting off a massive explosion. ''Lion'' was saved, but [[HMS Indefatigable (1909)|''Indefatigable'']] was not so lucky. At 16:00 she was smashed aft by three 11 inch (280&amp;nbsp;mm) shells from [[SMS Von der Tann|''Von der Tann'']], causing damage sufficient to knock her out of line.  ''Von der Tann'' landed another 11&amp;nbsp;inch (280 mm) salvo on one of her 12 inch (305&amp;nbsp;mm) turrets at near-maximum range. The plunging shells easily pierced the armour and, with no time for the heroics that saved ''Lion'', ''Indefatigable'' was ripped apart by a magazine explosion, sinking in moments with all but two of her crew of 1,019 officers and men (position 3).

[[Image:HMS Lion (1910).jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Beatty]]'s flagship [[HMS Lion (1910)|''Lion'']] burning after being hit by a salvo from [[SMS Lützow|''Lützow'']].]]
The odds had been evened to Hipper's benefit, but not for long. Evan-Thomas had finally brought up his squadron of four &quot;super-dreadnoughts&quot; &amp;mdash; fast warships of the [[Queen Elizabeth class battleship|''Queen Elizabeth'' class]] armed with 15 inch (381&amp;nbsp;mm) guns. With 15 inch (381 mm) shells landing on his ships and unable to respond effectively at long range with his smaller guns, Hipper was in a tight spot, but he knew Scheer's main body was fast approaching and his baiting mission was close to completion. The battlecruiser action intensified again: at 16:25 [[HMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']] was hit by what may have been a combined salvo from [[SMS Derfflinger|''Derfflinger'']] and [[SMS Seydlitz|''Seydlitz'']], and she disintegrated in a magazine explosion with all but nine of her 1,275 man crew lost. Viewing this, Beatty noted &quot;There seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today&quot; to his [[flag captain]] (position 4).

At about 16:30, the [[HMS Southampton (1912)|''Southampton'']] of Beatty's 2nd [[Light cruiser|Light Cruiser]] Squadron led by Commodore [[William Goodenough]] sighted the main body of Scheer's High Seas Fleet, dodging numerous heavy-caliber salvos to report the detailed strength of the Germans: sixteen dreadnoughts with six older battleships. Simultaneously a destroyer action raged between the battlecruiser fleets, as British destroyers meleed with their German counterparts and managed to put a torpedo into ''Seydlitz''. The destroyer ''Nestor'', under the command of Captain Bingham, sank two German [[torpedo boat]]s, the ''V-27'' and the ''V-29'', before she and another destroyer, the ''Nomad'', were hit and abandoned as Scheer's dreadnoughts sped by. Beatty decided to head north to draw the Germans towards Jellicoe and broke contact with the Germans at about 16.45 (position 5). Beatty's move towards Jellicoe is called the &quot;Run to the North.&quot; Because Beatty once again failed to signal his intentions adequately, the super-dreadnoughts of the 5th Battle Squadron found themselves lagging behind the battlecruisers and heading directly into the main body of the High Seas Fleet. For a period they had to fend off the lead German dreadnoughts and Hipper's battlecruisers on their own. [[HMS Malaya (1915)|''Malaya'']] sustained heavy casualties in the process, but the 15 inch (381 mm) fire of the British ships remained effective, causing severe damage to the German battlecruisers (position 6).

Jellicoe was now aware that full fleet engagement was nearing, but had insufficient information on the position and course of the Germans. [[Rear Admiral]] [[Horace Hood]]'s 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron was ordered to speed ahead to assist Beatty, while Rear-Admiral Arbuthnot's 1st [[Cruiser]] Squadron patrolled the van of the main body for eventual deployment of Jellicoe's dreadnought columns. Around 17:30 the cruiser [[HMS Black Prince (1904)|''Black Prince'']] of Arbuthnot's squadron, bearing southeast, came within view of Beatty's leading 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron, establishing the first visual link between the converging bodies of the Grand Fleet. Simultaneously the signals cruiser [[HMS Chester|''Chester'']], steaming behind Hood's battlecruisers, was intercepted by the van of the German scouting forces under Rear-Admiral Bodicker. Heavily outnumbered by Bodicker's four light cruisers, ''Chester'' was pounded before being relieved by Hood's heavy units which swung back westward for that purpose. Hood's flagship [[HMS Invincible (1907)|''Invincible'']] disabled the light cruiser [[SMS Wiesbaden|''Wiesbaden'']], as Bodicker's other ships fled toward Hipper and Scheer, in the mistaken belief that Hood was leading a larger force of British capital ships from the north and east. Another destroyer action ensued as German torpedo boats attempted to blunt the arrival of this new formation.

==The fleet action==
[[Image:Jutland fleet action.png|right|425px|]]
In the meantime Beatty and Evan-Thomas had resumed their engagement of Hipper's battlecruisers, this time with the visual conditions to their advantage. With the battle-worthiness of his ships greatly attrited, Hipper turned back to Scheer around 18.00, just as Beatty's flagship ''Lion'' was finally spotted by Jellicoe on the [[HMS Iron Duke (1912)|''Iron Duke'']]. Jellicoe promptly demanded the latest positioning data of the German forces from Beatty, who failed to respond to this questioning for almost ten minutes.

Jellicoe, having overestimated the enemy forces, was in a worrying position, needing to know the position of the Germans in order to judge when and how to deploy from columns to single line. The deployment could be onto either the western or the eastern column and had to be carried out before the Germans arrived; but early deployment could mean losing any chance of a decisive encounter. Deploying to the west would bring his fleet closer to Scheer, gaining valuable time as dusk approached, but the Germans might arrive before the maneuver was complete. Deploying to the east would take the force away from Scheer, but Jellicoe's ships might be able to cross the &quot;T&quot; and would have the advantage of silhouetting Scheer's forces to the west. Deployment would take twenty irreplaceable minutes, and the fleets were approaching at quite a high speed. Jellicoe ordered deployment to the east at 18:10 &amp;#x2777;.

Meanwhile Hipper had rejoined Scheer, and the combined High Seas Fleet was heading north, directly toward Jellicoe. Scheer had no indication that Jellicoe was arriving from the northwest and was distracted by the intervention of Hood's ships to his north and east. Beatty's four surviving battlecruisers were now crossing the van of the British dreadnoughts to join Hood's three battlecruisers; in doing so, he nearly rammed Rear-Admiral Arbuthnot's flagship [[HMS Defence (1907)|''Defence'']]. Arbuthnot's obsolete [[Armored cruiser|armoured cruisers]] had no real place in the coming clash between modern dreadnoughts, but he was attracted by the drifting hull of the crippled ''Wiesbaden''. With [[HMS Warrior (1905)|''Warrior'']], ''Defence'' closed in for the kill, only to blunder right into the gunsights of Hipper's and Scheer's oncoming capital ships. ''Defence'' was destroyed in a spectacular explosion viewed by most of the deploying Grand Fleet, sinking with all hands (903 officers and men). ''Warrior'' was hit badly but spared immolation by the mishap of the nearby superdreadnought [[HMS Warspite (1913)|''Warspite'']]. ''Warspite'' had been steaming near 25&amp;nbsp;knots (46&amp;nbsp;km/h) to keep pace with the 5th Battle Squadron as it tailed Beatty's battlecruisers in the run north, creating enough strain to jam her rudder. Drifting in a wide circle, she appeared as a juicy target to the German dreadnoughts and took thirteen hits, inadvertently drawing fire from the hapless ''Warrior''. This maneouvre from ''Warspite'' was known as &quot;[[Windy Corner]]&quot;. Despite surviving the onslaught, ''Warspite'' was soon ordered back to port by Evan-Thomas. As ''Defence'' sank, Hipper moved within range of Hood's 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron. ''Invincible'' inflicted two below-waterline hits on [[SMS Lützow|''Lützow'']] that would ultimately doom Hipper's flagship, but about 18:30 abruptly appeared as a clear target before [[SMS Lützow|''Lützow'']] and ''Derfflinger''. A series of 12 inch (305&amp;nbsp;mm) shells struck ''Invincible'', which blew up and split in two, killing all but six of her crew of 1,032 officers and men, including Rear Admiral Hood.

[[Image:British positions at Jutland.jpg|thumb|400px|Approximate positions of the British fleet at about 19:00 &amp;#x2779;, from ''The Fighting at Jutland'', edited by H. W. Fawcett and G. W. W. Hooper, circa 1921.]]

By 18:30 the main fleet action was joined for the first time, with Jellicoe effectively &quot;crossing Scheer's T&quot; &amp;#x2778;. Jellicoe's flagship ''Iron Duke'' quickly scored a series of hits on the lead German dreadnought, [[SMS König|''König'']], but in this brief exchange, which lasted only minutes, as few as ten of the Grand Fleet's twenty-four dreadnoughts actually fired shots. The Germans were hampered by poor visibility in addition to being in an unfavorable tactical position. Realizing he was heading into a trap, Scheer ordered his fleet to turn and flee at 18:33. Amid a pall of smoke and mist Scheer's forces succeeded in disengaging.

Conscious of the risks to his capital ships posed by torpedoes, Jellicoe did not seek chase but headed south, determined to keep the High Seas Fleet west of him. Scheer knew that it was not yet dark enough to escape and his fleet would suffer terribly in a stern chase, so at 18:55 he doubled back to the east &amp;#x2779;. In his memoirs he wrote, &quot;the manoeuvre would be bound to surprise the enemy, to upset his plans for the rest of the day, and if the blow fell heavily it would facilitate the breaking loose at night.&quot;

Commodore [[Goodenough]]'s 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron dodged the fire of German battleships for a second time in reestablishing contact with the High Seas Fleet shortly after 19:00. By 19:15, Jellicoe had crossed the &quot;T&quot; yet again &amp;#x277a;. This time his arc of fire was tighter and deadlier, causing severe damage to the Germans, particularly Rear-Admiral Behncke's leading 3rd Battle Squadron. At 19:17, for the second time in less than an hour, Scheer turned to the west, ordering a major torpedo attack by his destroyers and a &quot;death ride&quot; by Scouting Group I's four remaining battlecruisers &amp;mdash; [[SMS Lützow|''Lützow'']] being out of action and abandoned by Hipper &amp;mdash; to deter a British chase. In this portion of the engagement the Germans sustained thirty-seven heavy hits while inflicting only two, ''Derfflinger'' alone receiving fourteen. Nonetheless Scheer slipped away as sunset (at 20:24) approached. The last major engagement between capital ships took place as the surviving British battlecruisers caught up with their German counterparts, which were briefly relieved by Rear-Admiral Mauve's obsolete pre-dreadnoughts &amp;#x277b;. As [[HMS King George V (1911)|''King George V'']] and [[SMS Westfalen|''Westfalen'']] exchanged a few final shots, neither side could have imagined that the only encounter between British and German dreadnoughts in the entire war was already concluded.

At 21:00, Jellicoe, knowing of the Grand Fleet's deficiencies in night-fighting, hoped to avoid a major engagement until early dawn. He placed a screen of cruisers and destroyers behind his battle fleet to patrol the rear as he headed south to guard against Scheer's expected escape to Ems &amp;#x277c;. In reality Scheer opted to bypass his wake and escape via [[Horns Reef]]. Luckily for Scheer, Jellicoe's scouts failed to report his true course while Jellicoe himself was too cautious to judge from extensive circumstantial evidence that the Germans were breaking through his rear. While the nature of Scheer's escape and Jellicoe's inaction indicate the overall superiority of German night-fighting proficiency, the night battle's results were no more clear-cut than the battle as a whole. ''Southampton'', Commodore Goodenough's flagship, that had scouted so proficiently, was heavily damaged but managed to sink the German light cruiser [[SMS Frauenlob|''Frauenlob'']] which went down at 22:23 with all hands (320 officers and men). But at 02:00 on [[1 June]], ''Black Prince'' of the ill-fated 1st Cruiser Squadron met a grim fate at the hands of the battleship [[SMS Thüringen|''Thüringen'']], blowing up with all hands (857 officers and men) as her squadron leader [[HMS Defence|''Defence'']] had done hours earlier. At 02:10, flotillas of British destroyers launched torpedo runs on the German battle lines, and at the cost of five destroyers sunk and some others damaged, they managed to sink the predreadnought [[SMS Pommern|''Pommern'']] with all hands (844 officers and men), as well as to torpedo the light cruiser [[SMS Rostock|''Rostock'']] and causing another, [[SMS Elbing|''Elbing'']], to be rammed by the dreadnought [[SMS Posen|''Posen'']] and abandoned. The battlecruiser ''Lützow'' was scuttled at 01:45 after being abandoned by her 1,150 survivors. In addition to Jellicoe's caution, the Germans were helped by the failure of British naval intelligence in London to relay a critical radio intercept giving away the true position of the High Seas Fleet. By the time Jellicoe finally learned of Scheer's whereabouts at 04:15 it was clear the battle could no longer be resumed. There would be no &quot;[[Glorious First of June]]&quot; in 1916.

==Battle damage assessment==
[[Image:SMS Seydlitz damage.jpg|thumb|300px|SMS ''Seydlitz'' was heavily damaged in the battle, hit by twenty-one heavy shells and one torpedo. 98 men were killed and 55 injured.]]

[[Image:Marynarz Wilhelmshaven SMS Westfalen.jpg|thumb|200px|Member of crew of SMS Westfalen]]

The British lost fourteen ships including several battlecruisers totalling 111,000 tons and 6,094 men. The Germans lost eleven ships of 62,000 tons total and 2,551 men. Several other ships were badly damaged, such as HMS ''Lion'' and SMS ''Seydlitz''. At the end of the battle the British had twenty-four dreadnoughts and battlecruisers still able and ready to fight while the Germans had only ten. 

For the British, the outcome was a marginal tactical gain. Although they had lost several ships and had not destroyed the German fleet as intended, the Germans had retreated to port and the British were in command of the area. At a strategic level the outcome was more clear cut. The damaged British ships were restored to operational use quicker than the Germans and the High Seas Fleet did not leave port again. It remained active and a fighting force, however, and its presence as a [[fleet in being]] prevented a complete blockade of Germany.

British examination of their performance identified two main problems:

* Their armour-piercing shells exploded outside the German armour rather than penetrating and exploding within. As a result some German ships with only 8 inch (203 mm) of armour survived hits from 15 inch (381 mm) shells. Had these shells performed to design, coupled with the British accuracy of fire, German losses would probably have been greater.
* Communication between ships and the British commander in chief were poor. For most of the Battle Jellicoe had no idea where the German ships were, even though British ships were in contact. They failed to report positions contrary to the Grand Fleet Battle Plan. Some of the signalling was carried out by flag instead of wireless &amp;mdash; a questionable procedure given the mixture of haze and smoke that obscured the battlefield. 

===Battlecruiser design and handling===
The weak design and faulty use of the battlecruisers were important in the serious losses of the British. The battle is often regarded as demonstrating that the Royal Navy was technologically and operationally inferior to the German Navy. Jellicoe wrote in his despatch:

:&quot;The disturbing feature of the battle-cruiser action is the fact that five German battle-cruisers engaging six British vessels of this class, supported after the first twenty minutes, although at great range, by the fire of four battleships of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class, were yet able to sink ''Queen Mary'' and ''Indefatigable'' … The facts which contributed to the British losses were, first, the indifferent armour protection of our battle-cruisers, particularly as regards turret armour and deck plating, and, second, the disadvantage under which our vessels laboured in regard to the light … The German organisation at night is very good. Their system of recognition signals is excellent. Ours is practically nil. Their [[searchlight]]s are superior to ours and they use them with great effect. Finally, their method of firing at night gives excellent results. I am reluctantly compelled to the opinion that under night conditions we have a good deal to learn from them&quot;.

During the summer of 2003, a diving expedition examined the wrecks of ''Invincible'', ''Queen Mary'', ''Defence'', and ''Lützow'' to investigate the cause of the British ships' tendency to suffer from internal explosions. On this evidence, a major part of the blame may be laid on lax handling of the [[cordite]] propellant for the shells of the main guns. This, in turn, was a product of current British naval doctrine, which emphasised a rapid rate of fire in the direction of the enemy rather than slower, more accurate fire. In practice, the cordite could not be supplied to the guns rapidly enough through the hoists and hatches; in order to bring up the propellant for the next broadside before the time when it had to be loaded, many safety doors which should have been kept shut to safeguard against flash fires were open. Furthermore, whereas the German propellant ''RP C/12'' was supplied in brass cylinders, British cordite was supplied in silk bags, making it more susceptible to flash fires. The doctrine of a high rate of fire also led to the decision in 1913 to increase the supply of shells and cordite held on the British ships by 50 per cent, for fear of running out of ammunition; when this caused the capacity of the ships' magazines to be exceeded, cordite was stored in insecure places.

The memoirs of Alexander Grant, gunner on ''Lion'', show that some British officers were well aware of the dangers of careless handling of cordite:

:&quot;With the introduction of cordite to replace powder for firing guns, regulations regarding the necessary precautions for handling explosives became unconsciously considerably relaxed, even I regret to say, to a dangerous degree throughout the Service. The gradual lapse in the regulations on board ship seemed to be due to two factors. First, cordite is a much safer explosive to handle than gun-powder. Second, but more important, the altered construction of the magazines on board led to a feeling of false security … The iron or steel deck, the disappearance of the wood lining, the electric lights fitted inside, the steel doors, open because there was now no chute for passing cartridges out; all this gave officers and men a comparative easiness of mind regarding the precautions necessary with explosive material&quot;.

After the battle the [[Admiralty]] produced a report critical of the cordite handling practices. By this time, however, Jellicoe had been promoted to [[First Sea Lord]] and Beatty to command of the Grand Fleet; the report, which indirectly placed part of the blame for the disaster on the fleet's officers, was suppressed.

The battle showed that the British concept and use of the [[battlecruiser]] was wholly flawed. The battlecruiser had been designed according to [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]]'s dictum that &quot;speed is armour&quot;. They were intended to be faster than battleships, with superior [[fire-control system|fire control]], and able to pound enemy cruisers at ranges at which the enemy could not reply. But at Jutland they were not used in this fashion &amp;mdash; and indeed, British [[fire-control system|fire control]] was not sufficiently developed to permit them to be so used &amp;mdash; but instead closed recklessly with enemy battleships while lacking the armour to stand up to the pounding they received.

===The Jellicoe controversy===
At the time Jellicoe was criticised for his caution and for allowing Scheer to escape. Beatty in particular was convinced that Jellicoe had missed a tremendous opportunity to win another [[battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] and annihilate the High Seas Fleet. Jellicoe's career stagnated; he was promoted away from active command to become [[First Sea Lord]], while Beatty replaced him as commander of the [[British Grand Fleet]].

The controversy raged within the navy for about a decade after the war. Criticism focused on Jellicoe's decision at 19:15. Scheer had ordered his cruisers and destroyers forward in a torpedo attack to cover the turning away of his battleships. Jellicoe chose to turn away to the southeast and so keep out of range of the torpedoes. If Jellicoe had instead turned to the west, could his ships have dodged the torpedoes and destroyed the German fleet? Supporters of Jellicoe, including the naval historian [[Julian Corbett]], pointed out the folly of risking defeat in battle when you already have the command of the seas. (Corbett's volume of the official history of the war, ''Naval Operations'', contains the extraordinary disclaimer, &quot;Their Lordships find that some of the principles advocated in the book, especially the tendency to minimise the importance of seeking battle and forcing it to a conclusion, are directly in conflict with their views.&quot;)

Whatever one thinks of the result, it is true that the stakes were very high, the pressure on Jellicoe was immense, and his caution is certainly understandable - his judgement might have been that even 90% odds in favour were not good enough on which to bet the British Empire. The former [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[Winston Churchill]], said of the battle that Jellicoe &quot;was the only man who could have lost the war in an afternoon.&quot; The criticism of Jellicoe also fails to give enough credit to Scheer, who was determined to preserve his fleet by avoiding a decisive engagement, and showed great skill in effecting his escape.

===Beatty's actions===
There is another school of thought that condemns the actions of Admiral Beatty for the failure of a complete British victory. Although Beatty was undeniably a brave man, his [[encounter action]] with the German High Seas Fleet almost cost the British the battle. Most of the British losses in tonnage occurred in Beatty's squadron. The three capital ships the British lost that day were all under the command of Beatty. Beatty used his battle cruisers in a manner for which they were not designed. They had been anticipated for use as cruiser-destroyer, rather than for a direct attack on larger and better armored dreadnought battleships. A battlecruiser in a slugging match against a dreadnought battleship was at a decisive disadvantage.

Additionally, Beatty's lack of control over the encounter action is often criticised. Beatty did not apparently appreciate the finer points of command and control over a naval engagement. Beatty was on-board the battlecruiser ''Lion'' and lost contact with his four dreadnought battleships. Having the battlecruisers attack the German High Seas Fleet without the cover of the Queen Elizabeth super-dreadnoughts was a grave blunder. It both exposed the weakly armored battlecruisers and split his forces. Beatty's political influence in England prevented more criticism than took place at the time. Jellicoe's orderly attack on the Germans saved the day, according to proponents of this school of thought, and most probably Beatty's life.

'''Bambara''', also known as '''Bamanankan''' in the language itself, is a [[language]] spoken in [[Mali]] by as many as six million people (including second language users). The differences between Bambara and '''Dioula''' are minimal. Dioula is a language spoken or understood, by fewer numbers of people, in [[Burkina Faso]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], and [[Gambia]].  The Bambara language is primarily spoken by members of the [[Bambara]] ethnic group, numbering about 270,000 people, but serves also as an interethnic language of Mali. 

Bambara belongs to a group of closely-related languages called [[Manding languages|Manding]], within the larger [[Mande languages|Mandé]] group. It is an [[Subject Object Verb|SOV]] language and has two [[tone (tonal language)|tone]]s.
It uses seven vowels a, e, &amp;#603;, i, o, &amp;#596; and u (a like in car, e like in echo, &amp;#603; similar to the second e in echelon but more open, i like in India, o like in for, &amp;#596; like the final sound in gnaw, and u like in the name Honolulu).
Writing was introduced during the [[French colonial empire|French]] occupation and alphabetisation is a major issue especially in rural areas. Although written literature is only slowly evolving (due to the predominance of French as the &quot;language of the educated&quot;), there exists a wealth of [[oral history|oral literature]], which is often tales of kings and heroes. This oral literature is mainly tradited by the &quot;[[Griot]]&quot; who are a mixture of [[storyteller]]s, [[partysinger]]s and human history books who have studied the trade of singing and reciting for many years. Many of their songs are very old and are said to date back to the old kingdom of Mali.
Bambara is a national language of Mali, and also the most widely understood language in Mali.

Bambara has many local dialects. Some dialect variants: Somono, Segou, San, Beledugu, Ganadugu, Wasulu and Sikasso.

==Dioula==
Dioula is related to Bambara in a manner similar to the relation between [[American English]] and [[British English]]. It's probably the most used language for trade in [[West Africa]].

==Writing==
Since the seventies Bambara has mostly been written in the Latin alphabet, using some additional phonetic characters. The vowels are ''a, e, &amp;#603;'' (formerly ''è''), ''i, o, &amp;#596;'' (formerly ''ò''), ''u''; accents can be used to indicate tonality. The former digraph ''ny'' is now written ''&amp;#626;'' or ''ñ'' (Senegal). The ambiguous digraph &quot;ng&quot; represented both the &quot;hard ng&quot; sound in &quot;finger&quot; and the &quot;ng&quot; in &quot;king.&quot; The 1966 Bamako spelling conventions render the latter sound as &quot; &amp;#331;&quot;

[[N'Ko]] is a script devised by [[Solomana Kante]] in [[1949]] as a writing system for the Mande languages of West Africa; N&amp;#8217;Ko means 'I say' in all Mande languages. Kante created N&amp;#8217;Ko in response to what he felt were beliefs that Africans were a &quot;cultureless people&quot; since there was prior to this time, no indigenous African writing system for his language. N'ko came first into use in Kankan, Guinea as a Maninka alphabet and disseminated from there into other Mande-speaking parts of West Africa. The script is still in use for Bambara, although the Latin alphabet is much more common.

There are some &lt;!--or just one? [[User:Guaka|G-u-a-k-@]] hasn't found any yet, after nearly 3 months in Bamako.. :( --&gt; newspapers in Bambara.

==Grammar==
Bambara belongs to a group of closely-related languages called Manding (related to  [[Mandinka language|Mandinka]], [[Mande]] language group). It is an [[Subject Object Verb|SOV]] language and has two [[tone (tonal language)|tone]]s. The subject is usually &lt;!-- always? --&gt; followed by an auxilary verb (see [http://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/Cat%C3%A9gorie:Auxiliaires_bambaras auxilaries in Wiktionary]) possibly followed by the object and finally the verb.

In [[mathematical linguistics]] Bambara is regarded with interest, since for only very few languages it was possible to show that they were not [[context-free]].  For [[Swiss German|Zurich German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] the proof is based on sentence construction, whereas the proof for Bambara is based on word construction.

Bambara has no gender.  Gender for a noun can be specified by adding a suffix, ''-ce'' or ''-ke'' for male and ''-muso'' for female. The plural is formed by attaching ''-w'' to words. Sentences usually contain auxilary verbs.

Bambara uses postpositions, like &quot;bolo&quot; to indicate directions. Many postpositions are based on nouns, &quot;bolo&quot; also means ''hand''.

In urban areas, many Bambara conjunctions have been replaced in everyday use by French borrowings that often mark code-switches. The [[Bamako]] dialect makes use of sentences like: ''N taara Kita mais il n'y a personne là-bas.'' : ''I went to Kita [Bambara] but there was no one there [French].'' The sentence in Bambara alone would be ''N taara Kita nka mògòsi tuntè yen.'' The French proposition &quot;est-ce-que&quot; is also used in Bambara, however it is pronounced more slowly and as three syllables; &quot;ess uh kuh&quot;.

Bambara uses many French loan words. For example, some people might say: 
''I ka kulosi ye jauni ye'': &quot;Your skirt is yellow&quot; (using a derivation of the French word for yellow, jaune.)

However, one could also say:
''I ka kulosi ye neremuguman ye'', also meaning &quot;your skirt is yellow.&quot; The original Bambara word for yellow comes from &quot;''neremugu'',&quot; ''mugu'' being flour made from [[nere]], a seed from a long seed pod. Neremugu is often used in sauces in Southern Mali.

Most French loan words are suffixed with the sound 'i'; this is particularly common when using French words which have a meaning not traditionally found in Mali. For example, the Bambara word for [[snow]] is ''niegei'', based on the French word for snow ''neige''. As there has never been snow in Mali, there has not been a traditional meaning for the word and thus no unique word in Bambara to describe it.

===Examples===
;''N bè bamanankan fo dòòni dòòni''
:I speak a little bit of Bambara (litt: I ''aux positive'' Bambara speak little little)

;''I tè taa dumuni kè wa?''
:Aren't you going to eat? (litt: you ''aux negative'' go eat ''action'' ''question particle'')

==Music==
Malian artists such as [[Salif Keita]], [[Habib Koité]], and the blind couple [[Amadou &amp; Mariam]] often sing in Bambara.
[[Alpha Blondy]] often sings in Dioula.

[[Tiken Jah Fakoly]] (reggae) often sings in Dioula and French.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about the archaeological era, for the era in [[Classical mythology]] see [[Ages of Man]]''
:''For the comic book published by Image Comics, see [[Age of Bronze (comics)]]''

The '''Bronze Age''' is a period in a [[civilization]]'s development when the most advanced [[metalworking]] consisted of techniques for [[smelting]] [[copper]] and [[tin]] from naturally occurring outcroppings of ore, and then [[alloys|alloying]] those metals in order to cast [[bronze]].  The bronze age is part of the [[three-age system]] for [[prehistory|prehistoric societies]]. In that system, it follows the [[neolithic]] in some areas of the world.  In most parts of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the [[neolithic]] is directly followed by the '[[iron age]]'.

==Origins==
The earliest evidence of bronze metalworking dates to the mid [[4th millennium]] [[Maykop culture]] in the [[Caucasus]]. From there, the technology spread rapidly to the Near East and after some time to the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (see [[Meluhha]]).

==Near Eastern Bronze Age==
The Bronze Age in the Near East is divided into three main periods (the dates are very approximate):
* EBA - Early Bronze Age (c.3500-2000 BC)
* MBA - Middle Bronze Age (c.2000-1600 BC)
* LBA - Late Bronze Age (c.1600-1200 BC)
Each main period can be divided into shorter subcategories such as EB I, EB II, MB IIa etc.

Metallurgy developed first in [[Anatolia]], modern [[Turkey]]. The mountains in the Anatolian highland possessed rich deposits of copper and tin. Copper was also mined in [[Cyprus]], [[Egypt]], the [[Negev]] desert, [[Iran]] and around the [[Persian Gulf]]. Copper was usually mixed with arsenic, yet the growing demand for tin resulted in the establishment of distant trade routes in and out of Anatolia. The precious copper was also imported by sea routes to the great kingdoms of [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]].

The Early Bronze Age saw the rise of urbanization into organized city states and the invention of writing (the [[Uruk period]] in the fourth millennium BC). In the Middle Bronze Age movements of people partially changed the political pattern of the Near East ([[Amorites]], [[Hittites]], [[Hurrians]], [[Hyksos]] and possibly the [[Israelites]]). The Late Bronze Age is characterized by competing powerful kingdoms and their vassal states ([[Ancient Egypt]], [[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]], [[Hittites]], [[Mitanni]]). Extensive contacts were made with the [[Aegean civilization]] ([[Ahhiyawa]], [[Alashiya]]) in which the copper trade played an important role.

Iron began to be worked already in Late Bronze Age Anatolia. The transition into the Iron Age c.1200 BC was more of a political change in the Near East rather than of new developments in metalworking.

==Asia==
[[China]]'s bronze age began from around 2100? BC during the [[Xia dynasty]]. In [[Ban Chiang]], [[Thailand]], ([[Southeast Asia]]) bronze [[artefact]]s have been discovered dating to [[21st century BC|2100 BC]] [http://www.museum.upenn.edu/new/research/Exp_Rese_Disc/Asia/banchiang/bronzelab/index.shtml].

The [[Erlitou culture]], [[Shang Dynasty]] and [[Sanxingdui|Sanxingdui culture]] of early [[China]] used bronze vessels for rituals as well as farming implements and weapons [http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/chbro_bron.shtm].

The Middle [[Mumun pottery period]] culture of the southern [[Korean Peninsula]] gradually adopted bronze production circa [700-600?] BC after a period when Liaoning-style bronze daggers and other bronze artefacts were exchanged as far as the interior part of the Southern Peninsula (circa 900-700 B.C.). Bronze was an important element in ceremonies and as for mortuary offerings until AD 100.

==Aegean Bronze Age==
[[Image:Copper Ingot Crete.jpg|thumb|200px|Bronze Age copper ingot found in [[Crete]].]]
The [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]] bronze age civilisations established a far-ranging [[trade]] network.  This network imported [[tin]] and charcoal to [[Cyprus]], where [[copper]] was mined and alloyed with the tin to produce bronze. Bronze objects were then exported far and wide, and supported the trade. [[Isotope|Isotopic]] analysis of the tin in some [[Mediterranean]] bronze objects indicates it came from as far away as [[Great Britain]].{{fact}}

Knowledge of [[navigation]] was well developed at this time, and reached a peak of skill not exceeded until a method was discovered (or perhaps rediscovered) to determine [[longitude]] around [[1750]].  

The [[Minoan civilization]] appears to have coordinated and defended its bronze-age trade.

One crucial lack in this period was that modern methods of accounting were not available. Numerous authorities believe that ancient empires were prone to misvalue [[staples]] in favor of [[luxury|luxuries]], and thereby perish by famines created by [[uneconomic trade|uneconomic trading]].

How the bronze age ended in this region is still being studied.  There is evidence that [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] administration of the regional trade empire followed the decline of Minoan primacy.  Evidence also exists that supports the assumption that several Minoan [[client-states]] lost large portions of their respective populations to extreme famines and/or pestilence, which in turn would indicate that the trade network may have failed at some point, preventing the trade that would have previously relieved such famines and prevented some forms of illness (by nutrition).  It is also known that the [[bread-basket]] of the Minoan empire, the area north of the [[Black Sea]], also suddenly lost significant portions of its population, and thus probably some degree of cultivation in this era.

Recent research has discredited the theory that exhaustion of the [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] forests caused the end of the bronze trade.  The Cypriot forests are known to have existed into later times, and experiments have shown that [[charcoal]] production on the scale necessary for the bronze production of the late bronze age would have exhausted them in less than fifty years.

One theory says that as [[iron]] tools became more common, the main justification of the tin trade ended, and that trade network ceased to function as it once did.  The individual colonies of the Minoan empire then suffered drought, famine, war, or some combination of these three factors, and thus they had no access to the far-flung resources of an empire by which they could easily recover.

Another family of theories looks to the volcanic explosion of [[Thera]], which occurred shortly before the end of the bronze age.  Thera is about 40 miles north of [[Crete]], which was at the time the capital of the Minoan empire.  Some authorities  speculate that a [[tsunami]] from Thera destroyed Cretan cities.  Others say that perhaps a tsunami destroyed the Cretan [[navy]] in its home harbor, which then lost crucial battles with the [[Mycenae|Mycenaean]] navy, so that a former [[colony]] took over the empire.  

Yet another theory looks to the possible loss of Cretan expertise in administering the Empire.  If this expertise was concentrated in Crete, and simply became discredited by military failure, then the [[Mycenaean]]s may have made crucial political and commercial mistakes when administering their empire.

All of these theories are persuasive, and aspects of all of them may have some validity in describing the end of the bronze age in this region.

==British Bronze Age==
In [[Great Britain]], the bronze age is considered to have been the period from around [[21st century BC|2100]] to [[8th century BC|700 BC]]. [[Immigration]] brought new people to the islands from the continent, recent tooth enamel isotope research on bodies found in early bronze age graves around [[Stonehenge]] indicate that at least some of the immigrants came from the area of modern [[Switzerland]]. The [[Beaker people]] displayed different behaviours from the earlier [[Neolithic]] people and cultural change was significant although integration is thought to have been peaceful as many of the early [[henge]] sites were seemingly adopted by the newcomers. The rich [[Wessex culture]] developed in southern Britain at this time. Additionally, the climate was deteriorating, where once the weather was warm and dry it became much wetter as the bronze age continued, forcing the population away from easily-defended sites in the hills and into the fertile valleys. Large livestock ranches developed in the lowlands which appear to have contributed to economic growth and inspired increasing forest clearances. The [[Deverel-Rimbury culture]] began to emerge in the second half of the 'Middle Bronze Age' (c. [[1400 BC|1400]]-[[1100 BC]]) to exploit these conditions. [[Cornwall]] was a major source of [[tin]] for much of western Europe and [[copper]] was extracted from sites such as the [[Great Orme]] mine in northern [[Wales]].  Social groups appear to have been tribal but with growing complexity and hierarchies becoming apparent. 

Also, the burial of dead (which until this period had usually been communal) became more individual. For example, whereas in the Neolithic a large [[chambered cairn]] or [[long barrow]] was used to house the dead, the 'Early Bronze Age' saw people buried in individual [[tumulus|barrow]]s (also commonly known and marked on modern British Ordnance Survey maps as Tumuli), or sometimes in [[cist]]s covered with [[cairn]]s.

==Central European Bronze Age==
[[Image:Bronze age weapons Romania.jpg|thumb|right|Bronze age weaponry]]
In [[Central Europe]], the early bronze age [[Unetice culture]] ([[18th century BC|1800]]-[[16th century BC|1600 BC]]) includes numerous smaller groups like the [[Straubingen culture|Straubingen]], [[Adlerberg culture|Adlerberg]] and [[Hatvan|Hatvan cultures]]. Some very rich burials, such as the one located at [[Leubingen]] with grave gifts crafted from gold, point to an increase of social stratification already present in the Unetice culture. All in all, cemeteries of this period are rare and of small size. The Unetice culture is followed by the middle bronze age ([[16th century BC|1600]]-[[12th century BC|1200 BC]]) [[Tumulus culture]], which is  characterised by inhumation burials in [[tumuli]] (barrows). In the eastern [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[Körös]] tributaries, the early bronze age first saw the introduction of the [[Mako culture]], followed by the [[Ottomany culture|Ottomany]] and [[Gyulavarsand culture|Gyulavarsand]] cultures. 

The late bronze age [[urnfield]] culture, ([[13th century BC|1300 BC]]-[[700s BC|700 BC]]) is characterized by cremation burials. It includes the [[Lusatian culture]] in eastern [[Germany]] and [[Poland]] (([[1300 BC|1300]]-[[500 BC]]) that continues into the [[Iron Age]]. The Central European bronze age is followed by the iron age [[Hallstatt culture]] ([[700s BC|700]]-[[450 BC]]).

[[list of archaeological sites|Important sites]] include:
* [[Biskupin]] (Poland)
* [[Nebra]] (Germany)
* Zug-Sumpf, [[Zug]], [[Switzerland]]

==Nordic Bronze Age (1500-500 BC)==
{{main|Nordic Bronze Age}}

In northern [[Germany]], [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]], bronze age inhabitants manufactured many distinctive and beautiful artifacts, such as the pairs of [[lurer]] horns discovered in Denmark.  Some linguists believe that a [[proto-Indo-European language]] was probably introduced to the area around [[20th century BC|2000 BC]], which eventually became the ancestor of the [[Germanic languages]]. This would fit with the evolution of the Nordic bronze age into the most probably Germanic [[pre-Roman iron age]].  

The age is divided into the periods I-VI according to [[Oscar Montelius]]. Period Montelius V already belongs to the [[Iron Age]] in other regions.

In 1998, with the advent of [[digital television]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[satellite]] and [[digital terrestrial television]] viewers were able to view the service.  Initially it was difficult to obtain a digital satellite or terrestrial receiver without a subscription to Sky or [[ONdigital]] respectively, but now the channel forms an important part of the [[Freeview]] package of channels.  
==Background==
The BBC were initially criticised for the cost of running BBC News 24 channel, with so few viewers. Their response was to promote the channel through [[BBC One]] and later also [[BBC Two]], by having them [[simulcast]] News 24 output at night. This has made BBC News 24 available to non-digital viewers receiving BBC One/Two's analogue [[Terrestrial Television|terrestrial]] signals, and this is seen by some as influential (to a certain limited extent) in promoting the take-up of digital television. Following the end of the long running [[Breakfast with Frost]], in the summer of 2005, BBC One simulcast '''News 24 Sunday''', a weekly Sunday morning interview show presented by [[Peter Sissons]]. This ended when the replacement to Breakfast with Frost, [[Sunday AM]] presented by [[Andrew Marr]] began. 

Examples of News 24 network broadcasts include the [[September 11th attacks]], [[Operation Red Dawn|the capture of Saddam Hussein]] and [[7 July 2005 London bombings|the London bombings of July 7th, 2005]].

In September [[1999]] the [[European Commission]] ruled against a complaint by [[Sky News]] which argued that the publicly funded News 24 was unfair and illegal under [[European Union|EU]] law. The EC ruled that the licence fee should be considered state aid but that such aid was justified due to the public service remit of the BBC and that it did not exceed actual costs.

The BBC's 2004 [http://www.bbc.co.uk/annualreport/ annual report] claims that News 24 outperformed Sky News in both weekly and monthly reach in multichannel homes for the January 2004 period, and for the first time in two years moved ahead of Sky News in being perceived as the channel best for news. 

News 24 broadcasts from the News Centre in [[BBC Television Centre]], West [[London]].

== Presentation ==
[[Image:BBC News 24 evolution.JPG|550px|centre|]]
The initial format of the channel was criticised as being less authoritative than other [[BBC News]] output, this being blamed on the radical colour and design of the set and the shirtsleeved male presenters. As a result the channel was relaunched on [[October 25]], [[1999]] with a new set, music and titles which were based on the recently relaunched network news. This similarity was intended to increase the credibility of the channel and aid cross channel promotion.

In December 2002 the Lambert Report, an independent review commissioned by the government, criticised the BBC Governors for failing to ensure that News 24 had a distinct identity from the commercial rolling-news services provided by the [[ITV News Channel]] and [[Sky News]]. As a result the [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport|Culture Secretary]] [[Tessa Jowell]] announced new conditions on the &quot;approvals&quot; under which the BBC operates News 24. 

[[Image:BBCnews24breakingnews.jpg|thumb|right|An example of the new breaking news graphic]]
In December 2003, the channel was relaunched, with cosmetic changes to the look and feel of the channel being the main obvious change.  A new set was launched, replacing the beige and red design introduced in 1999.  New graphics were also introduced, which are more attention grabbing,  the channel signature theme tune was refreshed and a new 'live-rendered' title sequence designed.  In addition, criticism was made that &quot;no one notices breaking news&quot; on the channel, so together with the new attention seeking graphics, a breaking news &quot;sting&quot; was developed, which is designed to grab people's attention whenever breaking news is flashed upon the screen. The relaunch also takes into account the criticisms in the Lambert Report, introducing more analysis and features into the schedules of the channel which makes it more distinctive from its commercial rivals.

Following the relaunch of news bulletins on '''BBC One''', the graphics were altered slightly, with the globe changed to red from orange for land and black for sea and the 24 in white. The red ribbons were also changed to a slightly darker shade.

===Countdown===
Since the October 1999 relaunch an important element of News 24 presentation has been the countdown to the top of every hour. The countdown is to show viewers the pace of the channel. The full version was 90 seconds, though approximately 30 seconds were normally shown. The original countdown featured ivory numbers and globe against a deep red background, reflecting the wider rebranding of the channel. The music was composed by [[David Lowe]], responsible for the network news music. 

In [[January 2003]] this countdown was revised to show life around the UK; [[stockbroker]]s, [[playground]]s, [[commuting | commuters]], [[hospital]]s and [[school]] lessons were all shown. With the December 2003 relaunch of the channel the music of the countdown was adapted for the first time and the footage was revised to include markets, fairgrounds and the newsroom and news centre at [[Television Centre]].

On [[March 28]], [[2005]] the countdown was radically altered. The full version is 60 seconds long, but they still normally show about 30 seconds on air. The music was again revised but the biggest change came in the footage used &amp;mdash; it now reflects the methods and nature of newsmore modern weapons. The Reichswehr was forced to adopt a small and professional army quite aside from any German plans, for the [[Treaty of Versailles]] limited it to 100,000 men.

Bewegungskrieg required a new command hierarchy that allowed military decisions to be made closer to the unit level. This allowed units  to react and make effective decisions faster, which is a critical advantage and a major reason for the success of Blitzkrieg.

German leadership had also been criticised for failing to understand the technical advances of the First World War, having given [[History of the tank|tank production]] the lowest priority and having conducted no studies of the [[machine gun]] prior to that war.{{ref|2}} In response, German officers attended [[technical school]]s during this period of rebuilding after the war.

[[Infiltration tactics]] invented by the German Army during the First World War became the basis for later tactics. German infantry had advanced in small, decentralised groups which bypassed resistance in favour of advancing at weak points and attacking rear-area communications. This was aided by co-ordinated artillery and air bombardments, and followed by larger infantry forces with heavy guns, which destroyed centres of resistance. These concepts formed the basis of the [[Wehrmacht]]'s tactics during the Second World War.

On the war's Eastern Front, combat did not bog down into [[trench warfare]]. German and Russian armies fought a war of manoeuvre over thousands of miles, giving the German leadership unique experience which the trench-bound Western Allies did not have.{{ref|3}} Studies of operations in the East led to the conclusion that small and coordinated forces possessed more combat worth than large, uncoordinated forces.

===Foreign influence===
During this period, all the war's major combatants developed mechanised force theories. Theories of the Western Allies differed substantially from the Reichswehr's. British, French, and American doctrines broadly favoured a more set-piece battle, less combined arms focus, and less focus on concentration. Early Reichswehr periodicals contained many translated works, though they were often not adopted. Technical advances in foreign countries were, however, observed and used in-part by the Weapons Office. Foreign doctrines are widely considered to have had little serious influence.{{ref|14}}

Col. [[Charles de Gaulle]], in [[France]], was a known advocate of concentration of armour and aeroplanes — views that little endeared him to the French high command, but are claimed by some to have influenced [[Heinz Guderian]]. [http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article_print.php?id_article=20]

British theorists [[J.F.C. Fuller]] and [[B. H. Liddell Hart]] have often been associated with blitzkrieg's development, though this is a matter of controversy. It is argued that [[Guderian]], a critical figure in blitzkrieg's conception, drew some of his inspiration from Hart. This was based on a paragraph in the English edition of Guderian's autobiography in which he credits Hart. In opposition, it is argued that Hart, as editor of the autobiography's English edition, wrote that paragraph himself or, more broadly, that his influence on Guderian was not as significant as held. Fuller's influence is less clear. During the war, he developed plans for massive, independent tank operations and was subsequently studied by the German leadership. It is variously argued that Fuller's wartime plans and post-war writings were an inspiration, or that his readership was low and German experiences during the war received more attention.

What is clear is the practical implementation of this doctrine in a wide and successful range of scenarios by Guderian and other Germans during the war. From early combined-arms river crossings and penetration exploitations during the advance in France in 1940 to massive sweeping advances in Russia in 1942, Guderian showed a mastery and innovation that inspired many others. This leadership was supported and fostered by the Reichswehr General Staff system, which worked the Army to greater and greater levels of capability through massive and systematic Movement warfare war games in the 1930s. 

The Reichswehr and Red Army collaborated in [[wargame]]s and tests in [[Kazan]] and [[Lipetsk]] beginning in 1926. Set within the Soviet Union, these two centres were used to field test aircraft and armoured vehicles up to the battalion level, as well as housing aerial and armoured warfare schools through which officers were rotated. This was done in the Soviet Union, in secret, to evade the Treaty of Versailles's occupational agent, the [[Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control|Inter-Allied Commission]].{{ref|4}}

===Guderian into the Wehrmacht===
[[Image:guderian 1.jpg|right|thumb|General [[Heinz Guderian]], a theorist key to Germany's development of blitzkrieg.]]
Following Germany's military reforms of the 1920s, [[Heinz Guderian]] emerged as a strong proponent of mechanised forces. Within the Inspectorate of Transport Troops, Guderian and colleagues performed theoretical and field exercise work. There was opposition from many officers who gave primacy to the infantry or simply doubted the usefulness of the tank. Among them was Chief of the General Staff [[Ludwig Beck]] (1935–38), who was sceptical that armoured forces could be decisive. Nonetheless, the panzer divisions were established during his tenure.

Guderian argued that the tank was the decisive weapon of war. &quot;If the tanks succeed, then victory follows&quot;, he wrote. In an article addressed to critics of tank warfare, he wrote &quot;until our critics can produce some new and better method of making a successful land attack other than self-massacre, we shall continue to maintain our beliefs that tanks—properly employed, needless to say—are today the best means available for a land attack.&quot; Addressing the faster rate at which defenders could reinforce an area than attackers could penetrate it during the First World War, Guderian wrote that &quot;since reserve forces will now be motorised, the building up of new defensive fronts is easier than it used to be; the chances of an offensive based on the timetable of artillery and infantry co-operation are, as a result, even slighter today than they were in the last war.&quot; He continued, &quot;We believe that by attacking with tanks we can achieve a higher rate of movement than has been hitherto obtainable, and—what is perhaps even more important—that we can keep moving once a breakthrough has been made.&quot;{{ref|5}} Guderian additionally required that tactical [[radio]]s be widely used to facilitate co-ordination and command.

===Panzertruppe and Luftwaffe===
[[Image:EarlyPzDivTOE.png|thumb|right|250px|Organisation of a 1941 German [[Panzertruppe|panzer division]].]]

Blitzkrieg would not have been possible without modifying Germany's standing interwar military, which under the [[Treaty of Versailles]] was limited to 100,000 men, its air force disbanded, and tank development forbidden. After becoming head of state in 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] ignored these provisions. A command for armoured troops was created within the German [[Heer]]—the ''[[Panzertruppe]]'', as it came to be known later. The [[Luftwaffe]], or air force, was re-established, and development begun on ground-attack aircraft and doctrines. Hitler was a strong supporter of this new strategy. He observed panzer field exercises and read Guderian's book ''Achtung! Panzer!''{{ref|6}} Upon seeing exercises at [[Kummersdorf]], he remarked &quot;That is what I want—and that is what I will have.&quot;{{ref|7}}

===Spanish Civil War===
[[Image:Pzkpfwiausfa.jpg|thumb|left|[[Panzer I|PzKpfw I]] saw extensive use as training and scout vehicles in most blitzkrieg operations]]
German volunteers tested aspects of blitzkrieg tactics during the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936. Panzer commitments consisted of Panzer Battalion 88, a force built around three companies of [[Panzer I|PzKpfw I]]'s that functioned as a training cadre for Nationalists. The Luftwaffe deployed squadrons of [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], [[Dive bomber|dive-bombers]], and [[Transport aircraft|transports]] as the [[Condor Legion]].{{ref|8}} Guderian called the panzer employment &quot;on too small a scale to allow accurate assessments to be made.&quot;{{ref|9}} More was gained by the Luftwaffe, which developed both tactics and aircraft in combat; it was here that the [[Junkers Ju 87|Stuka]] first saw combat. Eighteen thousand Luftwaffe troops also gained combat experience.

==Methods of operations==
===Schwerpunkt===
Blitzkrieg sought decisive actions at all times. To this end, the theory of a ''schwerpunkt'' (focal point) developed; it was the point of maximum effort. Panzer and Luftwaffe forces were used only at this point of maximum effort whenever possible. By local success at the ''schwerpunkt'', a small force achieved a breakthrough and gained advantages by fighting in the enemy's rear. It is summarised by Guderian as &quot;Nicht kleckern, klotzen!&quot; (Don't tickle, smash!)

To achieve a breakout, infantry or, less commonly, panzer forces themselves (otherwise preserved for manoeuvre beyond) would attack the enemy's defensive line, supported by artillery fire and Luftwaffe bombing. These forces created a breach in the depth of the enemy's line. Through this breach passed the panzer forces in their entirety, as the breaching force attacked to the flanks to increase security through distance. This point of breakout has been labelled a &quot;hinge&quot;, for from it panzer forces manoeuvred forward and developed &quot;leverage&quot; against the defensive line's forces.

In this, the opening phase of an operation, the Luftwaffe sought a coup against enemy air forces. It attempted to strafe and bomb landed aircraft and runways, disabling them, or deploy in fighter sweeps to clear the skies in large battles. From the beginning, air superiority  was a goal; to operate as designed, the panzer force required that reconnaissance aircraft, ground-attack aircraft, and in some cases transport aircraft all be able to fly. With the Luftwaffe itself driven from the sky in the war's later years, operating under Allied air superiority would be a hindrance ([[#Air superiority|See below]]).

A final element was the use of [[airborne forces]] beyond the enemy lines. These were not only to disrupt enemy activities or take important positions, in ''Blitzkrieg'' they were also to serve as a psychological inducement for the troops trying to forge ahead into enemy territory - since any rapid advance is in danger of eventually slowing down when urgency is lost and supply lines lengthen, while troop strengths fall due to inevitable casualities. It was the stated purpose of commanding officers that the airborne troops deployed far beyond enemy lines serve as a sort of 'beacon' which the advancing troops were to relieve. In this urgent rush to save their comrades from eventually being overwhelmed by heavier enemy forces was thus seen an important element of preventing an advance from slowing down too much.

===Paralysis===
[[Image:PanzerV Panther D.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Panther tank|Panther Ausf. D]], one of the more advanced German panzer designs developed from experience with the Soviet [[T-34]].]]
Having achieved a breakthrough into the enemy's rear areas, German forces attempted to paralyse the enemy's decision making and implementation process. Moving faster than enemy forces, panzer forces exploited weaknesses and acted before opposing forces could formulate a response. Guderian wrote that &quot;Success must be exploited without respite and with every ounce of strength, even by night. The defeated enemy must be given no peace.&quot;

Central to this is the [[decision cycle]]. Every decision made by German or opposing forces required time to gather information, make a decision, disseminate orders to subordinates, and then implement this decision through action. Through superior mobility and faster decision-making cycles, panzer forces could take action on a situation sooner than the forces opposing them.

[[Directive control]] was a fast and flexible method of command. Rather than receiving an explicit order, a commander would be told of his superior's intent and the role which his unit was to fill in this concept. The exact method of execution was then a matter for the low-level commander to determine as best fit the situation. Staff burden was reduced at the top and spread among commands more knowledgeable about their own situation. In addition, the encouragement of initiative at all levels aided implementation. As a result, significant decisions could be effected quickly and either verbally or with written orders a few pages in length.

===Kesselschlacht===
An operation's final phase, the ''Kesselschlacht'' (cauldron battle), was a concentric attack on an encircled force. It was here that most losses were inflicted upon the enemy, primarily through the capture of prisoners and weapons.

==Operations in the Second World War==
===Poland 1939===
[[Image:Poland2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|In Poland, panzer divisions created numerous pockets of Polish forces (blue circles) that were destroyed by following infantry.]]

Despite the term ''blitzkrieg'' being coined during the [[Polish September Campaign]] of 1939, historians generally hold that German operations during it were more consistent with more traditional methods. The Wehrmacht's strategy was more inline with [[Vernichtungsgedanken]], or a focus on envelopment to create pockets in broad-front annihilation. Panzer forces were deployed among the three German concentrations without strong emphasis on independent use, being used to create or destroy close pockets of [[Polish Army|Polish forces]] and seize operational-depth terrain in support of the largely unmotorised infantry which followed. The Luftwaffe gained air superiority by a combination of superior technology and numbers. Common claims that the Polish Air Force was destroyed early in the campaign while it was on the ground are not true. Polish aircraft were moved to hidden airstrips approximately 48 hours before the outbreak of the hostilities.

The understanding of operations in Poland has shifted considerably since the Second World War. Many early postwar histories, such as Barrie Pitt's in ''The Second World War'' (BPC Publishing 1966), incorrectly attribute German victory to &quot;enormous development in military technique which occurred between 1918 and 1940&quot;, incorrectly citing that &quot;Germany, who translated (British inter-war) theories into action...called the result Blitzkrieg.&quot;  More recent histories identify German operations in Poland as relatively cautious and traditional.  Matthew Cooper wrote (in ''The German Army 1939-1945: Its Political and Military Failure'') that &quot;(t)hroughout ([[Polish September Campaign|the Polish Campaign]]), the employment of the mechanised units revealed the idea that they were intended solely to ease the advance and to support the activities of the infantry....Thus, any strategic exploitation of the armoured idea was still-born. The paralysis of command and the breakdown of morale were not made the ultimate aim of the ... German ground and air forces, and were only incidental by-products of the traditional manoeuvers of rapid encirclement and of the supporting activities of the flying artillery of the Luftwaffe, both of which had has their purpose the physical destruction of the enemy troops. Such was the [[Vernichtungsgedanke]] of the Polish campaign.&quot;  He went on to say that the use of tanks &quot;left much to be desired...Fear of enemy action against the flanks of the advance, fear which was to prove so disastrous to German prospects in the west in 1940 and in the Soviet Union in 1941, was present from the beginning of the war.&quot;  John Ellis, writing in ''Brute Force'' (Viking Penguin, 1990) asserted that &quot;...there is considerable justice in Matthew Cooper's assertion that the panzer divisions were not given the kind of ''strategic'' mission that was to characterise authentic armoured ''blitzkrieg'', and were almost always closely subordinated to the various mass infantry armies.&quot; In fact, according to Zaloga and Madej, in ''The Polish Campaign 1939'' (Hippocrene Books, 1985), &quot;Whilst Western accounts of the September campaign have stressed the shock value of the panzers and Stuka attacks, they have tended to underestimate the punishing effect of German artillery  on Polish units. Mobile and available in significant quantity, artillery shattered as many units as any other branch of the Wehrmacht.&quot;

===France 1940===
The [[Battle of France|invasion of France]] consisted of two phases, Operation Yellow  (''Fall Gelb'') and Operation Red. Yellow opened with a feint conducted against Holland and Belgium by two Panzer corps and [[paratrooper]]s. Three days later, the main panzer effort of Panzer Group von Kleist attacked through the [[Ardennes]] and achieved a breakthrough with Luftwaffe air support. The group raced to the coast of the [[English Channel]], dislodging the [[British Expeditionary Force]], [[Belgian Army]], and some divisions of the [[French Army]]. The Panzer units initially advanced far beyond the following divisions. The Panzers were met with a counterattack at the [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Battle of Arras]] the tough British tanks inducing a brief panic in the High Command. The Panzer forces were halted outside the port city of Dunkirk which was being used to evacuate the Allied forces. The Luftwaffe (in the form of Goering) had promised to complete the job but its bombing did not prevent the evacuation of the majority of the troops ([[Operation Dynamo]]); some 330,000 French and British. Operation Red then began with XV Panzer Corps attacking towards [[Brest, France|Brest]] and XIV Panzer Corps attacking south, east of Paris, towards [[Lyon]], and XIX Panzer Corps completing the encirclement of the [[Maginot Line]]. The defending forces were hard pressed to organise any sort of counter-attack. The French forces were continually ordered to form new lines along rivers, often arriving to find the German forces had already passed them.

===Soviet Union: the Eastern Front: 1941–45===
[[Image:DefensivePincersVolkhov.png|thumb|right|250px|After 1941–42, panzer forces were increasingly used as a mobile reserve against Allied breakthroughs.]] 
Use of armoured forces was crucial for both sides on the Eastern Front. [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1941, involved a number of breakthroughs and encirclements by panzer forces. Its stated goal was &quot;to destroy the Russian forces deployed in the West and to prevent their escape into the wide-open spaces of Russia.&quot;{{ref|10}} This was generally achieved by four panzer armies which encircled surprised and disorganised Soviet forces, followed by marching infantry which completed the encirclement and defeated the trapped forces. The first year of the [[Eastern Front (WWII)|Eastern Front]] offensive can generally be considered to have had the last successful major blitzkrieg operations.

After Germany's failure to destroy the Soviets before the winter of 1941, the limits of blitzkrieg became visible. Although the German attack took huge areas of Soviet territory, the overall strategic effects were more limited. The [[Red Army]] was able to regroup far to the rear of the main battle line, and eventually defeat the German forces for the first time in the [[Battle of Moscow]]. 

In the summer of 1942, when Germany launched another offensive in the southern [[USSR]] against [[Stalingrad]] and the [[Caucasus]], the Soviets again lost tremendous amounts of territory, only to counter-attack once more during winter.  German gains were ultimately limited by [[Hitler]] diverting forces from the attack on Stalingrad itself and seeking to pursue a drive to the Caucasus oilfields simultaneously as opposed to subsequently as the original plan had envisaged.[[Image:Jagdtiger 1.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[Jagdtiger]], one of the most formidable German [[tank destroyer]]s. These specialised vehicles denied the basics of blitzkrieg because their designs trade mobility for firepower and protection.]]

===Western Front, 1944–45===
As the war progressed, Allied armies began using tactics somewhat resembling the blitzkrieg tactics of Germany. Many operations in the Western Desert and on the Eastern Front relied on massive concentrations of firepower to establish breakthroughs by fast-moving armoured units. These artillery-based tactics were also decisive in Western Front operations after [[Operation Overlord]] and both the British Commonwealth and American  armies developed flexible and powerful systems for utilizing artillery support.  What the Russians lacked in flexibility, they made up for in number of rocket, cannon, and mortar tubes.  The Germans never achieved the kind of response times or fire concentrations their enemies were capable of by 1944.

After the Allied landings at [[Battle of Normandy|Normandy]], Germany made attempts to overwhelm the landing force with armoured attacks but this failed for lack of co-ordination and Allied air superiority.  The most notable attempt to use Blitzkrieg in Normandy was at Mortain, which resulted in the creation of the Falaise Gap and the ultimate destruction of German forces in Normandy.  The Mortain counter-attack was launched against Allied forces employed in [[Operation Cobra]], U.S. 12th Army Group's breakout from the Normandy area at [[St.-Lô]]. The German [[German Seventh Army|Seventh Army]] attacked towards the coast at St.-Lô, attempting to cut off the [[U.S. Third Army]], commanded by [[George S. Patton]], in [[Operation Lüttich]]. It was unable to achieve a breakthrough against defending infantry and, stalled, was encircled and effectively destroyed by U.S. 12th Army Group.

The Allied offensive in central France, spearheaded by armoured units from [[George S. Patton]]'s Third Army, used breakthrough and penetration techniques that were essentially identical to blitzkrieg. Patton acknowledged that he had read both Guderian and Rommel before the war, and his tactics shared their emphasis on speed and attack. A phrase commonly used in his units was &quot;haul ass and bypass.&quot;

Germany's last offensive on its Western front, [[Battle of the Bulge|Operation Wacht am Rhein]], was a blitzkrieg offensive towards the vital port of [[Antwerp]] during the winter of 1944 to 1945. Launched in poor weather against a weakened Allied sector, it achieved surprise and initial success. Allied air power was stymied by cloud cover. However, defence along the [[Ardennes]] and few serviceable roads caused delays. Allied forces deployed to the flanks of the German penetration, and Allied aircraft were again able to attack panzer columns, finally routing them. While the strategy itself had been sound, the German troops had already been reduced beyond their ability to effectively exploit the initial gains.

==Countermeasures and limitations==
===Terrain===
Blitzkrieg was largely dependent upon terrain and weather conditions. Where the ability for rapid movement across &quot;tank country&quot; was not possible, blitzkrieg was often avoided or resulted in failure. Terrain would ideally be flat, firm, unobstructed by natural barriers or fortifications, and interspersed with roads and railways. If it was instead hilly, wooded, marshy, or urban, panzers would be vulnerable to infantry in close-quarters combat and unable to breakout at full speed. Additionally, units could be halted by mud ([[thaw]]ing along the Eastern Front regularly slowed both sides) or extreme snow.

===Air superiority===
[[Image:Il2 sturmovik.jpg|thumb|right|400px|[[Ilyushin Il-2]], formidable Soviet [[ground attack aircraft]] that specialised in destroying German armour]]
Allied [[air superiority]] became a critical hindrance to German operations during the later years of the war. Early German successes enjoyed air superiority with unencumbered movement of ground forces, close air support, and aerial reconnaissance. However, the Western Allies' air-to-ground attacks were so great following the lead up to [[Operation Overlord]] that panzer crews deployed from the Western to Eastern Front showed reluctance to moving en masse during daylight. Indeed, the final German blitzkrieg operation in the west, [[Operation Wacht am Rhein]], was planned to take place during poor weather which grounded Allied aircraft. Under these conditions, it was difficult for German commanders to employ the panzer arm to its envisioned potential.

===Counter-tactics===
[[Image:Stanislaw Maczek.jpg|thumb|right|150px| General [[Stanisław Maczek]], one of the early developers of anti-blitzkrieg tactics]]

Blitzkrieg was very effective against [[static defence]] doctrines that most countries developed in the aftermath of the First World War. Early attempts to defeat the blitzkrieg can be dated to the [[Polish September Campaign]] in 1939, where Polish general [[Stanisław Maczek]], commander of 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade, prepared a detailed report of blitzkrieg tactics, its usage, effectiveness and possible precautions for the French military from his experiences. However, the French staff disregarded this report (it was captured, unopened, by the German army). Later, Maczek would become one of the most successful Allied armoured forces commanders in the war.

During the [[Battle of France]] in 1940, De Gaulle's 4th Armour Division and elements of the British Armour Brigade in the British Expeditionary Force both made probing attacks on the German flank, actually pushing into the rear of the blitzkrieging armoured columns at times (See [[Battle of Arras (1940)]] ). This may have been a reason for Hitler to call a halt to the panzers' advance. Those attacks combined with [[Maxime Weygand]]'s [[Hedgehog tactic]] would become the major basis for responding to blitzkrieg attacks in the future: deployment in depth, permitting enemy forces to bypass defensive concentrations, reliance on anti-tank guns, strong force employment on the flanks of the enemy attack, followed by counter-attacks at the base to destroy the enemy advance in detail. While Allied forces in 1940 lacked the experience to successfully develop these strategies, resulting in France's capitulation with heavy losses, they characterized later Allied operations such as Kursk (where Russian armies deployed in great depth), Mortain (where counterattacks by the US and Canadian armies closed the Falaise Gap) or the Ardennes (and the hedgehog defence of Bastogne and counterattack of the US 3rd Army).  

By 1944 the Allied armies' [[Ordnance QF 17 pounder|17 pdr]] anti-tank guns and [[90 mm M3 gun|90 mm gun]]-equipped tank destroyers and the Germans' famous [[88 mm gun|88s]] were very successful in blunting tank attacks, especially those with little infantry support. By that time the Allies had also developed their own version of both offensive and defensive strategies using armoured forces.

===Logistics===
Although effective in quick campaigns against Poland and France, blitzkrieg could not be sustained by Germany in later years. Blitzkrieg strategy has the inherent danger of the attacking force overextending its [[supply line]]s, and the strategy as a whole can be defeated by a determined foe who is willing to sacrifice territory for time in which to regroup and rearm, as the Soviets did on the Eastern Front. Tank and vehicle production was a constant problem for Germany; indeed, late in the war many panzer &quot;divisions&quot; had no more than a few dozen tanks.{{ref|11}} As the end of the war approached, Germany also experienced critical shortages in [[fuel]] and [[ammunition]] stocks as a result of Anglo-American [[strategic bombing]]. Although production of Luftwaffe fighter aircraft continued, they would be unable to fly for lack of fuel. What fuel there was went to panzer divisions, and even then they were not able to operate normally. Of those [[Tiger I|Tiger]] tanks lost against the United States Army, nearly half of them were abandoned for lack of fuel.{{ref|12}}

==Influence==
Blitzkrieg's widest influence was within the [[Allies|Western Allied]] leadership of the war, some of whom drew inspiration from the Wehrmacht's approach. United States General [[George S. Patton]] emphasized fast pursuit, the use of an armoured spearhead to effect a breakthrough, then cut off and disrupt enemy forces prior to their flight. In his comments of the time, he credited Guderian and Rommel's work, notably ''Infantry Attacks'', for this insight.  He also put into practice the idea attributed to cavalry leader [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]], &quot;Get there fustest with the mostest.&quot; (Get there fastest, with the most forces).

Blitzkrieg also has had some influence on subsequent militaries and doctrines. The [[Israeli Defense Forces]] may have been influenced by blitzkrieg in creating a military of flexible armoured spearheads and [[close air support]].{{ref|13}} The 1990's United States theorists of &quot;[[Shock and awe]]&quot; claim blitzkrieg as a subset of strategies which they term &quot;rapid dominance&quot;.

==Changing Interpretations of Blitzkrieg==
Beginning in the 1970s, the interpretation of Blitzkrieg, particularly with respect to the Second World War, has undergone a shift in the historical community.  John Ellis described the shift in his book ''Brute Force'' in 1990.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our perception of land operations in the Second World War has...been distorted by an excessive emphasis upon the hardware employed.  The main focus of attention has been the tank and the formations that employed it, most notably the (German) panzer divisions.  Despite the fact that only 40 of the 520 German divisions that saw combat were panzer divisions (there were also an extra 24 motorised/panzergrenadier divisions), the history of German operations has consistently almost exclusively been written largely in terms of ''blitzkrieg'' and has concentrated almost exclusively upon the exploits of the mechanised formations.  Even more misleadingly, this presentation of ground combat as a largely armoured confrontation has been extended to cover Allied operations, so that in the popular imagination the exploits of the British and Commonwealth Armies, with only 11 armoured divisions out of 73 (that saw combat), and of the Americans in Europe, with only 16 out of 59, are typified by tanks sweeping around the Western Desert or trying to keep up with Patton in the race through Sicily and across northern France.  Of course, these armoured forces did play a somewhat more important role in operations than the simple proportions might indicate, but it still has to be stressed that they in no way dominated the battlefield or precipitated the evolution of completely new modes of warfare.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ellis, as well as Zaloga in his study of the Polish Campaign in 1939, points to the effective use of other arms such as artillery and aerial firepower as equally important to the success of German (and later, Allied) operations.  Panzer operations in Russia failed to provide decisive results; Leningrad never fell despite an entire Panzer Group being assigned to take it, nor did Moscow.  In 1942 panzer formations overstretched at Stalingrad and in the Caucasus, and what successes did take place - such as Manstein at Kharkov or Krivoi Rog - were of local significance only.

:''This article is about the comic. For other uses, see [[Beano]].''
'''''The Beano''''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[child]]ren's [[comic book|comic]] published by [[D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd]] of [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]], which was first issued on [[26 July]] [[1938]] (dated [[30 July]]). The present [[editor]] is [[Euan Kerr (editor)|Euan Kerr]], who has been in this role since [[1984]]. Currently the comic costs 80p. 

There have been several long-running strips over the years. The longest-running strip in the comic [[as of 2005]] is ''[[Dennis the Menace (UK)|Dennis the Menace and Gnasher]]'', which first appeared (under the name ''Dennis the Menace'') in [[1951]]. Other famous strips include ''[[The Bash Street Kids]]'', ''[[Minnie the Minx]]'', and ''[[Roger the Dodger]]''. ''[[Lord Snooty]]'' appeared in the very first issue, but disappeared from the comic in [[1990]].

There are frequent [[fictional crossover]]s between the strips, with most of the characters living in the fictional town of [[Beanotown]].

A first issue of The Beano sold for [[Pound Sterling|£]]12,100 on [[16 March]] [[2004]], which was at the time the highest price ever paid for a British comic at an [[auction]].

The Beano is also the second longest running comic, the first being [[The Dandy]] which is also made by [[D.C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd]].

==Trivia==
The Beano comic takes its name from the [[English English]] word ''beano'' which can be loosely interpreted as ''a fun time''. For further discussion of the origin of this word, see [http://www.bicycle-beano.co.uk/beano.html The Meaning Of Beano].  [[Private Eye]] refers to [[The Spectator (1828)|The Spectator]] as &quot;The Hasbeano&quot;, with the Spectator's editor [[Boris Johnson]] becoming &quot;Boris the Menace&quot;.

[[Image:Bees Collecting Pollen 2004-08-14.jpg|thumb|right|Bee collecting pollen]]
'''Bees''' ('''Apoidea''' superfamily) are flying [[insect]]s, closely related to [[wasp]]s and [[ant]]s.  There are approximately 20,000 species of bees, and they may be found on every continent except Antarctica. Bees are adapted for feeding on [[nectar (plant)|nectar]] and [[pollen]], the former primarily as an energy source, and the latter primarily for [[protein]] and other nutrients. Most pollen is used for food for the [[larva|brood]]. 

Bees have a long [[proboscis]] that enables them to obtain the nectar from [[flower]]s. Bees have [[antennae]] made up of thirteen segments in males and twelve in females. They have two pairs of wings, the back pair being the smaller of the two. 

Bees play an important role in [[pollination|pollinating]] [[flowering plant]]s, and are called [[pollinator]]s. Bees may focus on gathering nectar or on gathering pollen, depending on their greater need at the time. Bees gathering nectar may accomplish pollination, but bees that are deliberately gathering pollen are more efficient pollinators. It is estimated that one third of the human food supply depends on insect pollination, most of this accomplished by bees.

Bees are fuzzy and carry an electrostatic charge, thus aiding in the adherence of pollen. Bees periodically stop foraging and groom themselves to pack the pollen into specialized [[pollen basket]]s which are on the legs of honeybees and some other [[species]], and on the ventral [[abdomen]] on other species.

Bees are extremely important as pollinators in [[agriculture]], with [[pollination management|contract pollination]] having overtaken the role of [[honey]] production for beekeepers in many countries. [[Monoculture]] and [[pollinator decline]] have increasingly caused honeybee keepers to become [[Seasonal human migration|migratory]] so that bees can be concentrated in areas of pollination need at the appropriate season. Many other species of bees are increasingly cultured and used to meet agricultural pollination need. Bees also play a major, though not always understood, role in providing food for birds and wildlife. Many of these bees survive in refuge in wild areas away from agricultural spraying, only to be poisoned in massive spray programs for [[mosquito]]es, [[gypsy moth]]s, or other [[Pest (animal)|pest]] insects.

There are over 16,000 described species, and possibly around 30,000 species in total. Many species are poorly known. The smallest bee is a dwarf bee (Trigona minima) and it is about 2.1 mm (5/64&quot;) long. The largest bee in the world is the [[Megachile pluto]], which can be as large as 39 mm (1.5&quot;).

== Eusocial and quasisocial bees ==
Bees may be solitary, or may live in various sorts of communities. The most advanced of these are [[eusocial]] colonies, found among the [[honeybee]]s and [[stingless bee]]s. Sociality is believed to have evolved separately in different groups of bees.

Eusocial bees live in colonies, each of which has a single [[Queen (bee)|queen]], together with [[worker bee|worker]]s and [[drone (bee)|drone]]s. When humans provide a home for a colony, the structure is called a [[Beehive (beekeeping)|hive]]. A hive can typically contain up to about 40,000 individual bees at their annual peak, which occurs in the spring, but usually have fewer.

Visiting flowers is a dangerous occupation, with very high mortality rates. Many [[assassin bug]]s and [[crab spider]]s hide in flowers to capture unwary bees. Others are lost to birds in flight. [[Insecticide]]s used on blooming plants can kill large numbers of bees, both by direct poisoning and by contaminating their food supply. A honeybee queen may lay 2000 eggs per day during spring buildup, but she also must lay 1000 to 1500 eggs per day during the foraging season, simply to replace daily casualties.

Regardless of such estimates, most of the modern historians count only the cavalry units. Apart from 16,000 cavalry, the Teutonic Order also fielded some 9,000 infantry, [[archer]]s and [[crossbow]] troops. Both armies also had large [[military camp]]s, [[Tabor (formation)|tabor]]s and other units, which made up some 10% of their total strength. 

Both armies were organised in ''[[banner]]s''. Each heavy cavalry banner was composed of approximately 240 mounted [[knight]]s as well as their squires and armour-bearers. Each banner flew its own standard and fought independently. Lithuanian banners were usually weaker and composed of approximately 180 light cavalry soldiers. The structure of foot units ([[pikemen]], [[archer]]s, [[crossbow]]men) and the artillery is unknown. 

The forces on both sides were composed of troops coming from a variety of countries and lands. Apart from units fielded by lands of [[Poland]], [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and the [[Teutonic Order]], there were also mercenaries from Western Europe (most notably [[Alsace]], [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], [[Germany|German Countries]], [[Moravia]], [[Bohemia]] and probably [[Moldavia]]. Historians of the [[Soviet Union]] attempted to overemphasize the Russian role in the battle. For example, they included some Lithuanian banners, such as [[Smolensk]], into the Russian list. They also phrased the desciption of the battle to make it appear that the support from Russian lands was decisive. In fact there was a joke that &quot;the battle with the [[fascism|fascist]] Teutons was won by joint Polish-Soviet forces&quot; (most of the territory of the Grand Duchy was part of the [[Soviet Union]] in [[20th century]]).

The overall commander of the joint Polish-Lithuanian forces was king [[Wladislaus II of Poland|Władysław Jagiełło]], with the Polish units subordinated to Marshal of the Crown [[Zbigniew of Brzezie]] and Lithuanian units under the immediate command of Grand Duke of Lithuania [[Vytautas the Great|Vytautas]].  Until recently it was believed that the Sword Bearer of the Crown [[Zyndram of Maszkowice]] was the commander in chief of the joint army, but this idea was based on a false translation of the description of the battle by [[Ioannes Longinus]]. The Teutonic Forces were commanded directly by the Grand Master of the Order [[Ulrich von Jungingen]].

== Course of the battle ==
The opposing forces formed their lines at dawn. At noon the forces of Grand Duke of Lithuania [[Vytautas the Great|Vytautas]] started an all-out assault on the left flank of the Teutonic forces, near the village of Tannenberg ([[Stębark]]). The Lithuanian cavalry was supported by a cavalry charge of several Polish banners on the right flank of the enemy forces. The enemy heavy cavalry counter-attacked on both flanks and fierce fighting occurred. After more than an hour, the [[Lithuanian]] light cavalry started to a planned retreat maneuver towards marshes and woods. This maneuver was oftenly used in the east of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] by Mongols so Vytautas who had experience in battles against Mongols used it in this battle.  Only three banners of [[Smolensk]] commanded by [[Semen Lingwen]], son of [[Algirdas]], brother of [[Jogaila|Jagiełło]] and a cousin of [[Vytautas the Great|Vytautas]], remained on the right flank after the retreat of [[Vytautas the Great|Vytautas]] and his troops. One of them was totally destroyed while the remaining two were backed up by the Polish cavalry held in reserve and broke through the enemy lines to the Polish positions. 

Heavy cavalry of the Order started a disorganised pursuit after the retreating Lithuanians and entered the marshes, where [[Vytautas the Great|Vytautas]] reorganized his forces to return to battle. At the same time heavy fighting continued on the left flank of the Polish forces. After several hours of massed battle, the Teutonic cavalry started to gain the upper hand. According to [[Ioannes Longinus]] the Grand Master [[Ulrich von Jungingen]] personally led a cavalry charge on the strongest Polish unit — the Banner of the Land of [[Kraków]]. The Polish ranks started to waver and the flag of the banner was lost. However, it was soon recaptured by the Polish knights and king [[Wladyslaw Jagiello|Władysław Jagiełło]] ordered most of his reserves to enter combat.  The arrival of fresh troops allowed the Poles to repel the enemy assault and the forces of [[Ulrich von Jungingen]] were weakened. At the same time his reserves were still busy pursuing the evading Lithuanian cavalry. When they finally returned to the battlefield, it was already too late for the Teutonic charge to succeed and the forces of the Order started the withdrawal. 

After several hours of fighting, [[Ulrich von Jungingen]] decided to join his embattled forces in the main line of engagement.  [[Vytautas the Great|Vytautas]], however, also returned to the battlefield with the reorganized forces of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and joined the fierce fighting.  The Teutonic forces were by then becoming outnumbered by the mass of Polish knights and the advancing Lithuanian infantry, which all of a sudden had come pouring on the battlefield from the surrounding forests. [[Ulrich von Jungingen]] personally led the assault with 16 banners of heavy cavalry, which until then held in reserve. Jagiełło, however, threw in all his remaining reserves, as well as several already tired units.  Putting up heavy resistance, the 16 banners of the Great Master were surrounded and began to suffer high losses, including the Grand Master himself, who was probably killed by Polish peasantry. Seeing the fall of their Grand Master, the rest of the Teutonic forces started to withdraw towards their camp.  Part of the routed units retreated to the forests where they were pursued by the Lithuanian and Polish cavalry, while the rest retreated to the camp near the village of [[Grunwald]], where they tried to organise the defence by using the [[tabor (military unit) | tabor]] tactics: the camp was surrounded by waggons tied up with chains, serving as a mobile fortification. However, the defences were soon broken and the camp was looted. According to the anonymous author of the ''Chronicle of the Conflict of Ladislaus King of Poland with the Teutons Anno Domini 1410'', there were more bodies in and around the camp than on the rest of the battlefield. The pursuit after the fleeing Teutonic cavalry lasted until the dusk. 

Despite the technological superiority of the Teutonic Knights, to the point of this being believed to be the first battle in this part of Europe in which field-artillery was deployed, the numbers and tactical superiority of the Polish Lithuanian alliance were to prove overwhelming. 

[[Jan Zizka|Jan Žižka of Trocnov]] lost his first eye in the battle fighting for the Lithuanians.

== After the Battle ==
[[Image:Battle of Grunwald (After the Battle).jpg|thumb|250 px|A painting by [[Alphonse Mucha]] detailing the carnage after the Battle of Grunwald]]
The defeat of the [[Teutonic Order]] was resounding. According to [[Andrzej Nadolski]] about 8,000 Teuton soldiers were killed in the battle, and an additional 14,000 taken captive. Most of the approximately 250 members of the Order were also killed, including much of the Teutonic leadership. Apart from [[Ulrich von Jungingen]] himself, the Polish and Lithuanian forces killed also the Grand Marshal [[Friedrich von Wallenrode]], Grand Komtur [[Kuno von Lichtenstein]] and [[Albrecht von Schwartzburg]], the Grand Treasurer [[Thomas von Merheim]]. Komtur of [[Brandenburg]], [[Markward von Salzbach]] and the mayor of [[Sambia]] Schaumburg were executed by order of [[Vytautas the Great|Vytautas]] after the battle. The only higher officials to escape from the battle were Grand Hospital Master and Komtur of [[Elblag|Elbing]] [[Werner von Tettinger]]. Such a slaughter of noble knights and personalities was quite unusual in Mediæval Europe. This was possible mostly due to the participation of the peasantry who joined latter stages of the battle, and took part in destruction of the surrounded Teutonic troops. Unlike the noblemen, the peasants did not receive any ransom for taking captives; they thus had less of an incentive to keep them alive. Among those taken captive were [[Kazimierz V|Kasimir V]], duke of Stettin ([[Szczecin]]) , and [[Konrad the White]], duke of Oels ([[Oleśnica]]). 

After the battle Polish and Lithuanian forces stayed on the battlefield for three days. All notable officials were interred in separate graves, while the body of [[Ulrich von Jungingen]] was covered with royal coat and transported to [[Malbork|Marienburg]]. The rest of the dead were gathered in several mass graves. There are different speculations as to why [[Jagiello]] decided to wait that long. After three days, the Polish-Lithuanian forces moved on to Marienburg and laid siege upon the castle, but the three days time was enough for the Teutons to organise the defence. After several weeks of siege, the Lithuanian Grand Duke withdrew from the war and it became clear that the siege would not be effective. The nobility from Lesser Poland also wanted to end the war before the harvest and the siege was lifted. 

In the battle, both Polish and Lithuanian forces took several thousand captives. Most of the mercenaries were released shortly after the battle on the condition that they will return to Kraków on [[September 29]], [[1410]]. After that move, the king held most of the Teutonic officials, while the rest returned to Prussia to beg the Teutonic Order officials for their liberation and ransom payment. This proved to be a major drain of the Teutonic budget as an average rate for a knight was quite high. For instance, one of the mercenaries named [[Holbracht von Loym]] had to pay ''sixty times the number of 150 Prague [[grosz]]es'', that is almost 300 [[kilogram]]s of pure silver, a value uncommon even in modern times. With his army defeated and the remnants of it composed mostly of ill-paid mercenaries, [[Heinrich von Plauen]] had little incentive to continue the fight, especially that most of the cities owned by the Teutons sworn their loyalty to the Polish king. Thus, after retaking [[Danzig]] from rebelious burghers, the peace negotiations were started. 

The Peace of Thorn ([[Peace of Toruń 1411|Peace of Toruń]]) was concluded as a result of the Battle of Grunwald, in which Poland annexed the ''Dobriner Land'' ( [[Dobrzyn Land|Dobrzyń Land]]) and Lithuania recovered  [[Samogitia]]. This is thought to be a diplomatic defeat for Poland and Lithuania as they pushed for attempts to dismantle the [[Teutonic Knights]] state altogether. However, while the Poles and Lithuanians were unable to translate their military victory to greater political gains, the indirect results of the battle were much worse for the Teutons. The massacre of Teutonic troops left them with few forces to defend their remaining territories. The Grand Masters from then on had to rely on mercenary troops, which proved too expensive for the Teutons' budget to sustain. Although [[Heinrich von Plauen]], the successor to [[Ulrich von Jungingen]], managed to save his state from complete breakdown, the opposition to his rule among the burghers, the knights and within the Order itself forced his ouster. 

Eventually, the Teutons' internal conflicts and constant tax increases led to the uprising of the [[Prussian Confederation]]. The power of the Teutonic Knights waned as a result of this revolt, and the order never recovered. This decline led to a series of conflicts that culminated in the [[Thirteen Years' War]], leading to the death of the ''victorious order''.

==Influences of the Battle of Grunwald on modern culture==
===Poland===
[[Image:Grunwald_2003.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Jagiełło]] in the reconstruction of the battle in [[2003]].]]

The battle of Grunwald is regarded as one of the most important battles in the Polish history. It is often depicted by an [[ideogram]] of two swords, which were supposedly given to king Jagiello before the battle by the Teutonic envoys to &quot;raise Polish desire for battle&quot;. 

[[Image:Order Krzyża Grunwaldu kl. I-awers.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Grunwald Cross Medal]], symbol of two swords is visible]]

In [[1914]], on the eve of [[World War I]], during the celebrations marking the 500-year anniversary of the battle a monument was erected in [[Kraków]]. The ceremony spawned demonstrations of outrage within Polish society against the aggressive politics of the [[German Empire]], including the forcible [[Germanization]] of [[Poles]] after the [[partitions of Poland]]. Polish poet [[Maria Konopnicka]] wrote the fiercely Polish-patriotic and anti-German poem [[Rota (The oath)|Rota]]. About the same time, [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]] wrote his book ''[[The Teutonic Knights (book)|The Teutonic Knights]]'' (Polish: ''Krzyżacy'') , one of his series of books designed to increase the patriotic spirit among the Poles. The book was eventually depicted in the film ''[[The Teutonic Knights (film)|The Teutonic Knights]]'' by [[Aleksander Ford]].
These days, a festival is held every year to commemorate this medieval battle. Thousands of [[medieval reenactment|medieval reenactors]], many of them in knight's armor, from all across Europe gather every year in July at the Grunwald fields to reconstruct the battle again. Great care is put to the historical details of the armour, weapons and the conduct of the battle.

[[Order Krzyża Grunwaldu]] (''The Grunwald Cross Medal'') was a Polish military award created in [[1943]] by commander of [[Gwardia Ludowa]] (in [[1944]] confirmed by [[Krajowa Rada Narodowa]]) and was given for heroism in [[World War II]].

In Poland there are [[sport team]]s named &quot;Grunwald&quot;' like [[Grunwald Poznań]]. Moreover, one of administrative districts of [[Poznań]] ([[Poznań-Grunwald]]) was named after this village.

===Belarus===
The victory in the Battle of Grunwald is widely respected and commemorated in Belarus. In 15th century the lands of modern-day [[Belarus]] made up [[media: Gdlbelarus1400.JPG|the core of the territory]] of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].  Many of cities from what is today Belarus sent their troops to the battle to fight on the Grand Duchy's side.

===Lithuania===
The victory at the Battle of Grunwald or ''Žalgirio mūšis'' in 1410 is synonymous to the peak of the political and military power of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The demise of the Teutonic order ended the period of German expansion and created preconditions for the political stability, economic growth and relative cultural prosperity  that lasted until the rise of [[Muscovy]] in the late XVI century. In the Lithuanian historical discourse regarding the battle there is a lasting debate and controversy over the role played by the Lithuanian-born king of Poland [[Jogaila]], and his cousin, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, [[Vytautas the Great|Vytautas]], the latter usually being favoured as a national hero. 

Leading Lithuanian [[basketball]] and [[football (soccer)|football]] teams are both called &quot;Žalgiris&quot; to commemorate the victorious battle [[BC Žalgiris]] and [[FK Žalgiris]]. 

The term ''Žalgiris'' became a symbol of the resistence to the foreign domination over Lithuania. The victories of the basketball club [[BC Žalgiris]] Kaunas against the Soviet Army sports club CSKA Moscow (in the late [[1980s]]) served as a major emotional inspiration for the Lithuanian national revival, and the consequent emergence of [[Sąjūdis]] movement that led to the collapse of [[USSR]].

===Germany===
In Germany the battle was known as the Battle of Tannenberg. In [[1914]] yet another [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]] took place between Germany and Russia, ending with a Russian defeat. In German propaganda during the WWI / WWII period the 1914 battle was put forth as a revenge for the Polish - Lithuanian victory 504 years earlier, and the battle itself was purposefuly named to suit this agenda.

===Russia and Soviet Union===
Due to participation of [[Smolensk]] squad in the battle, Soviet propaganda depicted  the battle as [[Poland|Polish]]-[[Lithuania|Lithuanian]]-[[Russia|Russian]] coalition against evil [[German people|Germans]].


== Banners ==
=== Poland ===
The exact [[Order of Battle]] of the Polish forces is unknown. However, [[Ioannes Longinus]] in his ''Historiæ Polonicæ'' written after [[1455]] recorded 51 Polish [[Choragiew|banners]], together with their descriptions, blazoning and commanders. It is not certain whether the list is complete.

=== Lithuania ===
Due to different system of [[feudal]] overlordship, as well as lack of heraldic traditions, the units of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] were all grouped under banners of two types: the [[Vytis]] and the [[Columns of Gediminas]]. The only difference between various lands using the same emblem was the [[blazon]]. The hareness and the colour of the horse on the [[Pahonia]] differed. 

Note that the number of Lithuanian banners is uncertain. According to [[Ioannes Longinus]] there were 40 banners on the right flank of the Polish-Lithuanian forces, 10 flying the [[Columns of Gediminas]] and 30 flying the [[Vytis]]. However, he also mentions that there might have been 2 additional banners from [[Smolensk]] and up to six additional banners of [[Samogitia]]. German authors also mention that there were three auxiliary banners of [[Moldavia]] flying their own flags. In addition, it is probable that the units of [[Trakai]], [[Volhynia]], [[Smolensk]], [[Kiev]] and [[Nowogrodek]] used their own emblems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT)''' is a [[decision problem]] considered in [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]].  An instance of the problem is a Boolean expression written using only AND, OR, NOT, variables, and parentheses.  The question is: given the expression, is there some assignment of ''TRUE'' and ''FALSE'' values to the variables that will make the entire expression true?

In [[mathematics]], a formula of [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]] is said to be '''satisfiable''' if [[truth-value]]s can be assigned to its [[variable]]s in a way that makes the formula true. The class of satisfiable propositional formulas is [[NP-complete]]. The propositional satisfiability problem (SAT), which decides whether a given propositional formula is satisfiable, is of central importance in various areas of [[computer science]], including [[theoretical computer science]], [[algorithmics]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[hardware design]] and [[hardware verification|verification]].

The problem can be significantly restricted while still remaining NP-complete. By applying [[De Morgan's laws]], we can assume that NOT operators are only applied directly to variables, not expressions; we refer to either a variable or its negation as a ''literal''. For example, both ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and not(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are literals, the first a ''positive'' literal and the second a ''negative'' literal. If we OR together a group of literals, we get a ''clause'', such as (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''or'' not(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)). Finally, let us consider formulas that are a conjunction (AND) of clauses. We call this form [[conjunctive normal form]]. Determining whether a formula in this form is satisfiable is still NP-complete, even if each clause is limited to at most three literals. This last problem is called 3CNFSAT, 3SAT, or 3-satisfiability.

On the other hand, if we restrict each clause to at most two literals, the resulting problem, 2SAT, is in [[P_(complexity)|P]]. The same holds if every clause is a [[Horn clause]]; that is, it contains at most one positive literal.

A highly technical [[proof that Boolean satisfiability problem is NP-complete]] is available.

== Complexity ==
SAT is [[NP-complete]].  In fact, it was the first known '''NP'''-complete problem, as proved by [[Stephen Cook]] in 1971 (see [[Cook's theorem]] for the proof).  Until that time, it was not known that NP-complete problems even existed. The problem remains '''NP'''-complete even if all expressions are written in ''[[conjunctive normal form]]'' with 3 variables per clause (3-CNF), yielding the '''3SAT''' problem.  This means the expression has the form: 
:(''x''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; OR ''x''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; OR ''x''&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;) AND
:(''x''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; OR ''x''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; OR ''x''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;) AND
:(''x''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt; OR ''x''&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt; OR ''x''&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;) AND ...
where each ''x'' is a variable or a negation of a variable, and each variable can appear multiple times in the expression.

A useful property of Cook's reduction is that it preserves the number of accepting answers. For example, if a graph has 17 valid 3-colorings, the SAT formula produced by the reduction will have 17 satisfying assignments.

== Restrictions of SAT ==
SAT is easier if the formulas are restricted to those in [[disjunctive normal form]], that is, they are disjunction (OR) of terms, where each term is a conjunction (AND) of literals (possibly negated variables). Such a formula is indeed satisfiable if and only if some of its terms are satisfiable, and a term is satisfiable iff it does not contain both ''x'' and NOT ''x'' for some variable ''x''. This can be checked in polynomial time.

SAT is also easier if the number of literals in a clause is limited to 2, in which case the problem is called 2SAT. This problem can also be solved in polynomial time, and in fact is complete for the class [[NL (complexity)|NL]]. Similarly, if we limit the number of literals per clause to 2 and change the AND operations to [[XOR]] operations, the result is ''exclusive-or 2-satisfiability'', a problem complete for [[SL (complexity)|SL]] = [[L (complexity)|L]].

One of the most important restrictions of SAT is HORNSAT, where the formula is a conjunction of [[Horn clause]]s. This problem is solved by the polynomial-time [[Horn-satisfiability]] algorithm, and is in fact [[P-complete]]. It can be seen as [[P (complexity)|P]]'s version of the boolean satisfiability problem.

Provided that the [[complexity classes P and NP]] are not equal, none of these restrictions are NP-complete, unlike SAT. The assumption that P and NP are not equal is not currently proved.

=== 3-satisfiability ===
3-satisfiability is a special case of ''k''-satisfiability (''k''-SAT) or simply satisfiability (SAT), when each clause contains at most ''k'' = 3 literals. It was one of [[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems]].

Here is an example, where ~ indicates NOT:
: E = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or ~''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or ~''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)
E has two clauses (denoted by parentheses), four literals (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and ''k''=3 (three literals per clause).

To solve this instance of the decision problem we must determine whether there is a truth value (TRUE or FALSE) we can assign to each of the literals (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; through ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) such that the entire expression is TRUE.  In this instance, there is such an assignment (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = TRUE, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = TRUE, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=TRUE, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;=TRUE), so the answer to this instance is YES.  This is one of many possible assignments, with for instance, any set of assignments including ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = TRUE being sufficient.  If there were no such assignment(s), the answer would be NO.

Since k-SAT (the general case) reduces to 3-SAT, and 3-SAT [http://cs482.elliottback.com/archives/2005/03/16/lecture-23-3-sat/ can be proven] to be [[NP-complete]], it can be used to prove that other problems are also NP-complete. This is done by showing how a solution to another problem could be used to solve 3-SAT. An example of a problem where this method has been used is &quot;[[Clique problem|Clique]]&quot;. It's often easier to use reductions from 3-SAT than SAT to problems which researchers are attempting to prove NP-complete.

== Extensions of SAT ==
The satisfiability problem seems to become more difficult if we allow ''[[quantifier]]s'' such as &quot;for all&quot; and &quot;there exists&quot; that bind the boolean variables. An example of such an expression would be:
: &lt;math&gt;\forall x, \exists y,\exists z; (x \lor y \lor z) \land (\lnot x \lor \lnot y \lor \lnot z)&lt;/math&gt;
If we use only &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt; quantifiers, this is still the SAT problem. If we allow only &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; quantifiers, it becomes the [[Co-NP-complete]] [[TAUTOLOGY problem]]. If we allow both, the problem is called the [[quantified boolean formula problem]] (QBF), which can be shown to be [[PSPACE-complete]]. It is widely believed that PSPACE-complete problems are strictly harder than any problem in NP, although this has not yet been proved.

A number of variants deal with the number of variable assignments making the formula true. Ordinary SAT asks if there is at least one such assignment. MAJSAT, which asks if the majority of all assignments make the formula true, is complete for [[PP (complexity)|PP]], a probabilistic class. The problem of how many variable assignments satisfy a formula, not a decision problem, is in [[Sharp-P|#P]]. UNIQUE-SAT or USAT is the problem of determining whether a formula known to have either zero or one satisfying assignments has zero or has one. Although this problem seems easier, it has been shown that if there is a practical ([[BPP|randomized polynomial-time]]) algorithm to solve this problem, then all problems in [[NP (complexity class)|NP]] can be solved just as easily.

The [[maximum satisfiability problem]], an [[FNP (complexity)|FNP]] generalization of SAT, asks for the maximum number of clauses which can be satisfied by any assignment. It has efficient [[approximation algorithm]]s, but is NP-hard to solve exactly. Worse still, it is [[APX]]-complete, meaning there is no [[polynomial-time approximation scheme]] (PTAS) for this problem unless P=NP.

== Algorithms for solving SAT ==
There are two classes of high-performance [[algorithms]] for solving instances of SAT in practice: modern variants of the [[DPLL algorithm]], such as [[Chaff algorithm|Chaff]], and [[stochastic local search algorithm]]s,
such as [[WalkSAT]]. [[Genetic algorithm]]s are increasingly being used to solve SAT problems, especially when there is no or limited knowledge of the problem domain. Large random instances of SAT can be solved by [[Survey Propagation]] (SP). Particularly in [[hardware design]] and [[hardware verification|verification]] applications, satisfiability and other logical properties of a given propositional formula are often decided based on a representation of the formula as a [[binary decision diagram]] (BDD).

Propositional satisfiability has various generalisations, including satisfiability for [[quantified boolean formula problem]], for [[first-order predicate calculus|first]]- and [[second-order logic]], [[constraint satisfaction problem]]s, [[0-1 integer programming]], and [[maximum satisfiability problem]].

Many other decision problems, such as [[graph colouring problem]]s, [[planning problem]]s, and [[scheduling problem]]s can be rather easily encoded into SAT.

'''Bohemians''' are inhabitants of [[Bohemia]], [[Czech Republic]]. The term used to designate inhabitants of the former [[monarchy|kingdom]] of Bohemia, located in the west of the modern day [[Czech Republic]]. The name derived from the [[Latin]] term for the [[Celt]]ic tribe ([[Boii]]) inhabiting that area (Tacitus: Boiohaemum). The word &quot;Bohemfeated attacks by [[Confederate army|Confederate]] General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]], ending Lee's second and final invasion of the [[Northern United States | North]].

==Background and movement to battle==

Shortly after Lee's army won a decisive victory over the Army of the Potomac at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] ([[May 1]]&amp;ndash;[[May 3|3]], [[1863]]), Lee decided upon a second invasion of the North. Such a move would upset [[United States|Federal]] plans for the summer campaigning season and possibly relieve the besieged Confederate garrison at [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], and it would allow the Confederates to live off the bounty of the rich Northern farms while giving war-ravaged [[Virginia]] a much needed rest. Also Lee's 75,000-man army could threaten [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and give voice to the growing peace movement in the North.

Thus, on [[June 3]] Lee's army began to shift northward from [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]]. In order to attain more efficiency in his commands, Lee had reorganized his two large corps into three new corps. [[James Longstreet]] retained command of his First Corps. However, the old corps of Lieutenant General [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson]] was divided into two, with the Second Corps going to Lt. Gen. [[Richard S. Ewell]] and the new Third Corps commanded by Lt. Gen. [[A.P. Hill]]. The [[Gettysburg Confederate Order of Battle]] lists the units and commanders of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]].

The Federal Army of the Potomac, under Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]], consisted of seven infantry corps, a cavalry corps, and an Artillery Reserve, for a combined strength of more than 90,000 men. However, [[Abraham Lincoln]] would soon replace Hooker with Maj. Gen. [[George G. Meade]], due to Hooker's defeat at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] and his timid response to Lee's second invasion north of the Potomac. The [[Gettysburg Union Order of Battle]] lists the units and commanders of the Army of the Potomac after Meade assumed command.

The first major action of the campaign took place on [[June 9]] between the opposing cavalry forces at [[Brandy Station]], near [[Culpeper, Virginia]]. The Confederate cavalry under [[J.E.B. Stuart]] was nearly bested by the Federal horsemen, but Stuart eventually prevailed. However, this battle, the largest cavalry engagement of the war, proved that for the first time, the Union horse soldier was equal to his Southern counterpart. 

By mid-June, the Army of Northern Virginia was poised to cross the [[Potomac River]] and enter [[Maryland]]. After defeating the Federal garrisons at [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]] and [[Martinsburg, West Virginia|Martinsburg]], Ewell's Second Corps began crossing the river on [[June 15]]. Hill's and Longstreet's corps followed on [[June 24]]&amp;ndash;[[June 25|25]]. Hooker's army pursued, keeping between the U.S. Capital and Lee's army. The Federals crossed the Potomac on [[June 25]]&amp;ndash;[[June 27|27]].

Meanwhile, in a controversial move, Lee allowed J.E.B. Stuart to take a portion of the army's cavalry and ride around the [[Union Army|Union army]]. However, Lee's orders gave Stuart much latitude, and both generals are to blame for the long absence of Stuart's cavalry, as well as for the failure to assign a more active role to the cavalry left with the army. Stuart and his three best brigades were absent from the army during the crucial phase of the approach to Gettysburg and the first two days of battle. By [[June 29]], Lee's army was strung out in an arc from [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania]], 28 miles (45 km) northwest of [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]], to [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]], 30 miles (48 km) north of Gettysburg, to near [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] and [[Wrightsville, Pennsylvania|Wrightsville]] on the [[Susquehanna River]].

In a dispute over the use of the forces defending the [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]] garrison, Hooker offered his resignation, and [[Abraham Lincoln]] and General-in-Chief [[Henry W. Halleck]], who were looking for an excuse to get rid of Hooker, immediately accepted the resignation. They replaced him on [[June 27]]&amp;ndash;[[June 28|28]] with Maj. Gen. [[George Meade | George Gordon Meade]], commander of the [[V Corps (ACW)|V Corps]].

When, on [[June 29]], Lee learned that the Army of the Potomac had crossed its namesake river, he ordered a concentration of his forces around [[Cashtown-McKnightstown, Pennsylvania | Cashtown]], located at the eastern base of South Mountain and eight miles (13 km) west of Gettysburg.

On [[June 30]], while part of Hill's Corps was in Cashtown, one of Hill's brigades, North Carolinians under [[J. Johnston Pettigrew]], ventured toward Gettysburg. The memoirs of Maj. Gen. [[Henry Heth]], Pettigrew's division commander, claimed that Pettigrew was in search of a large supply of shoes in town, but this explanation has been largely discounted by historians.

When Pettigrew's troops approached Gettysburg on [[June 30]], they noticed Federal cavalry under Brig. Gen. [[John Buford]] west of town, and Pettigrew returned to Cashtown without engaging them. When Pettigrew told Hill and Henry Heth about what he had seen, neither general believed that there was a substantial Federal force in or near the town, suspecting that it had been only Pennsylvania militia. Despite General Lee's order to avoid a general engagement until his entire army was concentrated, Hill decided to mount a significant [[reconnaissance | reconnaissance in force]] the following morning to determine the size and strength of the enemy force in his front. Around 5 a.m. on Wednesday, [[July 1]], Heth's division advanced to Gettysburg.

The terrain of Gettysburg and vicinity is described in [[Gettysburg Battlefield]].
                                                                                                                                                                                   
==First day of battle==

General Buford realized the  importance of the high ground directly to the south of Gettysburg, knowing that if the Confederates could gain control of the heights, Meade's army would have a hard time dislodging them.  He decided to utilize three ridges west of Gettysburg: Herr Ridge, McPherson Ridge, and Seminary Ridge (proceeding west to east toward the town). These were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by his small division against superior Confederate forces, meant to buy time awaiting the arrival of infantrymen who could occupy the superior defensive positions south of town, [[Cemetery Hill]], [[Cemetery Ridge]], and [[Culp's Hill]].

Heth's division advanced with two brigades forward, commanded by Brig. Gens. [[James Archer]] and [[Joseph R. Davis]]. They proceeded easterly in columns along the Chambersburg Pike. Three miles (5 km) west of town, about 7:30 a.m. on July 1, Heth's two brigades met light resistance from cavalry [[vedette]]s and deployed into line. Eventually, they reached dismounted troopers from Col. [[William Gamble (USA)|William Gamble]]'s cavalry brigade, who mounted determined resistance and delaying tactics from behind fence posts with rapid fire from their Sharps carbines. By 10:20 a.m., the Confederates had pushed the Union cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge, when the vanguard of the [[I Corps (ACW)|I Corps]] (Maj. Gen. [[John F. Reynolds]]) finally arrived. 

North of the Pike, Davis gained a temporary success against Brig. Gen. [[Lysander Cutler]]'s brigade, but was repulsed with heavy losses in an action around an unfinished railroad bed cut in the ridge. South of the Pike, Archer's brigade assaulted through Herbst (also know as McPherson's) Woods. The Federal [[Iron Brigade]] under Brig. Gen. [[Solomon Meredith]] enjoyed initial success against Archer, capturing several hundred men, including Archer himself.

Early in the fighting, while General Reynolds was directing troop and artillery placements just to the east of the woods, he fell from his horse, killed instantly by a bullet striking him behind the left ear. Maj. Gen. [[Abner Doubleday]] assumed command. Fighting in the Chambersburg Pike area lasted until about 12:30 p.m. It resumed around 2:30 p.m., when Heth's entire division engaged, adding the brigades of Pettigrew and Col. [[John M. Brockenbrough]].

As Pettigrew's North Carolina Brigade came on line they flanked the 19th Indiana and drove the Iron Brigade back. The 26th North Carolina (the largest regiment in the army with nearly 900 men) lost heavily, leaving the first day's fight with around 212 men. By the end of the three-day battle, they would have about 60 men standing, the highest casualty percentage for one battle of any other regiment, north or south. Slowly the Iron Brigade was pushed out of the woods toward Seminary Ridge. Hill added [[William Dorsey Pender]]'s division to the assault and the I Corps was driven back through the grounds of the Lutheran Seminary and Gettysburg streets.

As the fighting to the west proceeded, two divisions of Ewell's Second Corps, marching west toward Cashtown in accordance with Lee's order for the army to concentrate in that vicinity, turned south on the Carlisle and Harrisburg Roads toward Gettysburg, while the Union [[XI Corps (ACW)|XI Corps]] (Maj. Gen. [[Oliver O. Howard]]) raced north on the Baltimore Pike and Taneytown Road. By early afternoon, the Federal line ran in a semi-circle west, north, and northeast of Gettysburg.

However, the Federals did not have enough troops; Cutler, who was deployed north of the Chambersburg Pike, had his right flank in the air. The leftmost division of the XI Corps was unable to deploy in time to strengthen the line, so Doubleday was forced to throw in reserve brigades to salvage his line. 

Around 2:00 p.m., [[Robert E. Rodes]]'s and [[Jubal Anderson Early|Jubal Early]]'s Second Corps divisions smashed and out-flanked the Federal I and XI Corps positions north and northwest of town. The brigades of [[Edward A. O'Neal]] and [[Alfred Iverson]] suffered severe losses assaulting the I Corps division of Brig. Gen. [[John C. Robinson]] south of Oak Hill. Early's division profited from a blunder made by Brig. Gen. [[Francis C. Barlow]], when he advanced his XI Corps division to Blocher's Knoll (directly north of town and now known as Barlow's Knoll); this represented a salient in the corps line, susceptible to attack from multiple sides, and Early's troops overran his division, which constituted the right flank of the Union Army's position. Barlow was wounded and captured in the attack.

As Federal positions collapsed both north and west of town, Gen. Howard ordered a retreat to the high ground south of town, [[Cemetery Hill]], where he had left the division of [[Adolph von Steinwehr]] as a reserve.

Gen. Lee understood the defensive potential to the Union if they held this high ground. He sent orders to Ewell that Cemetery Hill be taken &quot;if practicable.&quot; Ewell chose not to attempt the assault, considered by historians to be a great missed opportunity.

The battle of [[July 1]] had pitted over 25,000 Confederates against 18,000 Federals, and ranks in itself as the twenty-third largest battle of the war.

===Plans and movement to battle===
Throughout the evening of July 1 and morning of [[July 2]], most of the remaining infantry of both armies arrived on the field, including the Union [[II Corps (ACW)|II]], [[III Corps (ACW)|III]], [[V Corps (ACW)|V]], [[VI Corps (ACW)|VI]], and [[XII Corps (ACW)|XII Corps]]. Longstreet's third division, commanded by [[George Pickett]], had begun the march from [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania|Chambersburg]] early in the morning; it would not arrive until late on July 2.

The Union line ran from [[Culp's Hill]] southeast of the town, northwest to Cemetery Hill just south of town, then south for nearly two miles (3 km) along Cemetery Ridge, terminating just north of [[Little Round Top]]. Most of the XII Corps was on Culp's Hill, the remnants of I and XI Corps defended Cemetery Hill, II Corps covered most of the northern half of Cemetery Ridge, and III Corps was ordered to take up a position to its flank. This shape of the Union line is popularly described as a &quot;fishhook&quot; formation. The Confederate line paralleled the Union line about a mile (1600 m) to the west on [[Seminary Ridge]], ran east through the town, then curved southeast to a point opposite Culp's Hill. Thus, the Federal army had interior lines, while the Confederate's exterior line was nearly five miles (8 km) in length.

Lee's battle plan for July 2 called for Longstreet's First Corps to position itself stealthily to attack the Union left flank, facing northeast astraddle the Emmitsburg Road, and to roll up the Federal line. The attack sequence was to begin with [[John Bell Hood]]'s and [[Lafayette McLaws]]'s divisions, followed by [[Richard H. Anderson]]'s division of Hill's Third Corps. The progressive ''en echelon'' sequence of this attack would prevent Meade from shifting troops from his center to bolster his left. At the same time, [[Edward Johnson (general) | Edward &quot;Allegheny&quot; Johnson's]] and Jubal Early's Second Corps divisions were to make a &quot;demonstration&quot; against Culp's and Cemetery Hills (again, to prevent the shifting of Federal troops), and to turn the demonstration into a full-scale attack if a favorable opportunity presented itself. 

Lee's plan, however, was based on faulty intelligence, exacerbated by Stuart's continued absence from the battlefield. Instead of moving beyond the Federals' left and attacking their flank, Longstreet's left division, under McLaws, would face Maj. Gen. [[Daniel Sickles]]'s III Corps directly in their path. Sickles, dissatisfied with the position assigned him on the southern end of Cemetery Ridge, and seeing higher ground more favorable to artillery positions a half mile (800 m) to the west, had advanced his corps&amp;mdash;without orders&amp;mdash;to the slightly higher ground along the Emmitsburg Road. The new line ran from Devil's Den, northwest to the Sherfy farm's Peach Orchard, then northeast along the Emmitsburg Road to south of the Codori farm. This created an untenable salient at the Peach Orchard; Brig. Gen. [[Andrew A. Humphreys]]'s division (in position along the Emmitsburg Road) and Maj. Gen. [[David B. Birney]]'s division (to the south) were subject to attacks from two sides and were spread out over a longer front than their small corps could defend effectively.

Longstreet's attack was to be made as early as practicable; however, Longstreet got permission from Lee to await the arrival of one of his brigades, and, while marching to the assigned position, his men came within sight of a Union signal station on Little Round Top. Countermarching to avoid detection wasted much time, and Hood's and McLaws's divisions did not launch their attacks until just after 4 p.m. and 5 p.m., respectively.

===Attacks on the Union left flank===
As Longstreet's divisions slammed into the Union III Corps, Meade had to send reinforcements in the form of the entire V Corps, Caldwell's division of the II Corps, most of the XII Corps, and small portions of the newly arrived VI Corps. Hard fighting took place in [[Devil's Den]], the [[Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day#Wheatfield | Wheatfield]], [[Little Round Top]], and the [[Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day#Peach Orchard | Peach Orchard]]. The III Corps was virtually destroyed as a combat unit in this battle and Sickles's leg was amputated after it was shattered by a cannonball. Caldwell's division was devoured piecemeal in the Wheatfield. Anderson's division assault starting around 6 p.m. reached the crest of Cemetery Ridge, but they could not hold the position in the face of counterattacks from the II Corps.

Meanwhile, Colonel [[Strong Vincent]] of V Corps was holding, with his small brigade, an important hill in the Union position: [[Little Round Top]]. He was able to hold off repeated assaults by a Confederate brigade of Hood's division with his five relatively small regiments. Meade's chief engineer, Brig. Gen. [[Gouverneur K. Warren]], had realized the importance of this position, and dispatched Vincent's brigade, Hazlett's artillery battery, and the 140th New York to occupy Little Round Top mere minutes before Hood's troops arrived. The defense of Little Round Top with a bayonet charge by the [[20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] was one of the most fabled episodes in the Civil War.
{{seesubarticle|Little Round Top}}

===Attacks on the Union right flank===
About 7:00 p.m., the Second Corps' attack by Johnson's division on Culp's Hill got off to a late start. Most of the hill's defenders, the Union XII Corps, had been sent to the left to defend against Longstreet's attacks, and the only portion of the corps remaining on the hill was a brigade of New Yorkers under Brig. Gen. [[George S. Greene]]. Due to Greene's insistence on constructing strong defensive works, and with reinforcements from the I and XI Corps, Greene's men held off the Confederate attackers, although the Southerners did capture a portion of the abandoned Federal works on the lower part of Culp's Hill.
{{seesubarticle|Culp's Hill}}

Just at dark, two of Jubal Early's brigades attacked the Union XI Corps positions on East Cemetery Hill where Col. [[Andrew L. Harris]] of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, came under a withering attack, losing half his men; however, Early failed to support his brigades in their attack on the Union defenders, and Ewell's remaining division, that of Maj. Gen. [[Robert E. Rodes]], failed to aid Early's attack by moving against Cemetery Hill from the west. The Union army's interior lines enabled its commanders to shift troops quickly to critical areas, and with reinforcements from II Corps, the Federal troops retained possession of East Cemetery Hill, and Early's brigades were forced to withdraw.
{{seesubarticle|Cemetery Hill}}

J.E.B. Stuart and his four cavalry brigades arrived in Gettysburg late in the afternoon, but had no role in the second day's battle. [[Wade Hampton]]'s brigade fought a minor engagement with [[George Armstrong Custer]]'s [[Michigan]] cavalry near [[Battle of Hunterstown | Hunterstown]] to the northeast of Gettysburg.

== Third day of battle ==
[[Image:Gettysburg_Battle_Map_Day3.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Map of Battle, July 3rd.]]

General Lee wished to renew the attack on Friday, [[July 3]], using the same basic plan as the previous day: Longstreet would attack the Federal left, while Ewell attacked Culp's Hill. However, before Longstreet was ready, Federal XII Corps troops started a dawn artillery bombardment against the Confederates on Culp's Hill in an effort to regain a portion of their lost works. The Confederates attacked and the second fight for Culp's Hill ended around 11 a.m., after some seven hours of bitter combat.
{{seesubarticle|Culp's Hill}}

Lee was forced to change his plans. Now Longstreet would command Pickett's Virginia division of his own First Corps, plus six brigades from Hill's Corps, in an attack on the Federal II Corps position at the right center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge. Prior to the attack, all the artillery the Confederacy could bring to bear on the Federal positions would bombard and weaken the enemy's line. 

[[Image:3698.jpg|thumb|left|The &quot;High Water Mark&quot; on Cemetery Ridge as it appears today. The monument to the 72nd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment (&quot;Baxter's Philadelphia Fire Zouaves&quot;) appears at right, the Copse of Trees to the left.]]
Around 1:00 p.m., 170 Confederate cannons began an artillery bombardment was probably the largest of the war. In order to save valuable ammunition for the infantry attack that they knew must follow, the Army of the Potomac's artillery at first did not return the enemy's fire. After waiting about 15 minutes, 80 or so Federal cannon added to the din. The Army of Northern Virginia was critically low on artillery ammunition, and the cannonade did not significantly affect the Union position. Around 3:00 p.m, the cannon fire subsided, and 12,500 Southern soldiers stepped from the ridgeline and advanced the three-quarters of a mile (1200 m) to Cemetery Ridge in what is known to history as &quot;[[Pickett's Charge]]&quot;. Due to fierce flanking artillery fire from Union positions on Cemetery Hill and north of Little Round Top, and musket and canister fire from the II Corps as the Confederates approached, nearly one half of the attackers would not return to their own lines. Although the Federal line wavered and broke temporarily at a jog in a low stone fence called the &quot;Angle&quot;, just north of a patch of vegetation called the Copse of Trees, reinforcements rushed into the breach and the Confederate attack was repulsed.
{{seesubarticle|Pickett's Charge}}

There were two significant cavalry engagements on July 3. Stuart was sent to guard the Confederate left flank and was to be prepared to exploit any success the infantry might achieve on Cemetery Hill by flanking the Federal right and hitting their trains and lines of communications. Three miles (5 km) east of Gettysburg, in what is now called &quot;East Cavalry Field&quot; (not shown on the accompanying map, but between the York and Hanover Roads), Stuart's forces collided with Federal cavalry: Brig. Gen. [[David McM. Gregg]]'s division and [[George A. Custer]]'s brigade. A lengthy mounted battle, including hand-to-hand sabre combat, ensued. Custer's charge, leading the 1st Michigan Cavalry, blunted the attack by [[Wade Hampton]]'s brigade, blocking Stuart from achieving his objectives in the Federal rear. After Pickett's Charge, Meade ordered Brig. Gen. [[Judson Kilpatrick]] to launch a cavalry attack against the infantry positions of Longstreet's Corps southwest of Big Round Top. Brig. Gen. [[Elon J. Farnsworth]] protested against the futility of such a move, but obeyed orders; Farnsworth was killed in the attack and his brigade suffered significant losses.
{{seesubarticle|Battle of Gettysburg, Third Day cavalry battles}}

== Aftermath ==
The armies stared at one another across the bloody fields on [[July 4]], the same day that the [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] garrison surrendered to Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Lee reformed his lines into a defensive position, hoping that Meade would attack. The cautious Union commander, however, decided against the risk, a decision for which he would later be criticized.

On [[July 5]], in a driving rain, the Army of Northern Virginia left Gettysburg on the Hagerstown Road; the Battle of Gettysburg was over, and the Confederates headed back to Virginia. Meade's Army of the Potomac followed, though the pursuit was half-spirited at best. The recently rain-swollen Potomac trapped Lee's army on the north bank of the river, but by the time the Federals caught up, the Confederates were ready to cross back to Virginia. The rear-guard action at Falling Waters on [[July 14]] ended the Gettysburg Campaign and added some more names to the long casualty lists, including General Pettigrew, mortally wounded.

Throughout the campaign, General Lee seemed to have entertained the belief that his men were s, notably [[Germany]].  The UK was allied with France (by the [[Entente Cordiale]]) and Russia, and when war broke out in [[1914]], the British Army sent the [[British Expeditionary Force]] to France and Belgium to prevent Germany from occupying these countries. The War would be the most devastating in British military history, with over 900,000 men killed and over 2 million wounded. In the early part of the war, the professional force of the BEF was decimated and, by turns, a volunteer (and then conscripted) force replaced it. Major battles included the [[Battle of the Somme]]. Advances in technology saw the advent of the [[tank]] and [[aircraft]] which were to be decisive in future battles. Trench warfare dominated strategy, and the use of chemical and poison gases added to the devastation.

In 1939, [[World War II]] broke out with the German invasion of [[Poland]]. British assurances to the Polish led the British Empire to declare war on Germany, allied with France. Again an Expeditionary Force was sent to France, only to be hastily evacuated as the German forces swept through the Low Countries and across France in [[1940]]. Only the [[Battle of Dunkirk|Dunkirk evacuations]] saved the entire Expeditionary Force from capture. Later, however, the British would have success defeating the Italians and Germans at the [[First Battle of El Alamein|Battle of El Alamein]] in [[North Africa]], and in the [[Battle of Normandy|D-Day invasions of Normandy]]. In the Far East, the British Army battled the [[Japan|Japanese]] in [[Burma]]. World War II saw the British army develop its Commando units including the Special Air Services.

===1945-1990===
After the end of World War II, the British Empire declined with the independence of [[India]], and other colonies in Africa and Asia. Accordingly the strength of the British military was reduced, in recognition of Britain's reduced role in world affairs. However, a large deployment of [[BAOR|British troops]] remained in Germany, facing the threat of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] invasion. The [[Cold War]] saw massive technological advances in warfare, and the Army saw more technological advanced weapons systems installed.

Despite the decline of the British Empire, the Army was still deployed around the world, fighting in the [[Korean War]], the [[Suez crisis]] of [[1956]], and colonial wars in Oman and Malaysia. In [[1982]] the British Army, alongside the [[Royal Marines]], helped to recapture the [[Falkland Islands]] during the [[Falklands War]] against [[Argentina]]. 

In the three decades following 1969, the Army was heavily deployed in [[Northern Ireland]], to support the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (later the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]]) in their conflict with loyalist and republican paramilitary groups. The locally-recruited [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] was formed, later becoming the [[Royal Irish Regiment]] in 1992. Over 700 soldiers were killed during the [[Troubles]].  Following the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] ceasefires between 1994 and 1996 and since 1997, demilitarisation has taken place as part of the peace process, much reducing the military presence in the area.

===1990-present===
[[Image:British gulf war.jpg|thumb|200px|British soldiers training during the Gulf War]]
The ending of the [[Cold War]] saw a 40% cut in manpower, significantly reducing the size of the Army. Despite this, the Army has been deployed in an increasingly global role. In [[1991]], the United Kingdom was the second largest contributor to the coalition force that fought [[Iraq]] in the [[Gulf War]]. Later the Army would see service in the former [[Republic of Yugoslavia]] in the [[Bosnian War]] and the [[Kosovo War]]. In [[2003]], the United Kingdom was the only other major contributor to the United States led [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]].

The Army has also been deployed in many [[peacekeeping|peacekeeping operations]], such as in [[Sierra Leone]] and in the [[war against terrorism]]. Some peacekeeping operations are under [[United Nations]] mandates. The [[Special Air Service|SAS]] unit of the British Army is specifically trained for anti-terror operations, and fought in [[Afghanistan]] in [[2001]]. A squadron of SAS troops is always present on the UK mainland to respond to terrorist attacks. 

There has been a reduction in the number of troops deployed in [[Northern Ireland]] since the [[Good Friday Agreement]] was signed in [[1998]]. In 2005, after the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] announced an end to armed conflict in Northern Ireland, it was revealed that the British Army would dismantle posts in the province and withdraw many troops.

==Formation and structure==
'' See main article:  [[Structure of the British Army]]''

The structure of the British Army is complex, due to the
different [[British Army|origins]] of its various constituent parts.  
In terms of the nature of its servicemen, it is divided into the '''Regular Army''' (full-time professional soldiers) and the '''[[Territorial Army]]''' (part-time paid soldiers). In terms of its military structure it is divided into [[corps]] (administrative groupings by common function), and [[division (military)|divisions]] and [[brigade]]s (large [[formation]]s, somewhat fluid in nature).

The [[regiment]] is in some respects the most important unit of the British
Army. It is the largest &quot;permanent&quot; tactical unit in most corps, although it is only an administrative and ceremonial grouping of [[battalion]]s in the [[infantry]]. Typically, a regiment or battalion consists of around 700 soldiers and is commanded by a [[Lieutenant Colonel]]. Many infantry regiments today consist of only one regular battalion, although many also contain another Territorial Army battalion.

*[[Brigade]]
**[[battalion]] or [[regiment]] commanded by a Lieutenant Colonel
** [[Company (military unit)|Company]] (or [[Squadron]]) of about 100 soldiers, commanded by a [[Major]]. 
*** [[Platoon]] (or [[Troop]]) of about 30 soldiers, commanded by a [[Lieutenant]]
**** [[Section (military unit)|Section]] of about 8 soldiers, commanded by a [[Corporal]]

Sections can be subdivided into two fire teams for tactical purposes.
===Battlegroups===
The main tactical formation in the British Army is the [[battlegroup (army)|battlegroup]]. This is a mixed formation of armour, infantry, artillery, engineers and support units, and is structured according to whatever task it is called on to perform ; it is formed around the core of either an armoured regiment or infantry battalion, and has other units added or removed from it as necessary. A battlegroup will typically consist of between 600 and 700 soldiers under the command of a Lt. Colonel.

===Recruitment===

[[Image:ArmyCareersOxford20051022 CopyrightKaihsuTai.jpg|thumb|right|A [[British armed forces]] - including British Army - [[recruitment]] centre in [[Oxford]].]] 

The Army mainly recruits within the United Kingdom, and normally has a recruitment target of around 25,000 soldiers per year. Low unemployment in Britain has resulted in the Army having difficulty in meeting its target, and in the early years of the 21st century there has been a marked increase in the number of recruits from other (mostly [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]) countries, who as of mid-2004 comprised approximately 7.5% of the Army's total strength. In July 2004 there were 5,620 foreign soldiers from 42 countries in the Army (not counting over 3,000 [[Nepal]]ese [[Gurkha]]s). After Nepal, the nation with most citizens in the British Army is [[Fiji]], with 1,895, followed by [[Jamaica]] with 960; soldiers also come from more prosperous countries such as [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]].

In 2003, nearly 10,000 teenagers joined the army, including more than 3000 16-year-olds.[http://www.newstatesman.com/200412060006.htm]

All soldiers must take an oath of allegiance on joining the Army: this is known as &quot;attestation&quot;. Those who believe in God use the following words:

:''I swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs and successors and that I will as in duty bound honestly and faithfully defend Her Majesty, her heirs and successors in person, crown and dignity against all enemies and will observe and obey all orders of Her Majesty, her heirs and successors and of the generals and officers set over me.'' [http://www.army.mod.uk/servingsoldier/usefulinfo/valuesgeneral/adp5milcov/ss_hrpers_values_adp5_3_w.html#selfless]

Others replace the words &quot;swear by Almighty God&quot; with &quot;solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm&quot;.

==Flags and ensigns==
[[image:Army_Flag.gif|thumb|250px|The non-ceremonial flag of the British Army. Sometimes the word &quot;Army&quot; in gold letters appears below the badge.]]
The British Army does not have its own specific ensign, unlike the Royal Navy, which uses the [[White Ensign]], and the RAF, which uses the [[Royal Air Force Ensign]]. Instead, the Army has different flags and ensigns, for the entire army and the different regiments and corps. The official flag of the Army as a whole is the [[Union Flag]], flown at ratio 3:5. A non-ceremonial flag also exists, which is used at recruiting events, military events and exhibitions. Whilst at war, the Union Flag is always used, and this flag represents the Army on the [[Cenotaph]] in [[Whitehall]], [[London]] (the UK's memorial to war dead). A British Army ensign also exists for vessels commanded by a commissioned officer, the [[Blue Ensign]] defaced with the Army badge. However, there are currently no commissioned vessels in the Army. 

Each line regiment (except the Rifle Regiments) also has its own flags, known as [[Colours, standards and guidons|the Colours]] - the Regimental Colour and the Queen's Colour. These colours have been taken into batle in the past and serve as a great sense of pride to the regiment. There is great variation in the different regimental colours. Typically the colour has the regiment's badge in the centre.

The '''Battle of Świecino''' (or ''Świecin'') (named for the village of [[Świecino]], near Żarnowiec Lake, northern Poland) also called the '''Battle of [[Żarnowiec]]''' or in German '''Battle of Schwetzin''', took place on [[September 17]] [[1462]] during the [[Thirteen Years' War]]. The [[Poland|Poles]] commanded by [[Piotr Dunin]], consisting of some 2000 mercenaries decisively defeated the [[Teutonic Knights]], having some 2700 mercenaries, commanded by [[Fritz Raweneck]] and [[Kaspar Nostyc]]. Auxiliary forces sent by duke [[Eric II of Pomerania]], ally of the Polish king, did not enter the battle.

== Polish forces ==
The Polish forces consisted of the mercenaries hired by the Polish king, [[Casimir IV of Poland|Casimir IV the Jagiellon]] and the royal city of [[Gdańsk]]. His force consisted of some 1000 cavalry, including 112 heavy cavalry, and another 1000 of infantry. These numbers include 1000 cavalry and 400 infantry were mercenaries hired by Polish king, the rest were units from Gdańsk.

== Teutonic forces ==
Most of the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic army]], under the command of Fritz Raweneck and Kaspar Nostyc, were mercenary soldiers gathered from the nearby castles [[Gniew]], [[Starogard Gdański]], [[Nowe]], [[Skarszewy]] and [[Kiszewy]]. This army totalled 1000 cavalry and 400 infantry. Raweneck also had the supply chain (tabors), cannons and up to 1300 auxiliary infantry of Pomeranian peasants, used mainly for fortification works.

== Battle ==
The battle started in the morning. Polish units build a fortified camp consisting, as usual in central European battles, of wagons linked by a chain surrounded by a deep ditch ([[Tabor (formation)|tabor]]). Also, units of Raveneck and his subordinate, Kaspar Nostyc (commander from [[Chojnice]]) created tabor. Piotr Dunin decided not to wait for the enemy and attacked first, setting infantry with crossbows at left, defended by cavalry between the tabor and the coast of the nearby lake of Rogoźnica. Raveneck placed cavalry in front of his tabor, and infantry behind it, without any strategic plan. The first phase of the battle was started by a charge of Polish heavy cavalry under Paweł Jasieński. Fierce fighting continued for three hours and ended without a clear winner. After a short pause at midday, Teuton units were able to push the Poles back; however, they found themselves under very heavy fire from crossbows of the Polish infantry, which caused huge losses and withdrawal. During this fight Raveneck was wounded. Raveneck stopped his soldiers and tried to attack again, but this charge ended with total defeat - Raveneck died and the rest of the cavalry surrendered or escaped. The Teuton infantry tried to defend at tabor, but its resistance was broken by a sudden attack of Polish cavalry.

== Casualties ==
The Teuton army lost around 1000 soldiers, including some 300 cavalryman. Fifty soldiers were captured. The Teutonic commander was also killed in battle and was buried in the Żarnowiec chapter church.

The Poles lost just 100 soldiers, but 150 later died from wounds. Among the dead on the Polish side was [[Maciej Hagen]] from [[Gdańsk]]. Piotr Dunin was twice wounded.

== Aftermath ==
The direct result of the battle of Świecino was that Gdańsk City and Pomerania were freed from Teutonic danger so that the royal and municipal armed forces could be used elsewhere in the war, mainly to protect the Vistula waterway and to capture the Teutonic held strongholds. This way that Teutonic forces in Prussia, on the rights bank of Vistula were cut off from the supplies form Western Europe.

The psychological significance was that this was the first open field battle won by the royal forces, so it increased the morale of the Polish forces, and lowered the morale of the Teutonic Knights. Many military historians say that the battle of Świecino was the turning point of the [[Thirteen Years' War]], leading to the final victory in 1466.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{English dialects}}
'''Basic English''' is a [[Constructed language|constructed language]] with a small number of words created by [[Charles Kay Ogden]] and described in his book ''Basic English: A General Introduction with Rules and Grammar'' (1930).  The language is based on a simplified version of [[English Language|English]].

Ogden said that it would take seven years to learn English, seven months for [[Esperanto]], and seven weeks for Basic English, comparable with [[Ido]]. Thus Basic English is used by companies who need to make complex books for international use, and by language schools that need to give people some knowledge of English in a short time.

Ogden did not put words into Basic English that could be said with a few other words, and he worked to make the words work in any country. He put his set of words through a large number of tests and adjustments. He also made the grammar simpler, but tried to keep the grammar normal for English users. 

The concept gained its greatest publicity just after the [[World War II|Second World War]] as a tool for world peace. Although it was not built into a program, similar simplifications were devised for various international uses. 

== Rules of grammar ==
Ogden's rules of grammar for Basic English allow people to use the 850 words to talk about things and events in the normal English way.
#Words are pluralized by adding an &quot;S&quot; on the end of the word.  If there are special ways to make a plural word in English, such as &quot;ES&quot; and &quot;IES&quot;, they should be used instead.
#Words like &quot;change,&quot; &quot;turn,&quot; and &quot;use&quot; are used as nouns, but the 300 of them may be turned into different forms by adding the ending -&quot;ER&quot; or -&quot;ING&quot;; or into adjectives by adding -&quot;ING&quot; and -&quot;ED.&quot; Only &quot;act&quot; is to be turned into &quot;actor,&quot; not &quot;acter.&quot;
#Some adjectives can be turned into adverbs with the ending -&quot;LY&quot;.
#For comparatives and superlatives, either &quot;MORE&quot; and &quot;MOST&quot; or -&quot;ER&quot; and -&quot;EST&quot; may be used.
#Some adjectives can be inverted with &quot;UN&quot;-.
#Yes/No Questions are formed by adding &quot;DO&quot; at the beginning or changing the word order.
#Operators and pronouns conjugate as in normal English.
#Combined words can be formed from two operators (for example &quot;become&quot;), from two nouns (for example &quot;newspaper&quot; or &quot;headline&quot;) or from a noun and a direction (&quot;sundown&quot;).
#Measures, numbers, money, months, days, years, clock time, and international words are in English forms.
#The wordlist can be augmented by the [[jargon]] of an industry or science.  For example, in a grammar, words such as &quot;grammar&quot; or &quot;noun&quot; might be used, even though they are not on Ogden's wordlist.



== Historical references ==
[[Winston Churchill]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] supported the idea of using Basic English as an international language, and Churchill recommended it in a speech at [[Harvard University]] in [[1943]]. Amused critics said that &quot;blood, toil, tears and sweat&quot; translates into Basic English as &quot;blood, hard work, eyewash and body water&quot;.

According to the [[Times Educational Supplement]]'s [http://www.talkingto.co.uk/ttgo/html/ttgo_answ.asp?quesID=1923&amp;CatID=187 Talking To series], [[George Orwell]] might have parodied Basic English in his book ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. The references to [[Newspeak]] could be interpreted as a hidden critique against &quot;[[International auxiliary language|universal languages]]&quot;. [[George Bernard Shaw]] is said to have subsidized Basic English, but this may be a misunderstanding: Shaw's real interest in language reform - and the bulk of his estate after his death - went to devising a new alphabet for non-Basic English.

== Word List ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''brass instrument''' is a [[musical instrument]] whose tone is produced by vibration of the lips as the player blows into a tubular [[resonance|resonator]] (mouthpiece).  They are also called ''labrosones'', literally meaning &quot;lip-vibrated instruments&quot; (Baines, 1993).
[[Image:trumpets02262006.jpg|thumb|right|Abstrars earlier to raise airmen's morale. President Roosevelt authorized the Bronze Star Medal by [[Executive Order]] 9419 dated [[February 4]], [[1944]], retroactive to [[December 7]], [[1941]]. This authorization was announced in War Department Bulletin No. 3, dated [[February 10]], [[1944]].

The Executive Order was amended by President [[John F. Kennedy]], per Executive Order 11046 dated [[August 24]], [[1962]], to expand the authorization to include those serving with friendly forces. Such an honor has been presented but three times:
#To the 2nd Battalion of [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] for their fight in the [[Operation Medak pocket|Medak Pocket]] in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]];
#To the 1st Battalion of the [[Royal 22e Régiment|Royal 22&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; Régiment]] for its defense of the airport at [[Sarajevo]];
#To 26 members of 3rd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry Battle Group, including posthumously to four killed when a U.S. F-16 fighter-bomber mistakenly attacked them as they conducted a night firing exercise on the outskirts of [[Kandahar]], [[Afghanistan]].

==CIB &amp; CMB Conversion==

As a result of a study conducted in [[1947]], the policy was implemented that authorized the retroactive award of the Bronze Star Medal to soldiers who had received the [[Combat Infantryman Badge]] or the [[Combat Medical Badge]] during [[World War II]]. The basis for doing this was that the badges were awarded only to soldiers who had borne the hardships which resulted in General Marshall's support of the Bronze Star Medal. Both badges required a recommendation by the commander and a citation in orders.

==Appearance==

The Bronze Star is a bronze star 1 1/2 inches (38 mm) in circumscribing diameter. In the center thereof is a 3/16 inch (48 mm) diameter superimposed bronze star, the center line of all rays of both stars coinciding. The reverse has the inscription &lt;small&gt;&quot;HEROIC OR MERITORIOUS ACHIEVEMENT&quot;&lt;/small&gt; and a space for the name of the recipient to be engraved. The star is suspended from the ribbon by a rectangular shaped metal loop with the corners rounded.  The ribbon is 1 3/8 inches (35 mm) wide and consists of the following stripes: 1/32 inch (1 mm) white 67101; 9/16 inch (14 mm) scarlet 67111; 1/32 inch (1 mm) white; center stripe 1/8 inch (3 mm) ultramarine blue 67118; 1/32 inch (1 mm) white; 9/16 inch (14 mm) scarlet; and 1/32 inch (1 mm) white.

==Devices==

Additional awards of the Bronze Star Medal are denoted in the [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] by [[oak leaf clusters]]. The [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Marines|Marines]], and [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] issue [[award stars]] to denote subsequent decorations.

The [[Valor device]] (or ''&quot;V&quot; device'') is authorized by all services and is awarded to represent [[valor]] and does not denote an additional award. Only one may be worn on any ribbon.

'''Ballarat''' ({{coor dm|37|33|S|143|51|E|type:city(87000)_region:AU-VIC}}) is the largest inland city in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], approximately 120 kilometres north-west of [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]], with a population of 87,000 people. The city lies at 441 metres (1,447 feet) above sea level and covers an area of approximately 740 square kilometres. 

== History ==
The site of the city was originally a stock station established by [[William Cross Yuille]] and [[Henry Anderson]] in [[1838]] and named Ballaarat, which was derived from aboriginal words which mean camping place.
[[Image:BAllarat Hospital.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Ballarat Base Hospital]].]]
It was founded in the early [[1850s]] when [[gold]] was discovered there, and, with a huge influx of population and wealth, was for a time Victoria's largest city.  The legacy of the wealth generated is still visible in a large number of fine stone buildings in and around the city, especially in the Lydiard Street area which contains some of Victoria's finest examples of Victorian era buildings many of which are classified by the [[National Trust of Australia]].  
Ballarat is notable as the site for Australia's only armed civil uprising, the [[Eureka Stockade]] which took place in [[1854]].  The site contains a historical park and a memorial to commemorate the event.

== Features ==
[[Image:Ballarat location map in Victoria.PNG|thumb|left|200px|Location of Ballarat in Victoria (red).]]

The [[Ballarat Botanical Gardens]] are amongst the finest [[Botanical Gardens]] in Australia.
[[Lake Wendouree]] hosted the rowing for the [[1956]] [[Olympic Games]], and is a large recreational lake created out of former wetlands.

== Industries ==
Today, Ballarat's major industries include [[tourism]], food products, brick and tile manufacture, education and information technology services.

==Media==
Residents have their own independent local newspapers,  'The Courier', and the 'Ballarat News'. Local radio stations are 'The Voice', 'Power FM' and 'Noise FM'. Ballarat has its own television broadcasting facilities which provide regional television for most of the eureka district. [[WIN Television|WIN]], [[Prime Television|PRIME]], and [[Southern Cross Ten]] license [[Nine Network]], [[Seven Network]], and [[Network Ten]] content respectively and maintain a similar schedule but with local demographic commercials and local/regional news. Subscription television services are provided by [[Neighbourhood Cable]], and [[Austar]]. 

[[image:rat1-640.jpg|frame|Ballarat looking over [[Lake Wendouree]]; in the distance is [[Mount Warrenheip]].]]&lt;br clear=all /&gt;

==Climate==
Ballarat experiences a temperate climate with four seasons. Because of its elevation, at 450 metres above sea level, mean monthly temperatures tend to be on average 2-3 degrees below those for Melbourne. The mean daily maximum temperature for January is 24.9° Celsius, while for July it is 3°C . The mean annual rainfall is 705 mm, with August being the wettest month (77 mm). There are an average of 198 rain-free days per year.
In winter, [[snow]] occasionally falls on nearby [[Mount Buninyong | Mount Buninyong]], and in very cold winters, has been known to fall in the city centre.

The '''Battle of Abrittus''' (now Razgrad, [[Bulgaria]]), also known as the '''Battle of Forum Terebronii,''' occurred on [[July 1]], [[251]], between the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[legion]]s and [[Goths]] under King [[Cniva]]. The Romans were defeated, and the [[Roman Emperors|Emperor]] [[Decius]] and his son [[Herennius Etruscus|Herennius]] were both killed during battle, largely thanks to the failure of the general [[Trebonianus Gallus]] to attack aggressively.  Decius became the first Roman emperor killed in a battle with barbarians.

Gallus, who became [[Roman Emperors|emperor]] upon Decius' death, negotiated a treaty with the Goths under duress, which allowed them to keep their booty and return to their homes on the other side of the Danube, while at the same time promising an annual tribute in return for the Goths' promise to respect Roman territory.

[[Ammianus Marcellinus]] (31.5.12-17) rates this reverse with the most serious military disasters of the [[Roman Empire]] to his time: [[Publius Quinctilius Varus|Varus]]' defeat at the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]], the incursions of the [[Marcomanni]] during the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]], and the [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of Adrianople]].

The '''Battle of Berestechko''' in Volhynia, [[Ukraine]], part of the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]], lasted from [[June 28]] to [[June 30]], [[1651]], between the [[Poland|Polish]] army under [[Rulers of Poland|King]] [[John II of Poland|Jan II Casimir]] and Ukrainian [[Cossack]] and peasant forces, led by [[Hetman]] [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], and their [[Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] allies. The Polish army had around 57,000 troops, the Ukrainians around 100,000 plus 25,000 Tatar cavalry. The battle was won by the Poles after the Tatars, dispirited after the death of their leader [[Tugay Bey]], deserted the battlefield. As a result, Khmelnytsky was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Bila Tserkva]] with the Poles.

'''Bohdan Zynovii Mykhailovych Khmel'nyts'kyi''' (Богдан Зиновій Михайлович Хмельницький in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], commonly transliterated as '''Khmelnytsky'''; known in [[Polish language|Polish]] as '''Bohdan Zenobi Chmielnicki'''; in [[Russian (language)|Russian]] as '''Bogdan Khmel'nitsky''') (''c.'' [[1595]] &amp;ndash; [[August 6]], [[1657]]) was a [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] noble of [[Poles|Polish]] or [[Ruthenia|Ruthenian]] origin, leader of the [[Zaporizhzhia (region)|Zaporozhia]]n [[Cossack Hetmanate]], [[hetman]] of [[Ukraine]], noted for his revolt against [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] ([[1648]] &amp;ndash; [[1654]]) and the [[Treaty of Pereyaslavl]] which eventually led to the annexation of [[Ukraine]] by the [[Russian Empire]].

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
[[Image:Chmielnicki_ukraine_banknote_5_new.gif|thumb|right|300px|5 [[Hryvnia]] Ukrainian [[banknote]] depicting Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]
Khmelnytsky was probably born in [[Chyhyryn]], in [[Ukraine]]; it is unclear whether to a family of [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] nobility or to [[Poles|Polish]] nobility of [[Abdank]] Coat of Arms who had immigrated to Ukraine from [[Masovia]]. Khmelnytsky was educated by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in [[Lviv]]. Unlike many of their other pupils, he did not embrace [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] but early in life became indifferent to the faith. Later he seemed to belong to the [[Greek Orthodox]] faith, to which most of the Cossacks and the [[Ruthenian]] [[peasants]] belonged. He had two sons - [[Yuriy Khmelnytsky|Yuriy]] and [[Tymofiy Khmelnytsky|Tymofiy]] (Tymish). He was deprived of his estate of [[Subotiv]] by [[Daniel Czapliński]], the [[bailiff]] of Chyhyryn. At this time he was still in the subordinate position of a &quot;sotski&quot; (an officer over a ''sotnia'', or hundred cavalrymen) of the [[Registered Cossacks]], subject to the Polish [[magnate]] [[Stanislaw Koniecpolski|Stanisław Koniecpolski]]. With Koniecpolski he took part in the disastrous [[Battle of Cecora]] in [[1620]]. Czapliński availed himself of Khmelnytsky's absence to raid the estate, during which Khmelnytsky's young son Yuriy received injuries from which he ultimately died, and Khmelnytsky's second wife was carried off.

=== Cossack leader ===
As one of Czyhrynian and  Zaporozhian  [[Cossacks]], he fought against Turks and Tatars in 1625-1630.
He also participated in the Cossack rebellions of 1632 and 1637. 
In October 1645 he was invited to France by Cardinal Jules [[Mazarin]] with two regiments of Cossacks to participate in the war against Spain. Due to his military skills [[Dunkirk]] was taken by assault in two days.

For centuries after the creation of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the [[Orthodox]] people of [[Ruthenia]] had felt oppressed by the Polish nobles, [[Catholic]] priests and [[Jew]]ish traders. Although [[Ruthenian]] [[nobility]] enjoyed full rights, they were quickly [[polonize]]d and therefore were alienated from the common people; the advent of the [[Counter-Reformation]] worsened the relationship between the Orthodox and Catholic churches. Unwilling to attend to the details of administration themselves, Polish [[magnate]]s made [[Jew]]ish traders their go-betweens in transactions with the [[peasants]] of [[Ukraine]]. The magnates sold and leased certain privileges to the [[Jew]]s for a lump sum and, while enjoying themselves at their courts, left it to the Jewish leaseholders and collectors to become objects of hatred to the oppressed and long-suffering peasants. Although Khmelnytsky's personal resentment influenced his ultimate decision to rid Ukraine of Polish domination, it seems that his ambition to secure the Nobles' privileges and the Cossacks' independence, was the main motive that led him to instigate an uprising of the [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian people]] against them, known after him as the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]]. 

Khmelnytsky told the people that the Poles had sold them as slaves &quot;into the hands of the accursed Jews&quot;. With this as their battle-cry, the Cossacks killed a large number of Jews during the years 1648&amp;ndash;1649.  The precise number of dead may never be known, but the decrease of the Jewish population during that period is estimated at 50,000 to 200,000, which also includes deaths from diseases and Tatar imprisonment.

These events also initiated a series of campaigns (which began the period in Polish history known as [[The Deluge]]) that temporarily freed [[Ukraine]] from Polish domination but in time subjected it to Russian domination. Successes at [[Battle of Yellow Waters|Zhovti Vody]], [[Battle of Korsun]] and [[Battle of Pilavtsi]] (respectively, in Polish, Żółte Wody, Korsuń, and Piławce) against Hetman [[Mikolaj Potocki|Mikołaj Potocki]] led to the Polish king giving royal recognition for the contentious privileges under the [[Treaty of Zborov]].  Hostilities resumed when the Sejm refused to recognise the provisions of the treaty. After Khmelnytsky's forces were betrayed by their former allies, the [[Tatars]], they suffered a massive defeat in [[1651]] at the [[Battle of Beresteczko]], and were forced at [[Bila Tserkva]] to accept a loser's treaty. A year later, the Cossacks had their revenge at the [[Battle of Batoh]]. Ukraine was still perilously weak, and in [[1654]] Khmelnytsky persuaded the Cossacks to ally with the Russian tsar in the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]], which eventually led to the incorporation of the [[Left-bank Ukraine]] into [[Russia]].

[[Sholem Asch]] wrote about Kmelnytsky's cossack war in his book ''[[Al Kiddush Hashem: A Novel of 1648]]'' which describes the massacres of the Jews in horrific detail.

In Poland, Khmelnytsky's war was described in the [[19th century]] by [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]] in his famous novel, ''[[With Fire and Sword]] (Ogniem i mieczem)''. This book was written with a clearly stated intent of raising the national spirit in [[partitions of Poland|partitioned Poland]], and shows the story of Khmelnytsky and the Cossacks from the point of view of the Polish nobles ([[szlachta]]), thus glorifying the Polish side while vilifying the rebels. After Poland was subsumed within the Russian empire, attempts were made to recast Khmelnytsky as an archetype of the freedom loving Pole. Similar efforts to claim Khmelnytsky's heritage were made under the Soviet Union, where Khmelnytsky was recast as a historical leader of proletarian revolution.
In 1999 a Polish movie was made based on ''[[With Fire and Sword]] (Ogniem i mieczem)'', which portrayed a more realistic image of Khmelnytsky, as a complex man and Ukrainian leader with a deep personality who sought justice for the wrongs committed against him. Thus the movie tried to overcome somewhat negative views presented in the original book. It was well received by both Polish and Ukrainian audience.

'''Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Борис Николаевич Ельцин; {{Audio|ru-Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin.ogg|listen}}) (born [[February 1]], [[1931]]) was [[President of Russia]] from [[1991]] to [[1999]]. 

==Early life==
Boris Yeltsin was born tooperations with [[No. 100 Group RAF|RAF 100 Group]].

During World War II, some forty B-17s were repaired by the [[Luftwaffe]] after crash-landing or being forced down and put back into the air in the service of the Reich.  These were codenamed &quot;Dornier Do 200,&quot; given German markings, and used for clandestine spy and reconnaissance missions by the Luftwaffe. Other B-17s retained their Allied markings{{fact}} and were used to infiltrate B-17 formations, then report their position and altitude to German ground-control stations. The practice was intially successful, but it did not take the Army Air Force combat aircrews long to figure out what was happening.  Standard procedure shortly became to first warn off, and then fire upon, any 'stranger' trying to join a group's formation.

When [[Israel]] achieved statehood in [[1948]], the [[Israeli Air Force]] had to be assembled quickly to defend the new nation from the war it found itself embroiled in almost immediately.  Among the first aircraft acquired by the Israeli Air Force were three surplus American B-17s, smuggled via South America and Czechoslovakia to avoid an arms trading ban imposed by the United States. A fourth plane was captured and confiscated by American officials. In their delivery flight from Europe, the aircraft were ordered to bomb the Royal Palace of [[King Farouk]] in [[Cairo]] before continuing to Israel, in retaliation for Egyptian bombing raids on [[Tel-Aviv]].  They performed the mission (despite some of the crew fainting due to defective oxygen equipment) but caused little damage to the target.  The B-17s were generally unsuitable for the needs of the Israeli Air Force and the nature of the conflict, in which long-range bombing raids on large-area targets were relatively unimportant.  They were mainly used in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], flown by [[69 Squadron Israeli Air Force]].  They were withdrawn in [[1958 in aviation|1958]].

== Obsolescence ==
Following World War II, the B-17 was obsolete, and the Army Air Force retired the fleet. Flight crews ferried the bombers back across the Atlantic to the United States, where they were melted down and sold for scrap. 

A number of B-17s survive in museums and at airports. A handful of these still fly, visiting airports or performing in airshows. Since the bombers that served in World War II were sold for scrap, most of these survivors are surplus or training aircraft, which stayed in the U.S. during the War. However, there are few exceptions. 

The [[Memphis Belle]], which flew 25 missions over Europe before touring the United States to advertise [[war bonds]], is preserved in [[Memphis, TN]].The Memphis Belle has been transported to Wright Patterson Air Force base for restoration and display. The Dayton Daily News has more information on this move and how you can view the plane during its restoration. 

The Swoose, the only surviving example of the narrow-tailed B-17s of the A, B, C and D series, fought in the Pacific Theatre before being converted to an unarmed transport/flying command post used by general officers of the Fifth Air Force in Australia, and was then ordered back to the United States in 1943.  The oldest surviving B-17 in the world, The Swooses is presently in storage at the Smithsonian Institution's Silver Hill aircraft storage and restoration facility in Maryland. As of 2000, the Smithsonian was planning to restore her, though whether to full airworthiness or to static display standard had not been determined.

Another noteworthy combat veteran is [[Shoo Shoo Shoo Baby]], which flew 24 combat missions out of England before being forced to land in Sweden in late 1944. Sweden, which was neurtral, interned the crew and later returned them, but kept the plane and converted it to be a transport.
In the period November to October 1947 it was flying for the Danish Air Lines as Stig Viking (OY-DFA. March 1948 to December 1949 Danish Army, December 1949 to October 1952 Danish Navy.
October 1952 Royal Danish Air Force all its service time in Denmark her name was Store Bjørn.

It was later sold to a French aerial mapping company. Abandoned in 1961, the remains of the plane were donated to the [[U.S Air Force]] in 1972, with a restoration undertaken between 1978-1988 by a crew at [[Dover Air Force Base]], [[Delaware]]. The end result was nothing short of magnificent and the plane can be seen today at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] in [[Dayton]], [[Ohio]].

It has also been recently discovered that the B-17G at the [[March Field Air Museum]] in [[Riverside]], [[California]] was delivered to the [[15th Air Force]] and most likely flew combat missions over [[North Africa]] and in the [[Mediterranean]] (Something that was confirmed by battle damage found after the plane was paint stipped during restoration). The exact detail of that plane's service, though, are not yet known.

Two B-17s navigating and acting as mother ships for six [[P-38|P-38 Lightnings]] were forced to land on a glacier in Greenland during a ferry flight to the UK on July 15, 1942. Incredibly, none of the crews were lost. By the 1990s, these eight aircraft had been buried under more than 250 feet of ice. One of the P-38s was recovered and restored as &quot;Glacier Girl.&quot; One of the B-17s was also recovered (My Gal Sal, 41-9032), but it remains dismantled in storage in [[Cincinnati, OH]]. None of the 'Lost Squadron' ever saw combat, however.

[[Image:Bathyscaphe Trieste Closeup.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Close-up of pressure sphere]]
[[Image:trieste2.JPG|thumb|200px|right|''Trieste'' emblem]]

'''''Trieste''''' was a deep-diving research [[bathyscaphe]] (&quot;deep boat&quot;) with a crew of two. Designed by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] scientist [[Auguste Piccard]], she was launched in August 1953 in the [[Mediterranean]] near [[Naples]], [[Italy]]. She was purchased by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] in 1958 for $250,000.00.

The ''Trieste'' basically consisted of a chamber filled with [[gasoline]] for [[buoyancy]] and a separate pressure sphere. This sphere (called [[bathysphere]] by [[Auguste Piccard|Piccard]]) provided just enough room for two persons and was built by the [[Krupp]] Steel Works of [[Essen, Germany|Essen]], [[Germany]]. To withstand the staggering pressure of 9 tons per square inch (124 M[[pascal|Pa]]) at the bottom of [[Challenger Deep]], the new sphere's walls were 5 inches (127 mm) thick. It weighed 13 tons in air, 8 in water.

Transported to the [[Naval Electronics Laboratory]]'s facility in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], she was extensively modified and then used in a series of deep-submergence tests in the [[Pacific Ocean]] during the next few years, including a dive to the [[Mariana Trench]], the deepest known part of the ocean, in January 1960.

''Trieste'' departed San Diego on [[October 5]], [[1959]] on the way to [[Guam]] by the freighter ''Santa Maria'' to participate in ''[[Project Nekton]]'' - a series of very deep dives in the Mariana Trench. 

On [[January 23]], [[1960]], she reached the ocean floor in the Challenger Deep, carrying [[Jacques Piccard]] (son of Auguste) and Lieutenant [[Don Walsh]], USN. This was the first time a ship, manned or unmanned, had reached the deepest point in the sea. The onboard systems indicated a depth of 37,800 ft (11,521 m), but this was later revised to 35,813 ft (10,916 m). (However later and more accurate measurements made in 1995 have found the Challenger Deep to be shallower, at 35,798 ft (10,911 m)). The descent took almost five hours and the two men spent barely twenty minutes on the ocean floor before undertaking the 3 hour 15 minute ascent. They observed small [[sole (fish)|soles]] and [[flounder]]s and noted the floor consisted of [[diatom]]aceous ooze while on the bottom.

In April 1963, she was modified and used in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to search for the missing submarine [[USS Thresher (SSN-593)|USS ''Thresher'']] (SSN-593). In August 1963, ''Trieste'' found the wreck off [[New England]], 8400 feet (2.56 km) below the surface. The bathyscaphe was then retired and some of her components were used in the ''[[Bathyscaphe Trieste II|Trieste II]]''.

In appearance at the time of ''Project Nekton'' she was over 50 feet (15 m) long, but the great extent of this was a series of floats filled with 22,500 US [[gallon]]s (85 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of gasoline to provide buoyancy, and air tanks at either end of the ship. The crew were in a 6 ft (2 m) diameter steel sphere attached to the underside of the floats. An additional nine tons of pellet shot were taken on the craft to speed the descent. This additional weight was held in place by electromagnets, so that in case of an electric failure the craft would immediately start to rise to the surface.

The ''Trieste'' class bathyscaphes were replaced by the [[DSV Alvin|''Alvin'' class]] submersibles, best exemplified by [[DSV Alvin|DSV ''Alvin'']]. Though they could not dive as deep (a maximum of 20,000 feet for [[DSV Sea Cliff|DSV ''Sea Cliff'']]), they were more capable and more durable.

''Trieste'' is now a permanent exhibit at the [[Naval Historical Center]], [[Washington Navy Yard]] in [[Washington, DC]].

The '''Battle of Bouvines,''' [[July 27]], [[1214]], was the first great international conflict of alliances among national forces in Europe. In the alliances, which were orchestrated by [[Pope Innocent III]], [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] of France defeated [[Otto IV of Germany]] and count [[Jeanne of Flanders|Ferrand of Flanders]] so decisively that Otto was deposed and replaced by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] [[Hohenstaufen]]. Ferrand was captured and imprisoned. Philip was himself able to take undisputed control of the territories of [[Anjou]], [[Brittany]], [[Maine (province of France)|Maine]], [[Normandy]], and the [[Touraine]], which he had recently seized from Otto's kinsman and ally [[John of England]].

The city of [[Bouvines]] is between [[Lille]] and [[Tournai]], and in the 13th century was in the County of [[Flanders]] and is part of modern [[France]].

==Prelude==
The campaign plan seems to have been designed by John, who was the fulcrum of the alliances; his general idea was to draw the French king away from Paris southward against himself and keep him occupied, while the main army, under  emperor Otto IV, with the counts of the low countries, should march on Paris from the north. John's part in the general strategy was carried out at first, but the allies in the north moved slowly. John, after two encounters with his mortal enemy of France, turned back to his Guienne possessions on July 3, however, perhaps in one of his fits of despondency. When, three weeks later, the emperor finally concentrated his forces at [[Valenciennes]], John was out of the picture, and in the interval Philip Augustus had countermarched northward and regrouped. Philip now took the offensive himself, and in maneuvering to get a good cavalry ground upon which to fight he offered battle (July 27), on the plain east of Bouvines and the river Marque. The imperial army drew up facing south-westward towards Bouvines, the heavy cavalry on the wings, the infantry in one great mass in the center, supported by the cavalry corps under the emperor himself. The total force is estimated at 6500 heavy cavalry and 40,000 foot solidiers. The French army (about 7000 cavalry and 30,000 infantry) took ground exactly opposite in a similar formation, cavalry on the wings, infantry, including the townsmen (''milice des communes'') in the center, Philip with the cavalry reserve and the royal standard, the [[Oriflamme]], in rear of the men on foot.

==Battle==
The battle opened with a confused cavalry fight on the French right, in which individual feats of knightly gallantry were more noticeable (and better recorded in the chronicles) than any attempt at combined action. The serious fighting was between the two centers; the infantry of the Low Countries, who were at this time almost the best in existence, drove back the French. Philip led the cavalry reserve of nobles and knights to retrieve the day, and after a long and doubtful fight, in which he himself was unhorsed and narrowly escaped death, began to drive back the Flemings. In the meanwhile the French feudatories on the left wing had thoroughly defeated the imperial forces opposed to them, and [[William de Longespee, 3rd Earl of Salisbury|William Longsword, Earl of Salisbury]], the leader of this corps, was unhorsed and taken prisoner by the fighting [[bishop of Beauvais]]. On the other wing the French at last routed the Flemish cavalry and captured Ferdinand Count of Flanders, one of the leaders of the coalition. In the center the battle was now a melée between the two mounted reserves led by the king and the emperor in person. Here too the imperial forces suffered defeat, Otto himself being saved only by the devotion of a handful of Saxon knights. The Imperial Eagle Standard was captured by the French. The day was already decided in favor of the French when their wings began to close inwards to cut off the retreat of the imperial center. The battle closed with the celebrated stand of Reginald of Boulogne, a former vassal of King Philip, who formed a ring of seven hundred [[Brabant|Brabancon]] pikemen, and not only defied every attack of the French cavalry, but himself made repeated charges or sorties with his small force of knights. Eventually, and long after the imperial army had begun its retreat, the gallant schiltron was ridden down and annihilated by a charge of three thousand men-at-arms. Reginald was taken prisoner in the mele; and the prisoners also included two other counts, Ferdinand and William Longsword, twenty-five barons and over a hundred knights. The killed amounted to about 170 knights of the defeated party, and many thousands of foot on either side.

John returned to England to face the barons whose possessions in Normandy he had lost. After Bouvines there were no important wars in Western Europe until the 1290s.

The '''Battle of Actium''' was a [[naval battle]] of the [[Roman Civil War]] between [[Mark Antony]] and [[Caesar Augustus|Octavian]] (Caesar Augustus). It was fought on [[September 2]], [[31 BC]], near the Roman colony of [[Actium]] in [[Greece]] (near the modern-day city of [[Preveza]]), on the [[Ionian Sea]]. Octavian's fleet was commanded by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]], Antony's fleet was supported by the fleet of his lover, [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra]], queen of [[History of Greek and Roman Egypt|Egypt]]. The battle was won by the forces of Octavian, whose victory led him to become the [[Princeps]] [[Augustus]], later considered to be the first [[Roman Emperor]]: for this reason the date of the battle is often used to mark the end of the [[Roman Republic]] and the beginning of the [[Roman Empire]].

==Prelude==

The second [[triumvirate]] broke up due to the serious threat that Octavian felt of [[Caesarion]], the son of Cleopatra and Caesar. Octavian's base of power was his link with Caesar through adoption, which granted him much-needed popularity and loyalty of the legions. To see this convenient situation threatened after Antony declared that Caesarion was the legimate heir to Julius Caesar, a propaganda war between the allies began ending the second triumvirate on the last day of 33 BC. Finally the Senate deprived Antony of his power and declared war against Cleopatra. A third of the Senate and two consuls joined Antony's side and in 31 BC, the war started when Octavian's talented general Agrippa captured the Greek city and naval port of Methone which was loyal to Antony.  Mark Antony was an excellent soldier, but his lack of experience in naval matters at sea was his downfall.

==The battle==

[[Image:Battle_of_actium.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Battle plan]]The two fleets met outside the [[gulf of Actium]], on the morning of September 2, 31 BC, with Mark Antony leading 220 warships through the straits toward the open sea. There he met the fleet of Octavian, led by Admiral Agrippa, arranged to block his exit in an arc from the south. Mark Antony's warships were mostly massive [[quinquereme]]s, huge galleys with massive rams that could weigh up to three tons. The bows of the galleys were armored with bronze plates and square-cut timbers making it difficult to successfully ram them with similar equipment. Unfortunately for Antony, many of his ships were undermanned because of a severe malaria that had struck his forces while he was waiting for Octavian's fleet to arrive. Many oarsmen had died even before the battle began thus making them unable to execute the tactics for which they were designed--powerful, head-on collisions. Also the morale of his troops had weakened due to the cutting of supply lines. Antony had burned those ships he could no longer man and clustered the rest tightly together. 

Octavian's fleet was mostly smaller fully manned Liburnian vessels, armed with better trained and fresher crews.  His ships were also lighter and could protect themselves by outmanuvering the quinqueremes in Roman naval battle, where one objective was to ram the enemy ship and at the same time kill the above deck crew with a shower of arrows and catapult-launched stones large enough to decapitate a man.  Before the naval battle Mark Antony's general known as Delius defected to Octavian and brought with him Mark Antony’s battle plans. Antony had hoped to use his biggest ships to drive back Agrippa's wing on the north end of his line, but Octavian's entire fleet stayed carefully out of range. Shortly after mid-day, Antony was forced to extend his line out from the protection of the shore, and then finally engage the enemy.

Seeing that the battle was going against Antony, Cleopatra's fleet retreated to open sea without firing a shot. Mark Antony retreated to a smaller vessel with his flag and managed to escape the battle, taking a few ships with him as an escort to help break through Octavian's lines. Those that he left behind, however, were not so fortunate: Octavian's fleet captured or sank all of them.

==Aftermath==

[[Image:Ballistae on roman ship.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Ballista|Ballistae]] on a Roman ship.]]
The political consequences of this seemingly simple sea battle were tremendous.  The proper perspective is that Mark Antony's army was just as large as Octavian's, and the accomplished general Mark Antony could seriously challenge Octavian.  As a result of losing the sea battle, Mark Antony's army deserted in large numbers without engaging Octavian's army in battle. Antony lost some 19 infantry legions and 12,000 cavalry, deserting under cover of darkness, debilitating Mark Antony's ability to challenge Octavian. Despite a brief victory at Alexandria, on July 31, 30 BC, Mark Antony's armies decided to desert, leaving him without a competent army to fight Octavian. 

After losing his army to desertion, Mark Antony committed suicide, and, as a result, Cleopatra attempted to negotiate surrender terms with Octavian.  Upon failure to have favorable surrender terms Cleopatra committed suicide on August 12, 30 BC, by allowing herself to be bitten by a poisonous [[asp]] that was reportedly hidden in a basket of dates.  In summary, the Battle of Actium resulted in the loss of Mark Antony's army, and then his defeat, and the taking of Egypt by the Roman Empire. Also the battle ended the era of Roman Republic and began the time of the Roman Empire.
An account of the battle appears in [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]].

The '''Zebra Danio''' or '''Zebrafish''' (''Brachydanio rerio'' or ''Danio rerio'') is a [[tropical]] [[fish]], commonly kept in [[aquarium|aquaria]] and used for scientific research, belonging to the minnow family ([[Cyprinidae]]). The fish is named for its five uniformly, pigmented, horizontal [[blue]] stripes on the side of the body; all extending to the [[anal fin]] onto the end of [[caudal fin]] rays of its tail. Zebra Danios are of no economic importance in commercial fisheries as a [[food fish]], but very commonly known and popular in the [[aquarium]] trade. They are hardy fish and considered good for beginner aquarists. This species has been called one of the &quot;bread and butter&quot; fishes because of its ease of keeping, continued popularity and its favorable price and availability. 

Originating in Eastern [[India]] as well as in [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]] and [[Myanmar]], it grows to about 2 [[inch]]es (6 [[centimetre|cm]]) and lives for around 5 years. The zebra danio, in its native range, commonly inhabits streams, canals, ditches, ponds and also occurs in slow-moving to stagnant standing water bodies, particularly [[rice paddy|rice fields]]. In the aquarium trade, there are long-finned and other color forms of this danio, including a &quot;Leopard&quot; danio.

Like other danios it is [[omnivore|omnivorous]] and a peaceful fish that gets along well with other fish of similar size in [[aquarium|community tanks]].  A schooling fish, it prefers to be in groups of six or more.  Zebra Danios prefer water with a 6.0&amp;ndash;8.0 [[pH]], a water hardness of up to 5.0&amp;ndash;19.0 [[dGH]], and a temperature range of 64&amp;ndash;74 °[[Fahrenheit|F]] (18&amp;ndash;24 °[[Celsius|C]]). 

The males have gold stripes between the blue stripes and females have silver stripes instead of gold.  An egg-scatterer, danios produce around 100 eggs in a single [[spawning]]. They are considered one of the easiest aquarium fish to breed.

Other fish also share the name [[zebrafish]].

== Diseases ==
Zebra Danio are susceptible to [[Oodinium]], or [[Velvet disease]].

== Feeding ==
Zebra Danios are omnivorous. In the wild, these fish consume various small aquatic [[insects]], [[crustacean]]s, [[worms]] as well as [[plankton]]. For this reason, they can be used to reduce [[mosquito]] [[larvae]] populations in [[pond]]s and ditches. For zebra danios living in aquaria, live/frozen flaked foods are suitable, especially [[brine shrimp]] and [[sinking tablets]]. When conditioning zebras for breeding, it's advisable to feed them plenty of fresh foods.

== Model organism for development and genetics==
Zebra Danios serve as a common and useful [[model organism]] for studies of [[vertebrate]] development and gene function because they reproduce very easily, passing from the egg to the larvae stage in less than three days. For genetic research groups, the zebrafish is an excellent test subject and is used in many labs to replace or to supplement higher vertebrate models, such as rats and mice. ''Danio rerio'' is one of the few species of fish to have been flown into space (See [[Animals in space]]).  Aided by the transparency of the embryo, if researchers modify the fish's genotype at the egg stage they can see resulting changes in organ shape or dynamics barely three days later.  The arrival of zebrafish as a major model for studying developmental biology co-incided with a large scale [[Mutation|mutagenesis screen]]. The scholarly journal [http://dev.biologists.org/ Development] devoted an issue to research using the fish in celebration of this landmark. &lt;sup&gt;[http://dev.biologists.org/content/vol123/issue1/]&lt;/sup&gt;  A common [[reverse genetics]] technique is to knock down [[gene expression]] or modify [[Splicing_(genetics)|splicing]] in zebrafish using [[Morpholino]] antisense technology; the journal [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jhome/68503812  Genesis] devoted an issue to research using Morpholino oligos&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.wiley.com/legacy/products/subject/life/anatomy/genesis_morpholino.html]&lt;/sup&gt;, mostly in &lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/i&gt;. 

The results of genetic engineering in these fishes have been used to produce the [[Glofish]], an aquarium pet with fluorescent pigments. Other varieties include ''golden'', ''sandy'' and ''long fin'' fish.

In December 2005, a study of the ''golden'' strain identified the gene responsible for the unusual pigmentation of this strain as [[SLC24A5]], a solute carrier that appears to be required for [[melanin]] production, and confirmed its function with a Morpholino knockdown. The [[Orthologue|orthologous]] gene was then characterized in humans and a one base pair difference was found to segregate strongly between fair skinned Europeans and dark skinned Africans. &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16357253&amp;query_hl=38&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum]&lt;/sup&gt; This important study featured on the cover of the academic journal [[Science (journal)|Science]] and demonstrates the power of zebrafish as a model organism in the relatively new field of [[comparative genomics]].

==Zebra danios as an introduced species==
Zebra danios have been [[introduced species|introduced]] and become established in [[Japan]] and the [[United States]]. The fish has also been sighted in [[Colombia]], presumably escaped from an [[aquarium]] fish rearing facility and into local waters.

The '''Battle of Adowa''' (also known as ''Adwa'' or sometimes by the Italian name ''Adua'') was fought on [[March 1]], [[1896]] between [[Ethiopia]] and [[Italy]] near the town of [[Adowa]], Ethiopia, in [[Tigray Region| Tigray]]. It was the climactic battle of the [[First Italo-Abyssinian War]]. 

As the twentieth century approached, [[Africa]] had been carved up between the various [[Europe]]an powers, with the exception of the tiny republic of [[Liberia]] on the west coast of the continent and the ancient, landlocked kingdom of Ethiopia, bordering the strategic [[Horn of Africa]]. Italy, a relative newcomer to the [[colonialism|colonial]] [[scramble for Africa]], having been left with only two impoverished territories on the Horn, [[Eritrea]] and [[Somaliland|Somalia]], sought to increase its influence by conquering Ethiopia and creating a land bridge between its two territories. Italy and Ethiopia faced off in First Italo-Abyssinian War, with the two armies at a standoff in Tigray.

By late February, [[1896]], supplies on both sides were running dangerously low. Succumbing to pressure from the Italian government, General [[Oreste Baratieri]] made the first move on the night of [[February 29]]. He did not calculate the rough terrain, however, and his army was divided into small pockets of troops without contact with each other. This was observed by the Ethiopian commander [[Ras Makonnen]] (father of Emperor [[Haile Selassie]]), who ordered his troops to attack. By morning, troops belonging to Emperor [[Menelik II]] and Empress [[Taytu Betul]] joined the forays.

The 14,527 Italians were heavily outnumbered by over 120,000 Ethiopians and were eventually encircled and routed. Further casualties resulted from the heavy skirmishing as the Italians retreated to their bases. The Italians took 5,900 casualties, while the Ethiopians had about 10,000.

As a direct result of the battle, Italy signed the [[Treaty of Addis Ababa]], recognizing Ethiopia as an independent state. Responsibility for the fiasco fell on Baratieri, and he was relieved of his command. The humiliation remained with Italy for almost forty years, until [[1935]], when during the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] Italy commenced a short-lived conquest of Ethiopia. 

The defeat of a colonial power and ensuing recognition of African sovereignty would be rallying points for later African nationalists during the struggle for decolonization.

----
Something that is '''bistable''' can be resting in two states. In physics, for an [[ensemble]] or particles, the bistability comes from the fact that its [[free energy]] has three [[critical point]]s. Two of them are [[minimum|minima]] and the last is a [[maximum]]. By mathematical arguments, the maximum must lie between the two minima. By default, the system state will be in either of the minima states, because that corresponds to the state of lowest energy. The maximum can be visualised as a barrier.

A transition between the state of minimal free energy needs some form of activation energy to penetrate the barrier (compare [[activation energy]] and [[Arrhenius equation]] for the chemical case.) After the barrier has been reached, the system will relax into the next state of lowest energy again. The time it takes is usually attributed the [[relaxation time]]. (There might be uncertainty as to which state will be the new one, but it is often well defined in the situation.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Bjørn Lomborg small.JPG|thumb|Bjørn Lomborg]]

'''Bjørn Lomborg''' (born [[January 6]], [[1965]]) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[political science|political scientist]] and former director of the [[Environmental Assessment Institute]] in [[Copenhagen]]. He is most known for his best-selling [[controversial book]] ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]'', and the allegations of scientific dishonesty that followed it. He is now an adjunct professor at the [[Copenhagen Business School]].

Lomborg is also a [[vegetarian]] (although he is not a supporter of [[animal rights]]), openly [[gay]], and known to wear [[jeans]] to formal business meetings.

According to an interview published in 2005 by the [[Sa0-meter gauge; 25 km double track (1995 est.)

== Airports ==
36 (1999 est.)[[Nouvelle Air Ivoire]] is the national carrier of Côte d'Ivoire. Recently formed from the failed [[Air Ivoire]], the airline operates an aging* fleet of Western built aircraft. The airline is owned by Air France and the U.S. Finance company AIG. Prior to its reformation, the airline was forced to cease operations a number of times due to technical and financial difficulties.

'''Security/Safety Concerns'''  
There is rampant corruption among airport officials in Côte d'Ivoire. Immigration officials have been known to ask for bribes to 'expedite' processing the forms, or to offer to fill out the customs forms prior to demanding a 'fee' for doing so. The anti-French sentiment, peaking in early 2003, spilled over onto airports when 1,500 French nationals were trapped in Abidjan's airport by an anti-French mob.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The 17,000-man Ivorian Armed Forces (FANCI) include an [[army]], [[navy]], [[air force]], and [[gendarmerie]]. The [[Joint Staff]] is assigned to the FANCI Headquarters in [[Abidjan]]. A two-star officer serves as the chief of staff and commander of the FANCI.

'''Military branches:''' Army, Navy, Air Force, paramilitary Gendarmerie, Republican Guard (includes Presidential Guard), Sapeur-Pompier (Military Fire Group)

== Figures ==
'''Military manpower'''
* Military age: 18 years of age
* Availability: ''males age 15-49:'' 3,743,353 (2000 est.)
* Fit for military service: ''males age 15-49:'' 1,952,882 (2000 est.)
* Reaching military age annually: ''males:'' 182,936 (2000 est.)

'''Military expenditures'''
* Dollar figure: $94 million (fiscal year [[1996]])
* Percent of Gross Domestic Product: 1% (fiscal year [[1996]])

== Military regions ==
[[Côte d'Ivoire]] is broken down into five military regions, each commanded by a [[colonel]]:

* The army has the majority of its forces in the First Military Region concentrated in and around Abidjan, its principal units there being a rapid intervention [[battalion]] (airborne), an [[infantry]] battalion, an armored battalion, and an air defense [[artillery]] battalion.
* The Second Military Region is located in [[Daloa]] and is assigned one infantry battalion.
* The Third Military Region is headquartered in [[Bouaké]] and is home to an artillery, an infantry, and an engineer battalion.
* The Fourth Military Region maintains only a Territorial Defense Company headquartered in [[Korhogo]].
* The fifth region is the Western Operational Zone, a temporary command created to respond to the security threat caused by the [[civil war]] in neighboring [[Liberia]].

== Gendarmerie ==
The gendarmerie is roughly equivalent in size to the army. It is a national [[police]] force which is responsible for territorial security, especially in [[rural]] areas. In times of national crisis the gendarmerie could be used to reinforce the army. The gendarmerie is commanded by a [[colonel-major]] and is comprised of four Legions, each corresponding to one of the four numbered military regions, minus the temporary military operational zone on the western border.

== Navy ==
Côte d'Ivoire has a brown-water navy whose mission is [[coast]]al surveillance and security for the nation's 340-mile coastline. It has two fast-attack craft, two patrol crafts, and one light transport ship. It also has numerous smaller vessels used primarily for traffic, [[immigration]], and [[contraband]] control within the [[lagoon]] system.

== Air Force ==
Recent reports suggest that the Ivory Coast no longer has any aircraft remaining in its Air Force. Until recent French attacks which appear to have destroyed all of its aircraft, it was believed to have in its inventory 5 [[Dassault-Breguet/Dornier Alpha Jet|Alpha Jet]]s, 12 transport/utility [[aircraft]], and 2 [[helicopter]]s.

Two jets belonging to the Ivorian Air Force were destroyed by the [[France|French]] military in retaliation for an Ivorian military attack on a French military base on [[November 6]] [[2004]]. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3989127.stm (BBC)]

French forces destroyed a number of aircraft, including three [[Mil Mi-24]] helicopters and two [[Sukhoi Su-25]] ground-attack aircraft.

== International agreements ==
A mutual defense accord signed with [[France]] in [[1961]] provides for the stationing of [[Military of France|French forces]] in Côte d'Ivoire. The 43rd [[French Marines|Marine]] Infantry Battalion is based in [[Port Bouet]] adjacent to the [[Abidjan Airport]] and has more than 500 troops assigned.

== Name ==

''Croatia'' is the [[Latin]]ized version of the native name of the country: '''Hrvatska''' {{Audio|Hrvatska.ogg|listen}}. The letter &quot;r&quot; in the first syllable &quot;hrv&quot; is ''rolled'' or [[continuant]].

However, instead of the Latinized version, many languages use a form more similar to the native one. Various forms are [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Croatia#Translations listed in Wiktionary].

The country code for Croatia is [[HR]] (per [[ISO 3166]]), so Croatian Internet root domain end with [[.hr]]. Croatian alphabet consists of 30 letters (official character set is ''ISO-8859-2'', but Microsoft's ''Windows-1250'' character set is also used very often).

== History ==
''Main article: [[History of Croatia]]''

[[Croats]] came to [[Dalmatia]] and [[Pannonia]] in the [[7th century]]. Ruled by various [[List of rulers of Croatia|Croatian Princes]], [[Dukes]] since [[852]], Dalmatia eventually absorbed Pannonia and after periods of nominal [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] and then [[Frankish]] Imperial rule, Croatia eventually became a strong independent [[Kingdom]] in [[924]]. In [[1102]] the Croatians ended a decades-long dynastic struggle by agreeing to submit themselves to [[Hungary|Hungarian]] Royal authority. 

By the mid-1400s, the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian kingdom]] was gravely hurt by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] expansion as much of the mountainous country now known as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] fell to the Turks. At the same time, [[Dalmatia]] became mostly [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]]. [[Dubrovnik]] was a [[city-state]] that was firstly [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] (Roman) and Venetian, but later, unlike other Dalmatian city-states, it became independent as [[Republic of Dubrovnik]], even if it was often under the [[suzerainty]] of neighboring powers.

The [[Battle of Mohács]] in [[1526]] led the [[Croatian Parliament]] to invite the [[Habsburg]]s to assume control over Croatia. Habsburg rule eventually did prove to be successful in thwarting the Ottomans, and by the 18th century, much of Croatia was free of Turkish control. The odd crescent shape of the Croatian lands remained as a mark, more or less, of the frontier to the Ottoman advance into Europe. [[Istria]], Dalmatia and Dubrovnik all eventually passed to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] between [[1797]] and [[1815]].

[[Image:Hr-map.png|framed|Map of Croatia]]
Following [[World War I]], Croatia joined the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] (comprising what is today, [[Slovenia]], Croatia and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]). Shortly thereafter, this joint state in turn formed a union with [[Serbia]] to form the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (which eventually became [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in [[1929]]). [[Yugoslavia]] was invaded during [[World War II]] and Croatia was turned into a [[fascist]] puppet-state named [[Independent State of Croatia]]. When the Axis powers were defeated, Yugoslavia became a federal [[communist state|socialist state]].

Along with Slovenia, Croatia declared her independence from [[Yugoslavia]] on [[June 25]], [[1991]], which triggered the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. Belgrade rejected the new country and the ensuing months saw combat between various Croatian armed forces and the Belgrade-based [[YNA]] (Yugoslav National Army). In early 1992, Germany recognised Croatia, with many other influential countries following suit; finally the remainder of Yugoslavia was compelled to recognise the newly independent states, and as such, the Yugoslav security forces withdrew.

A [[Serb]] poplation living in some areas of Croatia then revolted and proclaimed their own state - [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]]. They were supported by the [[JNA|Yugoslav army]]. In [[1995]], the Croatian Army successfully launched two major offensives to retake the rebel areas by force, leading to a mass exodus of the Serbian population. A few months later, as a result, the war ended upon the negotiation of the [[Dayton Agreement]]. A peaceful integration of the remaining Serbian-controlled territories was completed in [[1998]] under [[UN]] supervision.

Croatia is currently in the process of joining the [[European Union]], accession negotiations started in December 2005.

Croatia is situated between central, southern, and eastern Europe. It has a rather peculiar shape that resembles a crescent or a horseshoe which helps account for its many neighbours: [[Slovenia]], [[Hungary]], the [[Serbia]]n part of [[Serbia and Montenegro]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] part of Serbia and Montenegro, and [[Italy]] across the Adriatic (disputed, see [[Foreign_relations_of_Croatia#Slovenia|Slovenia-Croatia border dispute]]). Its mainland territory is split in two non-contiguous parts by the short coastline of Bosnia and Herzegovina around [[Neum]].

Its terrain is diverse, containing:
* plains, lakes and rolling hills in the continental north and northeast (Central Croatia and [[Slavonia]], part of the [[Pannonian plain]]);
* densely wooded mountains in [[Lika]] and Gorski Kotar, part of the [[Dinaric Alps]];
* rocky coastlines on the [[Adriatic Sea]] ([[Istria]], Northern Seacoast and [[Dalmatia]]).

The country is famous for it's many beautiful [[List of national parks of Croatia|national parks]].


Croatia has a mixture of [[climate]]s. In the north and east it is continental, Mediterranean along the coast and a semi-highland and highland climate in the south-central region.

== Politics ==
===Political system===
''Main article: [[Politics of Croatia]]''

The [[Presidents of Croatia|President of the Republic]] (''Predsjednik'') is [[head of state]] and elected for a five-year term, and the Prime Minister is Head of Government. In addition to being the [[commander in chief]] of the armed forces, the president has the procedural duty of appointing the Prime minister with the consent of the Parliament, and has some influence on foreign policy.

The [[Croatian Parliament]] (''Sabor'') is a [[unicameral]] legislative body of not less then 100 and not more then 160 representatives, all elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. The plenary sessions of the Sabor take place from January 15 to July 15, and from September 15 to December 15.

The [[Croatian Government]] (''Vlada'') is headed by the [[Prime ministers of Croatia|Prime minister]] who has 2 deputy prime ministers and 14 ministers in charge of particular sectors of activity. The executive branch is responsible for proposing legislation and a budget, executing the laws, and guiding the foreign and internal policies of the republic.

Croatia has a three-tiered judicial system, consisting of the [[Croatian Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], county courts, and municipal courts. The [[Croatian Constitutional Court|Constitutional Court]] rules on matters regarding the [[Constitution of Croatia|Constitution]].

== Economy ==
''Main article: [[Economy of Croatia]]''
[[Image:Sibenik_(Croatia)_Cathedral_of_St_Jacob.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cathedral of St. Jakob in [[Šibenik]]]]

Croatia has an economy based mostly on various [[Tertiary sector of industry|services]] and some, mostly light [[Secondary sector of industry|industry]]. [[Tourism]] is a notable source of income.
The estimated [[Gross Domestic Product]] per capita in [[purchasing power parity]] terms for 2004 was USD 11,200 or 41.6% of the [[European Union|EU]] average for the same year.

The Croatian economy is [[Post-Communism|post-communist]]. In the late 1980s, at the beginning of the process of economic [[transition]], its position was favourable, but it was gravely impacted by de-industrialization and war damages.

Main problems include massive structural [[unemployment]] followed by an insufficient amount of economic reforms. Of particular concern is the gravely backlogged [[judiciary]] system combined with inefficient [[public administration]], especially involving land ownership.

The country has since experienced faster [[economic growth]] and has been preparing for membership in the European Union, its most important [[international trade|trading partner]].

In February 2005, Croatia implemented the [[Stabilization and Association Agreement]] with the [[EU]] and is advancing further towards full EU membership. The country expects some major economic impulses and high growth rates in the following next years (currently Croatia suffers most from its high export deficit and considerable debt). Some big trading companies have already taken advantage of the liberalization of the Croatian market. Croatia is expecting a boom in investments, especially [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] investments.

== Demographics ==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Croatia]]''

[[Image:Costume from Konavle near Dubrovnik, Croatia.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Girl wearing costume from [[Konavle]] near [[Dubrovnik]]]]
The population of Croatia has been stagnating over the last decade. The 1991-1995 war in Croatia had previously displaced large parts of the population and increased emigration. The natural growth rate is minute or negative (less than +/- 1%), as the [[demographic transition]] has been completed half a century ago. Average life expectancy is approximately 75 years, and the literacy rate is 98.5%.

Croatia is inhabited mostly by [[Croats]] (89.6%). There are around twenty minorities, [[Serbs]] being the biggest one (4.5%), others having less than 0.5% each. The predominate religion is [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] (87.8%), with some [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] (4.4%) and [[Sunni Muslim]] (1.3%) minorities.

The official and common language, [[Croatian language|Croatian]], is a South [[Slavic language]], using the [[Latin alphabet]]. Less than 5% of the population cites other language as their mother tongues.

== Culture ==
''Main article: [[Culture of Croatia]]''

[[Image:Zadar - église Saint-Donat.jpg|thumb|right|170px|St. Donatus' Church - the monumental building in the pre Romanesque style from 9th century [[Zadar]]]]
Croatian culture is based on a [[Culture of Croatia#History|thirteen century long history]] during which the country has attained many monuments and cities, which gave birth to a good number of [[Culture of Croatia#People|brilliant individuals]]. The country includes [[Culture of Croatia#Places|six World Heritage sites and eight national parks]]. Two [[Nobel prize]] winners came from Croatia, as did numerous important inventors and [[List of Croatians|other notable people]] — notably, some of the first [[fountain pen]]s came from Croatia. 

Croatia also has a place in the history of clothing as the origin of the [[necktie]] (''cravat''). The country has a long [[Culture of Croatia#Arts and literature|artistic, literary]] and [[Music of Croatia|musical tradition]]. Of particular interest is also the diverse [[Croatian cuisine|cuisine]].

* [[BMP-3]]

[[Image:ARMY_PICS_BMP3.jpg|left|thumb|Cypriot BMP-33]] [[Image:dug-in BMP3.jpg|thumb|right|BMP-3 in cover position during Nikiforos Training Exercise]]

The BMP-3 has been around for over four decades, and has gone through three major variations, the -1, -2 and -3 variants. The latest variant is the BMP-3, which has both troop transport capability, as well as anti-tank and as well as anti-personnel capability. It is also fully amphibious. 10 fully armed soldiers can be transported in this armored infantry vehicle.

The BMP-3 program aims to increase the ability of the Cyprus National Guard to be rapidly mobile in response to the needs of battle. The crew of the BMP-3 includes one driver, and a gunner.

* [[Leonidas]] (APC Designed and Manufactured in Greece)

[[Image:ARMY_PICS_LEONIDAS.jpg|thumb|left|Cypriot Leonidas AIFV]]

Developed by a consortium that includes [[Daimler Steyr]] and the [[Hellenic Defence Industry]] (EBO), the &quot;Leonidas&quot; armored infantry fighting vehicle, or AIFV, is the backbone of both the [[Greek Army]] and the Cypriot National Guard. The &quot;Leonidas&quot; can carry 12 fully armed soldiers into battle.

The &quot;Leonidas&quot; is also the progenitor of the &quot;[[Kentauros]]&quot; next generation AIFV that Greece is developing, hoping to capture an export market. &quot;Kentauros&quot; is meant to match the capabilities of the American Bradley AIFV which has seen use in both the first and second Persian [[Gulf war]].

The &quot;Leonidas&quot; has a crew of two.

* [[VAP]]('''Type: VAB VCI''')

[[Image:ARMY_PICS_VAB-VCI.jpg|thumb|left|Cypriot VAB-VCI type]]

The French firm [[GIAT]] thought of putting a 30mm anti-infantry gun on top of a VAB troop transport, and the Cyprus National Guard liked that idea and inducted the VAB VCI Variant into its ranks. As a reconnaissance vehicle, the VAB VCI allows for rapid entrance and exit to the field of battle, and the ability with its 30mm gun to do severe damage to soft targets like radar emplacements and low flying objects like helicopters.

The Cyprus National Guard retains high degrees of war-time information gathering capabilities by having weapons like the VAB VCI on hand. The VAB VCI can also transport 8 fully armed me into battle in addition to a driver, a navigator and a gun operator.

* [[VAP]] ('''Type: VAB NG''')

[[Image:ARMY_PICS_VAB NG.jpg|thumb|left|Cypriot VAB NG Type]]

The VAB NG has about 1400 improvements from the original model, and the Cyprus National Guard is in the process of making the transition to the NG standard. The VAB NG can carry up to 12 armed soldiers into battle, including a driver and a navigator. The VAB is a product of the French firm GIAT, and is a completely amphibious vehicle, with all terrain capability.

The Cyprus National Guard uses the VAB as a robust troop transporting workhorse, usually in conjunction with the need to pull large transport dollies for water, fuel and ammunition. In this capacity the VAB resembles more a donkey on wheels.

== Mobile Anti-Tank Weapons ==
* '''VAB with''' [[MILAN-3]] '''AT Missile'''

[[Image:ARMY_PICS_VAB-MILAN.jpg|thumb|left|Fully Loaded VAB with 4 MILAN Tubes]]

In the mid-[[1990s]], France's GIAT announced it had developed a new variant of the MILAN anti-tank missile. The variant, known as MILAN-3 was capable of out smarting anti-missile defences, and was capable of destroying armored targets with reactive armor, the latest defence against anti-tank missiles at that time.

GIAT placed the MILAN-3 on top of their already popular VAB troop carrier, and the Cyprus National Guard inducted this lethal defensive weapon into its arsenal. To date only [[Cyprus]], [[France]] and two other countries utilize the VAB MILAN-3 platform.

The VAB Milan-3 can carry 8 troops into battle, with an additional crew of three to drive, navigate and fire the main weapon (MILAN-3)

*  '''EE-3 Jararaca with MILAN-3 AT Missile'''

[[Image:ARMY_PICS_Jararaca.jpg|thumb|left|Cypriot Jararaca with one MILAN-3 AT Missile]]

Remember earlier when we mentioned the VAB+MILAN-3 combination and how lethal it can be... now imagine placing that kind of firepower on a vehicle with increased fuel efficiency, endurance and speed... what you get is the Jararaca Anti-Tank variant with MILAN-3 launcher.

Each vehicle has a crew of two only, one driver, one gunner. Each vehicle can carry up to 7 (one already loaded, six in the cabin) MILAN-3 missiles. The Cyprus National Guard uses this vehicle as a scout to search and destroy enemy armor.

== Airforce ==
The Republic of Cyprus has no airforce in terms of fighter and bomber airplanes. It mainly consists of Helicopters (both Transport Helicopters and Attack Helicopters), radar systems and major anti-aircraft systems. In terms of Airplanes, two photo-reconnaissance planes are operated, however one of them was lost in a training accident in September 2005 with both pilots dead. 
The most tragic accident however occurred on the [[10th July]] [[2002]], when a transport helicopter crashed, killing all five passengers. Within the passengers was the Commander of the National Guard, Lieutenant General Evangelos Florakis. The other four were the Commander of Cypriot Air Force Brigadier Stelios Demenegas, Lieutenant Nikos Georgiou and the two helicopter pilots, Flight Lieutenant Paris Athanasiades and Flank Officer Michalis Shiakallis. 

* '''Gazelle Helicopter With HOT AT Missile'''

[[Image:ARMY_PICS_GAZELLE.jpg|thumb|left|Cypriot Gazelle Helicopter in Helipad]]

In the late 1980's Cyprus purchased these scout helicopters from France with the purpose of using them for advanced scout missions for search and destroy scenarios. Each Gazelle can carry four HOT missiles into battle.

The HOT missile platform is an older anti-tank missile platform, but it serves the purpose of giving the Cyprus National Guard an air scouting ability with increased lethality.

* [[Mi-24|Mil Mi-35]]

[[Image:ARMY_PICS_MI-25.jpg|thumb|left|Mi-35 with Armament]] [[Image:Cypriot Mil-35 firing.jpg|thumb|right|Cypriot Mi-35 firing AT Missiles during training]]

The Mil Mi-35 is the export version of the [[Mi-24]] attack transport helicopter. Designed originally as a platform for both troop transport and anti-tank operations, the Mi-35 has evolved into a lethal anti-tank platform using the [[ATAKA]] anti-tank missile system. The Mi-35 can carry up to 8 ATAKA missiles into battle, including two salvos of anti-personnel rockets and a powerful 30mm machine gun. The Mi-35 can carry in addition eight fully armed troops (air cavalry or commandos) and a crew of two.

*PC-9A Pilatus Aircraft

[[Image:Pc9 in flight.jpg|thumb|left|A PC-9/A during a training flight, in Cypriot colouring]]

The PC-9/A is a two-seat single engine turboprop aircraft and is the major basic training aircraft for the Australian Defence Force (ADF).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Cyprus}}
[[Cyprus]] has historically followed a non-aligned foreign policy, although it increasingly identifies with the West in its cultural affinities and trade patterns, and maintains close relations with [[Greece]]. 

The prime originator of Cypriot non-alignment was [[Makarios III]], the first [[Presidents of Cyprus|President]] ([[1960]]-[[1977|77]]) of the independent republic of Cyprus. Prior to independence, Makarios - by virtue of his post as [[List of Archbishops of Cyprus|Archbishop of Cyprus]] and head of the [[Cypriot Orthodox Church]] - was the Greek Cypriot Ethnarch, or [[de facto]] leader of the community. A highly influential figure well before independence, he participated in the 1955 [[Bandung Conference]]. After independence, Makarios took part in the 1961 founding meeting of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in [[Belgrade]].

Reasons for this neutrality may lie in the extreme pressures exerted on the infant Republic by its larger neighbours, Turkey and Greece. [[Cyprus dispute | Intercommunal rivalries]] and movements for [[Enosis | union with Greece]] or partial union with Turkey may have persuaded Makarios to steer clear of close affiliation with either side. In any case Cyprus became a high-profile member of the Non-Aligned Movement and retained its membership until its entry into the [[European Union]] in [[2004]].

Immediately after the [[1974]] Greek-sponsored [[coup d'etat]] and the [[Turkish Invasion of Cyprus|Turkish invasion]], Makarios secured international recognition of his administration as the legitimate government of the whole island. This was disputed only by [[Turkey]], which currently recognises only the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]], established in [[1983]]. 

Since the 1974 crisis, the chief aim of the foreign policy of the Republic of Cyprus has been to secure the withdrawal of Turkish forces and the reunification of the island under the most favourable constitutional and territorial settlement possible. This campaign has been pursued primarily through international forums such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], and in recent years through the European Union.

Cyprus' [[1990]] application for full [[European Union|EU]] membership caused a storm in the Turkish Cypriot community, which argued that the move required their consent. Following the December [[1997]] EU Summit decisions on [[EU enlargement]], accession negotiations began [[31 March]] [[1998]]. Cyprus joined the European Union on [[1 May]] [[2004]]. To fulfil its commitment as a member of the European Union, Cyprus finally withdrew from the Non-Aligned Movement on accession.

The Government of Cyprus enjoys close relations with Greece. Cyprus is expanding relations with [[Russia]], [[Israel]], and [[Syria]], from which it purchases most of its oil.

Cyprus is a member of the [[United Nations]] and most of its agencies as well as the [[World Bank]], [[International Monetary Fund]], [[Council of Europe]], and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. In addition, the country has signed the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) and the [[Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Agreement]] (MIGA). 

'''Disputes - international:'''
The 1974 invasion of the Turkish army divided the island into two [[de facto]] autonomous areas, a Greek Cypriot area controlled by the internationally recognised Cypriot Government (59% of the island's land area) and a [[TRNC|Turkish-Cypriot area]] (37% of the island) which declared [[Declaration of Independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|UDI]] in [[1983]], that are separated by a [[United Nations]] [[UN Buffer Zone on Cyprus|buffer zone]] (4% of the island); there are two [[Sovereign Base Areas|UK sovereign base areas]] mostly within the Greek Cypriot portion of the island.

'''Illicit drugs:'''
Cyprus is a minor transit point for [[heroin]] and [[hashish]] via air routes and container traffic to [[Europe]], especially from [[Lebanon]] and [[Turkey]]; some [[cocaine]] transits as well

:''This article considers Catholicism in the broadest ecclesiastical sense. See [[Catholicism (disambiguation)]] for alternative meanings''

'''''Catholicism''''' has two main [[ecclesiastical]] meanings, described in [[Webster's Dictionary]] as: a) &quot;the whole orthodox Christian church, or adherence thereto&quot;; and b) &quot;the doctrines or faith of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic church]], or adherence thereto.&quot; [[#Footnotes|&lt;font size=-2&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]]

The term ''Catholicism'', derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] adjective &amp;#954;&amp;#945;&amp;#952;&amp;#959;&amp;#955;&amp;#953;&amp;#954;&amp;#972;&amp;#962; (katholikos), meaning &quot;general&quot; or &quot;universal&quot;, is widely understood to refer to the Church, governed by the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]] and the bishops in [[Communion (Christianity)|communion]] with him. However, other Churches that trace their historic episcopate to the apostolic succession &amp;mdash; such as the [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches, the [[Eastern Orthodox]] Churches, the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], the Churches of the [[Anglican Communion]], and the [[Old Catholic Church|Old-Catholics]] &amp;mdash; consider themselves to be branches of the Catholic Church. [[Neo-Lutheranism]] argues that Lutheran Churches are simply a Protestant reform movement that remains within the greater Church catholic.

==The term &quot;Catholic Church&quot;==
A letter that, in about [[107]], [[Ignatius of Antioch|Saint Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch]] wrote to Christians in Smyrna, is the earliest surviving witness to the use of the term &quot;catholic Church&quot; (Smyrnaeans, 8).[http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-01/anf01-21.htm#P2233_373220] By it Saint Ignatius designated the Christian Church in its universal aspect, excluding [[heresy|heretics]], such as those who disavow &quot;the Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again&quot; (Smyrnaeans, 7).[http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-01/anf01-21.htm#P2216_370671] He called such people &quot;beasts in the shape of men, whom you must not only not receive, but, if it be possible, not even meet with&quot; (Smyrnaeans, 4).[http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-01/anf01-21.htm#P2179_364822]

Yet more explicit was the manner in which Saint Cyril of Jerusalem (circa [[315]]-[[386]]) used the term &quot;catholic Church&quot; precisely to distinguish this Church from heretical &quot;Churches&quot;. He urged: &quot;If ever thou art sojourning in cities, inquire not simply where the Lord's House is (for the other sects of the profane also attempt to call their own dens houses of the Lord), nor merely where the Church is, but where is the Catholic Church. For this is the peculiar name of this Holy Church, the mother of us all, which is the spouse of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Only-begotten Son of God&quot; (Catechetical Lectures, XVIII, 26).[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/310118.htm]

Only slightly later, when Christians still applied the word &quot;priest&quot; only to [[bishop]]s and not yet to those who are now called &quot;priests&quot; in English, Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354-430) wrote:
:&quot;In the Catholic Church, there are many other things which most justly keep me in her bosom. The consent of peoples and nations keeps me in the Church; so does her authority, inaugurated by miracles, nourished by hope, enlarged by love, established by age. The succession of priests keeps me, beginning from the very seat of the [[Apostle Peter]], to whom the Lord, after His resurrection, gave it in charge to feed His sheep (Jn 21:15-19), down to the present episcopate.
:&quot;And so, lastly, does the very name of Catholic, which, not without reason, amid so many heresies, the Church has thus retained; so that, though all heretics wish to be called Catholics, yet when a stranger asks where the Catholic Church meets, no heretic will venture to point to his own chapel or house.
:&quot;Such then in number and importance are the precious ties belonging to the Christian name which keep a believer in the Catholic Church, as it is right they should ... With you, where there is none of these things to attract or keep me... No one shall move me from the faith which binds my mind with ties so many and so strong to the Christian religion... For my part, I should not believe the gospel except as moved by the authority of the Catholic Church.&quot; 
: &amp;mdash; St. Augustine (354&amp;ndash;430): &lt;i&gt;Against the Epistle of Manichaeus called Fundamental&lt;/i&gt;, chapter 4: Proofs of the Catholic Faith[http://www.ccel.org/pager.cgi?&amp;file=fathers/NPNF1-04/augustine/bk_fundamental/bk1.html&amp;from=CHAP4&amp;up=]

A contemporary of Augustine, [[St. Vincent of Lerins]], wrote in 434 under the pseudonym Peregrinus a work known as the ''Commonitoria'' (&quot;Memoranda&quot;). While insisting that, like the human body, Church doctrine develops while truly keeping its identity (sections 54-59, chapter XXIII), he stated: &quot;[I]n the Catholic Church itself, all possible care must be taken, that we hold that faith which has been believed everywhere, always, by all. For that is truly and in the strictest sense 'Catholic,' which, as the name itself and the reason of the thing declare, comprehends all universally. This rule we shall observe if we follow universality, antiquity, consent. We shall follow universality if we confess that one faith to be true, which the whole Church throughout the world confesses; antiquity, if we in no wise depart from those interpretations which it is manifest were notoriously held by our holy ancestors and fathers; consent, in like manner, if in antiquity itself we adhere to the consentient definitions and determinations of all, or at the least of almost all priests and doctors&quot; (section 6, end of chapter II).

==Divergent interpretations of the term &quot;Catholic Church&quot;==

Many Christians (and [[Christian denominations|denominations]]) see themselves as &quot;catholic&quot;. They fall into two groups:

::1) those like the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], and [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] Churches having [[Apostolic Succession]] from the early Church; and 
::2) those who claim to be spiritual descendants of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] but have no discernable institutional descent from the historic Church, and normally do not refer to themselves as catholic.

Of those in the first category, some see their Church as ''the'' Catholic Church, others see their Church as only ''part of'' the Catholic Church.

For Protestants, most of whom consider themselves to be spiritual descendants (category 2, above), this affirmation refers to their belief in the ultimate unity of all Churches under one [[God]] and one [[Salvation#Christian views of salvation#Roman Catholicism|Saviour]], rather than in one visibly unified institutional Church (category 1, above). In this usage ''catholic'' is sometimes written with a lower-case &quot;c&quot;. The Western [[Apostles' Creed]], stating &quot;I believe in...the holy catholic church...&quot; (sometimes capitalised), is thus recited in [[Protestant]] worship services (with the notable exception of German Lutherans, who substitute &quot;Christian&qun Stuart Mill]]

'''Conscription''' is a general term for involuntary labor demanded by some established authority, but it is most often used in the specific sense of government policies that require (very often, male only) citizens to serve in their [[military|armed forces]]. It is known by various names &amp;mdash; for example, the most recent conscription program in the [[United States]] was known colloquially as &quot;'''[[Conscription in the United States|the draft]]'''&quot;. Many nations do not ''maintain'' conscription forces, instead relying on a volunteer or professional military most of the time, although many of these countries still reserve the possibility of conscription for wartime and &quot;crises&quot; of supply.

(Historically, &quot;conscription&quot; has also sometimes been used as a general term for non-military [[Involuntary servitude|involuntary labour]] demanded by some established authority; for example, [[Old Testament]] commentaries use the term to describe the levies of labour used to build the Temple.)

In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and elsewhere the term ''conscription'' is generally used only during wartime.  [[National Service]] was the term used during peace-time in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Singapore]]. In [[New Zealand]] the term [[Compulsory Military Training (in New Zealand)| Compulsory Military Training]] was used.   In Japan during [[World War II]], Japanese women and children were conscripted to work in factories.

The term &quot;conscription&quot;  refers only to the mandatory service; thus, those undergoing conscription are known as &quot;conscripts&quot;  or &quot;selectee&quot; in the United States (from the [[Selective Service System]] or the [[Selective Service Initiative]] announced in [[2004]]).

In the [[USA]] the term &quot;enlisted&quot; is often used to refer only to those who have volunteered for service in roles other than as [[commissioned officers]].

Modern conscription was invented during the [[French Revolution]], allowing the [[French Republic|Republic]] to defend itself from European monarchies' attacks. Deputy [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]] gave its name to the [[September 5]], [[1798]] Act, whose first article stated: &quot;Any French is a soldier and owes himself to the defense of the [[patriotism|nation]]&quot;. It enabled the creation of the ''[[Grande Armée]]'', what [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] called &quot;the nation in arms&quot;, which successfully battled European professional armies.

According to philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], conscription is one of the forms taken by &quot;disciplinary institutions&quot;, along with hospitals, schools and prisons. [[Louis Althusser]] has also underlined how [[Machiavelli]] was one of the first modern theorists to think the relationship between conscription and the creation of a nation, or successfully bolstering [[patriotism]]. Machiavelli despised the use of [[mercenaries]] and professional armies, which at this time were ravaging the divided Italian states.

===Disputes over conscription (WW I, Vietnam War, etc.)===
Conscription, particularly when the conscripts are being sent to foreign wars that do not directly affect the security of the nation, has historically been highly politically contentious in democracies.  For instance, during [[World War I]], bitter political disputes broke out in [[Canada]] (see [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]]), [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]],  [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] (See [[Compulsory Military Training (in New Zealand)| Compulsory Military Training]]) over conscription. Canada also had a political dispute over conscription during [[World War II]] (see [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]]). Similarly, mass protests against conscription to fight the [[Vietnam War]] occurred in several countries in the late [[1960s]]. (See also: [[Conscription Crisis]])

In developed nations, the increasing emphasis on technological firepower and better-trained fighting forces, the sheer unlikelihood of a conventional military assault on most developed nations, as well as memories of the contentiousness of the Vietnam War experience, make mass conscription unlikely in the foreseeable future.

[[Russia]] and [[China]], as well as many smaller nations, retain mainly conscript armies.

==The gender-issue==
Some countries which draft women include the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Taiwan]] (ROC), [[North Korea]], [[Peru]], [[Malaysia]], [[Libya]], [[Israel]], and [[Eritrea]]. In [[2002]], [[Sweden]]'s government asked the army to consider mandatory military service for women. Some have considered the practice of excluding women from the draft unfair, because they feel it goes against principles of [[social equality|equality]]. Some simply argue that women can be militarily useful, and that excluding them places an unnecessary limit on resources. During World War II, women were drafted into the armed forces of the United Kingdom and the [[Soviet Union]]. The [[United States]] came close to drafting women into the [[Nurse Corps]] in preparation for a planned invasion of [[Japan]]; the Japanese surrender made this unnecessary.

The non-[[egalitarian]] policy practiced by some countries of drafting men and not women has often been a flash point and source of conflict. This policy is often cited by some [[masculism|masculists]] as an example of an unfair policy which benefits women over men.  Most avowed anti-feminists are strongly opposed to women in combat.{{fact}} Apprehension about the possible conscription of women was a key factor that led to the defeat of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] in the United States.

Conscription certainly imposes on the freedom of the individual and although some conscripts feel that they benefited from the experience others feel that their time could have been spent more productively pursuing their chosen studies or career paths [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1682777.stm See BBC news article on the end of French conscription] Individual resentment may also be compounded by the typically low wages paid to conscripts, especially in countries such as [[Greece]]. [[Feminists]] and others calling for more equal treatment of women in society have rarely extended their demands to include a call for equality for women with regards the draft.

The topic of male-only conscription in the UK was the focus of a large number of books, plays and other literature, most of which portrayed the writers experience of conscription in a very negative way, emphasizing the brutality and tedium of military training. Examples include [[Arnold Wesker]]'s ''Chips with Everything'' and ''Ginger You're barmy'' by [[David Lodge]]. In his book, Lodge suggests that the practice of male-only conscription helped to generate sexist attitudes by making it difficult for men to regard those who were excused the rigors of military training as their equals.

==Conscientious objection==
{{main articles|[[Conscientious objection]], [[Antimilitarism]], and [[Conscientious objection throughout the world]]}}
''&quot;It is debasing human dignity to force men to give up their life, or to inflict death against their will, or without conviction as to the justice of their action.&quot;'' -- Albert Einstein, Mahatma Gandhi, et al, in the &quot;Manifesto Against Conscription and the Military System&quot;

A [[conscientious objector]] is an individual whose personal beliefs are incompatible with [[military service]], or sometimes with any role in the armed forces. In some countries, conscientious objectors have special legal status which augments their conscription duties. For example, [[Sweden]] allows conscientious objectors to choose a service in the &quot;weapons-free&quot; branch,  such as an airport [[fireman]], [[nurse]] or [[telecommunications]] technician. Some may also refuse such service as they feel that they still are a part of the military complex. The reasons for refusing to serve are varied. Many conscientious objectors are so for religious reasons&amp;mdash;notably, the members of the [[Peace churches|historic peace churches]] are [[pacifism|pacifist]] by doctrine, and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], while not strictly speaking pacifists, refuse to participate in the armed services on the grounds that they believe [[Christianity|Christian]]s should be neutral in worldly conflicts.

==Draft evaders==
Not everyone who was conscripted was willing to go to war. Many young people used their family's political connections to ensure that they were placed well away from any potential harm.  They would avoid military service altogether through college deferments.  Others with political influence often joined the military and served in what was termed a [[Champagne unit]].  Others used educational exemptions, became conscientious objectors or pretended to be conscientious objectors.  For others, the most common method of avoiding the draft was to cross the border into another country. People who have been &quot;called up&quot; for military service and who attempted to avoid it in some way, were known as &quot;[[draft-dodger]]s&quot;. U.S. draft-dodgers made their way to [[Canada]] or [[Mexico]]. [[Australia]]n draft-dodgers had greater difficulty leaving their country due to the surrounding ocean.

Many people looked upon draft-dodgers with scorn as being &quot;cowards&quot;, but some supported them in their efforts.

==Draft resisters==
{{main|Antimilitarism}}

The [[Vietnam War]] saw new levels of opposition to conscription and [[National Service]]. Many people opposed to and facing conscription, chose to either plead conscientious objection or to evade the draft by fleeing to a neutral country. A small proportion, like [[Muhammad Ali]], chose to publicly and politically fight conscription. In Australia this was known as the Draft Resistance Movement.

==Countries with mandatory military service (partial list)==

A number of countries have '''mandatory military service''':

===Austria===
[[Austria]] has mandatory military service for fit male citizens from eighteen to thirty five years of age. Service lasts for eight months but will be shortened to six months in 2006. Conscientious objectors join the civilian service (''Zivildienst'') for twelve months (reduction to nine months in 2006).Very likely Austria will get an all-volunteer army in 2009.

===Belarus===
[[Belarus]] has mandatory military service for all fit men from eighteen to twenty seven years of age. Military service lasts for eighteen months for those without higher education, and for twelve months for those with higher education.

===Bermuda===
[[Bermuda]], although a dependant territory of the [[United Kingdom]], still maintains conscription for its local force.  Males between the age of eighteen and thirty two are drawn by lottery to serve in [[The Bermuda Regiment]] for a period of thirty eight months.  The commitment is only on a part time basis, however.  Anyone who objects to this has the right to have their case heard by an exemption tribunal.

===Brazil===
Males in [[Brazil]] are required to serve 12 months of military service upon their 18th birthday. Most often, the service is performed in military bases as close as possible to the person's home. The government does not require those planning to attend college or holding a permanent job to serve. There are also several other exceptions, including health reasons, for which one may not have to serve.

===Bulgaria===
[[Bulgaria]] has mandatory military service for male citizens from eighteen to twenty seven years of age. Currently (2004) the duration of the service depends on the degree of education. For citizens studying for or holding a bachelor degree or higher the service is six months, and for citizens with no higher education it is nine months. During the last ten years the duration of service has rapidly dropped (from two years in [[1994]]) and as Bulgaria adopts a professional army mandatory service is expected to be replaced with voluntary service.

===Chile===
[[Chile]] has mandatory military service for all citizens between eighteen and forty five. The duration of service is twelve months for the army and twenty four months for Navy and Air Force.

===China (PRC)===
Theoretically the [[People's Republic of China]] has conscription for both men and women. Women who are conscripted go into the army for two months and learn to use firearms. In practice, military service with the PLA is voluntary; all 18-year-old males have to register themselves with the government authorities, in a way similar to the [[Selective Service System]] of the United States. The main exception to this system applies to potential university students, who are required to undergo military training before their courses commence. An exception is also made for [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], whose residents are exempted from conscription as they are effectively barred from any military service.

===Croatia===
[[Croatia]]n law prescribes military service for male citizens from eighteen to twenty seven years old. The duration of the normal military service is six months ([[as of 2004]]), while conscientious objectors can apply for civil service which lasts for eight months. Conscription is regularly postponed for students until the end of their studies, as long as they apply before they turn twenty eight years of age.

Over the last decade or so, the duration of military service has been halved and civil service was introduced together with the streamlining of the professional army. Should this trend continue, the mandatory service may eventually be completely replaced with voluntary service.

===Cyprus===
[[Cyprus]] has compulsory military service for all Greek Cypriot men between the ages of eighteen and fifty. Military service lasts for twenty five months. After that, ex-soldiers are considered reservists and participate in military exercises for a few days every year. Conscientious objectors can either do thirty three months unarmed service in the army or thirty eight months community work. See official pages by the [http://www.army.gov.cy/index.php?id=76 Greek Cypriot National Guard].
In North Cyprus there is compulsory military service for Turkish Cypriots. The [[Annan Plan for Cyprus]] that was rejected in the [[Cyprus reunification referendum, 2004|2004 reunification referendum]] mandated the demilitarisation of the island and the disbanding of both Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot forces.

===Denmark===
As described in the [http://www.folketinget.dk/pdf/constitution.pdf Constitution of Denmark], § eighty one, [[Denmark]] has mandatory service for all able men. Normal service is four months, and is normally served by men in the age of eighteen to twenty seven. Some special services will take longer. Danish men will typically receive a letter around the time of their 18th birthday, asking when their current education (if any) ends, and some time later, depending on when, they will receive a notice on when to attend to the draft office to be tested physically and psychologically. However some may be deemed unfit for service and not be required to show up.

Even if a person is deemed fit, or partially fit for service, he may avoid having to serve if he draws a high enough number randomly. Persons who are deemed partly fit for service will however be placed lower than those who are deemed fit for service, and therefore have a very low chance of being drafted. Men deemed fit can be called upon for service until their 50th birthday in case of national crisis, regardless of whether normal conscription has been served. This right is very rarely exercised by Danish authorities.

[[Conscientious objector]]s can choose to instead serve six months in a non-military position, for example in [[Redningsberedskabet]] (dealing with non-military disasters like fires, flood, pollution, etc.) or foreign aid work in a third world country. [http://danmark.dk/portal/page?_pageid=34,328944&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL].

===Egypt===
[[Egypt]] has a mandatory military service program for males between the ages of eighteen and thirty. Females of comparable age serve in a civilian program. Conscription is regularly postponed for students until the end of their studies, as long as they apply before they turn twenty eight years of age. By the age of thirty a male is considered unfit to join the army and pays a fine. Males with no brothers, or those supporting parents are exempted from the service. Males serve for a period ranging from fourteen months to forty eight months depending on their education; high school dropouts serve for forty eight months during which they finish their high-school education. College graduates serve for lesser periods of time, depending on their education, and college graduates with special skills are still conscripted yet at a different rank and with a different pay scale with the option of remaining with the service as a career.  Some Egyptians evade conscription and travel overseas until they reach the age of thirty, at which point they are tried, pay a $580 fine (as of 2004), and are dishonorably relieved of their obligation to serve in the army. Such an offense, legally considered an offense of &quot;bad moral character&quot;, prevents the &quot;unpatriotic&quot; citizen from ever holding public office.
&lt;!--
maybe unpatriotic is a poor choice of words but this is how they describe it
--&gt;

===Eritrea===
[[Eritrea]] has a mandatory military service program for both men and women aged eighteen through forty. The term of service is eighteen months. There is no alternate service. The Eritrean government is well-known for hunting down and torturing suspected draft evaders.  Draft evaders often flee the country to nearby countries.

===Finland===
As of 2004, [[Finland]] has mandatory military service for men of at least six months (180 days), depending on the assigned position: those trained as officers or NCOs serve for twelve months (362 days), specialist troops serve for nine (270 days) or twelve months, and other rank and file serve for six months. Unarmed service is also possible, and lasts eleven months (330 days). Since [[1995]], women have been given the option of voluntary military service. During the first fifty six days, women have an option to quit the service without having to provide a reason. After serving for fifty six days, they fall under the same obligation to serve as men.

[[Non-military service]] of thirteen months (395 days) is available for men whose conscience prevents them from serving in the military. Men who refuse to serve at all are sent to prison for 6.5 months (197 days) or half the time of their remaining non-military service at time of refusal. In theory, male citizens from the demilitarized [[Åland]] region have to serve in [[customs office]]s or [[lighthouse]]s, but since this service has not been arranged, they are always exempted. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]' service is postponed every two years until they, at the age of twenty eight, are exempted.

Military service has been mandatory for men throughout the history of independent Finland since [[1917]]. Soldiers and civil servicemen receive a daily salary of 3.60 [[Euro|€]] (days 1-180), 5.75 € (days 181-270) and 8.25 € (onward from day 271).

After the training part of the service is done, the soldier enters the reserve. The reservists can be called to mandatory refresher exercises. Rank and file serves forty days maximum, specialists seventy five days and officers one hundred days. For this, a salary of about fifty euro per day is paid. The service is mandatory; it is not possible to refuse an order to attend the refresher exercise.

The length of non-military service has been criticized as being punitive by [[Amnesty International]] because it is over twice as long as the most common alternative, six-month military service. Several motions to shorten it have been made in the [[Finnish Parliament]] but none have passed.

===Germany===
:''Main article at [[Conscription in Germany]]''

[[Germany]] has mandatory military service of nine months for men. Women may volunteer and are allowed to perform - almost - the same jobs as men. A conscientious objector may petition for permission to do civilian alternative service, &quot;civil-service&quot; (''Zivildienst'') instead for nine months, which is usually accepted. A third option is to become a foreign development aide (''Entwicklungshelfer'') for at least eighteen months. Overall, however, during the past few years, the number of men being drafted has declined significantly.

Besides several exceptions, military service is compulsory for all men between the ages of eighteen and twenty three years. Those who are engaged in educational or vocational training programs prior to their military assessment are allowed to postpone service until they have completed the programs and can be called upon to perform their national duty at any time thereafter.

===Greece===
:''Main article at [[Conscription in Greece]]''

As of 2004, [[Greece]] (Hellenic Republic) has mandatory military service of twelve months for men. However, it is developing a professional army system, and it is widely expected that the mandatory military service will be cut to six months by [[2008]] or even abolished completely. Although women are accepted into the Greek army, they are not obliged to join as men are. Soldiers receive no health insurance, but they can receive medical support during their army service, including hospitalization costs. They receive a symbolic salary of approximately nine [[euro|euros]] per month for privates, twelve [[euro|euros]] for the rank of draft corporal and draft sergeant, and 600 [[euro|euros]] as a draft cadet. The wages are not sufficient to sustain a draftee serving his tour away from his place of residence and most draftees depend financially on their parents to support them financially while they are on their tour.

===Israel===
[[Israel]] has mandatory military service for both Jewish men and women.  All Israeli Jews are conscripted, except [[Haredi Judaism|Haredim]], who can choose to serve but mostly do not.  Israeli Arabs are exempt from service, although they can volunteer and some communities such as the [[Druze]], [[Bedouin]], and [[Circassians]] do serve.

Young women can generally not serve if they are married, pregnant, or otherwise - Israel is generally very lenient with Israeli women when it comes to the draft.  However, most that can, do serve out of patriotism.

Typically, men serve for 36&amp;nbsp;months, women serve for 24&amp;nbsp;months. ''See also: [[Israel Defence Forces]].''

There are limited number of ''[[Refusenik (Israel)|refusenik]]s'' who resist military service in general, or who refuse to serve in the [[West Bank]]. Some of them serving short prison terms as a result (no more than a few months). ''See also: [[Refusal to serve in the Israeli military]].''

In addition, men are liable for up to a month a year of reserve duty (miluim) until they are fifty. Women are liable for it until they are twenty four, married, or pregnant.

===Korea, South===
As of 2004, [[South Korea]] has mandatory military service of twenty four months. See: [http://kn.koreaherald.co.kr/SITE/data/html_dir/2002/12/14/200212140004.asp].

===Lebanon===
[[Lebanon]] previously had mandatory military service of one year for men. On [[4 May]] [[2005]], a new conscription system was adopted, making for a six-month service, and pledging to end conscription within two years. See [http://www.lebarmy.gov.lb/English/FlagService.asp Official Information from Lebanese Army].

===Malaysia===
As of [[2004]], [[Malaysia]] has mandatory [[Malaysian National Service|national service]] of three months for a selected group of both men and women. Twenty per cent of 18-year-olds are selected through a lottery system to join this program. Trainees are not trained to use firearms. The first training date was [[February 16]], 2004. See [http://www.khidmatnegara.gov.my Official Information from Malaysia National Service Training Department].

===Mexico===
Currently, all males reaching eighteen years of age must register for military service (Servicio Militar Nacional, or SMN) of one year, though selection is made by a lottery system using the following color scheme: whoever draws a black ball must serve as a &quot;disponibility reservist&quot;, that is, they must not follow any activities whatsoever and get their discharge card at the end of the year.  The ones who get a white ball serve in a Batallón del Servicio Militar Nacional (National Military Service Battalion) composed entirely of one-year SMN conscripts.  Those with a community service interest may participate in Literacy Campaigns as teachers, or as Phys-Ed instructors. Military service is also (voluntarily) open to women.  In certain cities, such as Mexico City and Veracruz, there is a third option: a red ball (Mexico City) and a Blue ball (Veracruz), which
entails serving a full year as a recruit in a Paratrooper Battalion in the case of Mexico City residents, or a Infantería de Marina unit (Navy Marines) in Veracruz.  In other cities which have a Navy HQ (such as Ciudad Madero), it is the Navy which takes charge of the conscripts, instead of the Army.

===Norway===
[[Norway]] has mandatory military service of eighteen months for men between the ages of eighteen (17 with parental consent) and forty four. The actual draft time is six months for the [[Norwegian Home Guard|home guard]], and 9-12 months for the regular [[Norwegian Army|army]], [[Royal Norwegian Air Force|air force]] and [[Royal Norwegian Navy|navy]]. The remaining months are supposed to be served in annual exercises, but very few conscripts do this due to lack of funding to the Norwegian armed forces. The decreased funding and greater reliance on high technology in the armed forces has resulted in only a third of the male population completing the service (since the late 1990's). The remaining two thirds have mostly formally been dismissed after medical tests or obtained deferral of the service due to studies or stays abroad. Many Norwegians consider it unfair that they are the &quot;unlucky&quot; 1/3 that have to complete the compulsory military duty when so many others are dismissed. Others see it as a privilege and there has been reported high competition during the past few years to be allowed to serve. Having completed the draft time is  generally regarded favourably with employers. The Norwegian armed forces will normally not draft a person who has reached the age of twenty eight. In Norway certain voluntary specialist training programs entail extended conscription of one to eight years. [[pacifism|Pacifists]] can apply for [[non-military service]], lasting thirteen months. Women can volunteer for military service in any part of the armed forces.

===Poland===
[[Poland]] has a compulsory service term of nine months for all mature men. However, many of those are considered unfit for mandatory military service during peacetime. Effectively, many tens of thousands of men are drafted each autumn. Alternative service can be requested, e.g. in the [[police]] force. This is only valid if you are not attending an educational facility. Some students can volunteer for military preparations, so they serve in military 6 weeks during their summer break after the finish fourth semester. After joining the European Union, many young men move abroad in order to avoid draft and quite low conditions in the [[Polish Army]]. Also many, facing very high unemployment in the country, join forces voluntarily to serve the term and later gain opportunity to get a well paid jobs in military or police.

===Romania===
[[Romania]] still has conscription. In [[2003]] an amendment to the [[Romanian Constitution|Constitution]] allowed the Parliament to mark the military service facultative and the conscription will end in January 2007. Men serve for twelve months (6 months if they have graduated a form of higher education). [[As of 2004]], conscripts no longer serve in the Romanian Navy.

The Romanian parliament voted in October 2005 to end the draft after the October 2006 &quot;class&quot; of draftees reports for duty. Beginning in January 2007, twenty year-old Romanian men will have to register with the government but the men will only be liable to call up in the case of war. The parliamentary vote formalized one of many military modernization and reform programs Romania agreed to when it joined NATO. By 2012, the requirement for registration will lower to seventeen years of age.

===Russia===
The conscription system was introduced into [[Imperial Russia]] by [[Dmitry Milyutin]] in the [[1870s]]. As of [[2002]], [[Russian Federation]] has a mandatory two-year draft but most Russians avoid it.   The most widely used ways to avoid the military service are:  
* Studying in a university or similar place. All students are free from conscription, but they can be drafted after they graduate (or if they drop out).  Graduated students serve one year as privates, but if they have a military education, they have option to serve two years as officers. Persons who continue postgraduate education, or have a [[doctoral degree]] (Candidate of Sciences) are not drafted.
* Getting a medical certificate that shows that a person is unfit for service. Sometimes such certificates are false and are made for a bribe. 
* Bribing military or civilian officials responsible for draft.
* Just not going to a draft station, draft-dodging. This can be a criminal offence, punishable by up to two years in prison. 
* Not widely used way is having more than two children, or one child younger than three years.
* There are other legal (described in the law) or illegal ways to evade draft. 

In Russia, a person can not be conscripted after he turns twenty seven. 

As a result of draft evasion, Russian generals have complained on numerous times that the bulk of the army is made up of drug-addicts, imbeciles, and ex-convicts, which in turn has lead to an overall decline of the morale and function of the Russian armed services.  Conscripts often face brutal hazing and [[bullying]] upon their enterance into the military known as [[dedovschina]], some dying as a result.  Suicide among Russian conscripts is at an all time high.

See [http://www.spacedaily.com/2002/021206145741.ooyw2y54.html Only eleven percent of Russian men enter mandatory military service].

===Singapore===
In [[Singapore]], the NS (Amendment) Act was passed on [[14 March]] [[1967]], under which all able-bodied male citizens of 18-21 years of age were required to serve a compulsory military service of two years (down from two and a half years, amended in 2005). Upon completion of full-time NS, they undergo [[reservist]] training cycles of forty days a year for the next ten years.

Singapore, which currently has a mandatory service period of twenty four months, used to have one of the longest mandatory military service periods for males, at thirty months. It also has special policies for ethnic [[Malay people|Malay]]s, because of possible conflicts in allegiances with neighbour [[Malaysia]]. Some of the Malays are drafted into the [[police]] or [[Civil Defense]].

See [[National Service]]

===Sweden===
In [[Sweden]] military service is mandatory for men only. As of 2002, Sweden's government asked the army to consider mandatory military service for women. Less than one third of the country's eligible 19-year-olds are actually drafted each year. See [http://www.news-star.com/stories/062703/New_8.shtml ''Sweden considers mandatory military service for women'']. Men may choose to do unarmed service, for instance as a [[firefighter]]. Generally, unarmed service is longer than armed.

===Switzerland===
[[Switzerland]] has the largest [[militia]] army in the world (220,000 including reserves). Military service for Swiss men is obligatory according to the Federal Constitution, and includes seventeen weeks of basic training as well as annual 3-week-refresher courses until a number of service days which increases with rank (260 days for privates) is reached. Service for women is voluntary, but identical in all respects. Conscientious objectors can choose 450 days of community service instead of military service. Medical deferments and dismissals from basic training (often on somewhat dubious grounds) have increased significantly in the last years. Therefore, only about 33% of Swiss men actually complete basic training.

===Taiwan (ROC)===
{{see also|Conscription in the Republic of China}}
The [[Republic of China]] has had mandatory military service for all males since [[1949]]. Females from the outlying islands of [[Fujian#Quemoy and Matsu|Fuchien]] were also required to serve in a civil defense role, although this requirement has been dropped since the lifting of martial law. In October 1999, the mandatory service was shortened from twenty four months to twenty two months. From January [[2004]], the mandatory service was shortened further. At this point, the duration of mandatory military service is eighteen months. Beginning [[1 January]] [[2006]], the duration will decrease to sixteen months. The ROC Defense Ministry has announced that should voluntary enlistment reach sufficent numbers, the compulsory service period for draftees will be shortened to fourteen months in 2007. Should this trend continue, the service period will be further shortened to twelve months in 2008.

ROC nationals with [[Overseas Chinese]] status are exempt from service. Draftees may also request alternative service, usually in community service areas, although the required service period would be longer than military service. Qualified draftees with graduate degrees in the sciences or engineering who pass officer candidate exams may also apply to fulfill their obligations in a national defense service option which involves three months of military training, followed by an officer commission in the reserves and four years working in technical jobs in the defense industry or government research institutions. 

The Ministry of Interior is responsible for administering the National Conscription Agency. [http://www.moi.gov.tw/outline/Conscription.asp Ministry of Interior site on Consciption Administration]

===Turkey===
In [[Turkey]], compulsory military service applies to all male citizens from twenty to forty one years of age (with some exceptions). Those who are engaged in higher education or vocational training programs prior to their military drafting are allowed to delay service until they have completed the programs. The duration of the basic military service varies. As of July [[2003]], the reduced durations are as follows: fifteen months for privates (previously eighteen months), twelve months for reserve officers (previously sixteen months) and six months for short-term privates, which denotes those who have earned a university degree and not have been enlisted as reserve officers (previously eight months).

For Turkish citizens who have lived or worked abroad of Turkey for at least three years, on condition that they pay a certain fee in foreign currencies, a basic military training of one month is offered instead of the full-term military service. Also, when the General Staff assesses that the military reserve exceeds the required amount, paid military service of one-month's basic training is established.

Although women have in principle no military service, they are allowed to become officers.

Refusing the obligatory military service due to conscientious objection is illegal in Turkey, and punishable with imprisonment by law.

===Ukraine===
The options are either reserve officer training for two years (offered in universities as a part of a program), or one year regular service.

===Venezuela===
Military service is mandatory and may last for up to two years. All men between eighteen - thirty five years of age are liable to be conscripted if not already registered as reserves or exempt from conscription by the local authority. 

Reasons for exemption include: being sole support for a family, studying college, being physically unfit. Some of these exemptions are based on subjective assessment by the local authorities and allegations of [[corruption]] and [[bribes]] periodically surface in the local media.

In past decades the policy of conscription (''la recluta'') in [[Venezuela]] used to draw its manpower from the detention of males of military age, in a similar way to the [[press gangs]] of the pre-Industrial era. This is slowly evolving into a modern and voluntary conscription system.

==Countries that do not currently have mandatory military service (partial list)==
===Argentina===
[[Argentina]] abolished military conscription in [[1994]], yet those in service had to finish it.

===Australia===
:''See main article: [[Australian Conscription|History of Australian conscription]]''

===Belgium===
[[Belgium]] suspended military conscription in 1994.

===Canada===
:''See main articles: [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]] and [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]]''

In [[Canada]] conscription has never taken place in peacetime.  Conscription became an extremely controversial issue during both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], especially in the province of [[Quebec]].

===Czech Republic===
The [[Czech Republic]] abolished compulsory military service on [[December 31]], [[2004]]. See [http://www.army.cz/scripts/detail.php?id=3041 announcement by the Minister of Defence] and related BBC News [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4118461.stm article].

===France===
Modern conscription was invented during the [[French Revolution]], since the army needed men to stop Austrian and British invasions from destroying the newly founded [[French Republic|Republic]]. The [[1798]] [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan Act]] stated: &quot;Any French is a soldier and owes himself to the defense of the nation&quot;. Thus [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] could create afterward the ''[[Grande Armée]]'' which successfully battled European professional armies.

France abolished peacetime military conscription in [[1996]], while those born before 1979 had to complete their service (see related BBC News [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1682777.stm article]); since the [[Algerian War of Independence]] (1954-62), conscripts had not been deployed abroad or in war zones, except those volunteering for such deployments.

===Hungary===
[[Hungary]] abolished mandatory military service by [[November]] [[2004]], after the [[National Assembly of Hungary|parliament]] had modified the constitution, ending a long-standing political dispute. To restore drafting, a two-thirds vote in parliament is needed, which is unlikely in the short term. The country is currently developing a professional army, with strong emphasis on &quot;contract soldiers&quot; who voluntarily serve 4+4 years for a wage.

===India===
[[India]] has never had mandatory military service, either under [[British Raj|British rule]] or since independence in [[1947]].

===Iraq===
Saddam Hussein's large [[Iraq]]i army was largely composed of conscripts, except for the elite [[Iraqi Republican Guard|Republican Guard]]. About 100,000 conscripts died during the [[Gulf War|First Gulf War]], also known as Operation Desert Storm. In the intervening years, Iraq's military suffered from decay and poor leadership, but there was still compulsory service. One program of note was &quot;Ashbal Saddam&quot; known as &quot;Saddam's Cubs&quot; where children were trained to defend Iraq through &quot;toughening&quot; exercises such as firearms training and dismembering live chickens with their teeth. Following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Second Gulf War]] where the original military was disbanded, the Iraqi Army was recreated as a volunteer force with training overseen at first by the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] and later by the American   presence.

===Ireland===
[[Ireland]] has always had a fully volunteer military. See the [http://www.military.ie/ Irish Defence Forces]. The [[Conscription Crisis of 1918 (Ireland)|threat of conscription]] being extended to Ireland in the [[World War I|First World War]] contributed to the creation of the [[Irish Free State]] in the 1920s. (''Also see: [[Conscription#United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] below'').

===Italy===
Until [[January 1]], [[2005]], [[Italy]] had mandatory military service for men between the ages of eighteen and forty five. Men were usually required to serve for ten months. Anyone objecting to military service for religious or ethical reasons could claim to be a conscientious objector, in which case community service was usually authorised as an alternative to the regular ten months of military service.

The [[Italian Parliament]], by a large majority, voted to abolish mandatory military service from [[1 January]] [[2005]], and the Italian armed forces will be now be entirely composed of professional volunteer troops, both male and female. [http://www.repubblica.it/2004/g/sezioni/cronaca/fineleva/fineleva/fineleva.html].

===Japan===
[[Japan]]'s [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Self Defence Forces]] have been a volunteer force since their establishment in the 1950s, following the end of the Allied occupation. As the [[Japanese constitution]] expressly prohibits Japan from maintaining any offensive military force, conscription will most likely never be an issue in the near future.

===Luxembourg===
[[Luxembourg]] has a volunteer military. See the [http://www.nat-military-museum.lu/ National Museum of Military History].

===Netherlands===
The [[Netherlands]] established conscription for a territorial militia in [[1814]], simultaneously establishing a standing army which was to be manned by volunteers only. However, lack of sufficient volunteers caused the two components to be merged in [[1819]] into a &quot;cadre-militia&quot; army, in which the bulk of troops were conscripts, led by professional officers and NCOs. This system remained in use until the end of the [[Cold War]]. Between [[1991]] and [[1996]], the Dutch armed forces phased out their conscript personnel and converted to an all-volunteer force. The last conscript troops were inducted in [[1995]] and demobilized in 1996. Formally, the Netherlands has not abolished conscription; that is to say, the laws and systems which provide for the conscription of armed forces personnel remain in place, and Dutch citizens who completed their military service prior to 1996 can still, theoretically, be mobilized in the event of a national emergency.

===New Zealand===
:''See main article: [[Compulsory Military Training (in New Zealand)]]''
Conscription of men into the armed forces of [[New Zealand]] came into effect in [[1940]], and was abolished in [[1972]].

===Portugal===
[[Portugal]] abolished compulsory military service on [[November 19]], [[2004]]. See [http://www.mdn.gov.pt/destaques/2004/fim_servico_militar.htm an announcement by the Minister of Defence].

===Slovakia===
[[Slovakia]] abolished compulsory military service on [[January 1]], [[2006]].

===Slovenia===
[[Slovenia]]'s [[Prime Minister]] [[Anton Rop]] abolished mandatory military service on [[September 9]] [[2003]]. See the [http://nato.gov.si/eng/press-centre/press-releases/2212/ official press release].

===Spain===
[[Spain]] abolished compulsory military service in [[2001]]. See [http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2001/03/09/espana/984145280.html an announcement by the Minister of Defence]. Military and alternative service was nine months long and in recent years the majority of conscripts chose to perform alternative, rather than military, service.

===United Kingdom===
The [[United Kingdom]] introduced conscription during both world wars. For the first two years of [[World War I]] the British relied on volunteers. But by 1916 the need for yet more soldiers to replace losses at the front, forced the British Government to introduce conscription under the [[Military Service Act]].  [[Conscientious objector]]s received relatively harsh treatment in the 1914-18 war.  Most had to do war-related work of a non-military sort.  Some went to jail.

[[Ireland]] was initially exempt from conscription in the First World War, but it was extended to Ireland on [[April 9]], [[1918]]. This led a [[Conscription Crisis of 1918 (Ireland)|Conscription Crisis in Ireland]] and was a decisive factor in pushing the country into seeking its [[Anglo-Irish War|independence]]. The poet [[William Butler Yeats|W.B. Yeats]] wrote to [[Richard Burdon Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|Lord Haldane]] in protest: &quot;...it seems to me a strangely wanton thing that England, for the sake of 50,000 Irish soldiers, is prepared to hollow another trench between the countries and fill it with blood.&quot; Also in protest, [[Augusta, Lady Gregory|Lady Gregory]] declared &quot;women and children will stand in front of their men and receive the bullets, rather than let them be taken to the front.&quot;  [[Northern Ireland]] was exempt from conscription in the Second World War, and was also excluded from the post-war National Service.

Conscription was reintroduced in 1939 at the start of [[World War II]]. Not only was conscription used for the three branches of the armed forces, it was also introduced to aid in coal mining with the [[Bevin Boys]], and later in the war with the introduction of conscription of women into the [[Women's Land Army]] to help with agricultural production.  Conscientious objectors were treated more tolerantly, but could still go to prison if they refused war-related work.

After World War II, the Government introduced [[National Service]], which was abolished in [[1960]].

===United States===
{{main|Conscription in the United States}}
The United States has employed conscription intermittently.  For example, in 1863 the imposition of a draft during the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]] touched off the [[New York Draft Riots]].  Conscription was next used after the United States entered World War I in 1917.  The first peacetime conscription came with the [[Selective Service Act|Selective Training and Service Act of 1940]].  Active conscription (&quot;the draft&quot;) ended in 1973.  Currently, male U.S. citizens and many male foreigners living in the U.S., if aged eighteen through twenty five, are required to register with the [[Selective Service System]], whose mission is &quot;to provide manpower to the armed forces in an emergency; and to run an Alternative Service Program for men classified as [[conscientious objectors]] during a draft.&quot;

One of the holders of the first number (258) in the U.S. military draft lottery in 1917 was an Alden C. Flagg. His son, Alden C. Flagg, Jr., of Boston, was a holder of the first number (158) in the U.S. peacetime draft lottery of 1940.

==Arguments for conscription==
===Valuable training===
Some argue that peacetime conscription is an ideal tool for teaching a population basic, important skills such as first aid, swimming, wilderness survival and so on. However, it can be argued that these skills could better be taught in the public school system than during mandatory service.

===The draft as protection against democracy-destroying [[Coup d'état|military coups]]===
Some argue that conscription should be connected to democracy. A professional army can possibly become a dangerous state-within-a-state. Military [[virtue]]s such as obedience to orders and respect for the chain of command can possibly be abused by aspiring [[dictator]]s. Armed forces can attract - consciously or unconsciously - people who prefer [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] systems. The army can even become the only chance for a job and decent life in times of unemployment, or for despised minorities. Such people may come to regard the army as their home and elevate it above the state.

On the other hand, once in power a number of dictators such as [[Napoléon Bonaparte|Napoleon]], [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], and [[Saddam Hussein]] have used conscription to drive their undemocratic ambitions. The most significant [[July 20 Plot|attempt on Hitler's life]] was from the professional component of his military.

===Manpower===
Small countries have several options to raise a sizeable army. One is to put every able-bodied man under arms. This is how [[Switzerland]] managed to stay independent despite repeated attacks throughout history. The [[Swiss]] militias were so successful that their fighting style and weapons (especially the [[halberd]]) were quickly adopted by their enemies. Many rulers even raised [[Swiss Guard]]s. The rich [[Flanders (county)|Flemish]] trade cities of the early [[14th century]]  raised huge militias that could even defeat armies of knights. The famous [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]] ([[1302]]) is a good example. 

Other options for national defence include membership in a military alliance like [[NATO]], as is the case for countries like [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]]. Switzerland started out as a military alliance between independent counties. 

Also, a wealthy small country could hire a professional [[mercenary]] army. This approach does, however, require wealth and men who are willing to hire on. Moreover, it required some means to control the mercenaries if they became unruly.

===Personnel diversity===
Perhaps the kind of people who most strongly want to be in the military are not always the only kind of people who are needed in it. Conscripts come from various backgrounds and might have differing opinions and views. A diverse group is arguably more likely to succeed at any task. Still, the frequently lower morale and experience of conscripts may make them less useful in actual combat situations, especially in wars of aggression. This has been witnessed in the [[Vietnam War]] and [[Soviet-Afghan War]].

Personnel diversity might be bad for armies in some ways, by inhibiting communication and increasing social tension, but it also helps different people come together and realize the true nature of an all-inclusive society. For example, it helps them understand the problems of other classes, professions, cultures, and educational levels. Similar arguments have been presented in favor of [[desegregation]] in schools. However, in countries that already have desegregated schools (i.e. most of the western world) it is not clear why the armed forces would be more important in bringing different people together than the school system, or could accomplish this in ways in which the school system could not.

===Conscript quality===
The manpower quality of a conscript force is considered poor in many countries. However, in some countries with conscription, the personnel diversity of the conscript force is considered its greatest strength. Admittedly, there are persons who would not be employed by a professional force, but these are a minority, and can be discharged for medical reasons in extreme cases.

However, the conscript force may also receive the best of the youth. Many conscripts are from such social strata that they would have much more lucrative employment or would be studying, were they not obliged to serve. These persons provide talented manpower that can easily be trained for technical and leadership duties. As junior NCO and commissioned officer positions are filled with leadership-trained conscripts, the size and cost of the professional cadre is much smaller. As these ex-conscripts, as reservists, mature and lose their fighting fitness, they can be subsequently retrained and given emergency positions corresponding their civilian expertise. For example, a transport manager who is a reserve officer might serve as a battalion logistics chief during wartime. The leadership-trained conscripts can also be recruited to the regular forces.

===Political and moral motives===
[[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] argued vehemently against professional armies, feeling it was the right and privilege of every citizen to participate to the defence of the whole society and a mark of moral decline to leave this business to professionals. He based this view on the development of the [[Roman republic]] which came to an end at the same time as the Roman army changed from a conscript to professional force.

The right of the state to conscript its citizens can be founded on [[utilitarian|Utilitarianism]] principles. First, we conjecture that the army must never be used for a war of aggression, but only to preserve the state. Second, we conjecture that the occupation by a foreign country would include unbearable conditions, e.g. [[genocide]] or destruction of the local way of life. If these two requirements are fulfilled, the greatest good to the greatest number of person may be achieved by sacrificing a number of persons and thus, these persons, the reservists serving in the armed forces, should be willing to make this sacrifice out of altruism. In fact, even without accepting this, the moderate (1-10 %) chance of dying compared to the prospect of living in an occupied country may be preferable.

Conscription can give the conscripts a lasting patriotic view and readiness to die for the good of the whole. Such readiness should be present in a virtuous citizen at all times, but through training, the readiness becomes a grim reality, not rhetoric. This tends to decrease the admiration of the military. On the other hand, the fact that every person understands that a war - any war - means that they themselves, friends, and relatives will be dying or at the least, facing mortal danger, decreases the willingness to enter an armed conflict. In practice, a conscript force cannot be used for an aggressive war for long, as this results in morale degradation both at home and on the front, testified by [[Afghanistan War|Afghanistan]] and [[Vietnam War]]s. This decreases the possibility of the government to engage in foreign adventures, thus preserving peaceful relations to all nations on Earth.

==Arguments against conscription==
===Conscription and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights===
Many arguments opposed to conscription, or opposed to gender-discriminated conscription, arise from its violation of the principles of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] of the [[United Nations]]. In particular:
* Art.1: ''All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. (...)''
* Art.2: ''Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as (...) sex (...)''
* Art.3: ''Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.''
* Art.4: ''No one shall be held in (...) servitude (...)''
* Art.13: ''(1)Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state. (2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.''
* Art.20: ''(...) No one may be compelled to belong to an association.''
* Art.23: ''Everyone has the right (...) to free choice of employment (...)''

In addition, many Constitutions do provide similar rights in Countries where there is or has been some form of conscription after [[World War II]] or that maintain a possibility of conscription in time of war.

===The draft as slavery===
:''Conscription subjects individual personalities to militarism. It is a form of servitude. That nations routinely tolerate it, is just one more proof of its debilitating influence''
:&amp;mdash; [[Albert Einstein]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[H.G. Wells]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Thomas Mann]] in [http://www.peace.ca/manifestoagainstconscription.htm Against Conscription and the Military Training of Youth--1930]

Some groups, such as [[libertarians]], say that the draft constitutes [[slavery]], since it is mandatory work.  Under the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution, slavery or indentured servitude is not allowed unless it is part of punishment for a crime.  They therefore see the draft as ''[[unconstitutional]]'' (at least in the U.S.) and immoral.  In 1918, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that the [[World War I]] draft did not violate the [[United States Constitution]].  ''Arver v. United States'', 245 U.S. 366 (1918) ([http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=245&amp;invol=366]).  The Court detailed its conclusion that the limited powers of the federal government included conscription.  Its only statement on the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] issue was based on a &quot;supreme and noble duty&quot; argument from nationalism and not legal reasoning:
:Finally, as we are unable to conceive upon what theory the exaction by government from the citizen of the performance of his supreme and noble duty of contributing to the defense of the rights and honor of the nation as the result of a war declared by the great representative body of the people can be said to be the imposition of [[involuntary servitude]] in violation of the prohibitions of the Thirteenth Amendment, we are constrained to the conclusion that the contention to that effect is refuted by its mere statement.

In the USSR, most of the conscripts received only very basic training and were used for forced labor unrelated to actual military service - usually digging up potatoes in the field with zero wage cost. The Soviet planned economy system thus had no incentive to produce better combined harvesting machines and Soviet agriculture remained low-tech.

In [[Soviet-bloc]] [[Hungary]], more than half of pre-1989 conscripts received a mere few weeks of [[rifle]] training and were swiftly assigned to &quot;working squadrons&quot; which usually hand-built [[rail tracks]] &quot;for free&quot;, and in very poor quality. At the same time, railway tracks in Western Europe were being built to high-quality standards by semi-automatic, rail-rolling factories operated by a professional workforce.

These are examples of a &quot;military&quot; draft used to obtain involuntary labour.They also illustrate one key theme of Adam Smith and other liberal economists that Liberty is the key method of social improvement. When compulsion takes the place of free markets and free Labour the efficiency of the economy is reduced. Compulsion also means that the Wages and working conditions of the Workers is inferior. David Hume points out that this was illustrated by the press gang. The legalised abduction of citizens by the state makes for military inefficiency as well as economic inefficiency and a denial of Constitutional freedom. When Labour is too cheap it will be wasted as other commodities are and this is one reason for the collapse of Communism in the USSR.

===Discipline problems===
No army can work without discipline. The discipline can either arise from the ''esprit de corps'', motivation of the soldiers or be imposed and pressed on the troops. Volunteers seldom have disciplinary problems, but people pressed in the service against their will have little other motivation to serve than personal survival, and perhaps change to get to rape and loot enemy civilians. As motivation is based on [[coercion]], the discipline on conscript armies is often harsh, and punishments severe. [[Capital punishment]], usually by [[firing squad]], is used almost universally to maintain discipline on conscription armies during the wartime. It is estimated the executions covered some 1% to 5% of all conscript losses in WWII. This can be best summarized by statement of [[Leon Trotsky]]: ''An army cannot be built without reprisals. Masses of men cannot be led to death unless the army command has the death penalty in its arsenal. So long as those malicious tailless apes that are so proud of their technical achievements — the animals that we call men — will build armies and wage wars, the command will always be obliged to place the soldiers between the possible death in the front and the inevitable one in the rear.'' As result, conscript armies are more likely to mutiny than all-volunteer forces, and like the [[Vlasov army]], can in extreme cases turn against their own.

===The draft as nationalism===
The military draft is predicated on the assumption that nations have rights that supersede those of the individual. In the words of Einstein and Gandhi's ''Anti-Conscription Manifesto'', &quot;The State which thinks itself entitled to force its citizens to go to war will never pay proper regard to the value and happiness of their lives in peace.&quot; The building of large conscript armies coincided with the rise of virulent [[nationalism]] in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Draftees can object being conscripted if they are [[separatism|separatists]] and do not want to support the armies of the state they oppose.
On the other hand, some separatist fighters acquire their military skills in the army they will later fight against.

===The draft as justification for attacks on civilians===
Conscription is a component of &quot;total war,&quot; and can also be used as an example of established policy to justify a government's demand that other sacrifices be required of civilians.  Once a draft is allowed, Justice [[Louis Brandeis]] argued, &amp;#8220;all bets are off&quot;. Arguably this results in a blurring of the moral distinction between civilians and the military as legitimate military targets, leading to attacks on civilians. Examples would include the indiscriminate bombing of cities conducted by both sides during [[World War II]], or the assertion by terrorist groups that civilians are legitimate targets.

===Questions of conscript quality===
One of the objections raised is a conscripted force would be of lower quality than a volunteer army.  First, short periods of service do not allow for much skill building.  Second, there is a possibility of a morale drop in units with conscripts, leading to a reduction in quality as officers and NCOs work to alleviate those problems.

The biggest problem is that the pace of training has to be adjusted to the level of the lowest quality manpower. Combined with the short tour of duty, this renders the skills of the conscripts very low. Certain individuals with poor military and social skills may prove [[loose cannon]]s in wartime, proving more a liability than an asset to the unit and perhaps risking the destruction of the whole unit. Therefore the [[elite]] units of all armies which have conscription, are composed entirely of selected volunteers, such as [[paratroops|Parachute Rangers]] in the Finnish army.

==Economics==
It can be argued that in a cost to benefit ratio conscription during peace time is not worthwhile. A number of months or years of service amongst the most fit subtracts from the productivity of the economy; add to this the cost of training them, and in some countries paying them. Compared to these extensive costs, some would argue there is very little benefit, if there ever were a war conscription and basic training could be completed quickly, and in most countries where conscription is compulsory there is little threat of war in any case.

The cost to benefit ratio of conscription during war time is also debatable. As technology improves, the necessity of a soldier on the battlefield becomes less and less necessary. Superior technology, not superior numbers, has become the deciding factor in war. The cost to train, equip, and care for a poorly trained conscript does not justify the contribution (if any) he or she makes to the armed forces.

Alternative theories suggest that readiness for war in times of crises require constant training or conscription.  These fall under the category of &quot;credible threat&quot; recently popularized by 2005 Nobel economic laureates Robert Aumann and Thomas Schelling who were  partially credited with the non-nuclear cold war between the United States and the former Soviet Union.  

Particulary in times of military duress, such as the current U.S. conflict in Iraq, conscription serves as an instrument through which fresh soldiers may be readied when reserves and voluntary troops have been overutilized.  These new troops ultimately provide more efficient use of U.S. economic resources due to the fact that individuals plan for military involvement as a normal activity.  Draft assignments, in contrast, disrupt everyday activity and lead to possibly greater economic shock.

'''Catherine ''Cady'' Coleman''' (born [[December 14]], [[1960]], in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]) is a colonel in the [[United States Air Force]] and an [[astronaut]]. 

She received a bachelor of science degree in [[chemistry]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in [[1983]], and then joined the Air Force as a second lieutenant while continuing her graduate work at the [[University of Massachusetts]]. In [[1988]] she entered active duty at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] as a research chemist. During her work she also participated at the analysis of the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) experiment launched with [[STS-41-C]] and retrieved with [[STS-32]]. In [[1991]] she received her [[doctorate]] in [[polymer science]] and engineering from the [[University of Massachusetts]]. She was selected by [[NASA]] in [[1992]] to become a mission specialist astronaut.

She has taken part in two [[space shuttle]] missions so far. In [[1995]] she was a member of the [[STS-73]] crew on the scientific mission USML-1 with experiments including [[biotechnology]], combustion science and the [[physics]] of [[fluids]].

She also trained for the mission [[STS-83]] to be the backup for [[Donald Thomas]], however as he recovered on time she did not fly that mission.

[[STS-93]] was Coleman's second space flight. She was mission specialist in charge of placing the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] in orbit.

Coleman is married to acclaimed contemporary glass artist Josh Simpson.

        <usernamve, and capabilities, but Napoleon never undertook to write a detailed systematic [[treatise]] of his campaigns or military theories.  It is very easy to find hundreds of quotes by Napoleon or attributed to Napoleon (who has to be one of the most quoted and quotable people in history), but these quotes are largely taken from letters, military dispatches, diaries, campaign reports, and eyewitness accounts, and are often taken out of context.  What we know of Napoleon's theories and methods come from study of his letters and his actions, the historical records of his campaigns and from the treatises of [[Antoine Henri Jomini]] who briefly served as a junior officer in Napoleon's armies under Marshal [[Michel Ney]].  As has been noted by other authors, Napoleon had little interest in instructing his commanders to be his equals in military thought (in [[1813]] Napoleon commented in response to Jomini's ''[[Treatise on Great Military Operations]]'' that &quot;It teaches my whole system of war to my enemies!&quot;).  In the end, as many have commented, that was his undoing as from [[1811]] to [[1813]] his allied enemies avoided battle with Napoleon directly and concentrated on eliminating forces commanded by his less competent Marshals and Generals.

Other commanders before Napoleon and Clausewitz, wrote treatises on various military subjects of interest to them.  For example, Marshal [[Sebastien le Prestre de Vauban]], published four treatises that revolutionized modern fortifications, and Marshal [[Maurice de Saxe]] whose published [[memoirs]]-[[treatise]], [[Mes Reveries]] (published [[posthumously]] in [[1756]]), was the intellectual forerunner to &quot;Napoleonic tactics&quot; or &quot;[[Grand Tactics]].&quot;  Both served in the armies of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the &quot;Sun&quot; King of [[France]] in the age immediately preceding the Napoleonic Era.  But none undertook a great philosophical examination of war on the scale of Clauswitz and [[Tolstoy]], who were both inspired by the events of the [[Napoleonic Era]] in which they lived.

Carl von Clauswitz was also a man of great intellect, and did participate in actual military campaigns, but without the drive to make himself emperor of his nation and attempt to conquer the world.  Instead, he was a person of thought and an instructor of the next generations at the ''[[Kriegsakademie]]'', and he was interested in the examination of war.  He undertook to write a careful philosophical and systematic examination of war in all aspects, as he saw it and taught it, and the result was his principle work, [[On War]], the West's premier work on the [[Philosophy of War]].  His examination was so careful and considered that it was only partially completed before his death.

Jomini was a direct contemporary rival of Clausewitz in post Napoleonic interpretation of Napoleonic warfare.  Jomini's treatises, consisting of geometric diagrams and formula like statements, were initally more popular than Clausewitz' philosophies, but as time has shown, Jomini's works have faded into history and are now nearly forgotten while Clausewitz continues to be applicable (even in the nuclear age) to stir controversy and debate.  As [[Lynn Montross]] indicated in [[War Through the Ages]], &quot;This outcome...may be explained by the fact the Jomini produced a system of war, Clausewitz a philosophy.  The one has been outdated by new weapons, the other still influences the strategy behind those weapons.&quot;

It is an arguable point whether one could equate Clauswitz with the ancient [[China|Chinese]] war philosopher and instructor, [[Sun Tzu]] or whether one could equate [[On War]] with [[The Art of War]], but the two together are generally acknowledged as being the greatest military philosophers in history and the greatest written works of military philosophy.  What Clauswitz accomplished was the introduction of systematic philosophical thought into Western military instruction and operational planning.

==Principal ideas==
''Vom Kriege'' (''[[On War]]'') is a compilation of his observations following the Napoleonic Wars.

Clausewitz used a [[dialectical]] method to construct his argument, leading to frequent modern misinterpretation.  As described by Christopher Bassford, professor of strategy at the [[National War College]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the main sources of confusion about Clausewitz's approach lies in his dialectical method of presentation. For example, Clausewitz's famous line that &quot;War is merely a continuation of politics,&quot; while accurate as far as it goes, was not intended as a statement of fact. It is the antithesis in a dialectical argument whose thesis is the point—made earlier in the analysis—that &quot;war is nothing but a duel [or wrestling match, a better translation of the German Zweikampf] on a larger scale.&quot; His synthesis, which resolves the deficiencies of these two bold statements, says that war is neither &quot;nothing but&quot; an act of brute force nor &quot;merely&quot; a rational act of politics or policy. This synthesis lies in his &quot;fascinating trinity&quot; [wunderliche Dreifaltigkeit]: a dynamic, inherently unstable interaction of the forces of violent emotion, chance, and rational calculation.[http://www.clausewitz.com/CWZHOME/CWZSUMM/CWORKHOL.htm]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among these confusions has been that Clausewitz was the origin of the concept of [[total war]] as used in 1940s' Third Reich Propaganda. Clausewitz, however, did not coin the phrase as an [[Gerard Walsh]] ideologic ideal, but as an inevitable part of the equations underlying his theories: War, as any struggle or competition, cannot be waged in a limited way, as the rules of competition will force the opponents to go to their utmost possibilities and devote all means they have to victory. 

Similarly, his statement &quot;War is merely the continuation of policy by other means,&quot; is perhaps his most oft-quoted and even more often missed point. It has been intepreted by some as the idea that [[war]] is only the &quot;strong arm&quot; of [[diplomacy]], utilized when more peaceful means of persuasion are not sufficient; and by others, that military should only serve the politic and not end in itself.  That Clausewitz did not in fact consider war to be merely a continuation of politics is revealed by his statement that societies often engaged in war contrary to their own ideals, for the sake of self-interest.

==Influence==
Despite his death before completing ''On War'', Clausewitz' ideas have been widely influential in [[military theory]]. Later Prussian and German generals such as [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Helmuth Graf von Moltke]] were clearly influenced by Clausewitz as they developed the concepts of [[total war]]. The idea that actual war includes &quot;friction&quot; which deranges, to a greater or lesser degree, all prior arrangements, has become common currency in other fields as well (e.g. business strategy).

Some claim that [[nuclear proliferation]] has started the decline of the prevalence of Clausewitzian ideas after dominating the world throughout the [[20th century]].{{ref|nuclear}}  When nuclear weapons were developed, state-based conventional armies simultaneously perfected their purpose (to destroy a mirror image of themselves) and made themselves obsolete.  No two [[nuclear power]]s have ever fought, nor are they likely to.  If they did, there would be no survivor.  Thus, the beginning of the 21st century found many instances of state armies trying in vain to suppress [[terrorism]], bloody feuds, raids and other intra/supra-state conflict.

The phrase ''fog of war'' was first used by Clausewitz in reference to how chaotic warfare can seem while one is immersed within it. {{ref|fog_of_war}}. The term [[Center of gravity (military)|Center of gravity]], still used by today's military planners, was also first used by Clausewitz, and represents the source from which an opponent derives its strength.

== Name ==
Clausewitz's Christian name is sometimes given in non-German sources as ''Carl Philipp Gottlieb'', ''Carl Maria'', or misspelled ''Karl'' due to reliance on mistaken source material, conflations with his wife's name, Marie, or mistaken assumptions about German orthography.  ''Carl Philipp Gottfried'' appears on Clausewitz's tombstone and is thus most likely to be the correct version.  The tombstone reads:

:Hier ruht in Gott
:Carl Philipp Gottfried von Clausewitz
:koenigl. General-Major u. Inspecteur der Artillerie
:geboren 1 Juni 1780
:gestorben 16&amp;nbsp;Nov 1831

Which translates as:

:Here rests with God
:Carl Philipp Gottfried von Clausewitz
:In the royal service, Major General and Inspector of Artillery
:Born [[1 June]] [[1780]]
:Died [[16 November]] [[1831]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Common Lisp''', commonly abbreviated '''CL''', is a dialect of the [[Lisp programming language]], standardised by ANSI X3.226-1994. Developed to standardize the divergent variants of Lisp which predated it, it is not an implementation but rather a language specification to which most Lisp implementations conform.

Common Lisp is a general-purpose programming language, in contrast to Lisp variants such as [[Emacs Lisp|Emacs Lisp]] and [[AutoLISP]] which are embedded extension languages in particular products. Unlike many earlier Lisps, Common Lisp (like [[Scheme programming language|Scheme]]) uses lexical variable [[scope (programming)|scope]].

Common Lisp is a multi-paradigm [[programming language]] that:

* Supports programming techniques such as [[procedural programming|imperative]], [[functional programming|functional]] and [[object-oriented]] programming.
* Is dynamically typed, but with optional type declarations that can improve efficiency.
* Is extensible through standard features such as Lisp macros (compile-time code rearrangement accomplished by the program itself) and reader macros (extension of syntax to give special meaning to characters reserved for users for this purpose).

==Syntax==
Common Lisp is a Lisp; it uses [[S-expression]]s to denote both code and data structure. Function and macro calls are written as lists, with the name of the function first, as in these examples:

 (+ 2 2)           ; adds 2 and 2, yielding 4

 (setf p 3.1415)  ; sets the variable &quot;p&quot; equal to 3.1415
&lt;!-- &quot;pi&quot; is a built-in constant; can't setf it--&gt;

 ; Define a function that squares a number:
 (defun square (x) (* x x))

 ; Execute the function:
 (square 3)        ; Returns &quot;9&quot;

&lt;!--                  I truncated this a bit; in smaller browsers, it runs off the side--&gt;
 ; construction - variables existing only in 'let' block, so you can easily give any new
 ; values to any existing variables without changing them. Old values are restored after
 ; the end of the block.
 (let ((a 6) (b 4)) (+ a b)) ; returns 10

==Data types==
Common Lisp has a plethora of data types, more than many languages.

===Scalar types===
''Number'' types include [[integer]]s, [[ratio]]s, [[floating-point number]]s, and [[complex number]]s. Common Lisp uses [[bignum]]s to represent numerical values of arbitrary size and precision. The ratio type represents fractions exactly, a facility not available in many languages. Common Lisp automatically coerces numeric values among these types as appropriate.

The Common Lisp ''[[character (computing)|character]]'' type is not limited to [[ASCII]] characters -- unsurprising, as Lisp predates ASCII. Some modern implementations allow [[Unicode]] characters. [http://www.cliki.net/Unicode%20Support]

The ''[[symbol]]'' type is common to Lisp languages, but largely unknown outside them. A symbol is a unique, named data object. Symbols in Lisp are similar to identifiers in other languages, in that they are used as variables to hold values; however, they are more general and can be used for themselves as well. Normally, when a symbol is evaluated, its value as a variable is returned. Exceptions exist: ''keyword'' symbols such as &lt;TT&gt;:foo&lt;/TT&gt; evaluate to themselves, and ''Boolean'' values in Common Lisp are represented by the reserved symbols &lt;TT&gt;T&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;NIL&lt;/TT&gt;.

===Data structures===
''Sequence'' types in Common Lisp include lists, vectors, bit-vectors, and strings. There are many operations which can work on any sequence type.

As in any other Lisp, ''lists'' in Common Lisp are composed of ''conses'', sometimes called ''cons cells'' or ''pairs''. A cons is a data structure with two slots, called its ''car'' and ''cdr''. A list is a linked chain of conses. Each cons's car refers to a member of the list (possibly another list). Each cons's cdr refers to the next cons -- except for the last cons, whose cdr refers to the &lt;TT&gt;nil&lt;/TT&gt; value. Conses can also easily be used to implement trees and other complex data structures; though it is usually advised to use structure
or class instances instead.

Common Lisp supports multidimensional ''arrays'', and can dynamically resize arrays if required. Multidimensional arrays can be used for matrix mathematics. A ''vector'' is a one-dimensional array. Arrays can carry any type as members (even mixed types in the same array) or can be specialized to contain a specific type of members, as in a vector of integers. Many implementations can optimize array functions when the array used is type-specialized. Two type-specialized array types are standard: a ''string'' is a vector of characters, while a ''bit-vector'' is a vector of [[bit]]s.

''[[Hash table]]s'' store associations between data objects. Any object may be used as key or value. Hash tables, like arrays, are automatically resized as needed.

''Packages'' are collections of symbols, used chiefly to separate the parts of a program into [[namespace]]s. A package may ''export'' some symbols, marking them as part of a public interface.

''Structures'', similar in use to [[C programming language|C]] structs and [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]] records, represent arbitrary complex data structures with any number and type of fields (called ''slots'').

Class ''instances'', similar to structures, but created by the object system, [[CLOS]].

===Functions===
In Common Lisp, the type of ''functions'' is a data type.  For instance, it is possible to write functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as well.  This makes it possible to describe very general operations. 

The Common Lisp library relies heavily on such higher-order functions. For example, the &lt;CODE&gt;sort&lt;/CODE&gt; function takes a [[comparison operator]] as an argument. This can be used not only to sort any type of data, but also to sort data structures according to a key.

 (sort (list 5 2 6 3 1 4) #'&gt;)
 ; Sorts the list using the &gt; function as the comparison operator.
 ; Returns (6 5 4 3 2 1).

 (sort (list '(9 a) '(3 b) '(4 c))
     #'(lambda (x y) (&lt; (car x) (car y))))
 ; Sorts the list according to the first element (car) of each sub-list.
 ; Returns ((3 b) (4 c) (9 a)).

The evaluation model for functions is very simple.  When the evaluator encounters a form &lt;code&gt;(F A1 A2...)&lt;/code&gt; then it is to assume that the symbol named F is one of the following:

# A special operator (easily checked against a fixed list)
# A macro operator (must have been defined previously)
# The name of a function (default), which may either be a symbol, or a sub-form beginning with the symbol &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt;.

If F is the name of a function, then the arguments A1, A2, ..., An are evaluated in left-to-right order, and the function is found and invoked with those values supplied as parameters.  

====Defining functions====

The macro &lt;CODE&gt;defun&lt;/CODE&gt; defines functions. 
A function definition gives the name of the function, the names of any arguments, and a function body:

 (defun square (x)
    (* x x))

Function definitions may include ''declarations'', which provide hints to the compiler about optimization settings or the data types of arguments. They may also include ''documentation strings'' (docstrings), which the Lisp system may use to provide interactive documentation:

 (defun square (x)
    &lt;EM&gt;(declare (number x) (optimize (speed 3) (debug 0) (safety 1)))
    &quot;Calculates the square of the number x.&quot;&lt;/EM&gt;
    (* x x))

Anonymous functions are defined using the &lt;CODE&gt;lambda&lt;/CODE&gt; special operator. Lisp programming style frequently uses higher-order functions for which it is useful to provide anonymous functions as arguments.

There are a number of other operators related to the definition and manipulation of functions. For instance, a function may be recompiled with the &lt;CODE&gt;compile&lt;/CODE&gt; operator. (Some Lisp systems run functions in an interpreter by default unless instructed to compile; others compile every entered function on the fly.)

====The function namespace====

The namespace for function names is separate from the namespace for data variables. This is a key difference between Common Lisp and [[Scheme programming language|Scheme]]. Operators which define names in the function namespace include &lt;code&gt;defun&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;flet&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;labels&lt;/code&gt;.

To pass a function by name as an argument to another function, one must use the &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; special operator, commonly abbreviated as #'. The first &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; example above refers to the function named by the symbol &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the function namespace, with the code &lt;code&gt;#'&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

[[Scheme programming language|Scheme]]'s evaluation model is simpler: there is only one namespace, and all positions in the form are evaluated (in any order) -- not just the arguments. Code written in one dialect is therefore sometimes confusing to programmers more experienced in the other. For instance, many CL programmers like to use descriptive variable names such as ''list'' or ''string'' which could cause problems in Scheme as they would locally shadow function names.

Whether a separate namespace for functions is an advantage is a source of contention in the Lisp community. It is usually referred to as the ''Lisp-1 vs. Lisp-2 debate''. These names were coined in a 1988 paper by [[Richard P. Gabriel]] and [[Kent Pitman]], which extensively compares the two approaches. [http://www.nhplace.com/kent/Papers/Technical-Issues.html]

===Other types===
Other data types in Common Lisp include:

*''Pathnames'' represent files and directories in the [[filesystem]]. The Common Lisp pathname facility is more general than most operating systems' file naming conventions, making Lisp programs' access to files broadly portable across diverse systems.
*Input and output ''streams'' represent sources and sinks of binary or textual data, such as the terminal or open files.
*Common Lisp has a built-in [[pseudo-random number generator]]. ''Random state'' objects represent reusable sources of pseudo-random numbers, allowing the user to seed the PRNG or cause it to replay a sequence.
*''Conditions'' are a type used to represent errors, exceptions, and other &quot;interesting&quot; events to which a program may respond.
*''Classes'' are first-class objects, and are themselves instances of classes called metaclasses.

Common Lisp also includes a toolkit for [[object-oriented programming]], the Common Lisp Object System or [[CLOS]], which is one of the most powerful object systems available in any language.

===Macros===
A ''[[macro]]'' in Lisp superficially resembles a function in usage. However, rather than representing an expression which is evaluated, it represents a transformation of the program source code.

Macros allow Lisp programmers to create new syntactic forms in the language. For instance, this macro provides the &lt;CODE&gt;until&lt;/CODE&gt; loop form, which may be familiar from languages such as [[Perl]]:

&lt;pre&gt;
 (defmacro until (test &amp;body body)
   `(do ()
        (,test)
      ,@body))

 ;; example
 (until (= (random 10) 0) 
   (write-line &quot;Hello&quot;))
&lt;/pre&gt;

All macros must be expanded before the source code containing them can be evaluated or compiled normally.  Macros can be considered functions that
accept and return abstract syntax trees (Lisp S-expressions).  These functions 
are invoked before the evaluator or compiler to produce the final source code.
Macros are written in normal Common Lisp, and may use any Common Lisp (or third-party) operator available.  The backquote notation used above is provided
by Common Lisp specifically to simplify the common case of substitution into
a code template.

====Variable capture and shadowing====
Common Lisp macros are capable of ''variable capture'', a situation in which symbols in the macro-expansion body coincide with those in the calling context. Variable capture is sometimes a desired effect: it allows the programmer to create macros wherein various symbols have special meaning. However, it can also introduce unexpected and unusual errorger Stripe]]

'''Criminology''' is the study of [[crime]] as a social phenomenon, including the causes and consequences of crime, criminal [[behavior]], as well as the development of, and impact of [[Law|laws]].  Research in criminology applies the [[scientific method]] to test [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] and ultimately develop theories that help explain the causes and other aspects of crime.  Though both deal with crime, criminology differs from [[criminal justice]] in that latter focuses on the components of the justice system including [[police]], [[courts]], and [[corrections]].  


==Schools of thought==
Over time, several [[school (discipline)|schools]] of thought have developed and are listed in the infobox. The main thematic distinction has been between the: 
[[Classical school|Classical School]] associated with [[Cesare Beccaria]], [[Jeremy Bentham]], and others who have argued that:
* People have free will to choose how to act.
* [[Deterrence]] is based upon the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] [[ontology|ontological]] notion of the human being a 'hedonist' who seeks pleasure and avoids pain, and a 'rational calculator' weighing up the costs and benefits of the consequences of each action. Thus, it ignores the possibility of irrationality and unconscious drives as motivational factors.
* [[Punishment]] (of sufficient severity) can deter people from crime, as the costs (penalties) outweigh benefits.
and the
[[Positivist school|Positivist School]] which presumes that criminal behaviour is caused by [[biology|biological]], [[psychology|psychological]], or social determining factors that predispose some people towards crime. [[Cesare Lombroso]], an Italian prison doctor working in the late 19th century and sometimes regarded as the &quot;father&quot; of criminology, was one of the largest contributors to biological positivism, which alleged that physiological traits such as the measurements of one's cheek bones or hairline, or a cleft palate, considered to be throwbacks to [[Neanderthal]] man, were indicative of &quot;[[atavism|atavistic]]&quot; criminal tendencies. This approach, influenced by the earlier theory of [[phrenology]] and by [[Charles Darwin]] and his [[theory of evolution]], has been superseded, but more modern research examines genetic characteristics and the chemistry of [[nutrition]] to determine whether there is an effect on violent behaviour (see [[Natural Justice]]). [[Hans Eysenck]] (1964, 1977), a British psychologist, claimed that psychological factors such as Extraversion and Neuroticism made a person more likely to commit criminal acts. He also includes a Psychoticism dimension that includes traits similar to the psychopathic profile, developed by Cleckley and later Hare. He also based his model on early parental [[socialisation]] of the [[child]]; his approach bridges the gap between biological explanations and environmental or social learning based approaches (see e.g. social psychologists [[Burrhus Frederic Skinner|B. F. Skinner]] (1938) and [[Albert Bandura]] (1973).  Sociological positivism (the father of which is considered to be [[Emile Durkheim]]) postulates that societal factors such as [[poverty]], membership of subcultures, or low levels of [[education]] can predispose people to crime.

==Theories of crime==
There are many theories, including:
===[[Strain theory]]===
Based on the work of American sociologist [[Robert K. Merton|Robert Merton]], this theory suggests that mainstream [[culture]], especially in the [[United States]], is saturated with dreams of opportunity, freedom and prosperity; as Merton put it, the ''American Dream''.  Most people buy into this dream and it becomes a powerful cultural and psychological motivation.  Merton also used the term ''anomie'', but it meant something slightly different for him than it did for [[Durkheim]]; he saw the term as meaning a dichotomy between what society expected of its citizens, and what those citizens could actually achieve.  Therefore, if the social structure of opportunities is unequal and prevents the majority from realising the dream, some of them will turn to illegitimate means (crime) in order to realise it. Others will retreat or drop out into deviant subcultures (&quot;hobos&quot;: urban homeless drunks and drug abusers).

===[[Symbolic interactionism]]===
Drawing on the phenomenology of [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[George Herbert Mead]], [[subcultural theory]] and [[conflict theory]], this school of thought focused on the relationship between the powerful state, media and conservative ruling elite on the one hand, and the less powerful groups on the other. The powerful groups had the ability to become the 'significant other' in the less powerful groups' processes of generating meaning. The former could to some extent impose their meanings on the latter, and therefore they were able to 'label' minor delinquent youngsters as criminal. These youngsters would often take on board the label, indulge in crime more readily and become actors in the 'self-fulfilling prophecy' of the powerful groups. Later developments in this set of theories were by [[Howard Becker]] and [[Edwin Lemert]], in the mid 20th century; also by [[Stanley Cohen]] who developed the concept of &quot;[[moral panic]]&quot; (describing societal reaction to spectacular, alarming social phenomena such as post-World War Two youth cultures (e.g. the ''[[Mods and Rockers]]'' in the UK in 1964), AIDS and football hooliganism.

===British and American subcultural theory===
Following on from the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] and Strain Theory, and also drawing on [[Edwin Sutherland|Edwin H. Sutherland]]'s idea of [[differential association]], subcultural theorists focused on small cultural groups fragmenting away from the mainstream to form their own values and meanings about life. Some of these groups, especially from poorer areas where opportunities were scarce, might adopt criminal values and meanings. British subcultural theorists focused more heavily on the issue of class, where some criminal activities were seen as 'imaginary solutions' to the problem of belonging to a subordinate class.

==Types and definitions of crime==
Both the Positivist and Classical Schools take a consensus view of crime &amp;ndash; that a crime is an act that violates the basic values and beliefs of society.  Those values and beliefs are manifested as laws that society agrees upon.  However, there are two types of laws:
* Natural laws are rooted in core values shared by many cultures.  Natural laws protect against harm to persons (e.g. murder, rape, assault) or property (theft, larceny, robbery), and form the basis of [[common law]] systems.
* [[Statutory law|Statutes]] are enacted by [[legislature]]s and reflect current cultural [[mores]], albeit that some laws may be controversial, e.g. laws that prohibit [[cannabis|marijuana]] use and [[gambling]]. [[Marxist criminology|Marxist Criminology]], [[Conflict criminology|Conflict Criminology]] and Critical Criminology claim that most relationships between [[State]] and [[citizen]] are non-consensual and, as such, [[criminal law]] is not necessarily representative of public beliefs and wishes: it is exercised in the interests of the ruling or dominant class.  The more right wing criminologies tend to posit that there is a consensual [[social contract]] between State and citizen.

Therefore, definitions of crimes will vary from place to place, in accordance to the cultural [[norm (sociology)|norms]] and mores, but may be broadly classified as:
*[[blue-collar crime]];
*[[corporate crime]];
*[[organised crime]];
*[[political crime]];
*[[public order crime]];
*[[state crime]];
*[[state-corporate crime]];
*[[white-collar crime]].

==Educational programs==
There is now a huge number of undergraduate and postgraduate criminology degrees available around the world. The present popularity of such degrees may in part be due to criminal and police television dramas that capture people's imaginations, but could also be because of growing awareness as to the continuing importance of issues relating to law, rules, compliance, politics, terrorism, security, forensic science, the media, deviance, and punishment.

Criminology is an multi-disciplinary field; [[criminologists]] may have degrees in criminology, [[law]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[social policy]], [[political science]], [[anthropology]], or other subjects. Criminology may involve [[crime statistics]], [[criminal psychology]], [[forensics|forensic science]], [[law enforcement]], and [[detective|investigative]] methods; academically, these areas are somewhat marginal to criminology.

[[Image:Wall_clock.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A wall clock]]

A '''clock''' (from the [[Latin]] ''cloca'', &quot;[[bell (instrument) |bell]]&quot;) is an instrument for measuring [[time]]. (Usually, for measuring time of intervals less than a day--as opposed to a calendar.) Those used for technical purposes, of very high accuracy, are sometimes called [[chronometer]]s.  A portable clock is called a [[watch]]. The clock in its most common modern form (in use since at least the [[14th century]]) displays the hours, minutes, and sometimes seconds that pass over a twelve or twenty-four-hour period.

==History==
[[Image:IncenseAlarmClock.JPG|222px|thumbnail|left||A replica of an ancient Chinese [[incense clock]]]] 

The clock is one of the oldest human inventions.  In principle, it requires no more than some physical process which will proceed at a known rate, and a way to gauge how long that process has been continuing. As the seasons and the phases of the moon can be used to measure the passage of longer periods of time, shorter processes could be used to measure off hours and minutes.  The [[sundial]], which measures the time of day by the direction of shadows cast by the sun, was widely known in ancient times. Candles and sticks of incense which burn down at approximately predictable speeds have also been used as clocks.  In an [[hourglass]] fine [[sand]] pours through a tiny hole at a predictable rate.

The historian [[Vitruvius]] reported that the [[ancient Egyptian]]s also used a [[Water clock|clepsydra]], a time mechanism run by flowing water. Historians disagree over the [[Antikythera mechanism]] but this is largely thought to be an early mechanical clock. By the [[9th century AD]] a [[clockwork|mechanical timekeeper]] had been developed that lacked only an [[escapement]] mechanism. There is a record that in [[1176]] [[Sens Cathedral]] installed a &amp;lsquo;horologe&amp;rsquo;&amp;mdash;the word still used in French for large clocks. (from Greek ''hora'', hour, and ''legein'', to tell).  This word has led scholars to believe that these tower clocks did not employ hands or dials, but “told” the time with audible signals such as bells.

A variety of mechanical clocks were produced by Spanish Muslim engineers, both large and small, and this knowledge was transmitted to Europe through Latin translations of Islamic books on mechanics. These clocks were weight-driven. Designs and illustrations of epi-cyclic and segmental gears were provided. One such clock included a mercury escapement. The latter type was directly copied by Europeans during the 15th century. In addition, during the 9th century, Ibn Firnas of Islamic Spain, according to Will Durant, invented a watch-like device which kept accurate time. The [[Muslims]] also constructed a variety of highly accurate astronomical clocks for use in their observatories.

The earliest reasonably accurate clocks are the [[13th century]] tower clocks probably developed for (and perhaps by) monks in Northern Italy. These were used to announce the [[canonical hours]] or intervals between set times of prayer. [[Canonical hours]] differ in length, and varied as the times of sunrise and sunset shifted.

The world's first self-striking clock was said to be invented by Chang Yeong-Sil, a chief enginner of Korea, in Korea during the [[Joseon Dynasty]]. It was called ''Chagyongru'', which means &quot;self-striking clock&quot; in Korean. [http://www.maxmon.com/1434ad.htm] [http://www.indiana.edu/~easc/resources/korea_slides/science/9-1.htm]

The earliest table clocks that survive in any quantity are mid-[[16th century]] ones from the metalworking towns of [[Nuremberg]] and [[Augsburg]]. These clocks have only one hand. The dial between the hour markers is divided into four equal parts making the clocks readable to the nearest 15 minutes. 

[[image:big.ben.scaled.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The massive clock on [[Big Ben]], [[London]], [[England]]. The  5 foot 4 inch (1.63 m) person &quot;holding on&quot; to the six o'clock marking has been inserted into the picture at correct scale. The hour hand is 9 feet (2.7 m) long and the minute hand is 14 feet (4.3 m) long]] 

The next major development in accuracy occurred in [[1657]] with the invention of the [[pendulum clock]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] had the idea to use a swinging bob to propel the motion of a time telling device earlier in the [[17th century]].  [[Christiaan Huygens]], however, is usually credited as the inventor.  He determined the mathematical formula that related pendulum length to time  (99.38 cm or 39.13 inches for the one second movement) and had the first pendulum driven clock made.  In [[1670]], the English clockmaker [[William Clement]] created the [[anchor escapement]], an improvement over Huygens' [[crown escapement]]. Within just one generation, [[minute]] hands and then [[second]] hands were added.

The excitement over the pendulum clock attracted the attention of designers resulting in a proliferation of clock forms. Notably, the longcase clock (aka [[grandfather clock]]) was created to house the pendulum and works. The English clockmaker [[William Clement]], inventor of the [[anchor escapement]], is credited with developing this form in [[1670]].  It was also at this time that clock cases began to be made of wood and [[clock face]]s to employ [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]].  On [[November 17]], [[1797]], [[Eli Terry]] received his first [[patent]] for a clock.  Terry is known as the founder of the American clock-making industry.

The development of [[electronics]] in the [[twentieth century]] led to clocks with no clockwork parts at all.  Time in these cases is measured in several ways, such as by the behaviour of [[quartz]] crystals, or the decay of radioactive elements.  Even mechanical clocks have since come to be largely powered by batteries, removing the need for winding.

==Types==
There are four major types of clocks.

===Analog clocks===
[[Analog signal|Analog]] clocks may be [[mechanical clock|mechanical]] or have a [[quartz movement]]. A [[clock face]] is the part of an [[analog signal|analog]] clock that tells time through the use of a fixed numbered dial or dials and moving hand or hands. It usually has a circular scale of 12 [[hour]]s, which also serves as a scale of 60 [[minute]]s, and often also as a scale of 60 [[second]]s. The [[analog clock with digital display]] emulates a digital clock but with an analog movement. The ultimate analog clock is the [[sundial]], which tracks the sun continuously, registering the time by the shadow of its [[gnomon]].

[[image:Digital-clock-radio-basic.jpg|thumb|Basic digital clock radio.]]

===Digital clocks===
[[Digital clock]]s use electronic methods of keeping time.  Battery operated digital clocks such as wrist watches use a quartz crystal oscillator for time keeping, whereas mains-powered clocks, such as bed-side alarm clocks, use typically the 50 or 60 [[hertz]] oscillation of [[AC power]] or a [[crystal oscillator]] as in a [[quartz movement]]. A [[digital]] clock typically displays a numerical hour range of 0-23, or 1-12 (with an indication of [[12-hour_clock|AM or PM]]) using an [[LCD]] or [[LED]] display, although digital versions of analog-style faces exist.  Mains-driven digital clocks are often reset after a power failure, and, typically, begin flashing to alert us that the time they display is incorrect.  After a reset digital clocks lacking a backup [[battery (electricity)|battery]] either start counting from 00:00, or stay 00:00 to indicate that their time needs to be set.

===Textual clocks===

Textual clocks present the time visually in the form of [[natural language]].  For instance, in english, the time 12:35 could be represented as &quot;Twelve thirty-five&quot;.  Some versions of these clocks use a more approximate version intended to be relaxing, such as &quot;About twelve thirty&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/cgi-bin/access.cgi?uri=/journals/modernism-modernity/v006/6.1whittier-ferguson.html  Project Muse]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auditory Clocks===

For convenience, distance, telephony or blindness, auditory clocks present the time as sounds.   
the form is either spoken [[natural language]], (e.g. &quot;The time is twelve thirty-five&quot;), or as auditory codes (e.g. number of sequential bell rings on the hour represents the number of the hour like the clock [[Big Ben]]).

&lt;!-- Keep this line break; it prevents the digital clock picture from overlapping into the next section and thus neatens up the page --&gt;
&lt;br clear=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;

==Purposes==
Clocks are in homes and offices; smaller ones ([[watch]]es) are carried; larger ones are in public places, e.g. a [[train station]] or [[church]]. A small clock is often shown in a corner of [[computer display]]s or [[mobile phone]]s.

The main purpose of a clock is not always to ''display'' the time. 
It may also be used to ''control'' a device according to time, e.g. an alarm clock, a [[VCR]], or a time [[bomb]] (see: [[counter]]). 

Practically all [[computer]]s depend on an accurate internal [[clock signal]] to allow synchronized processing. (A few research projects are developing CPUs based on [[asynchronous circuit]]s). Some computers also maintain time and date for all manner of operations whether these be for alarms, event initiation or just to display the time of day.

===Ideal clocks===
An [[ideal clock]] is a scientific principle that measures the ratio of the duration of natural processes, and thus will give the time measure for use in physical theories. Therefore, to define an ideal clock in terms of any physical theory would be circular. An ideal clock is more appropriately defined in relationship to the set of all physical processes.
[[Image:PDphotos-or who fled without weapons or armour. 

Charles had watched the Iberian situation since Toulouse, convinced the Muslims would return, and while he was securing his own realms, he was also preparing for war against the [[Umayyad]]s.  It is vital to note that Charles had used an extremely &amp;mdash; for the time &amp;mdash; controversial method of maintaining a standing army, one he could train as a core of veterans to add to the usual conscripts the Franks called up in time of war.  During the [[Dark Ages]], troops were only available after the crops had been planted, and before harvesting time.  Charles believed he needed a standing army, one he could train, to counter the Muslim heavy cavalry, of which, at the time, he had none.  To train the kind of infantry which could withstand heavy cavalry, Charles needed them yearround, and he needed to pay them, so their families could buy the food they would have otherwise grown.  To obtain this money, he seized church lands and property, and used the funds to pay his soldiers.  The same Charles who had secured the support of the ''ecclesia'' by donating land, seized some of it back between 724 and 732.  The Church was enraged, and, for a time, it looked as though Charles might even be excommunicated for his actions.  But then came a significant invasions . . .

===Eve of Tours===
It has been noted that Charles Martel could have pursued the wars against the Saxons - but he was determined to prepare for what he thought was a greater danger. Instead of concentrating on conquest to his east, he prepared for the storm gathering in the west. Well aware of the danger posed by the [[Muslim]]s after the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]], in [[721]], it has been explained that he used the intervening years to consolidate his power, and gather and train a veteran army that would stand ready to defend [[Christianity]] itself (at [[Tours]]). Moreever, after his victory at [[Tours]], Martel continued on in campaigns in [[736]]-[[737]] to drive other Muslim armies from bases in [[Gaul]] after they again attempted to get a foothold in [[Europe]] beyond [[al-Andalus]]. [[Edward Gibbon]] calles Martel &quot;the paramount prince of his age&quot;. 

It is also vital to note that the Muslims were not aware, at that time, of the true strength of the Franks.  They considered the Germanic tribes, of which the Franks were part, simply barbarians, and were not particularly concerned about them.  (the Arab Chronicles, the history of that age, show that awareness of the Franks as a growing military power only came after the Battle of Tours when the Caliph expressed shock at his army's disastrous defeat) Thus, when they launched their great invasion of 732, they were not prepared to confront Charles Martel and his Frankish army.   This, in retrospect, was a disastrous mistake.   Emir Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi was a good general and should have done two things he utterly failed to do.  He assumed that the Franks would not come to the aid of their Aquitanian cousins, and thus failed to assess their strength in advance of invasion.  He also failed to scout the movements of the Frankish army.  Having done either, he would have curtailed his lighthorse ravaging throughout lower Gaul, and marched at once with his full power against the Franks.  This would not have allowed Charles Martel to pick the time and place the two powers would collide, which all historians agree was pivotal to his victory.

==Battle of Tours==
:''Main article [[Battle of Tours]]''. 

===Leadup and importance===
The [[Cordoba]]n [[emirate]] had previously invaded [[Gaul]] and had been stopped in its northward sweep at the Battle of Toulouse, in 721. The hero of that less celebrated event had been Odo the Great, Duke of Aquitane, who was not the progenitor of a race of kings and patron of chroniclers.  It has previously been explained how Odo defeated the invading Muslims, but when they returned, things were far different.  In the interim, the arrival of a new [[emir of Cordoba]], [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]], who brought with him a huge force of Arabs and [[Berber]] horsemen, triggered a far greater invasion.  This time the Muslim horsemen were ready for battle, and the results were horrific for the Aquintanians.  Odo, hero of Toulouse, was badly defeated in the Muslim invasion of [[732]] at the [[Battle of the River Garonne]]&amp;mdash;where the western chroniclers state, &quot;God alone knows the number of the slain&quot;&amp;mdash;and fled to Charles, seeking help.  Thus, Odo faded into history, and Charles marched into it.   

The [[Battle of Tours]] earned Charles the [[cognomen]] &quot;Martel&quot;, for the merciless way he hammered his enemies. Many historians, including the great military historian [[Edward Shepherd Creasy|Sir Edward Creasy]], believe that had he failed at Tours, [[Islam]] would probably have overrun [[Gaul]], and perhaps the remainder of Christian [[Europe]].   Other reputable historians that echo Creasy's belief that this battle was central to the halt of Islamic expansion into Europe include William Watson, and Edward Gibbon believed the fate of [[Christianity]] hinged on this battle.  This opinion was very popular for most of modern historiography, but it fell somewhat out of style in the [[twentieth century]].  Some historians, such as Bernard Lewis,  claimed that Arabs had little intention of occupying northern France.  This opinion has once more fallen out of style and the Battle of Tours is usually considered by historian's today as a very significant event in the history of Europe and Christianity.

In the modern era, Norwich, the foremost authority on the [[Byzantine Empire]], says the Franks halting Muslim Expansion at Tours literally preserved Christianity as we know it. A more realistic viewpoint may be found in ''Barbarians, Marauders, and Infidels'' by Antonio Santosuosso, Professor Emeritus of History at the University of Western Ontario, and considered an expert historian in the era in dispute in this article. It was published in 2004, and has quite an interesting modern expert opinion on Charles Martel, Tours, and the subsequent campaigns against Rahman's successor in 736-737. Santosuosso makes a compelling case that these defeats of invading Muslim Armies, were at least as important as Tours in their defense of western Christianity, and the preservation of those Christian monasteries and centers of learning which ultimately led Europe out of the dark ages. He also makes a compelling case that while Tours was unquestionably of macrohistorical importance, the later battles were at least equally so. Both invading forces defeated in those campaigns had come to set up permanent outposts for expansion, and there can be no doubt that these three defeats combined broke the back of European expansion by Islam while the Caliphate was still united. While some modern assessments of the battle's impact have backed away from the extreme of Gibbon's position, Gibbons's conjecture is supported by other historians such as Edward Shepard Creasy and William E. Watson. Most modern historians such as Norwich and Santosuosso generally support the concept of Tours as a macrohistorical event favoring western civilization and Christianity . Military writers such as Robert W. Martin, &quot;''The Battle of Tours is still felt today&quot;'', also argue that Tours was such a turning point in favor of western civilization and Christianity that its aftereffect remains to this day.  This is the majority view of the battle as it is viewed today.

===Battle===
The Battle of Tours probably took place somewhere between Tours and [[Poitiers]] (hence its other name: Battle of Poitiers). The Frankish army, under Charles Martel, consisted mostly of veteran [[infantry]], somewhere between 15,000 and 75,000 men.  Responding to the Muslim invasion, the Franks had avoided the old Roman roads, hoping to take the invaders by surprise.  Martel believed it was absolutely essential that he not only take the Muslims by surprise, but that he be allowed to select the ground on which the battle would be fought, ideally a high, wooded, plain where the Islamic horsemen, already tired from carrying armour, would be further exhausted charging uphill.  Further, the woods would aid the Franks in their defensive square by partially impeding the ability of the Muslim horesmen from making a clear charge.  

From the Muslim accounts of the battle, they were indeed taken by surprise to find a large force opposing their expected sack of Tours, and they waited for six days, scouting the enemy.  They did not like charging uphill, against an unknown number of foe, who seemed well disciplined and well disposed for battle.  But the weather was also a factor.  The Germanic Franks, in their wolf and bear pelts, were more used the cold, better dressed for it, and despite not having tents, which the Muslims did, were prepared to wait as long as needed, the fall only growing colder.  

On the seventh day, the Muslim army, consisting of between 60,000 and 400,000 horsemen and led by Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi, attacked. During the battle, the Franks defeated the Islamic army and the emir was killed. While Western accounts are sketchy, Arab accounts are fairly detailed in describing how the Franks formed a large square and fought a brilliant defensive battle. Rahman had doubts before the battle that his men were ready for such a struggle, and should have had them abandon the loot which hindered them, but instead decided to trust his horsemen, who had never failed him. Indeed, it was thought impossible for infantry of that age to withstand armoured mounted warriors. Martel managed to inspire his men to stand firm against a force which must have seemed invincible to them, huge mailed horsemen, who in addition probably badly outnumbered the Franks.  In one of the rare instances where medieval infantry stood up against cavalry charges, the disciplined Frankish soldiers withstood the assaults, though according to Arab sources, the Arab cavalry several times broke into the interior of the Frankish square. But despite this, Franks did not break, and it is probably best expressed by a translation of an Arab account of the battle from the Medieval Source Book: &quot;And in the shock of the battle the men of the North seemed like North a sea that cannot be moved. Firmly they stood, one close to another, forming as it were a bulwark of ice; and with great blows of their swords they hewed down the Arabs. Drawn up in a band around their chief, the people of the Austrasians carried all before them. Their tireless hands drove their swords down to the breasts of the foe.&quot;  Both Western and Muslim accounts of the battle agree that sometime during the height of the fighting, scouts sent by Martel to the Muslim camp began freeing prisoners, and fearing loss of their plunder, a large portion of the Muslim army abandoned the battle, and returned to camp to protect their spoils.  In attempting to stop what appeared to be a retreat, Abdul Rahman was surrounded and killed by the Franks, and what started as a ruse ended up a real retreat, as the Muslim army fled the field that day.  They could have probably resumed the battle the following morning, but Rahman's death led to bickering between the surviving generals, and the Arabs abandoned the battlefield the day after his death, leaving Martel a unique place in history as the savior of Europe and a brilliant general in age not known for its generalship. Martel's Franks, virtually all infantry without armour, managed to withstand mailed horsemen, without the aid of bows or firearms, a feat of arms almost unheard of in medieval history.

==After Tours==
In the subsequent decade, Charles led the Frankish army against the eastern duchies, Bavaria and Alemannia, and the southern duchies, [[Aquitaine]] and [[Provence]].  He dealt with the ongoing conflict with the [[Frisia]]ns and [[Saxons]] to his northeast with some success, but full conquest of the Saxons and their incorporation into the Frankish empire would wait for his grandson Charlemagne, primarily because Martel concentrated the bulk of his efforts against Muslim expansion.  

So instead of concentrating on conquest to his east, he continued expanding Frankish authority in the west, and denying the Emirite of Córdoba a foothold in Europe. After his victory at Tours, Martel continued on in campaigns in [[736]] and [[737]] to drive other Muslim armies from bases in Gaul after they again attempted to get a foothold in Europe beyond al-Andalus. His victories at Berre and Narbonne again expelled invading Islamic armies.

===Wars from 732-737===
Between his victory of 732 and [[735]], Charles reorganised the kingdom of [[Burgundy]], replacing the counts and dukes with his loyal supporters, thus strengthening his hold on power.  He was forced, by the ventures of [[Radbod, King of the Frisians|Radbod]], [[rulers of Frisia|duke of the Frisians]] (719-734), son of the Duke Aldegisel who had accepted the missionaries Willibrord and Boniface, to invade independence-minded Frisia again in [[734]].  In that year, he slew the duke, who had expelled the Christian missionaries, in battle and so wholly subjugated the populace (he destroyed every pagan shrine) that the people were peaceful for twenty years after.  

The dynamic changed in 735 because of the death of Odo the Great, who had been forced to acknowledge, albeit reservedly, the suzerainty of Charles in 719.  Though Charles wished to unite the duchy directly to himself and went there to elicit the proper homage of the Aquitainians, the nobility proclaimed Odo's son, [[Hunold]], whose dukeship Charles recognised when the Arabs invaded Provence the next year.  

This naval Arab invasion was headed by Abdul Rahman's son.  It landed in [[Narbonne]] in 736 and took [[Arles]].  Charles, the conflict with Hunold temporarily put on a back burner, descended on the Provençal strongholds of the Muslims.  In 736, he retook [[Montfrin]] and [[Avignon]], and Arles and [[Aix-en-Provence]] with the help of [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards]].  [[Nîmes]], [[Agde]], and [[Béziers]], held by Isalm since [[725]], fell to him and their fortresses destroyed.  He defeated a mighty host outside of Narbonne, but failed to take the city.  Provence, however, he successfully rid of its foreign occupiers.

Notable about these campaigns was Charles' incorporation, for the first time, of heavy cavalry with stirrups to augment his [[phalanx]].  His ability to coordinate infantry and cavalry veterans was unequaled in that era and enabled him to face superior numbers of invaders, and decisively defeat them again and again.  Some historians believe Narbonne in particular was as imporant a victory for Christian Europe as Tours.  In ''Barbarians, Marauders, and Infidels'',  [[Antonio Santosuosso]], Professor Emeritus of History at the [[University of Western Ontario]], and considered an expert historian in the era in dispute, puts forth an interesting modern opinion on Martel, Tours, and the subsequent campaigns against Rahman's son in 736-737. Santosuosso presents a compelling case that these later defeats of invading Muslim armies were at least as important as Tours in their defence of Western Christendom and the preservation of Western monasticism, the monasteries of which were the centers of learning which ultimately led Europe out of her Dark Ages. He also makes a compelling argument, after studying the Arab histories of the period, that these were clearly armies of invasion, sent by the Caliph not just to avenge Tours, but to conquer Christian Europe and bring it into the Caliphate.  Thus, Charles again championed Christianity and halted Muslim expansion into Europe, as the window was closing on Islamic ability to do so.  These defeats were the last great attempt at expansion by the Umayyad Caliphate before the destruction of the dynasty at the [[Battle of the Zab]], and the rending of the Caliphate forever.

===Interregnum===
In 737, at the tail end of his campaigning in Provence and [[Septimania]], the king, Theuderic IV, died.  Martel, titling himself ''maior domus'' and ''princeps et dux Francorum'', did not appoint a new king and nobody acclaimed one.  The throne lay vacant until Martel's death.  As the historian [[Charles Oman]] says (''The Dark Ages'', pg 297), &quot;he cared not for name or style so long as the real power was in his hands&quot;.

The interregnum, the final four years of Charle's life, was more peaceful than most of it had been and much of his time was now spent on administrative and organisational plans to create a more efficient state.  Though, in [[738]], he compelled the Saxons of [[Westphalia]] to do him homage and pay tribute.  Charles set about integrating the outlying realms of his empire into the Frankish church.  He erected four diocese in Bavaria ([[Salzburg]], [[Regensburg]], [[Freising]], and [[Passau]]) and gave them Boniface as [[archbishop]] and [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] over all Germany east of the Rhine, with his seat at [[Mainz]].  In [[739]], [[Pope Gregory III]] begged Charles for his aid against Liutprand.  But Charles was loathe to fight his onetime ally and ignored the papal pleas.   Nonetheless, the Papal applications for Frankish protection showed how far Martel had come from the days he was tottering on excommunication, and set the stage for his son and grandson to literally rearrange Italy to suit the Papacy, and protect it.

==Death==
Charles Martel died on [[October 22]], [[741]], at [[Quierzy-sur-Oise]] in what is today the [[Aisne]] ''[[département in France|département]]'' in the [[Picardy]] region of France. He was buried at [[Saint Denis Basilica]] in [[Paris]]. His territories were divided among his adult sons a year earlier: to [[Carloman, son of Charles Martel|Carloman]] he gave Austrasia and Alemannia (with Bavaria as a vassal), to [[Pippin the Younger]] Neustria and Burgundy (with Aquitaine as a vassal), and to [[Grifo]] nothing, though some sources indicate he intended to give him a strip of land between Neustria and Austrasia.  

As noted, Gibbon called him &quot;the paramount prince of his age.&quot;  A strong argument can be made that Gibbon was correct.

==Legacy==
At the beginning of Charles Martel's career, he had many internal opponents and felt the need to appoint his own kingly claimant, Clotaire IV.  By his end, however, the dynamics of rulership in Francia had changed, no hallowed Meroving was needed, neither for defence nor legitimacy: Charles divided his realm between his sons without opposition (though he ignored his young son [[Bernhard, son of Charles Martel|Bernard]].  In between, he strengthened the Frankish state by consistently defeating, through superior generalship, the host of hostile foreign nations which beset it on all sides, including the heathen Saxons, which his grandson Charlemagne would fully subdue, and Moors, which he halted on a path of continental domination.

Charles was that rarest of commodities in the Dark Ages: a brilliant stategic general, who also was a tactical commander ''par excellance'', able in the crush and heat of battle to adapt his plans to his foes forces and movement &amp;mdash; and amazingly, defeated them repeatedly, especially when, as at Tours, they were far superior in men and weaponry, and at Berre and Narbonne, when they were superior in numbers of brave fighting men. Charles had the last quality which defines genuine greatness in a military commander: he foresaw the dangers of his foes, and prepared for them with care; he used ground, time, place, and fierce loyalty of his troops to offset his foes superior weaponry and tactics; third, he adapted, again and again, to the enemy on the battlefield, cooly shifting to compensate for the unforeseen and unforeseeable.

===Beginning of the Reconquista===
It is vital to note that Martel's victory at Tours, and his later campaigns, prevented invasion of Europe while the unified Caliphate was able to do so.  In doing so, Martel probably preserved Christianity and [[western civilisation]] as we know it. Although it took another two generations for the Franks to drive all the Arab garrisons out of Septimania and across the Pyrenees, Charles Martel's halt of the invasion of French soil turned the tide of Islamic advances, and the unification of the Frankish kingdoms under Martel, his son Pippin the Younger, and his grandson Charlemagne created a western power which prevented the Emirate of Córdoba from expanding over the Pyrenees.  Martel, who in 732 was on the verge of excommunication, instead was recognised by the Church as its paramount defender.  [[Pope Gregory II]] wrote him more than once, asking his protection and aid [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/g2-martellet.html], and he remained, till his death, fixated on stopping the Muslims.  Martel's son kept his father's promise and returned and took Narbonne by siege in [[759]], and his grandson, Charlamagne, actually established the ''Marca Hispanica'' across the Pyrenees in part of what today is Catalonia, reconquering Girona in [[785]] and Barcelona in [[801]]. This formed a permanent buffer zone against Islam, which became the basis, along with the King of Asturias, named Pelayo (718-737, who started his fight against the Moors in the mountains of [[Covadonga]], 722) and his descendants, for the Reconquista until all of the Muslims were expelled from Iberia.

===Military legacy===
In his vision of what would be necessary for him to withstand a larger force and superior technology (the Muslim horsemen had the [[stirrup]], which made the first [[knight]]s possible), he, daring not to send his few horsemen against the Islamic cavalry, trained his army to fight in a formation used by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]]s to withstand superior numbers and weapons by discipline, courage, and a willingness to die for their cause: a phalanx.  After using this infantry force by itself at Tours, he studied the foe's forces, and further adapted to them.  After 732, he began the integration of heavy cavalry, using the stirrup, and mailed armour, into his army, and trained his infantry to fight in conjunction with cavalry, a tactic which stood him in good stead during his campaigns of 736-7, especially at the Battle of Narbonne.  Martel's ability to use what he had, integrate new ideas and technology, earned him his reputation for brilliant generalship in an age generally bereft of same, and was the reason he was undefeated from 716 to his death, against a wide range of opponents, including the Muslim cavalry, at that time the world's best.   

The defeats Martel inflicted on the Muslims were absolutely vital in that the split in the Islamic world left the [[Caliphate]] unable to mount an all out attack on Europe via its Iberian stronghold after [[750]].  His ability to meet this challenge, until the Muslims self destructed, is of macrohisorical importance, and is why [[Dante]] writes of him in Heaven as one of the &quot;Defenders of the Faith.&quot;  The struggle between the [[Umayyad]]s and the [[Abbasid]]s, which came to a head during this period, left the Arabs unable to mount another massive invasion before they lost the base they needed from which to do it. The door to Europe, the Iberian emirate, was in the hands of the Umayyads, while most of the remainder of the Muslim world came under the control of the Abbasids, making an invasion of Europe a logistical impossibility while the two Muslim empires battled. There was no unified Caliphate to mount an invasion, and no foothold to launch such an invasion from.  Instead, al-Andalus (Umayyad Emirate was busy fighting off challenges from the Abbasids in Bagdad to think of invading Europe) and the Abbasid caliphate needed the foothold in Iberia which they lacked.  This put off invasion of Europe until the [[Ott[[Agrigentum]], the Carthaginian forces were ravaged by plague, Hannibal Mago himself succumbing to it. Although his successor, [[Himilco]], successfully extended the campaign by breaking a Greek siege, capturing the city of [[Gela]] and repeatedly defeating the army of [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius]], the new tyrant of Syracuse, he, too, was weakened by the plague and forced to [[sue for peace]] before returning to Carthage.

In [[398 BC]], Dionysius had regained his strength and broke the peace treaty, striking at the Carthaginian stronghold of [[Motya]]. Himilco responded decisively, leading an expedition which not only reclaimed Motya, but also captured [[Messina, Italy|Messina]]. Finally, he laid siege to Syracuse itself. The siege met with great success throughout [[397 BC]], but in [[396 BC]] plague again ravaged the Carthaginian forces, and they collapsed.

Sicily by this time had become an obsession for Carthage. Over the next sixty years, Carthaginian and Greek forces engaged in a constant series of skirmishes. By [[340 BC]], Carthage had been pushed entirely into the southwest corner of the island, and an uneasy peace reigned over the island.

===Third Sicilian War===
In [[315 BC]] [[Agathocles]], the tyrant of Syracuse, seized the city of [[Messene]] (present-day Messina).  In [[311 BC]] he invaded the last Carthaginian holdings on Sicily, breaking the terms of the current peace treaty, and laid siege to [[Agrigentum|Akragas]].

[[Hamilcar]], grandson of [[Hanno the Navigator]], led the Carthaginian response and met with tremendous success. By [[310 BC]] he controlled almost all of Sicily and had laid siege to Syracuse itself. In desperation, Agathocles secretly led an expedition of 14,000 men to the mainland, hoping to save his rule by leading a counterstrike against Carthage itself. In this, he was successful: Carthage was forced to recall Hamilcar and most of his army from Sicily to face the new and unexpected threat. Although Agathocles' army was eventually defeated in [[307 BC]], Agathocles himself escaped back to Sicily and was able to negotiate a peace which maintained Syracuse as a stronghold of Greek power in Sicily.

===Pyrrhus of Epirus===
Between [[280 BC]] and [[275 BC]], [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] waged two major campaigns in an effort to protect and extend the influence of the Greeks in the western Mediterranean: one against the emerging power of the [[Roman Republic]] to defend the [[Greek colonies]] in southern Italy, the other against Carthage in a renewed attempt to wrest Sicily wholly from their control.

After winning a complete victory over Rome at Heraclea, and another complete yet very costly victory at Asculum, Pyrrhus was soon distracted by opportunities in mainland Greece which had recently been invaded by the [[Gauls]], and the Greeks of Sicily. Making a temporary peace with the Romans he left for Sicily and between 278-276 BC, defeated every Carthaginian force against him. Pyrrhus even managed to take Eryx, the strongest Carthaginian holdout. Yet at Lilybaeum, the Carthaginians were able to hold out against Pyrrhus, and the invader soon found that he was no longer welcome by the Greek Sicilians. Leaving once again for Italy, he fought the Romans once more to a draw. Not having the resources and manpower to continue, Pyrrhus left for Epirus. For Carthage, this meant a return to the status quo. For Rome, however, it meant capturing [[Tarentum]] and holding the entirety of Italy. The result was a shift in the balance of power in the western Mediterranean: the Greeks were effectively reduced to their toehold in Sicily, while Rome's growing strength and territorial ambitions brought it directly into conflict with Carthage for the first time.

===The Messanan Crisis===
When Agathocles died in [[288 BC]], a large company of Italian mercenaries who had previously been held in his service found themselves suddenly without employment. Rather than leave Sicily, they seized the city of Messana. Naming themselves [[Mamertines]] (or &quot;sons of Mars&quot;), they became a law unto themselves, terrorizing the surrounding countryside.

The Mamertines became a growing threat to Carthage and Syracuse alike. In [[265 BC]], [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]], former general of Pyrrhus and the new tyrant of Syracuse, took action against them. Faced with a vastly superior force, the Mamertines divided into two factions, one advocating surrender to Carthage, the other preferring to seek aid from Rome. As a result, embassies were sent to both cities.

While the [[Roman Senate]] debated the best course of action, the Carthaginians eagerly agreed to send a garrison to Messana. A Carthaginian garrison was admitted to the city, and a Carthaginian fleet sailed into the Messanan harbor. However, soon afterwards they began negotiating with Hiero; alarmed, the Mamertines sent another embassy to Rome asking them to expel the Carthaginians.

Hiero's intervention had placed Carthage's military forces directly across the narrow channel of water that separated Sicily from Italy. Moreover, the presence of the Carthaginian fleet gave them effective control over this channel, the [[Strait of Messina]], and demonstrated a clear and present danger to nearby Rome and her interests.

As a result, the Roman Assembly, although reluctant to ally with a band of mercenaries, sent an expeditionary force to return control of Messana to the Mamertines.

===The Punic Wars===
The Roman attack on the Carthaginian forces at Messana triggered the first of the [[Punic Wars]]. Over the course of the next century, these three major conflicts between Rome and Carthage would determine the course of Western civilization.

*The [[First Punic War]] ([[264 BC]] to [[241 BC]])
*The [[Second Punic War]] ([[218 BC]] to [[201 BC]])
*The [[Third Punic War]] ([[149 BC]] to [[146 BC]])

Rome consistently triumphed over Carthage during the Punic Wars. The end of the Third Punic War resulted in the end of Carthaginian power and the complete destruction of the city by [[Scipio Aemilianus]]: Roman soldiers went from house to house, slaughtering the people of Carthage and enslaving any who survived. Carthage's harbor was burned and the city razed.

Between the first and the second Punic war, Carthage faced a major [[Mercenary War|mercenary revolt]]. During the mercenary revolt Rome was able to acquire [[Sardinia]].

It is disputed whether the Carthaginian farmland [[Salting the earth|was salted]] following the [[Battle of Carthage]].

==Roman Carthage==
[[Image:Follis-Domitius Alexander-carthage RIC 68.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Domitius Alexander]] on a [[follis]]. On the reverse, the personification of Carthage, his capital.]]
The site was too well-chosen to let it go to waste, however, and a new city grew up there, eventually becoming the second largest city in the western half of the [[Roman empire]]. By the late 2nd century, Carthage was the center of the Roman province of [[Africa Province, Roman Empire|Africa]], with a population of 500,000 people. It briefly became the capital of an usurper, [[Domitius Alexander]], in 308-311.

Carthage also became a centre of early [[Christianity]].  [[Tertullian]] rhetorically addresses the Roman governor with the fact that the Christians of Carthage that just yesterday were few in number, now &quot;have filled every place among you&amp;mdash;cities, islands, fortresses, towns, market-places, the very camp, tribes, companies, palaces, senate, forum; we have left nothing to you but the temples of your gods.&quot; (''[[Apologeticus]]'' written at Carthage, c. 197.)  It is worth noting that Tertullian omits any mention of the surrounding countryside or its network of villas not unlike colonial [[hacienda]] society.

In the first of a string of rather poorly reported Councils at Carthage a few years later, no fewer than seventy bishops attended. Tertullian later broke with the mainstream that was represented more and more by the bishop of Rome, but a more serious rift among Christians was the [[Donatist]] controversy, which [[Augustine of Hippo]] spent much time and parchment arguing against. In 397 at the [[Council at Carthage]], the [[Biblical canon]] for the western Church was confirmed.

The political fallout from the deep disaffection of African Christians was a crucial factor in the ease with which Carthage and the other centres were captured in the 5th century by [[Gaiseric]], king of the [[Vandals]], who defeated the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[general]] [[Bonifacius]] and made the city his capital. Gaiseric was considered a heretic too, an [[Arianism|Arian]], and though Arians commonly despised Catholic Christians, a mere promise of toleration might have caused the city's population to accept him. After a failed attempt to recapture the city in the 5th century, the Byzantines finally subdued the Vandals in the 6th century. Using Gaiseric's grandson's deposal by a distant cousin, [[Gelimer]], as a pretext, the Byzantines dispatched an army to conquer the Vandal kingdom. On Sunday, [[October 15]] [[533]], the Byzantine general [[Belisarius]], accompanied by his wife [[Antonina]], made his formal entry into Carthage, sparing it a sack and a [[massacre]].

During the emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]]'s reign, Carthage was made into an [[Exarchate]], as was [[Ravenna]] in [[Italy]]. These two exarchates were the western bulwarks of Byzantium, all that remained of its power in the west. In the early 7th century, it was the Exarch of Carthage, [[Heraclius]] (of [[Armenians|Armenian]] origin), who overthrew Emperor [[Phocas]].

The Byzantine Exarchate was not, however, able to withstand the [[Arab]] conquerors of the 7th century. The first Arab assault on the Exarchate of Carthage was initiated from [[Egypt]] without much success in 647. A more protracted campaign lasted from 670-683. In 698 the [[Exarchate of Africa]] was finally overrun by the rising forces of [[Islam]], and Carthage itself was destroyed by the Arab invaders, to be replaced by [[Tunis]] as the major regional center.   The destruction of the [[Exarchate of Africa]] marked a permanent end to Roman or Byzantine influence there, as the rising tide of Islam shattered the empire.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], the [[integer|integers]] ''a'' and ''b'' are said to be '''coprime''' or '''relatively prime''' if they have no common [[divisor|factor]] other than 1 and &amp;minus;1, or equivalently, if their [[greatest common divisor]] is 1.

For example, [[6 (number)|6]] and [[35 (number)|35]] are coprime, but 6 and [[27 (number)|27]] are not because they are both divisible by 3. The number [[1 (number)|1]] is coprime to every integer; [[0 (number)|0]] is coprime only to 1 and &amp;minus;1.

A fast way to determine whether two numbers are coprime is given by the [[Euclidean algorithm]].

[[Euler's totient function]] (or Euler's phi function) of a positive integer ''n'' is the number of integers between 1 and ''n'' &amp;minus; 1 which are coprime to ''n''.

== Properties ==

[[Image:coprime-lattice.svg|thumb|right|300px|Figure 1. The numbers 4 and 9 are coprime because the diagonal does not intersect any other lattice points]]

There are a number of conditions which are equivalent to ''a'' and ''b'' being coprime:

*There exist integers ''x'' and ''y'' such that ''ax'' + ''by'' = 1 (see [[Bézout's identity]]).
*The integer ''b'' has a [[multiplicative inverse]] [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''a'': there exists an integer ''y'' such that ''by'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod ''a''). In other words, ''b'' is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] in the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] '''Z'''/''a'''''Z''' of [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo]] ''a''.

As a consequence, if ''a'' and ''b'' are coprime and ''br'' &amp;equiv; ''bs'' ([[modular arithmetic|mod]] ''a''), then ''r'' &amp;equiv; ''s'' (mod ''a'') (because we may &quot;divide by ''b''&quot; when working modulo ''a''). Furthermore, if ''a'' and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are coprime, and ''a'' and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are coprime, then ''a'' and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are also coprime (because the product of units is a unit).

If ''a'' and ''b'' are coprime and ''a'' divides a product ''bc'', then ''a'' divides ''c''. This can be viewed as a generalisation of [[Euclid's lemma]], which states that if ''p'' is prime, and ''p'' divides a product ''bc'', then either ''p'' divides ''b'' or ''p'' divides ''c''.

The two integers ''a'' and ''b'' are coprime if and only if the point with coordinates (''a'', ''b'') in an [[Cartesian coordinate system]] is &quot;visible&quot; from the origin (0,0), in the sense that there is no point with integer coordinates between the origin and (''a'', ''b''). (See figure 1.)

The [[probability]] that two randomly chosen integers are coprime is 6/&amp;pi;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (see [[pi]]), which is about 60%.

Two [[natural number]]s ''a'' and ''b'' are coprime if and only if the numbers 2&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 1 and 2&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 1 are coprime.

==Cross notation, group==
If ''n''&amp;ge;1 is an [[integer]], the numbers coprime to ''n'', taken [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''n'', form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] with multiplication as operation; it is written as ('''Z'''/''n'''''Z''')&lt;sup&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/sup&gt; or '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Generalizations ==

Two [[ring ideal|ideals]] ''A'' and ''B'' in the [[commutative]] [[ring (algebra)|ring]] ''R'' are called '''coprime''' if ''A'' + ''B'' = ''R''. This generalizes [[Bézout's identity]]: with this definition, two [[principal ideal]]s (''a'') and (''b'') in the ring of integers '''Z''' are coprime if and only if ''a'' and ''b'' are coprime.

If the ideals ''A'' and ''B'' of ''R'' are coprime, then ''AB'' = ''A''&amp;cap;''B''; furthermore, if ''C'' is a third ideal such that ''A'' contains ''BC'', then ''A'' contains ''C''. The [[Chinese Remainder Theorem]] is an important statement about coprime ideals.

The concept of being ''relatively prime'' can also be extended any [[finite]] [[set]] of integers ''S'' = {''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, .... ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} to mean that the [[greatest common divisor]] of the elements of the set is 1. If every ''pair'' of integers in the set is relatively prime, then the set is called ''pairwise relatively prime''.

Every pairwise relatively prime set is relatively prime; however, the converse is not true: {6, 10, 15} is relatively prime, but not pairwise relative prime. (In fact, each pair of integers in the set has a non-trivial common factor.)

      <comment>/* Types of control units */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''control unit''' is the part of a [[Central processing unit|CPU]] or other device that directs its operation. The outputs of the unit control the activity of the rest of the device. A control unit can be thought of as a [[finite state machine]].

At one time control units for CPUs were ad-hoc logic, and they were difficult to design.  Now they are often implemented as a [[microprogram]] that is stored in a [[control store]].  Words of the microprogram are selected by a [[microsequencer]] and the bits from those words directly control the different parts of the device, including the [[processor register|registers]], [[arithmetic and logic unit]]s, [[instruction register]]s, [[Computer bus|buses]], and off-chip [[input/output]]. In modern computers, each of these subsystems may have its own subsidiary controller, with the control unit acting as a supervisor.  (See also [[CPU design]] and [[computer architecture]].) 

== Types of control units ==
All types of control units generate electronic control signals that control other parts of a [[CPU]].  Control units are usually one of these types:&lt;br&gt;
#[[Microcode]]d control units. In a [[microcode]]d control unit, a program reads signals, and generates control signals.  The program itself is executed by a very simple computer, a relatively simple [[digital circuit]] called a [[microsequencer]].&lt;br&gt;
#Hardware control units. In a hardware control unit, a [[digital circuit]] generates the control signals directly.&lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Cello front side.jpg|thumb|A cello]]

The '''cello''' (pronounced &quot;Chello&quot;) or ''''cello,''' short for '''violoncello,''' is a [[stringed instrument]] and a member of the [[violin]] [[violin family|family]]. A cello player is called a '''cellist'''. The cello is popular in many capacities: as a solo instrument, in chamber music, and also as a foundation of the modern orchestral sound.

== Description ==
[[Image:Brikcius.jpg|thumb|Cellist]]
The name ''cello'' is an abbreviation of the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''violoncello'', which means &quot;little violone&quot;. The ''[[violone]]'' is an obsolete instrument, a large [[viol]], similar to a modern [[double bass]].

The cello is most closely associated with [[European classical music]]. It is part of the standard [[orchestra]] and is the bass voice of the [[string quartet]], as well as being part of many other [[chamber music|chamber]] groups. A large number of [[cello concerto|concertos]] and [[cello sonata|sonatas]] have been written for it. It is less common in [[popular music]], but is sometimes featured in [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music|rock]] recordings. 

Among the most famous [[Baroque]] works for the cello are [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach's]] ''[[Cello Suites (Bach)|Unaccompanied Suites for Cello]],'' commonly known as the Bach Cello Suites). An example of a [[Classical music era|Classical era]] piece is [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn's]] ''Cello Concerto #1 in C major''. Standard [[Romantic music era|Romantic era]] repertoire includes [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák's]] ''Cello Concerto in b minor'', [[Sir Edward Elgar|Elgar's]] ''Cello Concerto in e minor'', and two sonatas by [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]. Modern compositions from the early [[20th century]] include unaccompanied cello sonatas by [[Paul Hindemith]] ([[opus number|opus]] 25) and [[Zoltán Kodály]] (opus 8). Recordings within the [[Avant Garde]] (cutting edge) genre have revitalized the instrument's perceived versatility. One example is ''Night of the Four Moons'' by [[George Crumb]].

==Construction==
The cello is much larger than the [[violin]] or the [[viola]] but smaller than the [[double bass]]. Like the other members of the [[violin family]], the cello has four strings.  Its strings are normally tuned to the [[pitch (music)|pitches]] (from high to low) A, D, G, and C (A3, D3, G2, and C2 in [[scientific pitch notation]]). This is like the [[viola]] but one octave lower, and is one octave plus one fifth lower than the [[violin]] (see [[#Tuning and range]]).  It is played in an upright position between the legs of a seated musician, resting on a metal spike called the [[endpin]]. The player draws the [[bow (music)|bow]] horizontally across the strings.
The cello is a complex instrument consisting of many different parts. Although the majority of it is composed of [[wood]], some parts can be made of [[steel]] or other metals and/or [[composite material]]. Today, the strings are most often metal but can be made of [[gut]] or [[nylon]].

===Body===
The main frame of the cello is typically made from wood, although some modern cellos are constructed from [[carbon fibre]]. A traditional cello normally has a [[spruce]] top, with [[maple]] for the back, sides, and neck. Other woods, such as [[poplar]] or [[willow]], are sometimes used for the back and sides. Less expensive cellos frequently have a top and back made of a [[Plywood|laminate]]. 

The top an and killed the consul.

==Invading Gaul==
Now the road to Italy was open, but they turned west towards [[Gaul]]. They came into frequent conflict with the [[Roman Republic|Romans]], who usually came out the losers. In [[109 BC]], they defeated a Roman army under the consul [[Marcus Junius Silanus]], who was the commander of [[Gallia Narbonensis]]. The same year, they defeated another Roman army under the consul [[Gaius Cassius Longinus, consul 124 BC|Gaius Cassius Longinus]], who was killed at Burdigala (modern day [[Bordeaux]]). In [[107 BC]], the Romans once again lost against the [[Tigurines]], who were allies of the Cimbri.

==Attacking the Roman Republic==
It was not until [[105 BC]] that they planned an attack on the Roman Empire itself. At the [[Rhône River]], the Cimbri clashed with the Roman armies.  The Roman commanders, the proconsul [[Quintus Servilius Caepio]] and the consul [[Gnaeus Mallius Maximus]], hindered Roman coordination and so the Cimbri succeeded in first defeating the legate [[Marcus Aurelius Scaurus]] and later cause a devastating defeat on Caepio and Maximus at the [[Battle of Arausio]]. The Romans lost as many as 80,000 men not including the lost auxiliary cavalry and the non-combatants which would have made a total loss of about 112,000 men.

Rome was in panic, and the ''terror cimbricus'' became a proverb. Everyone expected soon to see the ''new Gauls'' outside of the gates of Rome. In their desperation new measures were undertaken. Against the constitution, [[Marius]], who had defeated [[Jugurtha]], was elected consul and supreme commander for four years in a row ([[104 BC]]&amp;ndash;[[101 BC]]).

==Defeat==
[[Image:The defeat of the Cimbri.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Defeat of the Cimbri, by [[Alexandre Gabriel Décamps]].]]
However, in [[103 BC]], the Cimbri and their Proto-Germanic allies, the [[Teutons]], had turned to Spain where they pillaged far and wide. During this time C. Marius had the time to prepare and, in [[102 BC]], he was ready to meet the [[Teutons]] and the [[Ambrones]] at the [[Rhône River]]. These two tribes intended to pass into Italy through the western passes, while the Cimbri and the Tigurines were to take the northern route across the [[Rhine]] and later across the [[Tyrol]]ian [[Alps]].

At the estuary of the [[Isère River]], the Teutons and the Ambrones met Marius, whose well-defended camp they did not manage to overrun. Instead, they pursued their route, and Marius followed them.  At [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae|Aquae Sextiae]], the Romans won two battles and took the Teuton king [[Teutobod]] prisoner.

The Cimbri, however, had penetrated through the Alps into northern Italy. However, the consul [[Quintus Lutatius Catulus]] had not dared to fortify the passes, but instead he had retreated behind the [[Po River]], and so the land was open to the invaders. However, the Cimbri did not hurry, and the victors of Aquae
Sextiae had the time to arrive with reinforcements. At the [[Battle of Vercellae]], at the confluence of the [[Sesia River]] with the [[Po River]], in [[101 BC]], the long voyage of the Cimbri also came to an end.

It was a devastating defeat and both the chieftains [[Lugius]] and [[Boiorix]] died. The women killed both themselves and their children in order to avoid slavery. The Cimbri were annihilated, with the exception of a small remaining population of Cimbri which still remained in northern [[Jutland]] in the [[1st century]] AD.

==Culture==
The Cimbri are depicted as ferocious warriors who did not fear death. The host was followed by women and children on carts. Aged women dressed in white (see [[Völva]]) sacrificed the prisoners of war and sprinkled their blood (see [[Blót]]), the nature of which allowed them to see what was to come.

The '''Cleveland Browns''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. They currently belong to the [[AFC North|Northern Division]] of the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The Browns began play in 1946 as a charter member of the [[All-America Football Conference]] and joined the NFL in 1950 after the AAFC merged into the older league. The team has won 4 AAFC titles and 4 [[List of NFL champions|NFL Championships]].

In some accounts, there may be confusion regarding the team's history due to unusual and unprecedented actions taken by the city of Cleveland and the NFL in 1996. On [[November 6]], [[1995]], then-Browns owner [[Art Modell]] announced his intention to move the team to Baltimore, citing the inadequacy of  [[Cleveland Stadium]] and the lack of a sufficient replacement along with his heavy debt. The decision triggered a flurry of legal activity that ended when representatives of Cleveland and the NFL reached a settlement on [[February 8]], [[1996]]. It stipulated that the Browns' name, colors, and history of the franchise were to remain in Cleveland. A reactivated Cleveland Browns team would then begin play in 1999 in the AFC Central Division, while the relocated club would technically and legally be a new [[expansion team]], the [[Baltimore Ravens]].{{ref|baltsun}}

For that reason, past records and [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] players are attributed to the Browns and not to the Ravens. However, some incorrectly consider the Ravens and the pre-1995 Browns organization as one continuous entity since Art Modell retained the player and personnel contracts for his franchise, using terms like &quot;The Modell organization&quot; or &quot;Art Modell's franchise&quot; to denote it. {{ref|Modellorg}} (See the Franchise History section below for full details of the move.)

==Franchise history==
===Early days in the AAFC===
[[Image:ClevelandBrowns_100.png|left|frame|The Browns are the only team in the [[NFL]] that does not have a logo on their helmet]]
The Cleveland Browns were founded in 1946 under owner [[Arthur McBride|Arthur 'Mickey' McBride]]. The team was to be named the Cleveland Panthers, but a semi-pro team was using that name and threatened to sue if the AAFC club used it as well.  McBride then named the team after its first head coach, [[Paul Brown]].  Brown was uncomfortable with the idea of having the team named after him, stating publicly that the team was named after [[boxing]] champion [[Joe Louis]] who was known as the &quot;Brown Bomber.&quot;  

In either event, the Browns were extremely successful in the early part of their existence, dominating the new [[All-America Football Conference]], winning all four of its championships including with a landmark 1948 season in which they went unbeaten and untied - 24 years before the NFL's 'first' perfect team, the 1972 [[Miami Dolphins]]. Cleveland's undefeated streak (including ties) reached 29 games including 18 straight wins.

===1950-56: NFL dominance===
After the 1949 season the [[All-America Football Conference|AAFC]] merged with the rival [[National Football League]], with the Browns joining the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and [[Baltimore Colts]] as members of the older circuit.

Despite the change in leagues and what many football fans saw as a graduation to &quot;the big league,&quot; the Browns continued their dominant position among pro football teams, appearing in the next six NFL championship games, and capturing three championships during the 1950s.

The Browns won the championship in their first season in the NFL, 1950, behind the quarterbacking of [[Otto Graham]], the rushing of [[Marion Motley]], the receiving of [[Mac Speedie]], a defensive line anchored by [[Bill Willis]] and a secondary featuring [[Tommy James]]. Cleveland tore up the NFL in the regular season, going 10-2 with both losses being to the [[New York Giants]]. The Browns first regular season game was on the road against the defending NFL Champion Philadelphia Eagles as the schedule makers intended to give the Browns an immediate comeuppance. Cleveland won the game in dominant fashion, 35-10. The Browns defeated the Giants 8-3 in a tiebreaking playoff game and then came from behind in the fourth quarter beat the [[Los Angeles Rams]] 30-28 in the league championship in Cleveland.

Cleveland again tore through the NFL in the 1951 season, going 11-1 with four shutouts along the way. The NFL championship was a rematch with the Rams, in Los Angeles this time, and went back-and-forth until the fourth quarter when [[Norm van Brocklin]] threw a 73-yard touchdown to [[Tom Fears]] to put Los Angeles in the lead for good. The 24-17 loss was the first in a championship game in Browns history.

The 1952 regular season was not as successful, with only an 8-4 finish and Graham throwing 24 interceptions. Second-year player [[Ray Renfro]] became a star with 722 yards receiving and 322 yards rushing. But it was still good enough to win the division, and thus put the Browns in the NFL championship game against the [[Detroit Lions]]. A muffed punt, several defensive stands and a 67-yard touchdown run by [[Doak Walker]] all combined to help the Lions win 17-7, frustrating the Browns for the second consecutive year. 

[[Image:Browns 1950 Logo.GIF|thumb|right|The &quot;Brownie Elf&quot; mascot]]
The 1953 team started the season by winning 11 straight games. They would not win any more. A loss to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in the final week led into a rematch with the Lions in the NFL championship. The game was much closer than the year before, with the game tied at 10 going into the final quarter. [[Lou Groza]] kicked two field goals to put Cleveland up 16-10, but Detroit's [[Bobby Layne]] threw a 33-yard touchdown pass to [[Jim Doran]] with under two minutes left to win 17-16, and break Cleveland hearts for a third straight year.

In 1954, the Browns finished 9-3 and met up with Detroit in the finals for the third year in a row. This time, however, the Browns went on a relentless attack on both sides of the ball, intercepting Bobby Layne six times and forcing three fumbles, while [[Otto Graham]] threw three touchdowns and ran for three more, en route to a 56-10 thrashing.

The 1955 campaign was also a successful one for the Browns. [[Chuck Noll]] (who ironically would later gain fame as head coach of the rival [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]) had a productive season at linebacker, with five interceptions. Graham passed for 15 touchdowns and ran for six more in his final season before retiring due to injuries. The Browns, who finished 9-2-1, once again made the championship, this time against the [[Los Angeles Rams]]. They were no less dominant than they were the previous season, again forcing six interceptions out of quarterback [[Norm van Brocklin]], one of which was returned for a touchdown by [[Don Paul]]. Graham also passed for two touchdowns and ran for two more as the Browns won 38-14.

Without Graham behind center, the Browns floundered in 1956. Three quarterbacks ([[George Ratterman]], [[Babe Parilli]] and [[Tommy O'Connell]]) were used through the season, none of whom threw more touchdowns than interceptions. The 5-7 record meant the Browns were shut out of the championship game for the first time in team history.

===1957-65: The Jim Brown years===
The Browns responded in 1957 when they drafted fullback [[Jim Brown]], who easily became the NFL's leading rusher (and [[NFL Rookie of the Year]]) with 942 yards.  Once again at the top of the division at 9-2-1, they advanced back to the championship game against their nemeses from Detroit. But the Lions dominated from start to finish, causing six turnovers and allowing the Browns' two quarterbacks ([[Tommy O'Connell]] and [[Milt Plum]]) only 95 yards passing in a 59-14 rout.

In 1958 Jim Brown ran for 1527 yards, almost twice as much as any other running back. In his nine seasons in the league, he crossed the 1000-yard barrier seven times. The only snag in their getting back to another championship was the [[New York Giants]]. They lost to New York on the last week of the season after a spirited fourth-quarter comeback, then, due to their equal 9-3 records, faced the Giants again in a tiebreaker game with the winner going to the finals. This one was never in doubt: Jim Brown was limited to 8 yards and the team committed four turnovers as they were shut out 10-0.

In 1959 the Browns started 6-2 but finished 7-5, out of championship contention, despite Brown once again leading the league in rushing with 1329 yards. In 1960, Plum threw for 21 touchdowns and Brown's 1257 yards was still best in the NFL, but the team still finished second at 8-3-1.

[[Art Modell]], whose controversial decisions in later years led to the team's original demise, purchased the team in 1961. The season otherwise was typical: a fifth consecutive league-leading season from Jim Brown and a half-decent performance in the standings, but again, at 8-5-1, they were two games out of a berth in the championship.

====1962====
Milt Plum landed with the Lions in 1962, so [[Frank Ryan (football player)|Frank Ryan]] and [[Jim Ninowski]] shared quarterbacking duties. Jim Brown fell to fourth in the NFL rushing list, but the team's 7-6-1 record once again placed them third in the Eastern Division. 

Sadly, the team's first-round draft pick that year, [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Ernie Davis]], was diagnosed with [[leukemia]] during the preseason.  The only time he took the field at Cleveland Stadium would be when he was introduced during the [[August 18]] doubleheader exhibition game.  His loss was especially costly, since the team had been forced to trade future Hall of Famer [[Bobby Mitchell]] in order to acquire him.

====1963====
[[Paul Brown]], the only coach the Browns had ever known (and the team's namesake), was fired on [[January 9, 1963]] and replaced with [[Blanton Collier]].  Brown's dismissal was controversial not only because he had been the cornerstone of the franchise since its inception, but also due to the fact that Modell fired him in the midst of a Cleveland newspaper strike, allowing for limited local media attention.

A series of tragedies during the off-season also proved to be devastating: 1963 draft choice [[Tom Bloom]] was killed in a car accident in January; Davis lost his battle with [[leukemia]] on [[May 18]]; and defensive back [[Don Fleming]] was electrocuted on [[June 4]] while working in Florida.

Despite these blows, the team improved in 1963, led by [[Jim Brown]]'s NFL record 1,863 yards rushing, a mark that would stand for the next decade, until [[O.J. Simpson]] broke it in 1973.  The team's passing attack also flourished with 25 touchdown passes from [[Frank Ryan]], including a team-record 13 to second-year wideout [[Gary Collins]]. 

The season began with six straight victories, including an impressive 35-24 decision on [[October 13]] at [[Yankee Stadium]] over the defending Eastern Conference champion New York Giants.  Two weeks later, the Giants returned the favor with an embarrassing 33-6 victory at [[Cleveland Stadium]].  After two losses in their next three games eroded the team's momentum, they bounced back with a 27-10 win over Dallas and a 24-10 victory against the Cardinals.  The first game took place just two days after the [[John F. Kennedy]] [[assassination]], and was noteworthy for both the somber atmosphere and avoidance of any reference to the city of Dallas by the [[Cleveland Stadium]] public address announcer.

Despite those wins, a 38-10 loss at Detroit on [[December 8]] put an end to the team's postseason hopes, with the 10-4 season record a game behind the Giants.  The team also dropped a 40-23 decision to the [[Green Bay Packers]] in the [[Playoff Bowl]].

====1964====
The Browns reached the top again in 1964 as rookie [[Paul Warfield]] caught 52 passes for 920 yards and nine touchdowns, Ryan threw for 2,400 yards and 25 scores and Brown once agin led the league in rushing with 1,446 yards. 

The team was 3-0-1 in its first four games, the tie coming in a thrilling 33-33 deadlock against the St. Louis Cardinals on September 20.  The first loss came at the hands of the Pittsburgh Steelers on October 10, mainly due to the efforts of future Hall of Famer John Henry Johnson, who rushed for more than 200 yards.  After six wins in their next seven games, the Browns missed the chance to clinch the Eastern Conference by dropping a 28-19 decision at St. Louis on December 6.  However, before a national television audience six days later, the Browns convincingly captured their conference title with a 52-20 win over the [[New York Giants]].  The title earned them a spot in the NFL Championship game after a seven-year absence. 

Oddsmakers made their opponents, the [[Baltimore Colts]], seven-point favorites, but the teams left the field after one half of play locked in a scoreless duel. [[Lou Groza]]'s field goal gave the Browns a 3-0 lead, with the duo of quarterback [[Frank Ryan]] and wide receiver [[Gary Collins]] completing the upset by connecting on three touchdown passes, winning 27-0.  The title marks the last championship by any major Cleveland sports team, as of 2005. 

====1965====
The 1965 team finished 11-3 after Brown rushed for 1,544 yards, caught 34 passes and scored 21 touchdowns, once again leading the league in rushing yardage.  Those numbers resulted in Brown winning the [[Most Valuable Player]] award from the league. 

The team's passing attack was hindered in the preseason with a major injury to wide receiver [[Paul Warfield]], who missed much of the campaign as a result.  However, after shaking off an early-season 49-13 loss to St. Louis, the Browns won nine of their next 10 games, clinching the Eastern Conference with a 24-16 win over the [[Washington Redskins]] on [[December 5]].  

Cleveland once again made the [[NFL Championship game]], this time against the [[Vince Lombardi]]-led [[Green Bay Packers]].  In the days leading up to the contest, the Browns seemed in prime position to win another title as Packer quarterback [[Bart Starr]] and running back [[Jim Taylor]]'s health made them questionable for the game. 

When an early-morning snowstorm on the day of the game turned the field into a muddy mess, the Packers' reliance on their powerful running game proved to be a major factor in the game.  Early on, Starr and Green Bay wideout [[Carroll Dale]] connected for the first score, aided by Browns defender [[Walter Beach]] slipping on the muddy field.  Despite the slow start, Cleveland only trailed 13-12 at halftime, but only had the ball for 16 plays after intermission as the Packers pulled away with a [[Paul Hornung]] touchdown to win 23-12.

===1966-73: Playoff disappointments===
As training camp was beginning in July  1966, Jim Brown shocked the Browns, their fans and the NFL by announcing his retirement.  Brown, who had been filming the movie ''The Dirty Dozen'' in London, was irritated by Browns' owner [[Art Modell]]'s threats of fines for not reporting for training camp and simply retired. [[Leroy Kelly]] became the Browns' new rushing threat for the 1966 season, ably filling Brown's shoes with the first of his three consecutive 1000-yard seasons. [[Frank Ryan]]'s 29 touchdowns also led the league. Entering the final month of the regular season, the Browns had remained in contention, but a costly 26-14 loss in a [[Thanksgiving Day]] game at Dallas put a major dent in their postseason hopes. Blanton Collier's squad placed one game behind the Cowboys with a 9-5 mark and missed the league championship game for the first time in three years.

The 1967 Browns began the season with two losses, defeats that were quickly forgotten with nine wins in the next 11 contests to help the team finish at 9-5 for the second consecutive year.  Unlike the previous season, the NFL's new realignment made that record good enough for first place in the short-lived [[Century Division]], and a spot in the new Eastern Conference championship against the Cowboys. Unfortunately, the game between the two squads was over quickly as [[Don Meredith]] passed for two touchdowns, [[Dave Baynham]] ran for three and [[Bob Hayes]] generally made the Browns' life miserable on special teams as the Cowboys annihilated the Browns 52-14.

Following another slow start in 1968 Ryan was out at quarterback, in favor of [[Bill Nelsen]], who had been acquired from the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in the offseason. In their October 20 game against the undefeated Baltimore Colts, the heavy underdog Browns stunned their opponents with a 30-20 win, sparking an eight-game winning streak.  Nelsen's main target was fifth-year receiver [[Paul Warfield]], who had the best season of his career, with 1067 yards and 12 touchdowns. The team finished the regular season with a 10-4 mark, good enough for another first-place finish and a rematch with Dallas in the Eastern Conference final. After four consecutive losses to their Texas opponents, the Browns ended their frustration by not allowing the Cowboys an offensive touchdown until the final minute.  [[Leroy Kelly]]'s two long runs for scores paced the offense, with the turning point in a 31-20 victory coming on [[Dale Lindsey]]'s return of a Don Meredith interception for a touchdown early in the second half. Cleveland advaidges. In the more powerful cartridges, the short barrel of a carbine has significant disadvantages in velocity, and the high residual pressure when the bullet exits the barrel results in substantially greater [[Wiktionary:muzzle blast|muzzle blast]]. [[Flash suppressor]]s and [[Wiktionary:muzzle brake|muzzle brake]]s are common solutions to this problem, which may ease their acceptance.

For the military and security forces there is emerging a wide range of less than lethal PDW options.  These range from [[taser]]s to microwave beam type weapons.

== Usage ==

=== Pistol caliber carbines ===

One of the more unusual classes of carbine is the pistol caliber carbine.  These first appeared soon after metallic cartridges became common.  These were developed as &quot;companions&quot; to the popular [[revolvers]] of the day, firing the same cartridge but allowing more velocity and accuracy than the revolver.  These were carried by [[cowboys]], lawmen, and others in the [[Old West]].  The classic combination would be a [[Winchester rifle | Winchester]] lever action carbine and a [[Colt]] revolver in .44-40 or .45 Colt.  

Modern equivalents also exist, such as the [[Ruger Police Carbine]], which uses the same magazine as the Ruger [[pistols]] of the same caliber.  The [[Beretta Cx4 Storm]] shares magazines with many [[Beretta]] pistols, and shares its design with the [[Beretta Px4 Storm]] pistol.  The recent introduction of such products may indicate that there is a growing demand for these companion carbines.

The primary advantage of a pistol caliber carbine, other than the usually-added buttstock or shoulder rest for increased accuracy, is the fact that in general a longer barrel will yield higher projectile velocity. This results in greater stopping power and increased ability to penetrate body armor. Additionally, many pistol calibers, such as .45 ACP, have much heavier projectiles, such as 230 grain (15 g), than rifles do, 55 grains (3.6 g) being common in 22-caliber rounds like .22-250 and .223.

===Ultra carbines===

Firearms with shoulder stocks and barrels less than 16 in (406 mm) in length are classified as &quot;short barreled rifles&quot; (under the US [[National Firearms Act]] or '''NFA'''), and are sometimes restricted in the same way that [[Sawn-off shotgun|sawed off shotgun]]s and [[machine gun]]s are.  Because of this, rifles with barrels of less than 16 in (406 mm), or pistols with shoulder stocks, are rare. &quot;Kits&quot; exist which will convert a [[GLOCK]] pistol to a carbine.

=== Air carbines === 

In the world of [[airgun]]s, there is a small but growing class of what are also called &quot;ultra carbines&quot;, that have extremely short barrels.  These may be rifles with barrels cut down to as short as 8 inches (203 mm), or pistols converted into carbines with the addition of a shoulder stocks. These are generally not restricted legally in the same way some firearms are.

=== Other carbines ===

Another class of carbine is a semi-automatic version of a [[submachine gun]], with an extended barrel, just over 16 inches (406 mm) long, which will escape ban by some &quot;assault weapon&quot; legislation.  While functionally identical to other carbines, these are banned in some places as &quot;assault weapons&quot; based on their cosmetic similarity to submachine guns. However, they may not accept certain parts (such as magazines or collapsing stocks) from the submachine guns they resemble.  These are a popular compromise for (American) shooters who would like to own a submachine gun but cannot due to local restrictions or the prohibitive cost of buying a civilian legal submachine gun (since the end of the [[Federal assault weapons ban|Clinton assault weapons ban]], this has become less prohibitive).  While these submachine gun lookalikes are acceptable for use for self defense, the media generally portrays them as being used for violent crime. As such, this may make them a poor choice for a personal defense weapon. This does not deter many of the more vocal proponents of personal defense firearms, who typically recommend a pistol and a higher power weapon, like a carbine or a [[shotgun]].

In some historical cases the term ''machine carbine'' was the official title for sub-machine guns. Examples are the [[Sten]] and [[Owen gun]]s. Equally to confuse the non-automatic version of the [[Sterling submachine gun]] was also a &quot;Carbine&quot;.

'''Chinese cuisine''' is widely seen as representing one of the richest and most diverse culinary heritages in the [[world]]. It originated in different regions of [[China]] and has been introduced to other parts of the world — from [[Southeast Asia]] to [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]].

A meal in [[Chinese culture]] is typically seen as consisting of two general components: (1) a [[carbohydrate]] source or [[starch]], known as 主食 in the [[Chinese language]] (''zhǔshí''  &lt;sup&gt;[[Pinyin|?]]&lt;/sup&gt; , ''lit.'' &quot;main food&quot;, staple) — typically [[rice]], [[noodle]]s, or [[mantou]] (steamed buns), and (2) accompanying ''dishes'' of [[vegetable]]s, [[fish]], [[meat]], or other items, known as 菜 (''cài''&lt;sup&gt;[[Pinyin|?]]&lt;/sup&gt; , ''lit.'' &quot;vegetable&quot;) in the Chinese language. (This [[culture|cultural conceptualization]] is in some ways in contrast to [[Western cuisine|Western meals]] where [[meat]] or [[protein|animal protein]] is often considered the ''[[main course|main dish]]''.)

As is well known throughout the world, rice is a critical part of much of Chinese cuisine. However, in many parts of China, particularly [[North China]], [[wheat]]-based products including [[noodles]] and [[mantou|steamed buns]] (饅頭) predominate, in contrast to [[South China]] where rice is dominant. Despite the importance of rice in Chinese cuisine, at extremely formal occasions, it is sometimes the case that no rice at all will be served; in such a case, rice would only be provided when no other dishes remained. [[Soup]] is usually served at the end of a [[meal]] to satiate one's [[appetite]]. Owing to western influences, serving soup in the beginning of a meal is also quite normal in modern times.

[[Chopsticks]] are the primary [[eating utensil]] in Chinese culture for solid foods, while soups and other liquids are enjoyed {{ref|1}} with a wide, flat-bottomed [[spoon]] (traditionally made of [[ceramic]]).  It is reported that wooden chopsticks are losing their dominance due to recent [[logging]] shortfalls in China and [[East Asia]]; many Chinese eating establishments are considering a switch to a more environmentally sustainable eating utensil, such as plastic chopsticks. On the other hand, disposable chopsticks made of wood/bamboo have all but replaced reusable ones in small resturants.  In most dishes in Chinese cuisine, foods are prepared in smaller pieces (e.g. vegetable, meat, [[tofu|doufu]]), ready for direct picking up and eating. Traditionally, Chinese culture considered using [[knife|knives]] and [[fork]]s at the table &quot;[[barbarian|barbaric]]&quot; due to fact that these implements are regarded as [[weapon]]s. [[Fish]] are usually cooked and served whole, with diners directly pulling pieces from the fish with chopsticks to eat, unlike in some other cuisines where they are first [[fillet]]ed. This is because it is desired for fish to be served as fresh as possible. A common Chinese saying &quot;including head and tail&quot; refers to the wholeness and completion of a certain task or in this case; the display of food.

Spoon and fork are most often used by [[Malaysian Chinese]] and [[Singaporean Chinese]] eating at home, and are provided in many restaurants—especially &quot;coffee houses&quot; or [[kopi tiam]].  Some Chinese prefer to eat white rice with a spoon, even while eating other dishes with chopsticks. Many school [[cafeteria]]s (canteens) in China provide only spoons for students eating, not chopsticks, due to their reusability and ease of washing.

In a Chinese meal, each individual diner is given their own bowl of rice while the accompanying dishes are served in communal plates (or bowls) which are shared by everyone sitting at the table. In western cultures, this communal style of service is known as &quot;family style&quot;. In the Chinese meal, each diner picks food out of the communal plates on a bite-by-bite basis with their chopsticks. This is in constrast to western meals where it is customary to dole out individual servings of the dishes at the beginning of the meal. Many non-Chinese are unaccustomed in allowing a person's individual food utensils (which might have traces of a person's saliva) to touch the communal plates. For this [[hygiene]] issue, some Chinese families use additional serving spoons, or chopsticks (公筷, ''lit.'' common/public/shared chopsticks), to move the pieces of the food from the communal plates to the person's rice bowl. The food selected is often eaten together with a mouthful of rice.

[[Vegetarianism]] is not uncommon or unusual in China, though, as is the case in the West, is still only practiced by a relatively small proportion of the population. The Chinese vegetarian does not eat a lot of Tofu, unlike the stereotypical impression in the West. Most Chinese vegetarians are Buddhists. Non-Chinese eating Chinese cuisine will note that a large number of ''vegetable dishes'' may actually contain meat, as meat chunks or bits have been traditionally used to flavor dishes in Chinese cuisine. [[Chinese Buddhist cuisine]] has many true vegetarian dishes (no meat at all).

For much of China's history, human [[manure]] has been used as [[fertilizer]] due to the large human population and the relative scarcity of farm animals in China. For this reason, raw food (especially raw vegetables such as [[salad]]) has not been part of the traditional Chinese [[diet (nutrition)|diet]].

[[Dessert]]s as such are less typical in Chinese culture than in the West. Chinese meals do not typically end with a dessert or dessert course as is common in Western cuisine. Instead, sweet foods are often introduced during the course of the meal with no firm distinction made. For instance, the ''basi'' fruit dishes (sizziling sugar syrup coated fruits such as [[banana]] or [[apple]]) are eaten alongside other &quot;savoury&quot; dishes that would be considered &quot;main course&quot; items in the West. However, many sweet foods and dessert snacks do exist in Chinese cuisine. Many are fried, and several incorporate [[red bean paste]] (''dousha''). (Bean paste is also used in [[Japanese cuisine]].) The ''matuan'' is filled with ''dousha'' and fried; it is often eaten for breakfast. Some steamed bun items are filled with ''dousha''; some of these are in the shape of [[peach]]es, an important Chinese cultural symbol. Another dessert is ''[[Babao Fan]]'' (八寶飯) or &quot;Eight Treasure Rice Pudding&quot;.

If dessert is served at the end of the meal, by far the most typical choice is fresh [[fruit]], such as sliced [[oranges]]. The second most popular choice is a type of sweet [[soup]], typically made with [[azuki bean|red bean]]s and sugar. This soup is served warm. 

In Chinese culture, cold [[beverage]]s are believed to be harmful to [[digestion]] of hot food, so items like ice-cold water or [[soft drink]]s are traditionally not served at meal-time. Besides soup, if any other beverages are served, they would most likely be hot [[tea]] or hot water. Tea is believed to help in the digestion of [[Yellow grease|greasy]] foods. 

==Varieties==

==Other East Asian cuisines==
China shares much with the culinary heritage of other regions of East Asia, in addition to some contrasts; compare [[Japanese cuisine]], [[Singaporean cuisine]], and [[Vietnamese cuisine]], among others.

== Chinese cuisine in diaspora ==
See [[American Chinese cuisine]] and [[Canadian Chinese cuisine]] for the development of Chinese cuisine in North America. Chinese cuisine is also highly developed in Western Europe. Within the United States, the [[cuisine of Hawaii]] contains many Chinese foods and Chinese influences, due to the high number of Chinese and Asian immigrants. However, Chinese-originated or -inspired foods are often combined with those of other cuisines in novel ways.

==Contemporary health trends==
According to the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] estimates for 2000-02, 11% of the population of the People's Republic of China were undernourished. [http://www.fao.org/es/ess/yearbook/vol_1_2/pdf/China.pdf]  The number of undernourished people in the country has fallen from 386.6 million in 1969-71 to 142.1 million in 2000-02. [http://www.fao.org/faostat/foodsecurity/Files/NumberUndernourishment.xls]  The country still receives international food aid, but the [[World Food Program]] notes that the country achieved its goal of national agricultural self-sufficiency in the mid 1990s.  The WFP says hunger is concentrated in rural, resource-poor areas of northern, northwestern, and southwestern China. [http://www.wfp.org/country_brief/indexcountry.asp?region=5&amp;section=9&amp;sub_section=5&amp;country=156]  

A typical Chinese peasant before industrialization would have eaten meat rarely and most meals would have consisted of rice accompanied with green vegetables, with [[protein]] coming from foods like [[peanut]]s. Fats and sugar were luxuries not eaten on a regular basis by most of the population. In Chinese traditional culture, being overweight was a sign of prosperity and wealth as only the wealthy could afford fatty or sweet foods or even buy enough food to become fat. As income levels have increased, Chinese diets have become richer with more meats, fats, and sugar being consumed.   

While economic change has significantly reduced undernourishment, new health problems related to overconsumption and poor dietary choices have increased significantly. The incidence of nutrition-related disease and overweightness, including obesity (especially among children) has risen dramatically in mainland China over the last 10-15 years. [http://english.people.com.cn/200510/24/eng20051024_216452.html]  Health advocates put some of the blame on the increased popularity of Western foods, especially [[fast food]], and other culinary products and habits. Many Western, especially American, fast food chains have appeared in China, and are highly successful economically. These include [[McDonalds|McDonald's]] and [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] (KFC).

==Note==
{{note|1}} Note: In most [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] or [[dialects]] of [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the [[verb]] for consuming soup is actually translatable literally as &quot;drink&quot;.
&lt;!-- adverb and other prons a.d ions should be done --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Constantin Brancusi''' ([[February 19]], [[1876]] &amp;ndash; [[March 16]], [[1957]], originally '''Constantin Brâncuşi''' {{IPA|/kon.stan'tin brɨn'kuʃʲ/}}), was a [[Romania]]n [[sculpture|sculptor]], born in [[Hobita, Gorj|Hobiţa]], [[Gorj]], near [[Targu Jiu|Târgu Jiu]], where he placed his [[Sculptural Ensemble of Constantin Brancusi from Târgu Jiu|sculptural ensemble]] with ''[[The Table of Silence]]'', ''[[The Gate of the Kiss]]'' and ''[[The Endless Column]]''. 

==Life==
Brancusi studied art at the Şcoala de Meserii (school of arts and crafts) in [[Craiova]] from 1894 to 1898 and at the Şcoala Naţională de Arte Frumoase (national school of fine arts) in [[Bucharest]] from 1898 to 1901. Wishing to further his education in [[Paris]], he arrived there in 1904 and enrolled in the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in 1905. 

As an art student he was influenced by [[Auguste Rodin]], but his style moved beyond naturalist representation to stylized elegant forms. Brancusi was one of the first sculptors to experiment with [[abstract art]] (although never, in his own view, moving into ''pure abstraction''). His [[sculpture|sculptures]] became progressively smoother and less figurative, until only the barest outline of the original subject was left, venturing even farther away from figurative sculpture than his countryman and contemporary [[Dimitrie Paciurea]].

Brancusi produced a series of sculptures in metal called ''[[Bird in Space]]''. [[Edward Steichen]], a prominent photographer purchased one of these ''birds'' and tried to bring it into the United States. Under U.S. Customs code, works of art may be imported into the country duty-free. However, Customs officers did not accept the ''bird'' as a work of art and assessed a duty of $600 classifying it as a propeller blade. Subsequently a trial overturned the assessment.

Constantin Brancusi lived and worked from [[1925]] to [[1957]] in his workshop, located in the ''impasse Ronsin'', in the [[15ème arrondissement, Paris|15ème arrondissement]] of Paris. The original workshop has disappeared and has been rebuilt near the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]].

Located in the Montparnasse Cemetery are statues carved by Brancusi for a few fellow artists who committed suicide, the best-known of which is his ''[[Le Baiser]]'' (''The Kiss'').

Brancusi died on [[March 16]], [[1957]] and was buried in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]], [[Paris|Paris, France]].

==Legacy==

His works are housed in the New York [[Museum of Modern Art]] and in the [[National Museum of Art of Romania]] (in Bucharest), as well as in other major museums around the world.

Brancusi's onetime studio in Paris is open to the public. It is very close to the [[Pompidou Centre]], in the rue Rambuteau. He bequeathed part of his collection to the French state on condition that his workshop be rebuilt as it was on the day he died.

In [[2004]], a sculpture by Brancusi named ''Danaide'' sold for [[United States dollar|$]]18.1 million, the highest that a sculpture piece had ever sold for at auction. In May [[2005]], a piece from the ''Bird in Space'' series broke that record, selling for [[United States dollar|$]]27.5 million in a [[Christie's]] auction. [http://money.cnn.com/2005/05/05/news/newsmakers/brancusi.reut/index.htm?cnn=yes]

==Quotations==
''The people who call my work 'abstract' are imbeciles; what they call 'abstract' is in fact the purest [[realism (arts)|realism]], the reality of which is not represented by external form but by the [[idealism|idea]] behind it, the essence of the work.''

''Create like a god, command like a king, work like a slave.''

The '''Central Powers''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Mittelmächte'') were the nations of [[Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and [[Bulgaria]], which fought against the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] during [[World War I]]. They are called this because they all were located between [[Russia]] in the east and [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in the west. 

Germany and Austria-Hungary became allies on [[7 October]] [[1879]], being joined subsequently ([[20 May]] [[1882]]) (see [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]) by [[Italy]], which however undertook secretly in [[1902]] not to honour its alliance commitments against Germany's principal adversary France. Italy entered World War I on [[May 23]], [[1915]] &amp;mdash; in alliance with Britain. After World War I, however, the [[fascist]] regime in Italy would go back to its old agreement and, instead, ally itself with [[Nazi]] Germany. 

Following the outbreak of [[Europe|European]] war in August 1914, the [[Ottoman Empire]] intervened at the end of October against Russia, provoking declarations of war by the [[Triple Entente]] powers--Russia, France and Britain. 

Bulgaria, still resentful after its defeat in July 1913 at the hands of [[Serbia]], [[Greece]], [[Romania]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], was the last nation to enter the war against the Entente, invading Serbia in conjunction with German and Austro-Hungarian forces in October 1915. 

Bulgaria signed an armistice with the Allies on [[29 September]] [[1918]], following a successful Allied advance in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The [[Ottoman Empire]] followed suit on [[30 October]] in the face of British and Arab gains in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Syria]]. [[Austria]] and [[Hungary]] concluded ceasefires separately during the first week of November following the disintegration of the Habsburg Empire, and Germany signed the armistice ending the war on the morning of [[11 November]] after a succession of advances by [[Belgium|Belgian]], British, French and [[United States of America|US]] forces in north-eastern France and Belgium.

{{conservatism}}


'''Conservatism''' [derivative of conserve; from Latin conservare, to keep, guard, observe] in its true and classic sense is a simple philosophy that emphasizes &quot;a disposition to preserve, and an ability to improve&quot;.{{ref|Burke}}  Classical conservatism does not readily avail itself to the ideology of objectives.  It is a philosophy primarily concerned with means over ends.  To a classical conservative, the goal of change is less important than the insistence that change be affected with a respect for the rule of law and traditions of society.  The traditional enemy of conservatism, therefore, is [[radicalism]] (not, as is often asserted, [[liberalism]]).


==Development of Thought==

Despite its prevalence, conservatism does not have, nor lend itself to, a systematic treatise like [[Hobbes|Hobbes’]] ''Leviathon'' or [[John Locke|Locke’s]] ''Two Treatise of Government''.  Consequently, what is means to be a conservative today is frequently the subject of debate and muddied by association to various (and often opposing) ideologies or political parties.  The scholar, R.J. White, once put it this way:&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;To put conservatism in a bottle with a label is like trying to liquefy the atmosphere … The difficulty arises from the nature of the thing.  For conservatism is less a political doctrine than a habit of mind, a mode of feeling, a way of living.&quot;'' {{ref|White}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although political thought, from its beginnings, contains many strains that can be retrospectively labeled conservative, it was not until the [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]], and in particular the reaction to events surrounding the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, that conservatism began to rise as a distinct attitude or train of thought.  Many point to the rise of a conservative disposition in the wake of the [[Reformation]] and specifically to the works of influential [[Anglican]] theologian, '''[[Richard Hooker (theologian)|Richard Hooker]]''' – emphasizing moderation in the political balancing of interests towards the goals of social harmony and common good.  But it was not until Edmund Burke’s polemic – ''Reflections on the Revolution in France'' – that conservatism gained its most influential statement of views.

[[Image:Edmund_Burke.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Edmund Burke (1729-1797)]] [[Anglo-Irish]] statesman '''[[Edmund Burke]]''', who argued so forcefully against the [[French Revolution]], also sympathised with some of the aims of the [[American Revolution]]. This classical conservative tradition often insists that conservatism has no ideology in the sense of a [[utopia|utopian]] programme, with some form of master plan. Burke developed his ideas in reaction to the 'enlightened' idea of a society guided by abstract reason. Although he did not use the term, he anticipated the critique of [[modernism]], a term first used at the end of the 19th century by the Dutch religious conservative [[Abraham Kuyper]]. Burke was troubled by the Enlightenment and argued, instead, for the value of tradition.

Some men, argued Burke, have more reason than others, and thus some men will make worse governments if they rely upon reason than others. To Burke, the proper formulation of government came not from abstractions such as &quot;Reason,&quot; but from time-honoured development of the state and of other important societal institutions such as the family and the Church.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;''We are afraid to put men to live and trade each on his own private stock of reason, because we suspect that this stock in each man is small, and that the individuals would do better to avail themselves of the general bank and capital of nations and ages. Many of our men of speculation, instead of exploding general prejudices, employ their sagacity to discover the latent wisdom which prevails in them. If they find what they seek, and they seldom fail, they think it more wise to continue the prejudice, with the reason involved, than to cast away the coat of prejudice, and to leave nothing but naked reason; because prejudice, with its reason, has a motive to give action to that reason, and an affection which will give it permanence.''&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke argued that tradition is a much sounder foundation than &quot;reason&quot;. The conservative paradigm he established emphasises the futility of attempting to ground human society based on pure abstractions (such as &quot;reason,&quot; &quot;equality,&quot; or, more recently, &quot;diversity&quot;), and the necessity of humility in the face of the unknowable. Tradition draws on the wisdom of many generations and the tests of time, while &quot;reason&quot; may be a mask for the preferences of one man, and at best represents only the untested wisdom of one generation.  Any  existing value or institution has undergone the correcting influence of past experience and ought to be respected. 

Conservatives do not reject change, as Burke wrote &quot;a state without the means of change is without the means of its conservation,&quot; but they insist that further change be organic, rather than revolutionary. An attempt to modify the complex web of human interactions that form human society for the sake of some doctrine or theory runs the risk of running afoul of the iron law of [[unintended consequence]]s. Burke advocates vigilance against the possibility of [[moral hazard]]s. For conservatives, human society is something rooted and organic; to try to prune and shape it according to the plans of an ideologue is to invite unforeseen disaster.

At the end of the Napoleonic period, the [[Congress of Vienna]] marked the beginning of a conservative reaction in Europe, to contain the liberal and nationalist forces unleashed by the French revolution. [[Joseph de Maistre]] was the most influential spokesperson for counter-revolutionary and authoritarian conservatism, with the emphasis on monarchy as a guarantee of order in society.

==Schools of Conservatism==
===Cultural Conservatism===
[[Cultural Conservatism]] hopes to enshrine the received heritage of a successful nation or culture. The culture in question may be as large as [[Western culture]] or [[China|Chinese]] [[civilization]] or as small as that of [[Tibet]].

Cultural conservatives try to adapt norms handed down from the past. The norms may be romantic: the [[anti-metric movement]], demanding the retention of [[avoirdupois]] weights and measures in Britain, and opposing their replacement with the [[Metrication#United Kingdom|metric system]] is a classic example. They may be institutional: in the West this has included [[chivalry]] and [[feudalism]], as well as [[capitalism]], [[laicite]] and the [[rule of law]]. In the East, an example is the state examination system in China or widespread cultural tolerance in India. The norms may also be moral, according to [[social conservatism|social conservatives]].  For example, in some cultures such practices as homosexuality or abortion are thought to be wrong. And in other cultures women who expose their faces or limbs in public are considered immoral, and conservatives in those cultures often support laws to prohibit such practices.  Other conservatives take a more positive approach, supporting good samaritan laws, or laws requiring public charity, if their
culture considers these acts moral.

Cultural conservatives often argue that old institutions have adapted to a particular place or culture and therefore ought to persevere. Depending on how universalizing (or skeptical) they are, cultural conservatives may or may not accept cultures that differ from their own.  Many conservatives believe in a universal morality, but others will allow that moral codes may differ from nation to nation, and only try to support their moral code within their own culture. That is, a cultural conservative may doubt whether the broad ideals of French communities would be equally appropriate in Germany.

===Religious Conservatism===
Religious conservatives look to the receipt of special knowledge from a traditional source. Note that these values arrive external to their surrounding social order; religion opposes &quot;the world,&quot; though it may be informed by the world. So religious conservatism, rather than considering local sources of tradition, defers to the officially recognised custodians of the spiritual, theological and legalistic framework considered to be special knowledge received so long ago. These custodians can be, depending on the religion in question, relatively centralized, such as the case of the Catholic church, for example, or relatively de-centralised as in the case of Islam and other religions where there is no single supreme authority equivalent to the Pope or Dalai Lama, but rather authority is distributed among a learned class or caste, leaving it to individual believers to choose their own spiritual leader based on their inclinations, capacities and personal needs. It is worth noting that the greater the degree of this de-centralisation, the greater the lack of a common, clearly elucidated position, which can give rise to often conflicting messages to the outside observer unfamiliar with the tradition in question.

This means religious conservatism may not use the word tradition quite like other conservatives. Tradition in some religious contexts does not invoke a historically informed evolution. Church tradition by definition (in some cases) cannot evolve because it derives tradition from an unchanging divine act. This does not mean that church tradition never adapts, but that any &quot;changes&quot; enacted after [[revelation]] are refinements rather than discontinuities. St. Paul illustrates this use of tradition in [[First Corinthians]]: &quot;I have received from the Lord that which also I ''delivered'' unto you.&quot; The Latin word for ''delivered'' here is ''traditio''.

While some conservatives may be wary of government intervention into the private lives of citizens, even when that intervention is in support of traditional values, religious conservative movements in general tend to support such causes. The almost universal support by secular, Christian, Jewish, and Muslim conservatives for pro-life movements is the most prominent example.

Conservative governments influenced by religious conservatives may promote broad campaigns for a return to traditional values, such as the [[Back to Basics]] campaign of British premier [[John Major]]. In the [[European Union]], a conservative campaign sought to constitutionally specify certain conservative values in the proposed [[European Constitution]]. Most prominently, [[Pope John Paul II]] lobbied for inclusion of a reference to God, which was narrowly defeated.

Radical movements within established religious traditions illustrate the paradoxical method by which branches of religious conservatism can emerge that, rather than trying to preserve an existing, generally conservative, social order, seek to overthrow that existing order in the name of a puritanical ideal and enforce adoption of a perceived 'pristine' form of the religion usually consisting of a highly literalist, legalistic and, in some cases anti-spiritual core of traditions, values, worldview, and lifestyle.  This radical or revolutionary movement is usually a reaction against perceived abuses, corruption or heresy within the existing tradition, a clear example of this was the [[Protestant]] movement in Christianity.

For example, in [[Islam]] the [[Salafi|Salafist]] movement is often politically and socially radical, and violently repressed by governments and also distrusted by the majority of mainstream Muslims for that reason. Salafism seeks to impose, by force if necessary, its vision of a model Islamic society which existed at the time of [[Muhammad]]'s death and for a short time thereafter, rejects all the later development of Islamic societies, and can therefore be classified as a radical religious conservatism. The Salafi give great prominence to a disputed [[hadith]] (reported statement of the Prophet), which is classically conservative:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Every innovation is misguidance...''[http://www.islamicacademy.org/html/Articles/English/BID'AH%20-%20Innovation%20in%20Islam.htm]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Similar phenomena have arisen in practically all the world's religions, and in many cases this process was triggered by the violent and generally humiliating cultural collision between the traditional society in question and the modern Western form of civilisation that has been propagated throughout the world over the past 500 years. In fact, perhaps most paradoxical of all,  it can be observed that much of what is labelled as radical religious conservatism in the modern world is in fact none other than an indigenous fusion of traditional religious ideals with modern, european revolutionary philosophy, often Marxist in nature.

==Ideological Interaction and Influence==
Many forms of conservatism incorporate elements of other [[ideology|ideologies]] and philosophies. In turn, conservatism has influence upon them. Most conservatives strongly support the [[nation-state]] (although that was not so in the 19th century), and [[patriotism|patriotically]] identify with their own nation.  Nationalist [[separatist]] movements are by definition radical but also conservative.  They appeal to tradition and often emphasise rural life and [[folkways]]. Along such lines, controversial claims of association with [[Fascism]] have been argued, particularly in Europe (see [[Fascism and ideology#Fascism and Conservatism|Fascism and ideology]]).

===Nationalism===
[[Nationalism]], which sees the nation as a long-term, centuries-old, community, has many conservative aspects. Conversely, any centuries-old community is by definition attractive to traditionalist and Burkean conservatives. Conservatives may describe their preferred values as the ''national values'', implying that they are in some way compulsory for any resident of the nation. In recent responses to terrorism, both prime minister [[Tony Blair]] and opposition leader [[Michael Howard]] have suggested that British values and the ''British way of life'' must be enforced in Britain. They refer to a kind of 'Britishness' or 'Englishness' which has a literary rather than a political origin - [[George Orwell]], for instance, defended English values and even the monarchy.

Value conservatives in Europe appeal to 'national values'. Burkean conservatives value them for their own sake, because they are the result of long experience, but religious conservatives may use 'community values' as a [[euphemism]] for their own Christian values, or even for [[dominionism|theonomy]]. All nationalists appeal to national symbolism - the [[national flag]], national historical icons, founders and emblems, the work of national poets and authors, or the representation of the nation by its artists - and this is often adopted by conservatives. Military institutions in particular defend the nation and also provide tradition and ritual, so conservatives often admire military values: [[duty]], [[sacrifice]] and [[obedience]]. But good intentions do not always bear out, and this nationalism has often and easily degenerated into [[militarism]] and [[jingoism]]. Where the nation is not independent, open patriotism is impossible anyway. Consider a [[Kurdistan|Kurdish]] nationalist in Turkey, for
instance, with no official institutions to admire. Saluting the Kurdish flag in public means risking arrest by the Turkish police - one man's patriotism is another man's treason.

[[Nationalism]], and more generally [[patriotism]], are therefore typical features of modern conservatism, in established [[nation-state]]s. This was not the case in the 19th century, when the movements inspired by [[romantic nationalism]] were necessarily radical opponents of the then existing states, and separatist movements still are. Nor is present-day nationalism confined to self-identified conservatives, or to the right. The perception persists that nationalism is a remote or provincial ideology, but it is by definition the basis of every nation-state. Nevertheless, even nationalist conservatives sometimes prefer the less pejorative term patriotism, and Burkean conservatives would distance themselves from many nationalist groups and ideologies, on the grounds of their radicalism.

Nevertheless radical nationalist conservatism has been a major force in European history, no matter how distasteful that may be to many mainstream conservatives. Anti-immigrant and nationalist [[populist]] parties, such as France's [[Front National (France) | Front National]], continue to include a strong conservative element, and the conservative-nationalist tradition is very strong in Germany.

===Liberalism===
In the USA conservatism and [[liberalism]] are sometimes seen as polar opposites, yet in actuality the situation is more complex.  A major area of difference in US politics is that between [[social liberalism]] and [[social conservatism]].  Social liberals advocate policies promoting equality and tolerance while social conservatives support established traditions of American society, or norms of their previous generations.  The media widely covers the differences in opinion in issues such as [[same-sex marriage]], [[sex education]], the [[separation of church and state]] among others.  Fiscally, US liberals are regarded as advocates for consumer protection regulations, and other policies which run contrary to a more fiscal conservative, (or [[neoliberal]]) ideal.  The overall (US) terms ''liberal'' and ''conservative'' are [[generalization]]s and do not point to any concrete set of ideals or values.  In the US, the use of the term &quot;neoliberal&quot; is limited mainly to non-mainstream leftist critics of fiscal conservatism and/or of the free trade movement.  Some Americans term themselves &quot;libertarians&quot; (including some who support the Libertarian Party) and advocate fiscal conservatism along with social liberalism.  

The terms ''Economic conservatism'' or ''Fiscal conservatism'' are general terms, encompass modern [[neoliberalism]], as well as [[classical liberalism]] in the tradition of [[Adam Smith]].  Popularly used outside of North America, the traditional usage of ''liberal'' refers only to these free-market policies.  For example, in Europe 'liberal-conservative' is an accepted term.  Differences in meaning and usage of the term 'liberal' have contributed to some confusion, see [[Liberalism]].

Theorists of liberalism often assert a moral justification for the free market, grounded in principles of individual liberty and individual choice. Their support is not moral or ideological, but driven by the Burkean notion of prescription: what works best is what is right. Conservatives might also emphasise the importance of [[civil society]] in this context: government intervention in the economy will make people feel less responsible for the society. It is necessary to note, however, that many wealthy advocates of [[free-market|free-market economics]] such as the industrialist [[Andrew Carnegie]] do not oppose government subsidies.

Historically, many arguments have been advanced for the free market, and liberal principles in general. Present western classical-liberalism and political conservatism may have reached their pro-market position by different routes, but by now the lines have blurred. Rarely will a politician claim that free markets are &quot;simply more productive&quot; or &quot;simply the right thing to do&quot; but a combination of both. This merging of the classical liberal and conservative positions is found in most western conservative movements.

In any case , also in part made possible by the appearance of new, larger breeds of horses. The replacement of the insubstantial Roman [[horse tack|saddle]] by variants on the Scythian model, with pommel and cantle, was significant too.

New armored Cataphracts were deployed in eastern [[Europe]] and the [[near East]], notably in [[Persian Empire|Persia]]n forces as the main striking force of the armies, whereas earlier cavalry had to be consigned to the flanks.

The introduction of the [[stirrup]] allowed for even heavier cavalry.  As a greater weight of man and armor could be supported in the saddle, the almost-certainty of being dismounted in combat was reduced. In the initial charge a [[lance]] could be 'set' rather than held over-head&amp;mdash;leading to an enormous increase in the impact of a charge. In western Europe there emerged the heaviest of the heavy cavalry, the [[knight]]&amp;mdash; exchanging much of the mobility advantage for a massive, irresistible first charge.

Knights quickly became an important military force in western Europe, although it is worth noting that Medieval military doctrine actually employed them as part of a combined-arms force along with various kinds of foot troops. Still, Medieval chroniclers tended to pay undue attention to the knights at the expense of the rank and file, and this has led early students of military history to suppose that knights were the only things that mattered on Medieval European battlefields--a view with hardly any grounding in reality. Massed English longbowmen triumphed over French cavalry at [[Battle of Crécy |Crécy]], [[Battle of Poitiers |Poitiers]] and [[Battle of Agincourt |Agincourt]], while at [[Battle of Gisors|Gisors]] (1188), [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]] (1314), and [[Battle of Laupen|Laupen]] (1339), foot-soldiers proved their invulnerability to cavalry charges as long as they held their formation. However, the rise of infantry as the principal arm had to wait for the [[Swiss]] to develop their [[pike square|pike-squares]] into an offensive arm instead of a defensive one; this new aggressive doctrine brought the Swiss to victory over a range of adversaries, although eventually  numbers would tell ([[Battle of St. Jakob an der Birs]]). The introduction of less effective but simpler missile weapons, like the [[crossbow]], was additionally decisive. A top-quality 15th century army could be 50 percent cavalry, but by the 1520s this proportion had fallen below 25 percent. Knighthood quickly became associated with land ownership and senior positions in the [[feudal]] social structure. 

[[Image:Italian_cavalry_drill.png|300px|thumb|Italian cavalry officers practice their horsemanship in 1904 outside Rome.]]
From the 1550s, the use of gunpowder weapons solidified infantry's dominance of the battlefield, and began to allow true mass armies to develop. This is closely related to the increase in the size of armies throughout the early modern period; heavily armored cavalrymen were expensive to raise and maintain, and it took years to replace a skilled horseman or a trained horse, while [[arquebusier]]s and later [[musketeer]]s could be trained and maintained at a much lower expense, in addition to being much easier to replace. The Spanish [[tercio]] and later formations relegated cavalry to a supporting role. The [[pistol]] was specifically developed to try and bring cavalry back into the conflict, together with manoeuvres such as the [[caracole]]. These innovations were not particularly successful, however, and soon the charge was revived as the primary mode of employment for European cavalry. The [[demi-lancer]]s and the heavily armored sword-and-pistol [[reiter]]s were among the types of cavalry that experienced their heydays in the 16th and 17th centuries.

In any case, cavalry still had a role to play. First and foremost they remained the primary choice for confronting enemy cavalry. Attacking an unbroken infantry force head-on was usually unsuccessful, but the extended linear formations were vulnerable to flank or rear attacks. Cavalry was important at [[Battle of Blenheim|Blenheim]] ([[1704]]), [[Battle of Rossbach|Rossbach]] ([[1757]]), and [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]] ([[1807]]), remaining a significant factor throughout the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. And while massed infantry was deadly to cavalry, it was an excellent target for [[artillery]]&amp;mdash;once formations were broken, cavalry was essential and deadly in the harry and [[rout]] of the scattered infantry. It was not until individual firearms gained accuracy and improved rates of fire that cavalry was diminished in this role as well. Even then light cavalry remained an indispensable tool for scouting, screening the army's movements, and harassing the enemy's supply lines until military aircraft supplanted them in this role in the early 20th century.

By the [[Nineteenth Century]], [[Europe]]an cavalry fell into four main categories:

* [[Cuirassier]]s, heavy cavalry
* [[Dragoon]]s, originally mounted infantry but later regarded as medium cavalry
* [[Hussar]]s, light cavalry
* [[Lancer]]s or [[Uhlan]]s, light cavalry armed with [[lance]]s

There were cavalry variations for individual nations as well: [[France]] had the ''chasseurs à cheval''; [[Germany]] had the ''Jäger zu Pferd''; [[Bavaria]] had the ''Chevaulegers''; and [[Russia]] had Cossacks. Britain had no [[cuirassier]]s (other than the [[Household Cavalry]]), but had Dragoon Guards regiments which were classed as heavy cavalry. In the [[United States Army]], the cavalry were almost always [[dragoon]]s. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] had its cavalry dressed as [[hussar]]s, but fought as dragoons.

These forces found new success in Imperial operations ([[irregular military|irregular warfare]]), where modern weapons were lacking and the slow moving infantry-artillery train or fixed fortifications were often ineffective against native insurgents (unless the natives offered a fight on an equal footing, as at [[Battle of Tel al-Kebir|Tel-el-Kebir]], [[Battle of Omdurman |Omdurman]], etc). Cavalry &quot;[[flying column]]s&quot; proved effective, or at least cost-effective, in many campaigns&amp;mdash;although an astute native commander (like [[Samori]] in western Africa, [[Shamil]] in the [[Caucasus]], or any of the better [[Boer]] commanders) could use the added mobility (but reduced firepower) against European forces.

In the early [[American Civil War]] regular cavalry was significantly absent, but it continued to play a role as part of screening forces and in foraging and scouting. The later phases of the war saw the Federal army developing a truly effective cavalry force fighting as [[mounted infantry]].

== Asia ==

In eastern Europe, Russia, and out onto the [[steppes]] cavalry remained important much longer and dominated the scene of warfare until the early [[1600s]] and even beyond, as the strategic mobility of cavalry was crucial for controlling the vast expanses of territory.  [[Hun]]s, [[Mongol]]s and [[Cossack]]s are examples of the horse-mounted peripheral peoples that managed to gain substantial successes in military conflicts with Western civilizations, due to their strategic and tactical mobility. As European states began to assume the character of bureaucratic nation-states supported by professional standing armies, they were keen to recruit these mounted warriors in order to fill the strategic roles of scouts and raiders as well as devices of tactical harassment on the battlefield.  For instance, Cossack cavalry regiments were an important part of the Imperial Russian Army until the Revolution, and some even served in the [[Red Army]].

Further east, the [[military history of China]] was a scene of intense military exchange between the powerful infantry forces of the settled empires and the mounted &quot;barbarians&quot; of the north. On many occasions the Chinese studied nomadic cavalry tactics and applied the lessons in creating their own potent cavalry forces, while in others they simply recruited the tribal horsemen wholesale into their armies; and in yet other cases nomadic empires have proved eager to enlist Chinese infantry, as in the case of the [[Mongol Empire]] and its sinicized part, the [[Yuan Dynasty]].

[[Tibet]], [[Korea]], and [[Japan]], as well as the [[Turkic]] tribesmen of [[Central Asia]], have also been known to develop strong cavalry forces in the past.

=== British Indian Army ===
The [[British Indian Army]] maintained scores of regiments of cavalry, officered by British and manned by Indian [[sowars]] (cavalrymen). The legendary exploits of this branch lives on in literature and early films. Among the more famous regiments that continue to be figure in lineages of modern Indian and Pakistani Armies are:

* Governor General's Bodyguard (now [[Indian Presidential Bodyguard]])
* Skinner's Horse (now Indian [[1st Horse (Skinner's)]])
* Gardner's Lancers (now Indian [[2nd Lancers (Gardner's)]])
* Hodson's Horse (now Indian [[3rd Horse (Hodson's)]]) of the Bengal Lancers fame
* Probyn's Horse (now Pakistani)
* Royal Deccan Horse (now Indian [[The Deccan Horse]])
* Poona Horse (now Indian [[The Poona Horse]])
* Queen's Own Guides Cavalry (now partitioned between Pakistan and India)

== Cavalry's demise ==
In the [[20th century]] the advent of modern [[vehicle|vehicles]] with effective [[mobility]] and [[armor]], such as [[tank]]s, provided the opportunity for vehicles to replace horses as the key mobile element of an army. This change was made even more necessary by the development of the [[machine gun]] and other weapons which could easily destroy cavalry formations.  Horses became relegated to [[logistical]] roles, with few exceptions (see [[tachanka]]).

The demise of cavalry as a decisive force on the battlefield came in the [[World War I|First World War]] when cavalry forces were slaughtered while failing to achieve a strategic breakthrough on the [[Western Front]]. They nevertheless played an important role on several fronts, particularly in the Middle East.  

After [[World War I]] and the [[Polish-Bolshevik War]], horse cavalry was gradually abandoned as a major combat weapon by the industrialized powers. The last major cavalry battle was the [[Battle of Komarów]] in [[1920]]. In the 1920s and '30s most industrialized countries either transformed their cavalry units into [[mounted infantry]] or [[motorized infantry]]. The last cavalry charges in modern warfare were seen in the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Although there have been some engagements in twentieth and twenty-first century [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] wars involving cavalry, particularly by partisan or guerrilla fighters in areas with poor transport infrastructure, these units were not used as cavalry but rather as mounted infantry.

Cavalry actually experienced a minor revival in the more mobile warfare of World War II.  Russia, Italy, Germany, and even the United States fielded mounted units.  Russia also fielded combined mechanized and horse units.

Cavalry traditions and insignia were often inherited by the emerging armored formations and air forces. 

In the [[British Army]], all cavalry regiments were mechanised, re-roling from horse to armoured vehicles, to make up, with the [[Royal Tank Regiment]], the [[Royal Armoured Corps]].

In the [[Canadian Army]] a number of both regular and reserve units have cavalry roots.  These include [[The Governor General's Horse Guards]], [[Lord Strathcona's Horse]], The [[Royal Canadian Dragoons]], and The [[South Alberta Light Horse]].  Several current divisions of the [[United States Army]] and other modern armies retain the name &quot;cavalry&quot; due to their origins in the era of horse cavalry; they generally consist in [[armour|armored]] forces.  The [[United States]] also has [[air cavalry]] units equipped with [[helicopter]]s.

Today [[Indian Army]]'s [[61st Cavalry]] remains the only regular horse-mounted cavalry in the world -- preserving its heritage by recruiting only former Maharajahs and Rajputs. Indian Army maintains some of its Armored Regiments under the title of [[Lancer]]s or [[Horse]].

== Light and heavy cavalry ==
Historically, cavalry was divided into light and [[heavy cavalry]]. The difference was mainly how much [[armor]] was worn by the [[soldier]]s, and thus how powerful their mounts had to be in order to sustain the burden. 

Early light cavalry (like the auxiliaries of the Roman army) were typically used to [[scout]] and [[skirmish]] and to cut down retreating infantry. Heavy cavalry like the [[Byzantine]] [[Cataphract]] were used as shock troops &amp;mdash; they would charge the main body of the enemy and in many cases, their actions decided the outcome of the battle.

During the [[Early modern warfare|Gunpowder Age]], armored cavalry began to approach obsolescence. However, many units retained [[cuirass]]es and helmets for their protective values against [[sword]] and [[bayonet]] strikes and the morale boost they provides to the wearers. By this time the main difference between light and heavy cavalry was their training; the former was regarded as a tool for harassment and reconnaissance, while the latter was considered best for close-order charges.

Since the development of armored warfare the distinction between light and heavy armor has persisted basically along the same lines. [[Armored car]]s and [[light tanks]] have adopted the [[reconnaissance]] role while medium and heavy tanks are regarded as the decisive [[shock troops]].

== Social status ==
From the beginning of civilization to the 20th century, ownership of heavy cavalry horses has been a mark of wealth amongst settled peoples. A cavalry horse involves considerable expense in breeding, training, feeding, and equipment, and has very little productive use except as a mode of transport. 

For this reason, and because of their often decisive military role, the cavalry has typically been associated with high [[Social status|social status]]. This was most clearly seen in the [[Feudalism|feudal system]], where a lord was expected to enter combat armored and on horseback and bring with him an entourage of [[Peasants|peasants]] on foot. If landlords and peasants came into conflict, the peasants would be ill-equipped to defeat armored knights.

In later national armies the cavalry often remained a badge of social status, with the typical exception of &quot;frontier&quot; units like [[Cossacks]]. For instance, an officer of any British cavalry regiment is almost certain to have attended elite schools and to come from a socially privileged background.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''citric acid cycle''' (also known as the '''tricarboxylic acid cycle''', the '''TCA''' cycle, or the '''Krebs cycle''') is a series of [[chemical reaction]]s of central importance in all living [[cell (biology)|cell]]s that utilize [[oxygen]] as part of [[cellular respiration]]. In [[aerobic organism]]s, the citric acid cycle is part of a [[metabolic pathway]] involved in the chemical conversion of [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s and [[protein]]s into [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]] to generate a form of usable energy.  
It is the second of three metabolic pathways that are involved in [[fuel molecule]] [[catabolism]] and [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production, the other two being [[glycolysis]] and [[oxidative phosphorylation]].

The citric acid cycle also provides precursors for many compounds such as certain [[amino acid]]s, and some of its reactions are therefore important even in cells performing [[fermentation]].

==History==
The ''citric acid cycle'' is also known as the ''Krebs cycle'' after Sir [[Hans Adolf Krebs]] (1900-1981), who proposed the key elements of this pathway in 1937 and was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine]] for its discovery in [[1953]]. It is correctly written without a possessive [[apostrophe]].

==Location of cycle and inputs and outputs==
The citric acid cycle takes place within the [[mitochondrial matrix]] in [[eukaryote]]s, and within the [[cytoplasm]] in [[prokaryote]]s.

[[Image:TCA_reactions.png|thumb|center|738px|'''The reactions of TCAC as they happen in a human cell'''.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border-width: 0px; border-bottom: 1px solid black; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The color scheme is as follows: &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;enzymes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(219,155,36);&quot;&gt;coenzymes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(151,149,45);&quot;&gt;substrate names&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(227,13,196);&quot;&gt;metal ions&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128,0,0);&quot;&gt;inorganic molecules&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;inhibition&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;stimulation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;]] 

[[Fuel molecule]] catabolism (including [[glycolysis]]) produces [[acetyl-CoA]], a two-[[carbon]] [[acetyl]] group bound to [[coenzyme A]]. Acetyl-CoA is the main input to the citric acid cycle. 
[[Citrate]] is both the first and the last product of the cycle (Fig 1), and is regenerated by the condensation of [[oxaloacetate]] and acetyl-CoA.

The sum of all reactions in the citric acid cycle is:

: Acetyl-CoA + 3 NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + FAD + GDP + P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → &lt;br&gt; CoA-SH + 3 NADH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + GTP + 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

Two carbons are [[oxidation|oxidized]] to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the energy from these reactions is stored in [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] , NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are [[coenzyme]]s (molecules that enable or enhance enzymes) that store energy and are utilized in [[oxidative phosphorylation]].

===A simplified view of the process:===
* The process begins with the oxidation of pyruvate, producing one CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and one acetyl-CoA.
* Acetyl-CoA reacts with the four carbon carboxylic acid, oxaloacetate--to form the six carbon carboxylic acid, citrate. 
* Through a series of reactions citrate is converted back to oxaloacetate. This cycle produces 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and consumes 3 NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, producing 3NADH and 3H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. 
* It consumes 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and consumes one FAD, producing one FADH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.
* 1st turn end= 1 ATP, 3 NADH, 1 FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
* Since there are two molecules of Pyruvic acid to deal with, the cycle turns once more.
* The complete end result= 2 ATP, 6 NADH, 2 FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

== Regulation ==
Many of the enzymes in the TCA cycle are regulated by [[Enzyme#Metabolic pathways and allosteric enzymes|negative feedback]] from ATP when the [[energy charge]] of the cell is high. Such enzymes include the [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]] complex that synthesises the acetyl-CoA needed for the first reaction of the TCA cycle. Also the enzymes citrate synthase, isocitras used in a similar way (what you see on a rifle has probably already been done on a crossbow). Makers of crossbows (arbalistmeisters) were making quite beautiful crossbow stocks by [[1600]]. Some Belgian designs were as polished as those of modern [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] rifles.

Crossbows were actively being used in European warfare from [[800]] to [[1500]] A.D.  They supplanted bows in many European armies for a number of reasons. An expertly handled longbow had greater range, better accuracy (the &quot;arbalest&quot; or siege crossbow being the exception here), and a much faster rate of fire than an average crossbow,  but the value of the crossbow came in its simplicity: it could be used effectively after a week of training, while a comparable single-shot skill with a longbow could take years.  The use of winches allowed soldiers to use and fire weapons with a draw force far in excess of what they could have handled with a bow. In the later years of the crossbow it had enough kinetic energy to penetrate the armor of a knight with ease: some reached a draw force of nearly 350 lbf (1600 N), compared to the 60-180lbf (300-900 N) draw force for a longbow. Moreover, crossbows could be kept cocked and ready to shoot for some time with little effort, allowing crossbowmen to aim better and to &quot;cover&quot; a target area, while archers could not keep their powerful bows pulled for long periods of time.

Due to the long time required to reload a crossbow, users would sometimes make use of a [[pavise]].

[[Pope Urban II]] banned the use of crossbow against Christians in [[1097]], and the [[Second Lateran Council]] did the same for [[arbalest]]s in [[1139]]. The crossbow was seen as unchivalrous and as a threat to social order, since a peasant could kill a noble anonymously; crossbow mercenaries were usually killed immediately on capture, unlike others who might have been ransomed or set free. However, their effectiveness made them an &quot;evil&quot; no one could afford to be without, often in the form of hired foreign mercenaries.
Given the great accuracy of the crossbow, it filled many duties that [[Sniper rifle|sniper rifles]] have today.

Crossbows were eventually replaced in warfare by [[gunpowder]] weapons. Early guns had slower rates of fire and much worse accuracy than contemporary crossbows.

Modern crossbows are still used for target shooting and in some places for [[hunting]], although for the latter a person generally has to have a disability or special license to use one.  They are made of the same composite materials as modern bows.

One of the newest developments in crossbow technology is the use of the shoulder-cock. The shoulder-cock is extremely easy to use and has a fast loading time. Using a shoulder-cock, a good crossbowman could reload in under 7 seconds. The average draw force for the shoulder-cock crossbow is 100 lbf (400 N), which is low compared to other crossbows. A good example of a shoulder-cock crossbow is the FX-II crossbow.

'''Carbamazepine''' (sold under the brand-names '''Biston'''®, '''Calepsin'''®, '''Carbatrol'''®, '''Epitol'''®, '''Equetro'''®, '''Finlepsin'''®, '''Sirtal'''®, '''Stazepine'''®, '''Tegretol'''®, '''Telesmin'''®, '''Timonil'''®) is an [[anticonvulsant]] and [[mood stabilizer|mood stabilizing]] drug, used primarily in the treatment of [[epilepsy]] and [[bipolar disorder]]. It is also used to treat [[schizophrenia]] and [[trigeminal neuralgia]].  

== Mechanisms ==
Carbamazepine and its derivatives' action mechanism is not well understood, but appears to be primarily through the [[Inhibitor|inhibition]] of [[sodium channel]] activity.

== Side-effects ==
Carbamazepine renders [[Oral contraceptive|birth control pills]] ineffective.

Common side-effects include drowsiness, motor-coordination impairment and/or upset stomach. Taken every twelve hours, the Tegretol XR® or Carbatrol® preparations can greatly increase tolerability.

Less common side-effects include blurry or double [[Visual perception|vision]] and/or the temporary or mild loss of [[blood cell]]s or [[platelet]]s. In rare cases the latter can be life-threatening if unnoticed, so frequent blood tests are required during the first few months' use, followed by three or four tests per year. There are also reports of a bizarre auditory side-effect, whereby patients perceive musical notes about a [[semitone]] lower than their actual pitch (so [[middle C]] would be heard as the note [[Scientific pitch notation|B3]] just below it, etc).

[[Oxcarbazepine]], a derivative of carbamazepine, has fewer and less serious side-effects.

== History ==
Carbamazepine was discovered by chemist Walter Schindler at J.R. Geigy AG (now part of [[Novartis]]) in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], in 1953. Schindler then synthesized the drug in 1960, before its anti-epileptic properties had been discovered.

Carbamazepine was first marketed as a drug to treat [[trigeminal neuralgia]] in 1962. It has been used as an anticonvulsant in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] since 1965, but only approved in the [[United States|U.S.]] since 1974.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Chalcedonian Creed''' was adopted at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in [[451]] in [[Asia Minor]]. That Council of Chalcedon is one of the seven [[ecumenical council]]s accepted by Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, and many Protestant Christian churches.  It is the first Council ''not'' recognized by any of the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] churches.

The '''Chalcedonian Creed''' was written amid controversy between the western and eastern churches over the meaning of the [[incarnation]] (see [[Christology]]), the ecclesiastical influence of the [[Byzantine emperor|emperor]], and the supremacy of the [[Pope|Roman Pope]]. The western churches readily accepted the creed, but some eastern churches did not. 

The creed became standard orthodox doctrine, while the [[Coptic Church|church of Alexandria]] dissented, holding to [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]]'s formula of the oneness of Christ’s nature as the incarnation of God the Word. This church felt that this understanding required that the creed should have stated that Christ be acknowledged &quot;'''from''' two natures&quot; rather than &quot;'''in''' two natures.&quot; This [[Miaphysitism|miaphysite]] position, often ''erroneously'' known as &quot;[[Monophysitism]]&quot;, formed the basis for the distinction from other churches of the [[Coptic church]] of Egypt and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopia]] and the &quot;[[Jacobite Orthodox Church|Jacobite]]&quot; churches of [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syria]] and [[Armenian Orthodox Church|Armenia]] (see [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]). Over the last 30 years, however, the miaphysite position has been accepted as a '''mere restatement''' of orthodox belief by [[Ecumenical patriarch|Patriarch Bartholemew]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and by [[Pope]] [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

      <comment>/* Exact laws */ no conservation of information (see Talk)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[physics]], a '''conservation law''' states that a particular measurable property of an isolated physical system does not change as the system evolves. 

== Exact laws ==

The following is a partial listing of conservation laws that have never been shown to be inexact.

* [[Conservation of energy]]
* [[Momentum#Conservation_of_momentum|Conservation of linear momentum]]
* [[Angular_momentum#Conservation_of_angular_momentum|Conservation of angular momentum]]
* [[Electric_charge#Conservation_of_charge|Conservation of electric charge]]
* conservation of [[color charge]]
* [[Conservation of probability]]

== Approximate conservation laws ==

There are also approximate conservation laws.  These are approximately true in particular situations, such as low speeds, short time scales, or certain interactions.  

* [[Conservation of mass]]
* Conservation of [[baryon number]] (See [[chiral anomaly]])
* Conservation of [[flavor (particle physics)|flavor]] (violated by the [[weak interaction]])
* Conservation of [[parity (physics)|parity]]
* [[CP symmetry]]

== Philosophy of conservation laws ==

[[Noether's theorem]] expresses the equivalence which exists between conservation laws and the [[invariance]] of physical laws with respect to certain transformations (typically called &quot;[[symmetry|symmetries]]&quot;) for systems which obey the [[Principle of least action]] and hence having a [[Lagrangian]] and a Hamiltonian (See [[Classical mechanics]], [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] for details). For instance, [[time invariance]] implies that energy is conserved, [[translation invariance]] implies that momentum is conserved, and [[rotation invariance]] implies that angular momentum is conserved.

*''Things that remain unchanged, in the midst of change''
The idea that some things remain unchanging throughout the evolution of the universe has been motivating philosophers and scientists alike for a long time. 

In fact, quantities that are conserved, the ''[[invariant (physics)|invariants]]'', seem to preserve what some would like to call some kind of a 'physical reality' and seem to have a more meaningful existence than many other physical quantities. These laws bring a great deal of simplicity into the structure of a physical theory. They are the ultimate basis for most solutions of the equations of [[physics]].

'''''Car Talk''''' is a [[radio]] [[talk show]] broadcast weekly on [[National Public Radio]] stations throughout the [[United States]] and elsewhere. Its subjects are cars and car repair, and it often takes humorous turns.

As a call-in radio show, listeners call in with [[automobile|car]]-related questions. The majority of callers are seeking advice of a diagnostic nature. The hosts, [[Tom Magliozzi|Tom]] and [[Ray Magliozzi]] (aka Click and Clack, the [[Tappet]] Brothers) listen to the caller describe the symptoms of his or her malfunctioning car, often asking them to replicate strange sounds, then attempt to identify the cause of the malfunction. While the hosts pepper their call-in sessions with jokes directed at both the caller and at themselves, their knowledge of automobiles is extensive and they are usually able to arrive at a diagnosis and give helpful advice.

Car Talk was first broadcast in Boston in 1977. It was picked up nationally by NPR ten years later.

Car Talk's [[theme song]] is &quot;Dawggy Mountain Breakdown&quot; by [[David Grisman]].

==Features==
A recurring feature is &quot;Stump the Chumps&quot;, in which Tom and Ray revisit a caller from a previous show and find out what effect, if any, their advice has had (assuming the caller followed it at all).

A similar feature was started in May 2001 and entitled &quot;Where Are They Now, Tommy?&quot; Like &quot;Stump the Chumps&quot;, they revisited a previous caller; but the difference with &quot;Where Are They Now...?&quot; was best described by Tom as &quot;an excuse to talk to some of the previous wack jobs we've had on the show&quot;. The feature was short-lived, lasting only a few months. Some hold that this was because they had run out of callers from Alaska to harass.

Celebrities have been callers as well. Examples include [[Morley Safer]], [[Ashley Judd]], [[Gordon Elliott]], and at least one [[space shuttle]] [[astronaut]]. There have been numerous appearances from NPR personalities, including [[Bob Edwards]], [[Susan Stamberg]], [[Scott Simon]], [[Ray Suarez]], [[Will Shortz]], and commentator/author [[Daniel Pinkwater]]. On one occasion, the show featured an in-studio guest: [[Martha Stewart]], whom Click and Clack called &quot;Margaret&quot; twice.

== Hosts ==
''Car Talk''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s hosts are brothers [[Ray Magliozzi|Ray]] and [[Tom Magliozzi]] (aka, &quot;Click and Clack, The Tappet Brothers&quot;), two long-time [[car mechanic]]s.  Ray Magliozzi has a degree in general science from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], while Tom has an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering from MIT, an MBA, and a Ph.D. in management from Boston University.

The duo, usually led by Tom, are known for long rants on the evils of the [[internal combustion engine]], the state of [[Montana]], people who talk on [[cell phones]] while driving, women named Donna (who always seem to drive [[Camaro]]s), the use (or misuse) of the [[English language]], and just about anything else, including themselves. They have a laid-back humorous approach to cars, car repair, [[cup holder]] competition amongst car makers, cats, dogs, lawyers, car mechanics, mini-vans, [[SUV]]s, and most everything else. They often cast a critical insider's eye (jaundiced, mostly) towards the auto industry. Tom and Ray are generally committed to the values of defensive driving and environmentalism. In the late [[1990s]] they pioneered an effort to rid the world of [[French language|French]] pronunciations of words, intentionally pronouncing many words phonetically such as &quot;[[Chevrolet|Chev-ro-lette]].&quot;

Click and Clack operate the &quot;Good News Garage&quot; in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] just a few blocks north of the MIT campus.  Their offices are located nearby at the corner of JFK St. and Brattle St. in [[Harvard Square]], marked as &quot;Dewey, Cheetham and Howe&quot;, the law firm they reference on-air.

The two were commencement speakers at MIT in 1999.

==Humor and other quirks==

The show is divided into &quot;three halves.&quot; The show opens with a comedic monologue, followed by eight call-in sessions.  During the winter shows, a contest called the &quot;Puzzler&quot; takes place, in which a puzzle (sometimes car-related, often not) is presented. The answer to the previous week's Puzzler is given during the second half of the show, and a new puzzler is given during the third half.

The humor of ''Car Talk'' also extends into the end credits.  The show is produced under the Magliozzis' corporate banner, [[Dewey, Cheetham, and Howe]], a common lawyer joke.  After listing (and lampooning) the actual staff of ''Car Talk'' (includi[iodine]]. Another measure is to cover the nose, mouth and eyes with a piece of cloth and sunglasses to protect against [[alpha particle]]s, which are only an internal hazard.

=== Response ===

Response consists first of warning civilians so they can enter [[blast shelter]]s and protect assets.   

Staffing a response is always problematic in a civil defense emergency.  After an attack, conventional full-time emergency services are dramatically overloaded, with conventional fire fighting response times often exceeding several days.  Some capability is maintained by local and state agencies, and an emergency reserve is provided by specialized [[military]] units, especially [[civil affairs]], [[Military Police]], [[Judge Advocate]]s and [[combat engineer]]s.  

However, the traditional response to massed attack on civilian population centers is to maintain a mass-trained force of volunteer emergency workers.  Studies in [[World War II]] showed that lightly trained (40 hours or less) civilians in organized teams can perform up to 95% of emergency activities when trained, liaised and supported by local government.  In this plan, the populace rescues itself from most situations, and provides information to a central office to prioritize professional emergency services.

In the 1990s, this concept was revived by the [[Los Angeles Fire Department]] to cope with civil emergencies such as [[earthquake]]s.  The program was widely adopted, providing standard terms for organization.  In the U.S., this is now official federal policy, and it is implemented by [[community emergency response team]]s, under the Department of Homeland Security, which certifies training programs by local governments, and registers &quot;certified disaster service workers&quot; who complete such training.

=== Recovery ===

Recovery consists of rebuilding damaged infrastructure, buildings and production.  The recovery phase is the longest and ultimately most expensive phase.  Once the immediate &quot;crisis&quot; has passed, cooperation fades away and recovery efforts are often politicized or seen as economic opportunities.

Preparation for recovery can be very helpful.  If mitigating resources are dispersed before the attack, cascades of social failures can be prevented.  One hedge against bridge damage in riverine cities is to subsidize a &quot;tourist ferry&quot; that performs scenic cruises on the river.  When a bridge is down, the ferry takes up the load.

== Implementation ==

Some advocates believe that government should change building codes to require [[autonomous building]]s in order to reduce civil societies' dependence on complex, fragile networks of social services.

An example of a crucial need after a general nuclear attack would be transport fuel to transport every other item for recovery.  However, [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] are large, immobile, and probable targets.  One proposal is to preposition truck-mounted fuel refineries near oil fields and bulk storage depots.  Other critical infrastructure needs would include road and bridge repair, [[L_System|communications]], electric power, food production and potable water.

== History ==

In the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], as well as the [[Soviet Bloc]], during the [[1950s]] and [[1960s|60s]], many civil defence practices took place to prepare for the aftermath of a [[nuclear war]], which seemed quite likely at that time. However, there was never strong civil defense policy because it fundamentally violates the [[Mutually Assured Destruction]] doctrine by making provisions for survivors. In the M.A.D. doctrine, there are not supposed to be any survivors for a civil defense system to assist (thus the acronym). However M.A.D. was not official government policy, and successive governments in the west sought to implement civil defence measures in the face of popular apathy.

During the [[Cold War]], civil defense was seen largely as defending against and 
recovering from an attack involving [[nuclear weapons]].  After the end of the [[Cold War]], the focus moved from defense against nuclear war to defense against a terrorist attack possibly involving [[chemical weapon|chemical]] or [[biological weapon]]s.  After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the concept of civil defense has been revisited under the umbrella term of [[homeland security]]. The old US Civil Defence logo was used in the [[FEMA]] logo until recently and is hinted at in the United States [[Civil Air Patrol]] logo.

      <comment>/* Activation of chymotrypsin */  linked polypeptide to peptide</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Chymotrypsin-1AB9.png|thumb|Chymotrypsin]]
'''Chymotrypsin''' (bovine &amp;gamma; chymotrypsin: {{PDB|1AB9}}, {{EC number|3.4.21.1}}) is a digestive enzyme that can perform [[proteolysis]].

==Activation of chymotrypsin==
Chymotrypsin is synthesized by [[protein biosynthesis]] as a [[precursor]] called [[chymotrypsinogen]] that is enzymatically inactive. On cleavage by [[trypsin]] into two parts that are still connected via an S-S bond, cleaved chymotrypsinogen molecules can activate each other by removing two small peptides in a ''trans''-proteolysis. The resulting molecule is active chymotrypsin, a three [[peptide|polypeptide]] molecule interconnected via disulfide bonds.

==Action and Kinetics of chymotrypsin==
In vivo, chymotrypsin is a proteolytic enzyme acting in the digestive systems of mammals and other organisms. It facilitates the cleavage of peptide bonds by a hydrolysis reaction, a process which albeit thermodynamically favourable, occurs extremely slowly in the absence of a catalyst. The main substrates of chymotrypsin include tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and methionine, which are cleaved at the carboxyl terminal. Like many proteases, chymotrypsin will also hydrolyse ester bonds in vitro, a virtue that enabled the use of substrate analogs such as N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine p-nitrophenyl ester for enzyme assays.

Chymotrypsin cleaves peptide bonds by attacking the unreactive carbonyl group with a powerful nucleophile, the serine 195 residue located in the active site of the enzyme, which briefly becomes covalently bonded to the substrate, forming an enzyme-substrate intermediate. 

These findings rely on inhibition assays and the study of the kinetics of cleavage of the aforementioned substrate, exploiting the fact that the enzyme-substrate intermediate p-nitrophenolate has a yellow colour, enabling us to measure its concentration by measuring light absorbance at A400. 

It was found that the reaction of chymotrypsin with its substrate takes place in two stages, an initial “burst” phase at the beginning of the reaction and a steady-state phase following Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The mode of action of chymotrypsin explains this as hydrolysis takes place in two steps. First acylation of the substrate to form an acyl-enzyme intermediate and then deacylation in order to return the enyzme to its original state.

      <comment>/* CERT TEAMS */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In the [[United States]] a '''community emergency response team''' ('''CERT''') is a group of [[volunteer]] [[emergency worker]]s.  They are usually neighbors.  Under good doctrine, they receive professional mass training and become official auxiliaries to local government [[emergency service]]s in times of [[state of emergency|emergency]].

The theory behind CERT is based on a simple observation: in major emergencies, professional emergency services overload instantly.  Every area in the world has earthquakes and tornadoes, and the most common disasters are floods and severe storms.  Common mass emergencies include [[flood]], [[hurricane]], [[tsunami]] or [[earthquake]].  These can all create mass emergencies, and thus CERTs have a mission everywhere.

For example, in a city with 100,000 people, usually only five fire stations and two police stations are staffed, with perhaps forty [[firefighter]]s, ten fire trucks and thirty [[police]] on duty.  This is adequate for normal emergencies, rescues and crimes.  In normal rescues, rescuers out number victims four to one, and can respond in minutes.  A typical rescue is completed in a half hour.

In the above community, if a mass emergency traps or injures just two percent of the inhabitants, there are instantly 2,000 victims, many with injuries.  The telephones will fail from overload.  Roads, bridges, electricity and other services may fail, hampering emergency services, and interfering with fuel and material supplies.

If only professionals respond to that mass emergency and there are 2000 victims, there will be 1000 hours of rescues, divided by ten trucks, or about 100 hours.  As many as three quarters of the victims could die while waiting for rescue.  After an hour and a half, untreated victims of [[shock]] would begin to die.  After one day, trapped children would begin to die of thirst.  After two days, trapped adults and shut-ins would begin to die of thirst.  Most of these deaths could be prevented by simple rescue and first-aid procedures.  This is a heartbreaking situation for all concerned.

In these environments CERTs are far more effective than untrained civilians.  With less than 40 hours of training, an volunteer emergency responder becomes qualified to perform about 95% of needed emergency services.  This means that 95% of the rescues and life-saving [[triage]] and [[first-aid]] procedures can be completed in the &quot;golden day,&quot; the first 24 hours when rescues and first-aid are most likely to succeed.

Physical fitness is not required for most CERT training or emergency activities.  CERT members are instead trained to avoid hazards, and assign strenuous tasks to younger or fit members of the team. 

In a major emergency, the community needs mass emergency services.  Although amateurs are not able to work as skillfully as professionals, they are immensely better than nothing.

==CERT organization==
A [[local government]], usually a city, attempts to recruit a CERT in each neighborhood. Most governments with CERTs maintain a full-time community-service person as liaison to the volunteers who form the rest of the organization.

CERTs provide their own personnel, supplies, tools, organization and equipment, but they are activated by, trained by, promoted by and liaise with the government.  They are temporary volunteer government workers, usually organized as auxiliaries to the fire department.  In some areas, (such as [[California]]) during declared disasters, registered, activated CERT members are eligible for worker's compensation for on-the-job injuries.

The Federal Emergency Managment Agency (FEMA) reccomends that the standard, ten-person team be comprised as follows:
* Team Leader. (1 person) 
* Fire Suppression Team (2 people) 
* Search and Rescue Team (2 people) 
* Medical Triage Team (2 people) 
* Medical Treatment Team (2 people)
 
The city directly liaises with the neighborhood CERT team leader through the CERT's organic communication team.  In wealthy areas the communications may be by amateur radio, or dedicated telephone or fire-alarm networks.  In poor areas, relays of bicycle-equipped runners can effectively carry mail between the teams and the city's emergency operations center.

==CERT Team Member Roles ==
* '''CERT Team Leader.''' If there is only one CERT team on-scene, is also the Incident Commander until the arrival of competent authority. Makes initial assessment of the scene and determines appropriate course of action for team members; checks team members prior to deployment to ensure they are safe and equipped for the operation; determines safe or unsafe working environment; assigns team member roles if not already assigned; designates triage area, treatment area, morgue, and vehicle traffic routes; coordinates and directs team operations; determines logistical needs (water, food, medical supplies, transportation, equipment, etc.) and determines ways to meet those needs through team members or citizen volunteers on the scene; collects and writes reports on the operation and victims; ensures team accountability; communicates and coordinates with the Incident Commander. 

* '''Fire Suppression Team (2).''' Work under the supervision of the Team Leader to suppress small fires in designated work areas or as needed; when not accomplishing their primary mission, assist the search and rescue team or triage team; assist in evacuation and transport as needed; assist in the triage or treatment area as needed, other duties as assigned; communicate with Team Leader. 

* '''Search and Rescue Team (2).''' Work under the supervision of the Team Leader, searching for and providing rescue of victims as is prudent under the conditions; when not accomplishing their primary mission, assist the Fire Suppression Team, assist in the triage or treatment area as needed; other duties as assigned; communicate with Team Leader. 

* '''Medical Triage Team (2).''' Work under the supervision of the Team Leader, providing START triage for victims found at the scene; marking victims with category of injury per the standard operating procedures; when not accomplishing their primary mission, assist the Fire Suppression Team if needed, assist the Search and Rescue Team if needed, assist in the Medical Triage Area if needed, assist in the Treatment Area if needed, other duties as assigned; communicate with Team Leader. 

* '''Medical Treatment Team (2).''' Work under the supervision of the Team Leader, providing medical treatment to victims within the scope of their training. This task is normally accomplished in the Treatment Area, however, it may take place in the affected area as well. When not accomplishing their primary mission, assist the Fire Suppression Team as needed, assist the Medical Triage Team as needed; other duties as assigned; communicate with the Team Leader. 

In the short term, CERTs perform data gathering, especially to locate mass-casualties requiring professional response, or situations requiring professional rescues, simple fire-fighting tasks (e.g. small fires, turning off gas), light search and rescue, damage evaluation of structures, [[triage]] and [[first aid]].  In the longer term, CERTs may assist in evacuation residents, or assist with setting up a neighborhood shelter.

==The Community Emergency Response==

===Step 1: Self Rescue===

Each individual reaches into their grab-and-go bag, gets a flashlight, and puts on their shoes.  It's very tempting to check the family first, but glass on the floor can instantly create a casualty if one is bare-foot.

To prevent their injury, children should be trained to wait for a parent unless they see fire or feel heat.  The family should establish an outside meeting place, and evacuation methods from every room.

California's experience with earthquakes suggests that every family member should have a &quot;grab and go&quot; bag, attached to their bed.  It has to be attached to the bed, because in earthquakes (and perhaps other emergencies), bags in closets or under beds were lost when furniture moved and structures failed.  

The bag has to include shoes and a flashlight.  The most common injury in surprise emergencies is a foot injury, when people try to run on broken glass.  The most common problem is a power or lighting failure, and a flashlight is an immense help to self-rescue at night.  

Many people pack an entire personal emergency kit in the grab and go bag, but a shopping bag with shoes and a flashlight is enough to start.

===Step 2: Family Rescue===

Turn off gas only if you suspect a leak (the dials on the meter may be turning rapidly or you may smell the telltale odor of gas). Only your utility company can turn the gas back on once it has been turned off. If you suspect a gas leak, turn off the electricity also to prevent a fire or explosion. Then rescue other family members.  Do not re-enter a burning building.

FEMA advises that families prepare a kit of essential items that they will need to survive for up to 72 hours after an emergency or disaster. The following items are recommended for you kit: 

* Water, one gallon of water per person per day, for drinking and sanitation
* Food, at least a three-day supply of non-perishable food
* Battery-powered radio and a NOAA Weather Radio with tone alert, and extra batteries for      both
* Flashlight and extra batteries
* First Aid kit
* Whistle to signal for help
* Dust mask or cotton t-shirt, to help filter the air
* Moist towelettes for sanitation
* Wrench or pliers to turn off utilities
* Can opener for food (if kit contains canned food)
* Plastic sheeting and duct tape to shelter-in-place
* Unique family needs, such as daily prescription medications, infant formula or diapers, and important family documents
* Garbage bags and plastic ties for personal sanitation
* Emergency reference material such as a first aid book or a print out of this information
* Rain gear
* Mess kits, paper cups, plates and plastic utensils
* Cash or traveler's checks, change
* Paper towels
* Fire Extinguisher
* Tent
* Compass
* Matches in a waterproof container
* Signal flare
* Paper, pencil
* Medicine dropper
* Feminine supplies
* Personal hygiene items
* Disinfectant
* Household chlorine bleach

You should learn where to turn off your home's gas, electric and water service.  If this requires tools, attach them to the service box, or place them in your kit.

[http://www.ready.gov ready.gov] recommends medical supplies for a family, as well as suggestions for storing food.

===Step 3: Neighborhood rescue===

After self-rescue, the neighborhood goes to their team's neighborhood &quot;command post,&quot; established at earlier meetings.  The object is to centralize and prioritize resources.  This one step is the single most powerful act of a CERT.  The CERT command post is always marked by a flag, sign or tabard to help people locate it.

The neighborhood is usually informed about the command post at a neighborhood block party or picnic.

If the teams lack trained staff (likely, as most people are likely to be unorganized volunteers), the leader rips out sections of the notebook acquired during his training, and the teams self-train on-the-spot.  The notebooks include check-lists and procedures.  Literacy is both assumed and essential.

The leader (selected at an earlier meeting) assigns street teams to systematically assess every building in the neighborhood and report back.  Meanwhile, the neighborhood leader assigns people to specialist teams.  Generally, a trained and untrained person, or a fit and unfit person are paired.

When the leader takes charge and a communications person is present, the team reports that it started-up to the city's emergency operations center.  

In a good team, various families have agreed to loan supplies, tools and equipment to the team in an emergency. They bring these to the logistic team, who issues them.  Logistics people also canvass new people for needed tools, food, water, tents, paper, field commodes and other needs listed by the planners.

When the street and block assesments come back, the planners try to track current problems and anticipate future needs so the leader can assign teams well.  Usually the critical planning aid is a couple of greaseboards (which work in rain).  

The assessments include details like addresses of: destroyed buildings, unrescued persons, and hazards, as well as people who need immediate professional care or professional rescues.

===Step 4. Coordination with Regional Authorities===

The CERT team's communicators send a digested summary of damage and critical injuries to the city's (or regional) emergency operations center.  The 5% of rescues that require professional training and equipment are also reported in the summary.  The reports include exact addresses, and damage assesments.

Soon, the CERT begins light rescues, and brings injured people to the first-aid station. Planners track the injuries, especially [[triage]]d injuries requiring immediate professional care.  The communicators inform the city when local rescues are complete, and give an updated summary of severe injuries and damaged buildings. 

At some point, a fire or police team may appear at the command post.  The planners and leader can brief them from the summaries.  This saves professional responders huge amounts of time, and directs them to important problems.

Eventually, the city's emergency operations center tells the CERT where the injured people who need immediate care can be taken.  Note that the regional center can coordinate to balance loading of local hospitals.  The logistics people recruit vehicles, the leader assigns drivers and first-aid people, and the severe injuries are evacuated.  Later, less immediate injuries will be evacuated.

===Step 5.  Local sheltering===

Throughout, the CERT's shelter workers register people and children so family members can find them, and feed and house people and (if possible) pets (in tents, eventually).  As time passes, the communicator passes lists of registrees as desgnated by the emergency operations center.  In most situations, Red Cross or Red Crescent helps family members locate each other.

The CERT team should prepare the shelter area in advance, getting permission to locate an emergency tent city on a school grounds, park, parking lot or other open space.  If most families have tents, a small managed tof democratic states were accompanied by a sudden and dramatic decline in total warfare, interstate wars, [[ethnic]] wars, [[revolutionary]] wars, and the number of [[refugees]] and [[displaced person]]s [http://members.aol.com/CSPmgm/conflict.htm].

==Post war==
Rebuilding a society in the wake of a civil war is often difficult. In an international war the two parties merely have to agree to a cease-fire and can, for the most part, go their own way. In a civil war not only must violence stop but the factions involved must also learn to coexist with each other. This can often prove difficult, much of the population will have lost friends or loved ones in the war, losses they blame on their opponents. Civil wars also tend to greatly entrench any ethnic, religious, or ideological divisions within a society and restoring unity can be very difficult. The record of [[United Nations]] [[peacekeeping]] forces in healing such war-torn societies is mixed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Chocolate.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Chocolate most commonly comes in dark, milk, and white varieties, with cocoa solids contributing to the brown coloration.]]
'''Chocolate''' (see below for etymology) describes a number of raw and processed foods that originate from the tropical [[cacao]] tree.  It is a common ingredient in many kinds of [[sweet]]s, [[Chocolate confectionery|chocolate candy]], 
[[ice cream]]s, [[cookie]]s, [[cake]]s, [[pie]]s, and desserts. It is one of the most popular flavours in the [[world]].

Chocolate is made from the fermented, roasted, and ground beans taken from the pod of the tropical cacao tree ''[[Theobroma cacao]]'' native to [[Central America]], which has an intensely flavoured [[Bitter (taste)|bitter]] taste. The resulting products are known as &quot;chocolate&quot; or, in some parts of the world, [[cocoa]].

The bean products are known under different names in different parts of the world. In the [[North America|America]]n chocolate industry:
*[[Cocoa]] is the solids of the cacao bean, 
*[[Cocoa butter]] is the [[fat]] component, and 
*Chocolate is a combination of the solids and the fat.

It is the solid and the fat combination, sweetened with [[sugar]] and other ingredients, that is made into chocolate bars and which is commonly referred to as ''chocolate'' by the public. 

It can also be made into [[beverage]]s (called ''cocoa'' and ''[[hot chocolate]]''), and this was the original form used by the Aztecs, the Mayas, and the first European consumers.

Chocolate is often produced as small moulded forms in the shape of [[animal]]s, people, or inanimate objects to celebrate festivals worldwide. For example, moulds of [[rabbits]] or [[Eggs (food)|eggs]] for [[Easter]], coins or [[Saint Nicholas]] (Santa Claus) for [[Christmas]], and hearts for [[Valentine's Day]]. 

==Types==
===Classification===
[[Image:Bowl of truffles.jpg|300px|thumb|Chocolate truffles typically have a thin shell of chocolate with a soft centre.]]
Chocolate is an extremely popular ingredient, and it is available in many types. Different forms and flavours of chocolate are produced by varying the quantities of the different ingredients. Other flavours can be obtained by varying the time and temperature when roasting the beans.

*'''Unsweetened chocolate''' is pure [[chocolate liquor]], also known as bitter or baking chocolate. It is unadulterated chocolate: the pure, ground roasted chocolate beans impart a strong, deep chocolate flavour. With the addition of sugar, however, it is used as the base for cakes, brownies, confections, and cookies.
*'''Dark chocolate''' is chocolate without milk as an additive.  It is sometimes called &quot;plain chocolate&quot;. The U.S. Government calls this &quot;sweet chocolate&quot;, and requires a 15% concentration of chocolate liquor.  European rules specify a minimum of 35% cocoa solids.
*'''Milk chocolate''' is chocolate with milk powder or condensed milk added. The [[United States|U.S.]] Government requires a 10% concentration of chocolate liquor.  [[European Union|EU]] regulations specify a minimum of 25% cocoa solids.
*'''Semisweet chocolate''' is often used for cooking purposes.  It is a dark chocolate with high sugar content.
*'''Bittersweet chocolate''' is chocolate liquor (or unsweetened chocolate) to which sugar, more cocoa butter, [[lecithin]], and vanilla has been added. It has less sugar and more liquor than semisweet chocolate, but the two are interchangeable in baking. The best quality bittersweet and semisweet chocolates are produced as couverture; many brands now print on the package the percentage of cocoa (as chocolate liquor and added cocoa butter) contained. The rule is that the higher the percentage of cocoa, the less sweet the chocolate will be. 
*'''Couverture''' is a term used for chocolates rich in cocoa butter. Popular brands of couverture used by professional pastry chefs and often sold in gourmet and specialty food stores include: [[Valrhona]], Felchlin, [[Lindt &amp; Sprüngli]], Cacao Barry, Callebaut, and [[Guittard]]. These chocolates contain a high percentage of cocoa (sometimes 70% or more) and have a total fat content of 36-40%. 
*'''[[White chocolate]]''' is a confection based on [[cocoa butter]] without the cocoa solids.
*'''Cocoa powder.''' There are two types of unsweetened baking cocoa available: natural cocoa (like the sort produced by Hershey's and Nestlé) and Dutch-process cocoa (such as the Hershey's European Style Cocoa and the Droste brand). Both are made by pulverising partially defatted chocolate liquor and removing nearly all the cocoa butter. Natural cocoa is light in colour and somewhat acidic with a strong chocolate flavour. Natural cocoa is commonly used in recipes which call for baking soda. Because baking soda is an alkali, combining it with natural cocoa creates a leavening action that allows the batter to rise during baking. Dutch-process cocoa is processed with alkali to neutralise its natural acidity. Dutch cocoa is slightly milder in taste, with a deeper and warmer colour than natural cocoa.  Dutch-process cocoa is frequently used for chocolate drinks such as hot chocolate due to its ease in blending with liquids. Unfortunately, Dutch processing destroys most of the flavanols present in cocoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lowfatcooking.about.com/od/healthandfitness/a/chochealth.htm | title=Chocolate as a Health Food? | accessdate=2006-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flavours such as [[mint]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]], or [[strawberry]] are sometimes added to chocolate. Chocolate bars frequently contain added ingredients such as [[peanut]]s, [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s, [[caramel]], or even crisped [[rice]].

===Definition===

Strictly speaking, chocolate is any product based 99% on cocoa solid and/or cocoa fat. Because it is used in a vast number of other foods, any change in the cost of making it has a huge impact on the industry. Adding ingredients is an aspect of the taste. On the other hand, reducing cocoa solid content, or substituting cocoa fat with a non-cocoa one, reduces the cost of making it. There has been disagreement in the EU about the definition of chocolate. 

* Some want to see the definition allowing for any cocoa solid content and any kind of fat in chocolate. This would allow a merely coloured and flavoured margarine to be sold as being chocolate. In some countries this happens, and a 50% to 70% cocoa solid dark-chocolate, with no additive, for domestic use, is hard to find and expensive.
* Others believe in adhering more strictly to the definition above.

==History==
===Etymology===
The name chocolate most likely comes from the [[Nahuatl language]] indigenous to central [[Mexico]], although it may have been influenced by the [[Mayan languages]]. One popular theory is that it comes from the Nahuatl word ''xocolatl'' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|/ɕɔ.kɔ.atɬ/}}), derived from ''xocolli'', bitter, and ''atl'', water. On the other hand, Mexican philologist Ignacio Davila Garibi proposed that &quot;Spaniards had coined the word by taking the Maya word ''chocol'' and then replacing the Maya term for water, ''haa'', with the Aztec one, ''atl''.&quot; But this theory assumes that the conquistadores would change indigenous words from two very different languages, while at the same time adopting hundreds of other words from these same languages as-is; a highly unlikely scenario.

In a recent article, linguists Karen Dakin and Søren Wichmann found that in many [[dialect]]s of Nahuatl, the name is 'chicolatl', rather than 'chocolatl'.  In addition, many languages in Mexico, such as Popoluca, Mixtec and Zapotec, and even languages spoken in the Philippines have borrowed this form of the word.  The word chicol-li refers to the beating sticks still used in some areas in cooking, and that are either a small straight stick with small strong twigs still on one end or a stiff plant stalk with the stubs of roots cleaned and trimmed. Since chocolate was originally served ceremonially with individual beater sticks, it seems quite likely that the original form of the word was 'chicolatl', which would have the etymology 'beater drink'. In many areas of Mexico, 'chicolear' means 'to beat, stir'.

===Origins===

The chocolate residue found in an [[Maya civilization|ancient Maya]] pot suggests that Maya were drinking chocolate 2,600 years ago, the earliest record of cacao use. The [[Aztecs]] associated chocolate with [[Xochiquetzal]], the goddess of fertility.  In the New World, chocolate was consumed in a bitter and spicy drink called ''xocoatl'', often seasoned with [[vanilla]], [[chile pepper]], [[achiote]] (which we know today as [[annatto]]) and [[pimento]].  Xocoatl was believed to fight fatigue, a belief that is probably attributable to the [[theobromine]] content.  Chocolate was an important luxury good throughout [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], and cocoa beans were often used as currency. Other chocolate drinks combined it with such edibles as [[maize]] gruel (which acts as an emulsifier) and [[honey]].

The xocolatl was said to be an acquired taste.  [[Jose de Acosta]], a Spanish [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary who lived in Peru and then Mexico in the later [[16th century]], wrote of it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Loathsome to such as are not acquainted with it, having a scum or froth that is very unpleasant to taste. Yet it is a drink very much esteemed among the Indians, where with they feast noble men who pass through their country. The Spaniards, both men and women, that are accustomed to the country, are very greedy of this Chocolaté. They say they make diverse sorts of it, some hot, some cold, and some temperate, and put therein much of that &quot;chili&quot;; yea, they make paste thereof, the which they say is good for the stomach and against the catarrh.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Christopher Columbus]] brought some cocoa beans to show Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, but it remained for [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] to introduce it to Europe more broadly.

The first recorded shipment of chocolate to the Old World for commercial purposes was in a shipment from [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]] to [[Seville]] in [[1585]]. It was still served as a beverage, but the Europeans added sugar and milk to counteract the natural bitterness and removed the chilli pepper, replacing it with another Mexican indigenous spice, vanilla. Improvements to the taste meant that by the [[17th century]] it was a luxury item among the European nobility.

At the end of the 18th century, the first form of solid chocolate was invented in [[Turin]] by [[Doret]]. This chocolate was sold in large quantities from [[1826]] by [[Pierre Paul Caffarel]]. In [[1819]] [[F. L. Cailler]] opened the first [[Switzerland|Swiss]] chocolate factory. In [[1828]] [[Netherlands|Dutchman]] [[Conrad J. van Houten]] patented a method for extracting the fat from cocoa beans and making powdered [[cocoa]] and [[cocoa butter]]. Van Houten also developed the so-called [[Dutch process chocolate|Dutch process]] of treating chocolate with [[alkali]] to remove the bitter taste. This made it possible to form the modern chocolate bar.  It is believed that the Englishman [[Joseph Fry]] made the first chocolate for eating in [[1847]], followed shortly after by the [[Cadbury-Schweppes|Cadbury]] brothers.

[[Daniel Peter]], a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] candle maker, joined his father-in-law's chocolate business. In [[1867]] he began experimenting with milk as an ingredient. He brought his new product, milk chocolate, to market in [[1875]]. He was assisted in removing the water content from the milk to prevent mildewing by a neighbour, a baby food manufacturer named [[Henri Nestlé]]. [[Rodolphe Lindt]] invented the process called ''conching'', which involves heating and grinding the chocolate solids very finely to ensure that the liquid is evenly blended.

==Physiological effects==

===Toxicity in animals===
{{main|theobromine poisoning}}
In sufficient amounts the [[theobromine]] found in chocolate is [[toxic]] to animals such as [[horse]]s, [[dog]]s, [[parrot]]s, [[vole]]s, and [[cat]]s ([[kitten]]s especially) because they are unable to [[metabolize|metabolise]] the chemical effectively.  If they are fed chocolate, the theobromine will remain in their [[bloodstream]] for up to 20 hours, and these animals may experience [[epileptic seizure]]s, [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], [[internal bleeding]], and eventually [[death]].  Medical treatment involves inducing [[vomiting]] within two hours of ingestion, or contacting a [[veterinarian]].

A typical 20-kilogram dog will normally experience intestinal distress after eating less than 240 grams of milk chocolate, but will not necessarily experience [[bradycardia]] or [[tachycardia]] un-series P-40N-40 had V-1710-115, 1,360 hp (1,015 kW)

* [[Clive Caldwell|Clive &quot;Killer&quot; Caldwell]], Australia's greatest WW2 ace. (Caldwell scored most of his 28.5 kills while flying Tomahawks in North Africa.)  
* [[John Gorton]], [[Prime Minister of Australia]], 1968-71. (He survived two serious crashes. One required Gorton to undergo extensive [[plastic surgery]], and his face changed significantly as a result. When asked in later life what his most memorable flight had been, Gorton replied: &quot;The one in which I got my face mixed up with the instrument panel of a Kittyhawk.&quot;)
* [[James Morehead]], earned the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguised Service Cross]] and the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] after leading the first succeful aerial attack against Japanese fighters during WW2.
* [[Robert Lee Scott, Jr.]] commander of the 23rd Fighter Group of the [[Fourteenth Air Force]].
* [[Len Waters]], the only [[indigenous Australian|Australian Aboriginal]] fighter pilot of WW2.

== P-40s on film ==
*In the contemporary [[John Wayne]] movie ''[[Flying Tigers (movie)|Flying Tigers]]'', real P-40s are featured, along with some inaccurate studio models.
*In the 1945 film ''[[God is My Co-Pilot (film)|God is My Co-Pilot]]'' about the Flying Tigers and the USAAF pilots who replaced them in [[China]] and [[Burma]], real P-40s are featured.
*In ''[[Tora Tora Tora]]'', P-40s are depicted at the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], both being shot up on the ground, and shooting down Zeros.
*A P-40 is in the less-than-capable hands of a [[John Belushi]] character in the comedy ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]''.
*In the [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternative history]]/[[science fiction]] [[pastiche]] ''[[Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]]'' (2004), a [[computer graphics|computer-generated]] P-40 performs amazing feats, including doubling as a submarine, an ability which would have been appreciated by many WW2 fliers, had it been possible.
*In the film ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' P-40s are the main plane seen in the film besides the Japanese Zeros.  Rafe Macauley and Danny Walker fly these during the raid on Pearl Harbor being the only two pilots able to get in the air.  This also happened in the real [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], but the pilots were [[George Welch|George &quot;Wheaties&quot; Welch]] and [[Ken Taylor]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{OtherUses|a statement of belief}}

A '''creed''' is a statement of [[belief]] — usually [[religion|religious]] belief — or [[faith]].The word derives from the Latin ''[[credo]]'' for ''I believe''.

==Christian creeds==
Christianity, affirming that [[God]] has been begotten and manifest in the human being [[Jesus]], has formulated a number of statements of faith that seek to assert his [[doctrine]].  

In this sense, perhaps the earliest statement of Christian faith is the slogan affirming that ''[[Jesus]] is Lord'', which appears in St [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]'s [[Epistle to the Romans]] 10:9.  The meaning and importance of this slogan comes from its affirmation that Jesus Christ is the full revelation of the God [[Yahweh]] of [[Judaism]] made incarnate, a doctrine thought impossible and indeed [[blasphemous]] by the rest of the Jewish community.  

As Christianity wrestled with the implications of this statement, its developing [[theology]] required more complex formulations.  

=== Apostles' Creed ===
It is likely that the earliest creed of Christianity that deserves the title in full is the [[Apostles' Creed]].  [[Christian mythology]] attributes this creed to all [[Twelve Apostles|twelve Apostles]] as a joint composition, and assigns one phrase of the creed to each Apostle.  This attribution is unlikely, but the creed itself is quite old; it seems to have developed from a [[catechism]] used in the [[baptism]] of adults, and in that form can be traced as far back as the [[2nd century|second century]].  The Apostles' Creed seems to have been formulated to resist [[Docetism]] and similar ideas associated with [[Gnosticism]]; it emphasizes the birth, physical death, and bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ.  

The [[Nicene Creed]] clearly derives from the Apostles' Creed, and equally obviously represents an elaboration of its basic themes.  The most salient additions to this creed are much more elaborate statements concerning [[Christology]] and the [[Trinity]].  These reflect the concerns of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in [[325]] A. D., and have their chief purpose the rejection of [[Arianism]], which the church adjudged a [[heresy]].  In the [[Roman Catholic]] [[liturgy]] the Nicene Creed is repeated during each [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].

Christians today probably use the Nicene Creed most widely, followed by the Apostles Creed.

=== A creed as a catalogue of heresies ===
In an atmosphere of increasingly complicated theological controversy, orthodox belief might become more complicated in outline. In the decade before 594, [[Gregory of Tours|Gregory, bishop of Tours]] set out to write a ''Historia Francorum'' (&quot;History of the Franks&quot;). In Gaul, a part of Europe recently beset with both royal [[Arianism|Arians]] and royal pagans (until the conversion of [[Clovis]]), Gregory prefaced his history with a declaration of his faith, &quot;so that my reader may have no doubt that I am Catholic&quot; (Book I.i). The confession is in many phrases, each of which refutes a specific Christian heresy. Thus Gregory's creed presents, in negative, a virtual catalogue of heresies:
:&lt;!--phrases need to be linked to their respective Wikipedia entries--&gt;''I believe, then, in God the Father omnipotent. I believe in Jesus Christ his only Son, our Lord God, born of the Father, not created. [I believe] that he has always been with the Father, not only since time began but before all time. For the Father could not have been so named unless he had a son; and there could be no son without a father. But as for those who say: &quot;There was a time when he was not,&quot; [note: A leading belief of Arian Christology.] I reject them with curses, and call men to witness that they are separated from the church. I believe that the word of the Father by which all things were made was Christ. I believe that this word was made fresh and by its suffering the world was redeemed, and I believe that humanity, not deity, was subject to the suffering. I believe that he rose again on the third day, that he freed sinful man, that he ascended to heaven, that he sits on the right hand of the Father, that he will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe that the holy Spirit proceeded from the Father and the Son, that it is not inferior and is not of later origin, but is God, equal and always co­eternal with the Father and the Son, consubstantial in its nature, equal in omnipotence, equally eternal in its essence, and that it has never existed apart from the Father and the Son and is not inferior to the Father and the Son. I believe that this holy Trinity exists with separation of persons, and one person is that of the Father, another that the Son, another that of the Holy Spirit. And in this Trinity confess that there is one Deity, one power, one essence. I believe that the blessed Mary was a virgin after the birth as she was a virgin before. I believe that the soul is immortal but that nevertheless it has no part in deity. And I faithfully believe all things that were established at Nicæa by the three hundred and eighteen bishops. But as to the end of the world I hold beliefs which I learned from our forefathers, that Antichrist will come first. An Antichrist will first propose circumcision, asserting that he is Christ; next he will place his statue in the temple at Jerusalem to be worshipped, just as we read that the Lord said: &quot;You shall see the abomination of desolation standing in the holy place.&quot; But the Lord himself declared that that day is hidden from all men, saying; &quot;But of that day and that hour knoweth no one not even the anger in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father alone.&quot; Moreover we shall here make answer to the heretics [note: the Arians] who attack us, asserting that the Son is inferior to the Father since he is ignorant of this day. Let them learn then that Son here is the name applied to the Christian people, of whom God says: &quot;I shall be to them a father and they shall be to me for sons.&quot; For if he had spoken these words of the only­begotten Son he would never have given the angels first place. For he uses these words: &quot;Not even the angels in heaven nor the Son,&quot; showing that he spoke these words not of the only-begotten but of the people of adoption. But our end is Christ himself, who will graciously bestow eternal life on us if we turn to him.&quot;'' [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/gregory-hist.html#book3]

=== Other creeds ===
Other notable creeds include the:

* [[Athanasian Creed]]
* [[Chalcedonian Creed]]
* [[Social Creed (Methodist)]]
* The Masai Creed is a creed composed in about 1960 by Western Christian missionaries for the [[Masai]] people of East Africa. The missionaries were from the Congregation of the Holy Ghost. The creed attempts to express the essentials of the Christian faith within the Masai culture.

==Islamic creeds==
The most basic attempt to put the religion of [[Islam]] in a brief statement of doctrine is the [[shahada]], the proclamation that there is no [[god]] but [[Allah]], and [[Muhammad]] is His [[prophet]].   

More detailed credal declarations of Islamic [[dogma]] constitute [[aqidah]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''[[Aelianus Tacticus]], Greek military writer of the 2nd century CE, resident at Rome, is sometimes confused with Claudius Aelianus.''

'''Claudius Aelianus''' (c. [[175]] - c. [[235]]), often seen as just '''Aelian''', born at [[Praeneste]], was a Roman author and teacher of [[rhetoric]] who flourished under [[Septimius Severus]] and probably outlived [[Elagabalus]], who died in 222. He spoke [[Greek language|Greek]] so perfectly that he was called &quot;honey-tongued&quot; (''meliglossos''); Roman-born, he preferred Greek authors, and wrote in a slightly archaizing Greek himself.

His two chief works are valuable for the numerous quotations from the works of earlier authors, which are otherwise lost, and for the surprising lore, which offers unexpected glimpses into the Greco-Roman world-view. 

==''De Natura Animalium (&amp;Pi;&amp;epsilon;&amp;rho;&amp;iota; &amp;Zeta;&amp;omega;&amp;omega;&amp;nu; &amp;Iota;&amp;delta;&amp;iota;&amp;omicron;&amp;tau;&amp;eta;&amp;tau;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf;)''==
''On the Nature of Animals,'' (&quot;On the Characteristics of Animals&quot; is an alternative title; usually cited, though, by its Latin title), is a curious collection, in 17&amp;nbsp;books, of brief stories of natural history, sometimes selected with an eye to conveying allegorical moral lessons, sometimes because they are just so astonishing:
:&quot;The Beaver is an amphibious creature: by day it lives hidden in rivers, but at night it roams the land, feeding itself with anything that it can find. Now it understands the reason why hunters come after it with such eagerness and impetuosity, and it puts down its head and with its teeth cuts off its testicles and throws them in their path, as a prudent man who, falling into the hands of robbers, sacrifices all that he is carrying, to save his life, and forfeits his possessions by way of ransom. If however it has already saved its life by self-castration and is again pursued, then it stands up and reveals that it offers no ground for their eager pursuit, and releases the hunters from all further exertions, for they esteem its flesh less. Often however Beavers with testicles intact, after escaping as far away as possible, have drawn in the coveted part, and with great skill and ingenuity tricked their pursuers, pretending that they no longer possessed what they were keeping in concealment.&quot;

The [[Loeb Classical Library]] introduction characterizes the book as
:&quot;an appealing collection of facts and fables about the animal kingdom that invites the reader to ponder contrasts between human and animal behavior.&quot;

Aelian's anecdotes on animals rarely depend on direct observation: they are almost entirely taken from written sources, often [[Pliny the Elder]], but also other authors and works now lost, to whom he is thus a valuable witness. He is more attentive to marine life than might be expected, though, and this seems to reflect first-hand personal interest; he often quotes &quot;fishermen&quot;. At times he strikes the modern reader as thoroughly credulous, but at others he specifically states that he is merely reporting what is told by others, and even that he does not believe them. Aelian's work is one of the sources of medieval natural history and of the [[Bestiary|bestiaries]] of the Middle Ages; in some ways an allegory of the moral world, an [[Emblem]] Book. 

[[Conrad Gessner]] (or Gesner), the Swiss scientist and natural historian of the Renaissance, made a Latin translation of Aelian's work, to give it a wider European audience. The latest Latin translation is that of Friderich Jacobs (1832), based on both Gesner's translation and that of Petrus Gillius (1533). An English translation by A.&amp;nbsp;F.&amp;nbsp;Scholfield has been published in the Loeb Classical Library.

==''Varia Historia (&amp;Pi;&amp;omicron;&amp;iota;&amp;kappa;&amp;iota;&amp;lambda;&amp;eta; &amp;Iota;&amp;sigma;&amp;tau;&amp;omicron;&amp;rho;&amp;iota;&amp;alpha;)''==
''Various History'' &amp;#8212; for the most part preserved only in an abridged form &amp;#8212; is Aelian's other well-known work, a miscellany of anecdotes and biographical sketches, lists, pithy maxims, and descriptions of natural wonders and strange local customs, in 14&amp;nbsp;books, with many surprises for the cultural historian and the [[mythographer]], anecdotes about the famous Greek philosophers, poets, historians, and playwrights; myths instructively retold. The emphasis is on ''various'' moralizing tales about heroes and rulers, athletes and wise men; reports about food and drink, different styles in dress or lovers, local habits in giving gifts or entertainments, or in religious beliefs and death customs; and comments on Greek painting. Aelian gives an account of fly fishing, using lures of red wool and feathers, of lacquerwork, [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] worship &amp;#8212; Essentially the ''Various History'' is a Classical &quot;[[magazine]]&quot; in the original senses of that word. He is not perfectly trustworthy in details, and his agenda is always to inculcate culturally &quot;correct&quot; [[Stoicism|Stoic]] opinions, perhaps so that his readers will not feel guilty, but [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] found survivals of archaic rites mentioned by Aelian very illuminating in her ''Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion'' (1903).

Two English translations of the ''Various History,''  by Fleming (1576) and Stanley (1665) made Aelian's miscellany available to English readers; a recent English translation of Aelian's ''Varia Historia'' is by Diane Ostrom Johnson, 1997.
 
Considerable fragments of two other works, ''On Providence'' and ''Divine Manifestations'', are preserved in the early medieval encyclopedia, the ''[[Suda]].''  Twenty &quot;letters from a farmer&quot; after the manner of [[Alciphron]] are also attributed to him. The letters are invented compositions to a fictitious correspondent, which are a device for vignettes of agricultural and rural life, set in Attica, though mellifluous Aelian once boasted that he had never been outside Italy, never been aboard a ship (which is at variance, though, with his own statement, de Nat. An. XI.40, that he had seen the bull [[Serapis]] with his own eyes). Thus conclusions about actual agriculture in the ''Letters'' are as likely to evoke [[Latium]] as [[Attica]]. The fragments have been edited in 1998 by D. Domingo-Foraste, but are not available in English. The ''Letters'' are available in the Loeb Classical Library series.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''This article is about the mythological figure. For other meanings, see [[Callisto]].''

From [[Greek mythology]], '''Callisto''' was the daughter of [[Lycaon]], the king of [[Arcadia]], and possibly a [[nymph]]. Her name is derived from ''kalliste'' (καλλιστη), meaning &quot;most beautiful.&quot;

==The myth==
A follower of [[Artemis]], she took a vow to remain a virgin. But [[Zeus]] fell in love with her and disguised himself as [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]] in order to lure her into his embrace. [[Hera]], Zeus' wife, then turned Callisto into a [[bear]] out of revenge.  Later, [[Arcas]], the son of Callisto and Zeus, nearly killed her in a hunt but Zeus placed them both in the sky as the [[constellation|constellations]] [[Ursa Major]] and [[Ursa Minor]].

An alternate version:  One of Artemis' companions, Callisto lost her virginity to Zeus, who had come disguised as Artemis.  Enraged, Artemis changed her into a bear.  Callisto's son, Arcas, nearly killed his mother while hunting, but Zeus or Artemis stopped him and placed them both in the sky as Ursa Major and Ursa Minor.

Another alternate version:  Artemis killed Callisto in bear form, deliberately.

Hera was not pleased with the placement of Callisto and Arcas in the sky, so she asked her nurse, [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]], to help.  Tethys, a marine goddess, cursed the constellations to forever circle the sky and never drop below the horizon, hence explaining why they are circumpolar.

==Origin of the myth==
The myth may be derived from the fact that a set of constellations appear close together in the sky, in and near the [[Zodiac]] sign of [[Libra]], namely [[Ursa Minor]], [[Ursa Major]], [[Boötes]], and [[Virgo]].

Boötes, since it resembles a male [[stick-figure]], is in some versions of the myth explicitly identified as Arcas (untransformed), and was in myths elsewhere said represents a male god. Virgo, since it resembles a female, was usually considered to be a significant female goddess, though not identified as to whom. 

The combination of a god and goddess and two bears in the same area of sky may have led to a transformation myth, associating the b970s Lockheed constructed one C-130 with [[Turbofan engine|turbofan engines]] rather than turboprops, but the US Air Force preferred the takeoff performance of the existing aircraft. In the 1980s the C-130 was intended to be replaced by the [[Advanced Medium STOL Transport]] project. However, the project was cancelled and the C-130 has remained in production.

The '''C-130J''' is the newest version of the Hercules and the only model still produced. Externally similar to the classic Hercules, the J model is a radically different aircraft under the exterior. These differences include new [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] [[Allison AE2100]] turboprops with six-bladed [[composite material|composite]] [[Scimitar propeller|scimitar propellers]], digital avionics (including [[Head-Up Display|head-up displays]] for each pilot), reduced manpower requirements (2 pilots&amp;mdash;no navigator or flight engineer), increased reliability and up to 27% lower operating costs. The C-130J is also available in a standard-length or stretched C-130J-30 version. Lockheed received the launch order for J model from the RAF, who ordered 25 aircraft, with first deliveries beginning in [[1999 in aviation|1999]]. The RAF calls the C-130J the '''Hercules C.5''' and the stretched C-130J-30 the '''Hercules C.4'''.

The largest operator of the new model will be the USAF, who are ordering the aircraft in increasing numbers, although as of [[2005 in aviation|2005]] the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] announced that C-130J acquisition would be dramatically cut back. Current operators of the C-130J are the USAF, USMC (KC-130J tanker), [[Air National Guard|US Air National Guard]], [[United States Coast Guard|US Coast Guard]], RAF, [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (but will be phased out for the [[C-17]]), [[Danish Air Force]] and the [[Italian Air Force]].

Lockheed also offered leasing of four C-130J to the German [[Luftwaffe]], who is in need for a [[Transall]]-Replacement until the [[Airbus]] [[A400M]] is available in 2010.

==Significant operational use==
[[Image:Hercules Duxford.JPG|thumb|left|250px|A Hercules C.5 at the [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]], [[England]]]]
While the C-130 is involved in cargo and resupply operations daily, it has been a part of some notable operations. One of the most famous events involving the Hercules was the [[1976]] [[Entebbe raid]] in which [[Israel|Israeli]] [[commando]] forces carried a surprise assault to rescue 103 passengers of an airliner Hijacked by [[Palestinian]] and [[Germany|German]] [[terrorists]] at [[Entebbe Airport]], [[Uganda]]. The rescue force — 200 soldiers, jeeps, and a black [[Mercedes-Benz]] (intended to resemble Ugandan [[Dictator]] [[Idi Amin]]'s vehicle of state) — was flown 4,000km from Israel to Entebbe by five [[Israeli Air Force]] ([[IAF]]) Hercules aircraft without mid-air refueling (on the way back, the planes refueled in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]). 

The Hercules also holds the record of the largest and heaviest airplane to land on an [[aircraft carrier]]. In November [[1963]], a C-130 landed without using the ship's arresting gear on the [[USS Forrestal (CVA-59)]]. The pilot, Lt. James Flatley III, was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for his participation. The tests were highly successful, but the idea was considered too risky for routine &quot;[[Carrier onboard delivery|Carrier On-board Delivery]]&quot;) (COD) operations. Instead, the [[C-2 Greyhound]] was developed as a dedicated COD aircraft.

The '''MC-130''' variant carries and deploys what are currently the world's largest conventional [[bomb]]s, the [[BLU-82]] &quot;daisy cutter&quot; and [[GBU-43/B]] [[Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb]]. Daisy cutters were used during the [[Vietnam War]] to clear landing zones for [[Helicopter|helicopters]] and to eliminate [[land mine|minefields]] and have recently even been proposed for anti-personnel use. The weight and size of the weapons make existing [[bomber aircraft]] impossible or impractical for operational use.

A prominent C-130T aircraft is '''Fat Albert''', the support aircraft for the US Navy [[Blue Angels]] flight demonstration team. Although Fat Albert supports a Navy squadron, its crew consists solely of USMC personnel. At some [[Air Show|air shows]] featuring the flight team, Fat Albert takes part, performing flyovers and sometimes demonstrating its jet-assisted take off capabilities.

===Notable crashes===
[[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], the [[President of Pakistan|president]] of [[Pakistan]] from [[1978]], was killed on [[August 17]] [[1988]], when the C-130 he was in wobbled shortly after take off from [[Bahawalpur]] and then crashed. The then-US ambassador to Pakistan and a US [[general]] were also killed, alongside everyone else on-board.

On [[January 30]] [[2005]], an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] Hercules with 10 crew on board was hit by insurgent fire while taking off from Baghdad airport for Balad. Less than 24 minutes later, it crashed, as fire triggered by the hit induced an explosion in the right hand wing fuel tank, leaving the plane uncontrollable.

On [[December 6]] [[2005]], an [[Iranian Air Force]] C-130 military [[transport aircraft]] [[Iranian Air Force C-130 crash in Tehran|crashed into a ten-floor apartment building]], home to a number of air force personnel, in a residential area of [[Tehran]], the capital city of [[Iran]]. Bound for [[Bandar Abbas]] on the Persian Gulf, the aeroplane was carrying 84 passengers (68 of whom were journalists due to watch military exercises off the country's south coast) and 10 crew members. In total 116 people were confirmed dead, (as of [[December 8]] 2005).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Commodore 1570''' was a 5&amp;frac14;&quot; [[floppy disk]] drive for the [[Commodore 128]] [[home computer|home]]/[[personal computer]]. It was a single-sided, 170KB version of the double-sided [[Commodore 1571]], released as a [[stopgap]] measure when [[Commodore International]] was unable to provide large enough quantities of 1571s due to a shortage of double-sided drive mechanisms.  Like the 1571, it could read and write both [[Group Code Recording|GCR]] and [[MFM]] disk formats.

The 1570 utilized a 1571 logic board in a cream-colored [[Commodore 1541]] case with a 1541 drive mechanism. Like the 1571, its built-in DOS provided a data burst mode for transferring data to the C128 computer at a faster speed than a 1541. Its [[Read-only memory|ROM]] also contained some DOS bug fixes that didn't appear in the 1571 until much later.  The 1570 could read and write all single-sided [[CP/M operating system|CP/M]] format disks that the 1571 could access.

Although the 1570 was compatible with the [[Commodore 64]], the C64 wasn't capable of taking advantage of the drive's higher-speed operation, and when used with the C64 it was little more than a pricier 1541.  Also, many early buyers of the C128 chose to temporarily make do with a 1541 drive, perhaps owned as part of a previous C64 setup, until the 1571 became more widely available.

The '''Commodore 1571''' was [[Commodore International|Commodore's]] high-end 5&amp;frac14;&quot; [[floppy disk]] drive. With its double-sided drive mechanism, it had the ability to utilized double-sided, double-density (DS/DD) floppy disks natively. This was in contrast to its predecesors, the [[Commodore 1541|1541]] and [[Commodore 1570|1570]], which could read or write such disks only by manually flipping them over to access the second side.

The 1571 was released to match the [[Commodore 128]], both design-wise and feature-wise. It was announced in the summer of [[1985]], at the same time as the C128, and became available in quantity later that year. The later C128''D'' had a 1571 compatible drive integrated in the system unit. A double-sided disk on the 1571 could hold 332 [[Kilobyte|KB]] of data, formatted as 1,328 disk blocks of 256 [[byte]]s each.

The 1571 featured a &quot;burst mode&quot; when used in conjunction with the C128 (although not when used with the [[Commodore 64]] or [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]]). This mode replaced the slow [[bit-banging]] serial routines of the 1541 with a true serial [[shift register]] implemented in hardware, thus dramatically increasing the drive speed. Although this had originally been planned when Commodore first switched from the parallel [[IEEE-488]] interface to a custom serial interface, hardware bugs in the VIC-20's [[MOS Technology 6522|6522 VIA]] shift register prevented it from working properly [http://www.binarydinosaurs.co.uk/Museum/Commodore/c64/c64notes.php].

For compatibility with copy-protected software, the 1571 could also closely emulate the 1541. This mode was the default when the drive was used in conjunction with a C64.

The 1571 was noticeably quieter than its predecessor and tended to run cooler as well, even though, like the 1541, it had the power supply inside the unit (later Commodore drives, like the 1541-II and the 3&amp;frac12;&quot; [[Commodore 1581|1581]], came with external power supplies). The 1541-II/1581 power supply makes mention of a 1571-II, hinting that Commodore may have intended to release a version of the 1571 with an external power supply. However, no 1571-IIs are known to exist. The embedded OS in the 1571 was [[Commodore DOS|CBM DOS V3.0 1571]], an improvement over the 1541's V2.6.

Unlike the 1541, which was limited to [[Group Code Recording|GCR]] formatting, the 1571 could do both GCR and [[MFM]] disk formats. A C128 in CP/M mode equipped with a 1571 was capable of reading and writing floppy disks formatted for many [[CP/M]] computers; specifically, the following formats:
* [[IBM PC]] [[CP/M-86]]
* [[Osborne 1]]
* Epson QX10
* [[Kaypro]] II, IV

With additional software, it was possible to read and write to [[DOS]]-formatted floppies as well. Numerous commercial and public-domain programs for this purpose became available, the best known being [[SOGWAP]]'s &quot;Big Blue Reader&quot;. Although the C128 could not run any DOS-based software, this capability allowed data files to be exchanged with PC users.

Like the 1541, Commodore initially had difficulty keeping up with demand for the 1571, and that lack of availability and the drive's relatively high price (about US$300) presented an opportunity for cloners. Two 1571 clones, one from Oceanic and one from Blue Chip, appeared, but legal action from Commodore quickly succeeded in driving them from the market.

Commodore announced a dual-drive version of the 1571, to be called the 1572, but quickly cancelled it, reportedly due to technical difficulties with the 1572 DOS.

:''This article is about the drug Cocaine. For the blues song by [[J.J. Cale]] (later covered by [[Eric Clapton]]) see [[Cocaine (song)]]''.

'''Cocaine''' is a [[crystalline]] [[tropane]] [[alkaloid]] that is obtained from the leaves of the [[coca]] plant. It is a [[stimulant]] of the [[central nervous system]] and an [[appetite suppressant]], creating what has been described as a euphoric sense of happiness and increased energy. Though most often used recreationally for this effect, cocaine is also a topical [[anesthesia|anesthetic]] that was used in [[eye surgery|eye]] and throat [[surgery]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Cocaine is highly [[addiction|addictive]], and its possession, cultivation, and distribution is illegal for non-medicinal / non-government sanctioned purposes in virtually all parts of the world. 
==History==
===The coca leaf===
For thousands of years and still today, [[South America]]n [[Native American (Americas)|indigenous peoples]] have chewed the [[coca]] leaf (''Erythroxylon coca''), a plant which contains vital nutrients as well as numerous [[alkaloids]], including cocaine. The leaf was and is chewed almost universally by some [[tribe|indigenous communities]], but there is no evidence that its habitual use ever led to any of the negative consequences generally associated with habitual cocaine use today.

[[Image:Coca.jpg|168px|left|thumb|The coca plant, ''Erythroxylon coca''.]]

When the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spaniards conquered South America]], they at first ignored Aboriginal claims that the leaf gave them strength and energy, and declared the practice of chewing it the work of the [[Devil]]. But after discovering that these claims were true, they legalized and taxed the leaf, taking 10% off the value of each crop. These taxes were for a time the main source of support for the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the region.

In [[1609]] Padre [[Blas Valera]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Coca protects the body from many ailments, and our doctors use it in powdered form to reduce the swelling of wounds, to strengthen broken bones, to expel cold from the body or prevent it from entering, and to cure rotten wounds or sores that are full of maggots. And if it does so much for outward ailments, will not its singular virtue have even greater effect in the entrails of those who eat it?''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Isolation===  

Although the stimulant and hunger-suppressant properties of coca had been known for many centuries, the isolation of the cocaine [[alkaloid]] was not achieved until [[1855]]. Many scientists had attempted to isolate cocaine, but none had been successful for two reasons: the knowledge of chemistry required was insufficient at the time, and coca does not grow in [[Europe]] and is easily ruined during travel.

The cocaine alkaloid was first isolated by the [[Germany|German]] [[chemist]] [[Friedrich Gaedcke]] in [[1855]]. Gaedcke named the alkaloid “erythroxyline”, and published a description in the journal ''[[Archives de Pharmacie]]''.

In [[1856]] [[Friederich Wöhler]] asked Dr. [[Carl Scherzer]], a scientist aboard the ''[[Novara]]'' (an [[Austria]]n frigate sent by Emperor [[Franz Joseph of Austria|Franz Joseph]] to circle the globe), to bring him a large amount of coca leaves from South America. In [[1859]] the ship finished its travels and Wöhler received a trunk full of coca. Wöhler passed on the leaves to [[Albert Niemann]], a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] student at the [[University of Göttingen]] in [[Germany]], who then developed an improved purification process.

Niemann described every step he took to isolate cocaine in his [[dissertation]] entitled ''[[On a New Organic Base in the Coca Leaves]]'', which was published in [[1860]] &amp;mdash; it also earned him his Ph.D. and is now in the [[British Library]]. He wrote of the alkaloid's “colourless transparent prisms” and said that, “Its solutions have an alkaline reaction, a bitter taste, promote the flow of saliva and leave a peculiar numbness, followed by a sense of cold when applied to the tongue.” Niemann named the alkaloid “cocaine” — as with other [[alkaloid]]s its name carried the “-ine” [[suffix]] (from [[Liet Union]] demanded mining rights in [[Petsamo]]. On [[June 27]], Moscow demanded demilitarization of [[Åland]]. After Sweden had signed the [[Transit of German troops through Scandinavia (WWII)|troop transfer agreement]] with Germany on [[July 8]], [[Soviet Union]] demanded similar rights for a Soviet troop transit to [[Hanko]]. The transfer rights were given on [[September 6]], and demilitarization of Åland was agreed on [[October 11]], but negotiations on [[Petsamo]] continued to drag on. The Soviet Union also demanded several changes in the Finnish internal politics, for example forcing the resignation of [[Väinö Tanner]] from the cabinet. All of this reminded the public of how [[Occupation of Baltic Republics|the Baltic Republics had been occupied]] and annexed only a few months earlier. 

Unbeknownst to Finland, [[Adolf Hitler]] had started to plan invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] ([[Operation Barbarossa]]). He had not been interested in Finland before the [[Winter War]], but now he saw the value of Finland as an operating base, and perhaps also the military value of the [[Finnish army]]. In the first weeks of August, German fears of a likely immediate Russian attack on Finland caused Hitler to free the arms embargo. Negotiations were intitiated concerning German troop transfer rights in Finland in exchange for arms and other material. For the [[Third Reich]], this was a breach of the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], as well as being for Finland a breach of the [[Moscow Peace Treaty]]. Soviet negotiators had insisted that the troop transfer agreement (to [[Hanko]]) should not be published making it easy for the Finns to keep [[Transit of German troops through Scandinavia (WWII) |a troop transfer agreement with the Germans]] secret until the first German troops arrived.

=== Road to war ===

The negotiations about [[Petsamo]] [[nickel]] mining rights had dragged on for six months when the Soviet Foreign Ministry announced in January [[1941]] that the negotiations had to be concluded quickly. On the same day, the Soviet Union interrupted grain deliveries to Finland. Soviet ambassador Zotov was recalled home [[January 18]] and Soviet radio broadcasts started attacking Finland. Germans in Northern [[Norway]] reported in [[February 1]] that the [[Soviet Union]] had collected 500 fishing ships in [[Murmansk]], capable of transporting a division. Hitler ordered troops in [[Norway]] to occupy [[Petsamo]] ([[Operation Renntier]]) immediately if the [[Soviet Union]] started attacking Finland.

After the failure of the [[nickel]] negotiations, diplomatic activities were halted for a few months. The period did, however, saw increased German interest in Finland.

German Foreign Ministry sent [[Ludwig Weissauer]] to Finland [[May 5]], this time to clarify that war between Germany and the Soviet Union would not be launched before spring [[1942]]. Finnish leadership believed that at least officially, and forwarded the message to the Swedes and the British. When the war broke out only a couple of weeks later, it was understandable that both Swedish and British governments felt that the Finns had lied to them. 

In the spring of [[1941]] joint battle plans were discussed with Germany, as well as communications and securing sea lanes. Finland made significant request for material aid. Finland was willing to join Germany against Soviet union with someprerequisites: a guarantee of Finnish independence, the pre-Winter War borders (or better), continuing grain deliveries, and that Finnish troops would not cross the border before a Soviet incursion. The arrival of German troops participating in [[Operation Barbarossa]] began on [[June 7]] in [[Petsamo]].

[[Finnish parliament]] was informed for the first time on [[June 9]], when first mobilization orders were issued for troops needed to safeguard the following general mobilization phases. On [[June 20]] Finland's government ordered 45,000 people at the Soviet border to be evacuated. On [[June 21]] Finland's chief of the General Staff, [[Erik Heinrichs]], was finally informed by his German counterpart that the attack was to begin.


== Finnish Offensive 1941 ==

[[Image:Finnish advance in Karelia during the Continuation War.png|300px|thumb|The furthest advance of Finnish units in the Continuation War. Borders for both before and after the Winter War are shown.]]

[[Operation Barbarossa]] had already commenced in the northern Baltic by the late hours of [[June 21]], when German minelayers, which had been hiding in the Finnish archipelago, laid two large minefields across the [[Gulf of Finland]]. These minefields ultimately proved sufficient to confine the Soviets' [[Baltic Fleet]] to the easternmost part of the Gulf of Finland. Later the same night, German bombers, flew along the Gulf of Finland to [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] and mined the harbour and the river [[Neva]]. On the return trip, these bombers refuelled in [[Utti]] airfield. Finland feared that the [[Soviet Union]] would occupy [[Åland]] so [[Operation Kilpapurjehdus]] (Sail Race) was launched in the early hours of [[June 22]] to occupy [[Åland]]. Soviet bombers launched attacks against Finnish ships during the operation but no damage was inflicted.

On the morning of June 22, the German [[Gebirgskorps Norwegen]] started [[Operation Renntier]] and began its move from Northern [[Norway]] to [[Petsamo]]. Finland did not allow direct German attacks from its soil to the Soviet Union, so German forces in Petsamo and Salla had to hold their fire. There were occasional individual and group level small arms shooting between Soviet and Finnish border guards, but otherwise the front was quiet.

After three days, early on the morning of [[June 25]], the Soviet Union unleashed a major air offensive against 18 cities with 460 planes, mainly striking airfields but seriously damaging civilian targets as well. The Soviet Union justified the attack as being directed against German targets in Finland, but even the British embassy had to admit that this was not so. A meeting of parliament was scheduled for [[June 25]] when Prime Minister Rangell had been due to present a notice about Finland's neutrality in the Soviet-German war, but the Soviet bombings led him to instead observe that Finland was once again at war with the Soviet Union. The Continuation War had begun.

Mobilized units started moving towards the border on June 21, and they were arranged into defensive formations as soon as they arrived at the border.  Finland was able to mobilize 16 infantry divisions, one cavalry brigade, and two &quot;[[Jäger (military)|Jäger]]&quot; brigades, which were practically normal infantry brigades, except for one battalion in the 1st Jaeger Brigade (1.JPr), which was armoured using captured Soviet equipment. There were also a handful of separate battalions, mainly formed from Border Guard units and used mainly for reconnaissance. Soviet military plans has estimated that the Finns would be able to mobilize only 10 infantry divisions, as they had done in the Winter War, but they failed to take into account material the Finns had purchased between the wars and the training of all available men. In northern Finland there were also two German Mountain Divisions at Petsamo and two German Infantry divisions at Salla. Another German infantry division was en route through Sweden to Ladoga Karelia, although one reinforced regiment was later redirected from it to Salla.

When the war started, the Soviet Union had [[Soviet 23rd Army|23rd Army]] in Karelian Isthmus consisting of [[Soviet 50th Corps|50th]] and [[Soviet 19th Corps|19th Corps]] and [[Soviet 10th Mechanized Corps|10th Mechanized Corps]], together with 5 Infantry, 1 Motorized and 2 Armored divisions. At Ladoga Karelia there was the [[Soviet 7th Army|7th Army]] consisting of 4 Infantry divisions. In Murmansk-Salla region the Soviet Union had [[Soviet 14th Army|14th Army]] with [[Soviet 42nd Corps|42nd Corps]], consisting of 5 Infantry divisions (1 as reserve in [[Archangelsk]]) and 1 Armored division. Also the Soviets had around 40 battalions, separate regiments and fortification units which were not part of their divisional structure. In Leningrad there were 3 Infantry divisions and one Mechanized Corps.

The initial German strike against the Soviet Air Force had not touched air units located near Finland, so the Soviets could field nearly 750 Air Force planes and part of the 700 planes the Soviet Navy had against 300 Finnish planes.

The Soviet war against Germany did not go as well as pre-war Soviet war games had envisioned, and soon Soviet high command had to take units from wherever they could, so although Soviets had started the war against Finland, they could not follow the initial air offensive with a supporting land offensive.  They also had to withdraw the 10th Mechanized Corps with two armoured divisions and [[Soviet 237th Infantry division|237th Infantry division]] from Ladoga Karelia thus stripping reserves from defending units.

=== Reconquest of Ladoga Karelia ===
Initially the Finnish army was deployed in a defensive posture, but on [[June 29]] Mannerheim created the [[Army of Karelia]], commanded by Lt. Gen. Heinrichs, and ordered it to prepare to attack Ladoga Karelia. The Army of Karelia consisted of [[Finnish VI Corps (Continuation War)|VI Corps]] ([[Finnish 5th Division (Continuation War)|5th]] and [[Finnish 11th Division (Continuation War)|11th Divisions]]), [[Finnish VII Corps (Continuation War)|VII Corps]] ([[Finnish 7th Division (Continuation War)|7th]] and [[Finnish 9th Division (Continuation War)|9th divisions]]) and [[Group O]] ([[Finnish Cavalry Brigade|Cavalry Brigade]], [[1st Jaeger Brigade]] and [[2nd Jaeger Brigade]]). Also later when 1. division and two regiments of German 163. division arrived in the area, they were given to the Army of Karelia.

Opposing them were the Soviet [[Soviet 7th Army|7th Army]] with [[Soviet 168th Division|168th Division]] near Sortavala and [[Soviet 71st Division|71st Division]] north of [[Jänisjärvi]] (&quot;Hare Lake&quot;). Soviets had prepared field fortifications along the border across Sortavala and at the important road crossings at Värtsilä and Korpiselkä. 

On [[July 9]], the order for offensive was given. The duty to break through the Soviet defences was given to VI Corps, commanded by hero of [[Battle of Tolvajärvi]], Maj. Gen. [[Paavo Talvela]]. He had borrowed as much artillery as possible from other units of the Army of Karelia and even 1st Jaeger Brigade. (Col. [[Ruben Lagus]]) from Group O. With strong artillery support he unleashed 5th Division (Col. Koskimies) to Korpiselkä [[July 10]] and the defenders were overwhelmed by next morning. Talvela wasn't satisfied with the aggressiveness of Koskimies, and he relieved him from command and gave 5th Division to Col. Lagus.

Lagus pursued retreating Soviet IR 52 eastward with his light units and reached Tolvajärvi July 12. Then he turned southwards and advanced using small roads, some in such poor shape that men had to carry their bicycles. On July 14 his forces cut Sortavala-Petrozavodsk railroad, and next day they reached shores of Lake Ladoga, cutting Soviet routes around the lake. Soviets had to transfer two regiments and separate battalions from Karelian Isthmus to close down the hole on the eastern side of Lake Ladoga.

The 11th division (Col. Heiskanen) had already (by July 4) found that Soviet forces had temporarily abandoned their trenches across the border, and they used the opportunity to capture them. When the general offensive began, they had already (by July 9) pushed eastward from their captured positions over the roadless terrain and cut the road running from Korpiselkä to Värtsilä and Suistamo, on the eastern shore of Jänisjärvi. From there they threatened to encircle Soviet forces south of Korpiselkä and those fortified in Värtsilä. To prevent encirclement, the Soviets had to leave their positions and retreat eastward. Soviet IR 367 was able to hold its positions north of Jänisjärvi until defenders of Värtsilä had retreated there by July 12. Heiskanen continued pressing Soviet IR 367 around the eastern side of Jänistärvi, and reached Jänisjoki, running from Jänisjärvi to Lake Ladoga July 16, where they went on the defensive. 

Lagus continued his offensive immediately along the north-eastern coast of Lake Ladoga. Soviet Mot. IR 452 was coming from Karelian Isthmus and its first parts set to defensive at Salmi, where Tulemajoki reaches Lake Ladoga. Finns arrived there on July 18, and early next morning Finns started the battle by crossing the river 5km north of Salmi and managed to cut the roads leading to Salmi by afternoon. Next day Finns were able to push into the village and only small units were able to escape the encirclement. Salmi was finally captured by early hours of July 21.

The strengthened 5th division continued its advance as fast as possible and crossed the old border July 22 at Rajakontu. Meanwhile battle detachment under Järvinen (Col. Järvinen) had secured the left flank of the main thrust by crossing the old border at Känsäselkä and captured July 19 the villages of Kolatselkä and Palalahti by Tulemajärvi where they secured north and east leading roads and continued their advance to the south. And July 23 5th division from the west and detachment Järvinen from the north started their attack to Vitele village, which was captured next morning. Lagus unsuccessfully tried to encircle retreating Soviet forces and had by the evening reached Tuuloksenjoki but Soviet tanks and artillery managed to stop the advance of his light forces there.  

The 1st division (Col. Paalu) had arrived and was given to VI Corps July 16, but it was until July 20 when they reached the fast- moving front line and released attachment Järvinen to their attack towards Vitele. From there they continued attack north towards Hyrsylä and east toward Vieljärvi which it captured few days later. Soviet AR2, IR24, IR28 and parts of IR9 and IR10 started counteroffensive July 23, and after five days of fighting the front was established 10km east of Vieljärvi.

The Soviet North Front reorganized its forces at July 21 by transferring 168th division and one regiment from 71st division to 23rd Army, which was responsible for defence of Karelian Isthmus. The same day 7th Army was reorganized to two operative groups, Petrozavodsk Group (Lt. Gen. M. Antonjuk) with infantry regiment, two motorized regiments, one armoured regiment and separate units and South Group (Lt. Gen. V. Tsvetajev) with marine brigade, two motorized regiments and number of smaller units.

Also Mannerheim had recognized the situation and had already at July 19 ordered that attack must be stopped at Vitele-Vieljärvi line, as strong enemy formations were still on the southwestern side of Jänisjärvi and the fast advance had opened the Lake Ladoga coastline at the right flank of the 5th division and the defence has to be arranged.

The fears of Mannerheim were real, as July 19 Mj. Gen. Pavlov, commander of coastal defence of Lake Ladoga has ordered 4 Marine Brigade to conduct invasions behind Finnish defences.  During early hours of July 24, they landed successfully to Lunkulansaari and Mantsi, two islands right beside Salmi. All 11th, 5th and 1st divisions were committed at the time so Talvela had to scrape whatever forces he was able to get (including bridge building company) to throw attackers back to the lake. With the help of heavy artillery, which destroyed four of the fifteen ships Soviets were using, Finns were able to push marines to three separate mottis, and the attempt to reinforce these forces at the morning of July 25 was repulsed. One by one remaining mottis were destroyed. July 26 Soviets landed in Mantsi and this time they almost managed to capture the whole island before Talvela managed to reinforce forces there, and fighting continued in to the late night of July 27 when the last Soviet resistance ended.   

Finnish VII Corps (Mj. Gen. Hägglund) was ordered to attack at the right flank of VI Corps to Sortavala. The isthmus between Lake Ladoga and the Finnish border was quite narrow and the important rail junction of Matkaselkä was only ten kilometres from the border. So, it was no wonder that Soviets had started to fortify the border region, in depth, right after the Moscow Peace. These fortifications were the weakest at the northern section of the front, so Hägglund decided to put the main thrust there. There were concentrated 7th division (strengthened with pioneer units) and all Corps' artillery. The 19th division-south had to manage with only its internal artillery.

On the evening of July 10 the attack began.  As a heavy thunderstorm was raging at the area, it was decided that infantry would attack without artillery support so that surprise could be achieved. The plan succeeded and most Soviet forces were encircled in their pillboxes, which were then eliminated with artillery support. During the next day, 7th division advanced, encircling Soviet strongpoints.  By the morning of July 12, they managed to break through the region where Soviets had prepared minefields and fortifications. 

This proved to be only a short relief, as defending Soviet 168th division (Col. A. Bondarev) proved to be very capable in defence. Time after time, it created new minefields, dug strongpoints and trenches and skillfully evaded encircling Finnish units. The fight of the 168th division was later used as a textbook example for defensive fight in Soviet military schools.  

The 7th division reached the western shore of Jänisjärvi July 13 and turned southward. By July 15 they managed to reach the Sortavala-Petrozavodsk railroad at Pirttipohja and encircled defenders there.

The 19th division (Col. Hannuksela) had the unenvied duty to assault the best defended section of the 168th division. Hannuksela decided to create a very narrow and deep breach at Niinisyrjä village, only 200-300 meters wide and four kilometres deep, to breach the fortified border region. IR58 (Lt. Col. Juva) was to spearhead the assault which began late in the evening of July 10. IR58 fought all the night and next day advancing one and half kilometres. It became evident that they had insufficient artillery so they had to borrow artillery from II Corps. IR58 continued the attack and reached the end of border fortifications July 12. The Soviet 168th division counterattacked to close the breach and encircle the IR58, but Finns managed to hold the corridor, although Soviets managed to close its usage with artillery fire. Finnish IR16 (Col. M. Laurila), which followed IR58, managed to open the corridor by the morning of July 15.

The 7th division continued its attack July 15 eastward along the railroad. At July 17 they managed to breach Soviet defences at the isthmus between Jänisjärvi and Vahvajärvi. Meanwhile IR30 and IR51, of the 7th division, advanced east towards Jänisjoki, where they contacted the 11th division at the same day. IR30 and IR51 cleaned the western shore of Jänisjoki and reached Lake Ladoga by July 20, then started to clear islands at the front of Sortavala.

The IR37/7th division was ordered to advance westward at the southern coast of Vahvajärvi to contact the 19th division, trying to encircle enemies between the divisions. Bondarev recognized the situation and ordered retreat of the IR402. The 19th division had continued its attack southeast, and between July 18-25 the fierce encirclements and counter-encirclements raged before Finns managed to capture the main road and cut the railroad between Sortavala and Matkaselkä, which was captured July 18. Soviet managed to hold IR37 at Särkisyrjä village between July 18-19 and again at next Ilola village July 20-22, securing the retreat route of IR402. So by July 25 Soviet 168 Division had managed to straighten its front line to a geographically more defensible river (Kiteenjoki)-hills (Tirimäki, Okanmäki, Voinmäki)-river (Tohmajoki)-line.  

As Jänisjoki valley was cleared of the enemy, the remainder of the 7th division turned to the south-west. On July 25 they crossed Tohmajoki. The advancement was slow, as Soviets managed to hold their prepared strongpoints on hills, forcing Finns to encircle them. At July 28, 7 Division found a hole in Soviet defences and IR30/7 Division quickly poured through and captured Voinmäki. The advanced Finnish troops managed to ambush a car, which was transporting the Chief of Staff of Soviet 198 Division Lt. Col. Sinyk. The documents captured contained the order for a Soviet counterattack, which was to start next day, so all Finnish units were ordered to stop their offensive operations and prepare for defence.

The Soviet 23rd Army transferred 198 Division from Karelian Isthmus to Sortavala with an order to join the counteroffensive with 168 Division. The target of the attack was the recapture of the isthmus between Jänisjärvi and Lake Ladoga, as that would create a difficult situation for Finnish forces at the North side of the Lake Ladoga. When the offensive started July 29, it failed to gain ground anywhere, as available forces were too few against the Finns, and the captured information had given the Finns time to prepare for the offensive beforehand. Finns continued their offensive August 3 against the remaining Tirimäki and Okanmäki strongpoints (which prevented advancement towards Sortavala) and they were captured August 5.

Meanwhile Finnish II Corps had started its own offensive July 31 at the narrowest point between Lake Ladoga and the Finnish border and quickly managed to break through Soviet defences and advanced towards the coast of Lake Ladoga, threatening Soviet forces with encirclement. The Soviet 23rd Army cancelled the offensive and ordered 198 Division southward for a counteroffensive against advancing Finnish II Corps. 168 Division was ordered to withdraw towards Lake Ladoga starting August 5. Soviet IR367 was given the responsibility to defend Sortavala.

Although Sortavala was militarily insignificant, and had been neutralized when Finns captured islands which controlled access to Lake Ladoga on July 27, it was politically important.  So, instead of pursuing 168 Division relentlessly, Finns concentrated forces to capture the city. On August 12 Sortavala was reached by 7 Division and the city was cleared of Soviets at August 15. Only small groups of defending soldiers managed to escape from the city.

Finnish II Corps had cut railroads between Viipuri and Sortavala August 6, and on August 8 Mannerheim formed the new I Corps from 19 Division, 7 Division and 2 Division, with the task to clear the western shore of Lake Ladoga. The II Corps reached Lake Ladoga August 8 at Lahdenpohja, (thus capturing the harbour 168 Division had been instructed to use for evacuation on July 23).

Soviet 168 Division, with a number of separate regiments and battalions, continued its retreat towards the shores of Lake Ladoga, with Finnish 2 Division pressing from the south-west and 19 Division from the north, while 7 Division continued its offensive against Sortavala. On August 17, Soviets controlled only a 12 km wide and 10 km deep bridgehead, but during the following days Soviets concentrated naval and air units to protect the evacuation of 168 Division and other units. This evacuation was a great success, and Finns could only capture small booty from the motti, including 40 artillery pieces, 8 tanks, 310 cars, 35 tractors and 1500 live or dead horses. 

At the northern side of the Finnish main offensive group, Oinonen, with the Cavalry Brigade and 2 Jaeger Brigade, was ordered to advance to the old border. Opposing them was parts of IR52/71 Division, 80 Border Guard detachment and IR126/71 Division, which was commanded by Maj. Valli (a Finnish-born communist who emigrated to the Soviet Union during the Finnish Civil War).  Many Karelian, Ingern and Finnish-born communists served in its ranks, as well as many veterans from Kuusinen's people's army of the Winter War.

The probing attacks started on July 7, then the main attack started, with the southernmost 2 J. Br. reaching Tolvajärvi by July 14. From there the brigade started a northern encirclement towards Ägläjärvi. The attack of the Cav. Br. didn't succeed as well, and the Finns were forced to encircle well prepared Soviet hill-forts, which Finns were unable to capture directly, due to lack of artillery and air support.   

By that time German 163 Division (Lt. Gen. Engelbrecht) (lacking one brigade and part of the artillery, which was diverted to Salla during transport) had reached the front at Tolvajärvi and tried to breach Soviet positions there on July 21, with only one brigade, but failed as their opponents turned out to be stronger than expected. 

A new offensive started July 25, when two battalions from German IR310 and one from Finnish IR56 started attacking along the railroad, near the Näätäoja station. At Tolvajärvi, Engelbrecht decided to use the route 2 J. Br. had opened, and ordered them, and one German infantry battalion from IR307, to capture Ägläjärvi village, to sever the Soviet supply route to Tolvajärvi. The attack failed and Soviets managed to keep the road open through Ägläjärvi, although they lost a supply depot during fighting.

Lt. Gen. Engelbrecht exchanged Cav. Br. with a couple of infantry battalions which were ordered in defence, and ordered Cav. Br. to cut the road between Tolvajärvi and Ägläjärvi, by advancing through the forests. The attack started August 2 and by August 4 they reached the road and started advancing towards Tolvajärvi and Ägläjärvi. On August 3, 2 J. Br. and German I/IR307 started attacking Ägläjärvi village, which they captured on August 5. On August 6 they contacted Cav. Br. south of Ägläjärvi. The Soviets continued their retreat to Aittojoki, where they blew up the bridges and dug in. Also, their northern forces feared encirclement from Ägläjärvi, and left their fortified positions there August 8, retreating east of Kuolismaa.

On July 20, 11 Division had been relieved from Jänisjoki and it was moved first to the reserve and then to the area between German 163 Division and 1 Division, against Hyrsylä, on August 11. The Soviets reinforced their forces in the area with the new 272 Division, August 10, and they immediately started attacking towards Vieljärvi against Finnish 1 Division, but they managed, in only a few places, to advance two kilometres in five days, before the attack was stopped.

On August 19, 11 Division started the attack from Hyrsylä northwards and reached Petrozavodsk railroad, and the main road, the next day. From there they continued northeast towards Suvilahti, which they captured August 21, and northwards towards Tsalkki, the location of the last usable supply road for Soviet defenders. Also on August 19, 2 J. Br., Cav. Br. and German IR307 stormed over the Aittojoki. Cav. Br. tried to encircle defending Soviet forces, but recognized their precarious situation and quickly withdrew, managing to retreat most of their forces eastward before the 11 Division cut their retreat route at Tsalkki on August 23. With the capture of Suojärvi, the last town in Ladoga Karelia had been reconquered.

=== Reconquest of Karelian Isthmus ===
Between the Army of Karelia and Gulf of Finland there were three Finnish corps: II Corps (2.D, 15.D and 18.D) north of river [[Vuoksi]], V Corps (10.D) and IV Corps (4.D, 12.D and 8.D) defending the coast. At the Soviet side there were XIX Corps (142.D, 115.D), L Corps (43.D, 123.D), X Mechanized Corps (21.Armored D, 24.Arm.D. and 198.Mech.D) in reserve and division strength 22. Fortification Area, which defended the coast. The Soviet X Mechanized Corps were transferred at the end of June from Karelian Isthmus to southwest of Leningrad to defend against advancing Germans but left 198.D as only reserve to Soviet forces. The Finnish V Corps were disbanded and 10.D were attached first to IV Corps (Lt.Gen. [[Karl Lennart Oesch]]) and late July to II Corps (Mj.Gen. [[Taavetti Laatikainen]]) as a reserve. Both parties were first on defensive, and only small, company or battalion size probing attacks were made both sides to improve own positions. The loss of reserves prompted Soviets to retreat to more defensible lines at the nothernmost part of the front and continued fortifying in depth, creating concrete and wooden strongpoints, digging trenches and laying minefields, although the Finns advanced to keep contact with enemy. The quiet lasted until [[July 31]], when Finnish offensive began.

The Soviet fortification works had been concentrated near river Vuoksi and along the roads, so Finns concentrated their forces to narrow, deep breakthroughs over the roadless terrains which were supported by pioneers building temporary supply roads through the forests and over the swamps. The 18.D (Col. Pajari) attacked through the forest against the northernmost section of Soviet 115.D and instead of following roads they secured a roadcrossing and advanced again over the forest to the next road where they did the same. The roadcrossings were occupied by stronger units, which had to defend against several armor supported Soviet counterattacks. During one of those counterattacks private [[Vilho Rättö]] captured Soviet AT gun and aiming through the barrel he managed to destroy four enemy tanks, earning him the first [[Mannerheim Cross]] granted to a private. Finally at August 4 Finns managed to encircle and capture Ilmee road crossing thus forcing Soviets abandon their prepared positions between Ilmee and the border. The main thrust of 15.D (Col. Hersalo) was against Soviet IR588/142.D, and concentrated the thrust against only two kilometer wide section, where most of the artillery was concentrated. After breaching the border fortifications, they advanced five kilometers through the forest before coming to the road thus bypassing Soviet defences, which were encircled and captured one by one by forces coming behind the leading elements. After six days advance 15.D was only three kilometers from the Viipuri-Sortavala railroad and 15km from the western corner of Lake Ladoga and close to encircling Soviet forces on its left side. The 2.D (Col. Blick) decided to encircle two battalions of Soviet IR461 which were defending Tyrjä village by encircling the village from east and pushing the defenders to Lake Tyrjänjärvi by using IR7/2.D while IR28/2.D passed the village and advanced southwards. While supported by artillery the Soviets managed to hold on four days, before the encirclement was complete. Some of the men were able to escape through the forests, but most of them and all their heavy equipment were trapped to the village. Also Finns suffered heavy casualties in the fighting and the IR7 received the nickname ''Tyrjän rykmentti'' (Regiment of Tyrjä). The capture of Tyrjä opened road towards Elisenvaara railway crossing and at August 5 first Finnish units reached Viipuri-Sortavala railroad.  

The commander of Soviet 23. Army, Lt.Gen. M. Gerasimov ordered August 4 198.D to cease its counterattack near Sortavala and move south to attack advancing 2.D together with 142.D. Meanwhile 115.D and 43.D should tie Finnish reserves. Unfortunately this wasn't sufficient and 115.D retreated to river Helisevänjoki, where hills and a river formed good defensive positions against attacking 18.D. The 18.D advanced to river Helisevänjoki and reached Viipuri Sortavala railroad at Inkilä roadcrossing at August 8. The 10.D (Col. Sihvo) was ordered to advance between 15.D and 18.D and at August 6 they reached Viipuri Sortavala railroad. 10.D continued attack towards Käkisalmi Hiitola railroad, but Soviet forces managed to keep railroad and road open until August 8, when 10.D captured Hiitola village and when the first troops of 10.D reached Lake Ladoga next day the last land connection to Soviet troops defending the northwest coast of Lake Ladoga was severed. Soviets tried to open the connection with strong counterattacks during August 10 and 11 but were unsuccessful.

Meanwhile IR28/2.D had captured Elisenvaara railway junction August 9 thus opening supply routes through railways from Finland. After the battle of Tyrjä IR7/2.D rested two days as division reserve before continuing attack along railroad towards Lahdenpohja town, which it captured August 8, thus dividing Soviet forces in the forming bridgehead. At the same day, 2.D was transferred to new I Corps with an order to clear northern Soviet bridgehead. It was left to 15.D and 10.D to clear southern bridgehead where Soviet 142.D and 198.D were ordered to withdraw to Kilpolansaari island for naval transport. This withdrawal was executed orderly and Finns couldn't encircle any bigger enemy formations. At August 11 15.D captured Hiitola railway junction, and at August 13 all Soviet forces have retreated to Huiskonniemi peninsula and Kilpolansaari island. With total superiority in air Soviets managed to withdraw almost all the men and material from the bridgehead and at August 23 15.D, which was left to press Soviets, had cleared all remaining rearguards from the island. 

Soviet intention was to start large counteroffensive at August 10, and 23. Army had received 265.D reinforcements to Räisälä area. The offensive was to be directed against 18.D and 10.D with the target to open roads to encircled forces on northwest coast of lake Ladoga. By coindicent the 18.D had been resting and received order to continue advance on the same day, so when the Soviet attack started at Inkilä, Finns in turn started their own only 5km westwards. While the Soviet attack failed to gain ground, Finnish attack managed to cut Soviets' main supply route and subsequent Finnish counterattack forced Soviet forces to retreat southwards while fighting delaying action and first Finnish troops reached River Vuoksi at August 14 at [[Antrea]], where they continued clearing the left shore of the river. Soviets started to move forces from southwestern side of Viipuri to defend Enso and to counterattack to Antrea at August 16, but when the attack failed, the Soviets were forced to evacuate northern shore at August 21. At the eastern side Finns advanced southeastward and reached Vuosalmi at August 17 and northern outlet of river Vuoksi at August 18. Finns crossed immediately River Vuoksi unopposed few kilometers west of Vuosalmi at August 17, and by August 20 they had secured the beachhead.  

The Soviet counterattack against 10.D started August 14 and it managed to push Finns 2km northwards before Finnish reinforcements managed to stop it. The 10.D left the coast of Lake Ladoga to IR36/15.D and concentrated all of its forces against Soviet 265.D at Räisälä. At August 15 the 10.D started its own attack in which it encircled Soviet defenders in Räisälä at August 17 and captured it next day. From there it continued cleaning the left bank of northern outlet of River Vuoksi. At August 19 IR43/10.D continued attack southward and reached Lake Suvanto at August 21. From there it continued eastward with IR1/10.D. This threatened all Soviet forces north of Vuoksi with encirclement and they started retreating from Käkisalmi which was captured at August 21. The attack continued southward and as only small border guard units were capable to delay attackers, River Taipaleenjoki and the shore of Lake Ladoga was reached at August 23, but Finnish troops were unable to cross river on the move.     

STAVKA recognized the serious situation, and ordered at August 20 retreat to the new, unprepared defence line running from the southwest side of Viipuri northwards to river Vuoksi and along it to Lake Suvanto and through River Taipaleenjoki to Lake Ladoga. This decision shortened frontline considerably, but it also meant abandoning defensive installations they had prepared last months along the border. The Finns were preparing to start their own attack along the southernmost stretch of the border at, so when they notice Soviets leaving their positions at August 21, they were ordered for immediate pursuit. Althought Soviet 43.D (Mj.Gen. V. Kirpitsnikov) managed to man new positions north and west of Viipuri, they were unable to prevent Finnish 12.D (Col. Vihma) to advance along the right bank of River Vuoksi and contact 18.D, which was enlarging their beachhead at Vuosalmi, and at the evening of August 22 the whole right bank was in Finnish hands. Soviet 123.D (Mj.Gen. F. Aljabusev) was defending the southwest side of Viipuri. Much of the troops of 123.D and of the 115.D (Mj.Gen. Konjkov) which had retreated from upper Vuoksi were still unorganized due to fast retreat from their positions. The Finnish 4.D (Col. Viljanen) advanced along the [[Saimaa Canal]], pressing Soviet 43.D from north. By August 23 the southernmost Finnish division, 8.D (Col. Winell), had cleared the western shore of the [[Bay of Viipuri]] up to the River Ykspäänjoki, and started to prepare the crossing of the bay.

During August 23 Finns had manged to advance from the east to 8km from Viipuri, but at the morning of August 24 Soviet 123.D and 115.D stated counteroffensive against Finnish forces east of Viipuri, propably trying to capture initiative and force Finns back to the northern side of River Vuoksi. Using heavy artillery fire Soviets managed to push defending Finns at places over 5km backwards, but they didn't manage to create breaches to the front, and when the reserve of 12.D, IR26, which was already moving to the place for troop rotation, arrived, the Soviets were pushed back to their starting positions next day. The Soviet counterattack failed to affect already ordered 12.D attack, which severed main railroad connection between Viipuri and Leningrad at August 25. 

At the morning of August 24 Finnish 8.D started crossing Bay of Viipuri with the forces of III/IR45 to Lihaniemi Peninsula which it secured during the same day. At the next day they continued their attack and managed to sever last railroad running from Viipuri during afternoon, and managed to enlage their beachhead few kilometers to every direction during next two days. The 12.D had continued their offensive southwest, and severed Viipuri-Leningrad main road at August 27. At August 28 STAVKA allowed 23.Army to withdraw from Viipuri and form new defensive line to approximately the same place where Mannerheim Line had been. The Soviet forces began immediate retreat and tried forcefully open the roads. At Ylä-Somme they managed to open one road at the evening of August 28, and during the night they managed to move several truck trains through, although under Finnish fire. The artillery fire caused several casualties, and little by little the road become more and more congested and finally only men at foot were able to pass. During the next two days Soviets tried repeatedly open the railroad line along the bay of Viipuri, but at the late evening of August 30 IR3/12.D reached the positions of the 8.D. The [[Battle of Porlampi|motti of Porlampi]] has closed. As the Soviet attempts to open the encirclement during the next day failed and as Finnish encirclement tightened, they made the final attempt to save men by abandoning all vehicles and trying to escape by feet through forests. The ring was already too tight and only small groups managed to escape at this last night. Next morning demoralized troops started to surrender. 9,000 men surrendered and 7,000 were buried there, but almost 12,000 men had managed to escape before the ring closed. Also the booty was abundant: 306 artillery pieces, 55 tanks, 673 trucks, almost 300 tracktors and around 4,500 horses.      

Also at along the main road and railroad between Viipuri and Leningrad the Soviet order to retreat and form a new defensive line along the old Mannerheim Line came too late, as the 12.D at the same day captured Leipäsuo and continued advance southwest, towards Lake Kuolemanjärvi, and southeast, along the railroad. The Soviet defences at main road at Summa held, but Finns encircled these defences by breaching the defences at Munasuo. The defending remains of Soviet 123.D managed to hold Finnish advance only few places and and continued withdrawing towards Leningrad. At the morning of August 30 12.D cut Koivisto-Leningrad railroad at Kuolemanjärvi and reached the Gulf of Finland during the same day. Also at Vammelsuu 12.D cut the railroad at the same evening, but failed to cut main road. The Gulf was reached also here next morning, and the attack continued east to Terijoki, which was captured August 31 and reached old border at River Rajajoki next day. The encircled Soviet forces at Koivisto retreated to the islands and Soviet fleet transferred them to Leningrad. Last defenders of Koivisto were evacuated November 1.

At the left side of 12.D from August 23 the 18.D started attacking southeast between Lake Muolaanjärvi and Vuoksi. By August 26 the first lake isthmuses were breached. Meanwhile first units of 2.D were relieving the forces of the 18.D from isthmus between Lake Kirkkojärvi and Lake Punnusjärvi and 10.D those from Lake Punnusjärvi to River Vuoksi. After the mottis at the northwestern shores of Lake Ladoga had been cleared, I Corps was moved to River Vuoksi where it took 10.D and 15.D to its command. The 18.D breached the second lake isthmuses August 27 and rested one day before continuing attack towards Kivennapa road crossing which it captured August 29. The attack continued towards old border which was reached August 31. Also the 2.D reached the old border at August 31. The 10.D had more troubles as Soviet 198.D had started its counterattack August 29. The Finnish attack started to gain speed during August 30, and also 15.D joined the attack from the other side of the River Vuoksi. Valkjärvi railroad endpoint was captured at August 31 and because of the threat of encirclement, the Soviet forces were ordered to withdraw from the souther side of River Vuoksi behind the old border. 15.D followed retreating Soviets closely and by September 2 old border had been reached everywhere.

At August 20, General W. Erfurth notified Mannerheim, that Field Marshall W. Keitel will send a letter where Finns were asked to attack Leningrad. Mannerheim explained practical difficulties to the proposal and presented the opposition of both political and military leadership to the issue. The government had decided beforehand, that Finland will not attack Leningrad, and only after the pressure of military leadership they accepted small advance across the old border to capture better defensive positions. Especially social democrats opposed crossing the border. When Keitel's letter came, Ryti and Mannerheim prepared negative answer together. At August 31 Erfurth contacted Mannerheim again and proposed that Finns should cancel the attack to East Karelia and instead attack Leningrad. Ryti and Mannerheim provided refusal again. At August 31 Mannerheim gave order, that attack will be stopped at the mouth of River Rajajoki-Ohta-line. The exact line between Ohta and Lake Ladoga would be ordered later, when Finns had reached the old border there. That would shorten the frontline without the need to attack Soviet fortifications north of Leningrad ([[KaUR]]). At this last phase Soviets had six infantry divisions and number of separate batallions and regiments defending Leningrad from the north, but all of them were half strength due to hard fighting with Finns. 

12.D had reached the target already at September 1, but elsewhere attack started at September 2. 18.D captured Mainila at the same day and Valkeasaari at next day. By September 7 both 18.D and 2.D had reached their targets between River Rajajoki and Ohta. The commander of I Corps, Colonel Mäkinen, ordered his troops to advance to the line Ohta-Lake Lempaalanjärvi-Old border at Lake Ladoga with an addition, that if strong defences were met, the offensive could be stopped there. At September 4 the attack begun, and at September 6 10.D managed to encircle and destroy Soviet IR941 at Kirjasalo. Finally at September 9 the ordered line was reached everywhere and Finnish forces moved to defensive.

=== Occupation of East Karelia ===
=== Advancement from Northern Finland ===
=== Political development ===
On [[July 10]], the Finnish army began a major offensive on the [[Karelian Isthmus]] and north of [[Lake Ladoga]]. Mannerheim's order of the day, the [[Sword scabbard declaration]], clearly states that the Finnish involvement was an offensive one.[http://www.mannerheim.fi/10_ylip/e_mtuppi.htm] By the end of August 1941, Finnish troops had reached the pre-war boundaries. The crossing of the pre-war borders led to tensions in the army, the cabinet, the parties of the parliament, and domestic opinion. Military expansionism might have gained popularity, but it was far from unanimously championed.

Also, international relations were strained &amp;mdash; notably with Britain and Sweden, whose governments in May and June had learned in confidence from Foreign Minister [[Witting]] that Finland had absolutely no plans for a military campaign coordinated with the Germans. Finland's preparations were said to be purely defensive.

Sweden's leading cabinet members had hoped to improve the relations with Nazi Germany through indirect support of Operation Barbarossa, mainly channelled through Finland. [[Per Albin Hansson|Prime Minister Hansson]] and [[Christian Günther|Foreign Minister Günther]] found however, that the political support in the [[National Unity Government]] and within the Social Democratic organizations turned out to be insufficient, particularly after Mannerheim's Sword Scabbard Declaration, and even more so after Finland within less than two months undeniably had begun a [[war of conquest]]. A tangible effect was that Finland became still more dependent on food and munitions from Germany.

The [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] put Finland under blockade and the British ambassador was withdrawn. On [[July 31]], [[1941]], British [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] made an air raid on the northern Finnish port of [[Petsamo]] [http://www.fleetairarmarchive.net/RollofHonour/Battlehonour_crewlists/Petsamo_Kirkenes_1941.html]. Damages were limited since the harbour was almost empty of ships. 

[[September 11]], the U.S. ambassador Arthur Schoenfeld was informed that the offensive on the Karelian Isthmus was halted on the pre-Winter War border (with a few straightened curves at the municipalities of Valkeasaari and Kirjasalo), and that &quot;under no conditions&quot; Finland would participate in an offensive against [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], but would instead maintain static defence and wait for a political resolution. Witting stressed to Schoenfeld that Germany, however, should not hear of this.

On [[September 22]], a British note was presented (by Norway's ambassador Michelet) demanding the expulsion of German troops from Finland's territory and Finland's withdrawal from [[East Karelia]] to positions behind the pre-Winter War borders. Finland was threatened by a British declaration of war unless the demands were met. The declaration of war was exacted on Finland's Independence Day, [[December 6]]. 

In December 1941, the Finnish advance had reached [[River Svir]] (which connects the southern ends of [[Lake Ladoga]] and [[Lake Onega]] and marks the southern border of [[East Karelia]]). By the end of 1941, the front stabilized, and the Finns did not conduct major offensive operations for the following two and a half years. The fighting morale of the troops declined when it was realized that the war would not soon end.

It has been suggested that the execution of the prominent [[pacifism|pacifist]] leader [[Arndt Pekurinen]] in November 1941 was due to fear of army demoralization being exacerbated by such activism.

== International volunteers and support ==
Like in the [[Winter War]], Swedish volunteers were recruited. Until December, for guarding the Soviet naval base at [[Hanko]], that was then evacuated by sea, and the Swedish unit was officially disbanded. During the Continuation War, the volunteers signed for three&amp;ndash;six months of service. In all, over 1,600 fought for Finland, though only about 60 remained by the summer of 1944. About a third of the volunteers had been engaged already in the Winter War. Another significant group, about a fourth of the men, were Swedish officers on leave. 

There was also a ''[[Schutzstaffel|SS]]''-battalion of volunteers on the northern Finnish front 1942&amp;ndash;1944, that was recruited from [[Norway]], then under German occupation, and similarly some Danes.

About 3,400 Estonian volunteers also took part of the Continuation War.

== Diplomatic manoeuvres ==
Operation Barbarossa was planned as a ''[[blitzkrieg]]'' lasting a few weeks. British and US observers believed that the invasion would be concluded before August. In the autumn of 1941, this turned out to be wrong, and leading Finnish military officers started to mistrust Germany's capacity. German troops in Northern Finland faced circumstances they were not properly prepared for, and failed badly to reach their targets, most importantly [[Murmansk]]. Finland's strategy now changed. A separate peace with the Soviet Union was offered, but Germany's strength was too great. The idea that Finland had to continue the war while putting its own forces at the least possible danger gained increasing support, perhaps in the hopes that the Wehrmacht and the Red Army would wear each other down enough for negotiations to begin, or to at least get them out of the way of Finland's independent decisions. Some may also have still hoped for an eventual victory by Germany.

Finland's participation in the war brought major benefits to Nazi Germany. The Soviet fleet was blockaded in the [[Gulf of Finland]], so that the Baltic was freed for the training of German submarine crews as well as for German shipping, especially for the transport of the vital [[Swedish iron ore during World War II|iron ore from northern Sweden]], and [[Nickel deposits of Finland|nickel and rare metals]] needed in steel processing from the Petsamo area. The Finnish front secured the northern flank of the German [[Army Group North]] in the Baltic states. The sixteen Finnish divisions tied down numerous Soviet troops, put pressure on [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] &amp;mdash; although Mannerheim refused to attack &amp;mdash; and threatened the Murmansk Railroad. Additionally, Sweden was further isolated and was increasingly pressured to comply with German and Finnish wishes, though with limited success.

Despite Finland's contributions to the German cause, the Western Allies had ambivalent feelings, torn between residual goodwill for Finland and the need to accommodate their vital ally, the Soviet Union. As a result, Britain declared war against Finland, but the United States did not. There was no combat between these countries and Finland, but Finnish sailors were interned overseas. In the United States, Finland was highly regarded, partly due to having continued to make payments on its World War I debt faithfully throughout the [[interbellum|inter-war period]].

The Allies often characterize Finland as one of the Axis Powers, although the term used in Finland is &quot;[[co-belligerence]] with Germany&quot;. Finland later also earned respect in the West for the strength of its democracy and its refusal to allow extension of Nazi [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] practices in Finland. Finnish Jews served in the Finnish army, and Jews were not only tolerated in Finland[http://www.finemb.org.il/Historia.htm], but most Jewish refugees were granted asylum (only 8 of the more than 500 refugees were handed over to the Nazis). The field [[synagogue]] in [[Eastern Karelia]] was probably unique on the Axis side during the war. However, in the few cases Jewish officers from Finland's defence forces were awarded the German [[Iron Cross]], they declined. 

About 2,600&amp;ndash;2,800 Soviet prisoners of war were handed over to the Germans. Most of them (around 2,000) joined the [[Russian Liberation Army]]. The rest were mainly army officers and [[Political officer|political officers]] (and a handful of Jewish refugees), most of them dying in Nazi [[concentration camps]], while some were given to the [[Gestapo]] for interrogation. Sometimes these handovers were demanded in return of arms or food, and sometimes the Finns received Soviet prisoners of war in return. These were mainly Estonians and Karelians willing to join the Finnish army. These, as well as some volunteers from the occupied Eastern Karelia, formed the Kin Battalion (Finnish: ''&quot;Heimopataljoona&quot;''). At the end of the war, the USSR required that the members of the Tribe Battalion were to be handed over to the Soviet Union. Some managed to escape before or during the transport, but most of them were either sent to the [[Gulag]] camps or executed.

In 1941, even before the Continuation War, one battalion of Finnish volunteers joined the German [[Waffen-SS]] with silent approval of the Finnish government. It has been concluded that the battalion served as a token of Finnish commitment to cooperation with Nazi Germany. This battalion, named the ''[[Finnisches Freiwilligen Bataillon]]'' fought as part of [[SS Division Wiking|SS Division ''Wiking'']] in the [[Ukraine]] and [[Caucasus]]. The battalion was pulled back from the front in May 1943 and was transported to [[Tallinn]] where it was disbanded on [[July 11]]. The soldiers were then transferred into different units of the Finnish army.

== The end of the war ==
[[Image:Finnish areas ceded in 1944.png|thumb|300px|right|Areas ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union]]
Finland began to actively seek a way out of the war after the disastrous German defeat at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] in January&amp;ndash;February [[1943]]. [[Edwin Linkomies]] formed a new cabinet with the peace process as the top priority. Negotiations were conducted intermittently in 1943&amp;ndash;44 between Finland and its representative [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi]] on the one side, and the Western Allies and the Soviet Union on the other, but no agreement was reached.

Instead, on [[June 9]], [[1944]], the Soviet Union opened a major offensive against Finnish positions on the Karelian Isthmus and in the Lake Ladoga area (it was timed to accompany [[D-Day]]). On the second day of the offensive, the Soviet forces broke through the Finnish lines, and in the succeeding days they made advances that appeared to threaten the survival of Finland. Soviet troops occupied [[Petrozavodsk]] on [[June 28]] [[1944]]. Before they retreated, Finns delivered food to people for two weeks. This is rare or even unequaled act in the war history.

Finland especially lacked modern anti-tank weaponry, which could stop heavy Soviet tanks, and German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] offered them in exchange for a guarantee that Finland would not again seek a separate peace. On [[June 26]] President [[Risto Ryti]] gave [[Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement|this guarantee as a personal undertaking]], which he intended to last for the remainder of his presidency. In addition to material deliveries, Hitler sent some assault gun brigades and a [[Luftwaffe]] fighter-bomber unit to temporarily support the most threatened defence sectors. 

With new supplies from Germany, the Finns were now equal to the crisis, and halted the Russians in early July 1944, after a retreat of about one hundred kilometres that brought them to approximately the same line of defence they had held at the end of Winter War, the VKT-line (for ''&quot;Viipuri&amp;ndash;Kuparsaari&amp;ndash;Taipale&quot;'' running from Vyborg to [[River Vuoksi]], and along the river to Lake Ladoga at [[Taipale]]), where the Soviet offensive was stopped in the [[Battle of Tali-Ihantala]], in spite of nearly a third of their military machine being concentrated against the Finns. Finland had already become a sideshow for the Soviet leadership, who now turned their attention to Poland and southeastern Europe. The Allies had already succeeded in their landing in France and were pushing towards Germany, and the Soviet leadership did not want to give them a free hand in Central Europe. Although the Finnish front was once again stabilized, the Finns were exhausted and wanted to get out of the war.

Mannerheim had repeatedly reminded the Germans that in case their troops in Estonia retreated, Finland would be forced to make peace even at very unfavourable terms. Soviet-occupied Estonia would have provided the enemy a favourable base for amphibious invasions and air attacks against Helsinki and other cities, and would have strangled Finnish access to the sea. When the Germans indeed withdrew, the Finnish desire to end the war increased. Perhaps realizing the validity of this point, initial German reaction to Finland's announcement of ambitions for a separate peace was limited to only verbal opposition.

President Ryti resigned, and Finland's military leader and national hero, [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]], was extraordinarily appointed president by the parliament, accepting responsibility for ending the war.

On [[September 4]] the cease-fire ended military actions on the Finnish side. The Soviet Union ended hostilities exactly 24 hours after the Finns. An [[armistice]] was signed in Moscow on [[September 19]] between the Soviet Union and Finland. Finland had to make many limiting concessions: the Soviet Union regained the borders of 1940, with the addition of the [[Petsamo]] area; the [[Porkkala]] Peninsula (adjacent to Finland's capital [[Helsinki]]) was leased to the USSR as a naval base for fifty years (but returned in [[1956]]), and transit rights were granted; Finland's army was to demobilize in haste, and Finland was required to expel all German troops from its territory.  As the Germans refused to leave Finland voluntarily, the Finns had no choice but to fight their former supporters in the [[Lapland War]].

==Conclusion==
In retrospect the Continuation War can be seen as the result of a series of political miscalculations by the Finnish leadership in which Finland's martial abilities clearly outshone her diplomatic skills. However, many commentators also hold that Finland was a victim of bad luck in addition to any failings on its own part, being forced to make a choice in a situation when any of the available alternatives would result in being attacked by either side. It has been claimed that not joining the war with Germany against Soviet Union would almost certainly have lead to occupation attempts by either side of that great conflict, and thus Finland's involvement anyway.

It is also claimed that after the fall of the Soviet Union, it has become clear that Finland, maybe more by luck than by skill, happened to make the right choice after the Winter War by fervently seeking to reverse the German disinterest. This claim rests on the idea that Soviet occupation, and a fate surely worse than that of the other [[Border States]], would otherwise have been unavoidable.

The aged Field Marshal Mannerheim might have been responsible for a couple of misjudgements, for instance the [[Sword scabbard declaration]] in the Order of the Day of July 10, 1941, but at the end of the war he had earned a remarkable reputation among former foes and allies, in Finland as well as abroad, which to a considerable degree eased Finland's extrication from a potentially disastrous undertaking.

In any event, Finland's fate was no worse than any other country struck by the World War &amp;mdash; quite the contrary. Only 2,000 Finnish civilians were killed during World War II, and only relatively narrow border regions had been conquered by force. For nearly three years until [[June 20]], [[1944]], when Vyborg fell, not one major Finnish town was besieged or occupied. During the war there were three capital cities of belligerent European countries that were not occupied by force at some stage: [[London]], [[Moscow]] and [[Helsinki]]. Ultimately, Finland was successful in retaining independence, [[parliamentary democracy]] and [[market economy]].

After the war, Finland preserved her independence while adjusting [[Foreign relations of Finland|her foreign policy]] to avoid offence to the USSR, now the world's second [[superpower]], a concession which the Soviet government reciprocated by surrendering part of its gains from the postwar settlement and refraining from too obvious intrusions in Finland's domestic affairs. Finland also signed a pact of co-operation and mutual assistance that guaranteed that in the event of a war between the western powers and the Soviet Union, Finland would defend her territory and airspace against the western powers. To [[Moscow]], an independent Finland linked to her by a cooperation treaty was seemingly a price worth paying for keeping Sweden formally neutral in the [[Cold War]], a ''quid pro quo'' that for forty years safeguarded wider Soviet strategic interests in the region.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Several related results in [[number theory]] and [[abstract algebra]] are known under the name '''''Chinese remainder theorem'''''.

== Simultaneous congruences of integers ==

The original form of the theorem, contained in a [[third-century]] book by [[China|Chinese]] mathematician [[Sun Tzu (mathematician)|Sun Tzu]] and later republished in a [[1247]] book by [[Qin Jiushao]], is a statement about simultaneous congruences (see [[modular arithmetic]]). Suppose ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[integer|integers]] which are pairwise [[coprime]] (meaning [[greatest common divisor|gcd]]
(''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1 whenever ''i'' &amp;ne; ''j''). Then, for any given integers ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, there exists an integer ''x'' solving the system of simultaneous congruences

:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a_i \pmod{n_i} \quad\mathrm{for}\; i = 1, \ldots, k.&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, all solutions ''x'' to this system are congruent modulo the product ''n'' = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.

A solution ''x'' can be found as follows. For each ''i'' the integers ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''n''/''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are coprime, and using the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]] we can find integers ''r'' and ''s'' such that ''r n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''s'' ''n''/''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1. If we set ''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''s'' ''n''/''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', then we have

:&lt;math&gt;e_i \equiv 1 \pmod{n_i} \quad\mathrm{and}\quad
e_i \equiv 0 \pmod{n_j}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''j'' &amp;ne; ''i''.

One solution to the system of simultaneous congruences is therefore

:&lt;math&gt; x = \sum_{i=1}^k a_i e_i.\ &lt;/math&gt;

For example, consider the problem of finding an integer ''x'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv 2 \pmod{3}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv 3 \pmod{4}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv 2 \pmod{5}. &lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]] for 3 and 4&amp;times;5 = 20, we find (-13) &amp;times; 3 + 2 &amp;times; 20 = 1, i.e. ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 40. Using the Euclidean algorithm for 4 and 3&amp;times;5 = 15, we get (-11) &amp;times; 4 + 3 &amp;times; 15 = 1. Hence, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 45. Finally, using the Euclidean algorithm for 5 and 3&amp;times;4 = 12, we get 5 &amp;times; 5 + (-2) &amp;times; 12 = 1, meaning ''e''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = -24. A solution ''x'' is therefore 2 &amp;times; 40 + 3 &amp;times; 45 + 2 &amp;times; (-24) = 167. All other solutions are congruent to 167 modulo 60, which means that they are all congruent to 47 modulo 60.

Sometimes, the simultaneous congruences can be solved even if the &lt;i&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;'s are not pairwise coprime. The precise criterion is as follows: a solution ''x'' exists if and only if ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' &amp;equiv; ''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' ('''mod''' gcd(''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''n&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'')) for all ''i'' and ''j''. All solutions ''x'' are congruent modulo the [[least common multiple]] of the ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The [[method of successive substitution]] can often yield solutions to simultaneous congruences, even when the moduli are not pairwise coprime.

== Statement for principal ideal domains ==

For a [[principal ideal domain]] ''R'' the Chinese remainder theorem takes the following form: If ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''u&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' are elements of ''R'' which are pairwise coprime, and ''u'' denotes the product ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''u&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', then the [[quotient ring]] ''R/uR'' and the [[product of rings|product ring]] ''R/u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' x ... x ''R/u&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;R'' are isomorphic via the [[ring homomorphism|isomorphism]]

:&lt;math&gt;f : R/uR \rightarrow R/u_1R \times \cdots \times
R/u_k R &lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt;f(x +uR) = (x + u_1R, \ldots , x +u_kR) \quad\mbox{ for every } x\in R. &lt;/math&gt;

The inverse isomorphism can be constructed as follows. For each ''i'', the elements ''u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''u/u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are coprime, and therefore there exist elements ''r'' and ''s'' in ''R'' with

:&lt;math&gt;r u_i + s u/u_i = 1. &lt;/math&gt;

Set ''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''s u/u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. Then the inverse of ''f'' is the map

:&lt;math&gt;g : R/u_1R \times \cdots \times R/u_kR
\rightarrow R/uR &lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt;g(a_1+u_1R,\ldots ,a_k+u_kR)=
\left( \sum_{i=1}^k a_i e_i \right) + uR \quad\mbox{ for all }a_1,\ldots,a_k\in R. &lt;/math&gt;

Note that this statement is a straightforward generalization of the above theorem about integer congruences: the ring '''Z''' of [[integer]]s is a principal ideal domain, the [[surjective|surjectivity]] of the map ''f'' shows that every system of congruences of the form
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a_i \pmod{u_i} \quad\mathrm{for}\; i = 1, \ldots, k&lt;/math&gt;
can be solved for ''x'', and the [[injective|injectivity]] of the map ''f'' shows that all the solutions ''x'' are congruent modulo ''u''.

== Statement for general rings ==

The general form of the Chinese remainder theorem, which implies all the statements given above, can be formulated for [[ring (algebra)|rings]] and (two-sided) [[ring ideal|ideals]]. If ''R'' is a ring and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''I&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' are two-sided ideals of ''R'' which are pairwise [[coprime]] (meaning that ''I&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''I&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''R'' whenever ''i'' &amp;ne; ''j''), then the product ''I'' of these ideals is equal to their intersection, and the [[quotient ring]] ''R/I'' is isomorphic to the [[product of rings|product ring]] ''R''/''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; x ''R''/''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; x ... x ''R''/''I''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; via the [[ring homomorphism|isomorphism]]

:&lt;math&gt;f : R/I \rightarrow R/I_1 \times \cdots \times R/I_k &lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt;f(x + I) = (x +I_1, \ldots , x+I_k) \quad\mbox{ for all } x\in R.&lt;/math&gt;

== Applications ==
In the [[RSA|RSA algorithm]] calculations are made modulo &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a product of two primes &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. Common sizes for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are 1024, 2048 or 4096 [[bit]]s, making calculations very time-consuming. Using Chinese remaindering these calculations can be transported from the ring &lt;math&gt;\Bbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; to the ring &lt;math&gt;\Bbb{Z}_p \times \Bbb{Z}_q&lt;/math&gt;. The sum of the bit sizes of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the bit size of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, making &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; considerably smaller than &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. This greatly simplifies calculations.

Another potential application of Chinese remainder theorem is for counting soldiers in an army. Via Chinese remainder theorem, the general has the soldiers quickly line up in groups of 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on and counts the remaining soldiers that can't make complete groups.  After enough of these tests are made, the general can quickly calculate how many soldiers he has exactly; thus he has done a 3 hour headcount in all of 2 minutes. This fact, that a large number can be represented by a  small number of relatively small remainders, is also the core idea of [[residue number system]]s.

The '''CH-46D Sea Knight''' [[helicopter]] is a medium lift assault helicopter, used by the [[United States Navy]] for shipboard delivery of cargo, personnel, and search &amp; rescue. The '''CH-46E''' is used by the [[United States Marine Corps]] to provide all-weather, day-or-night assault transport of combat troops, supplies and equipment. Assault Support is its primary function, and the movement of supplies and equipment is secondary. Additional tasks may be assigned, such as combat support, search and rescue, support for forward refueling and rearming points, aeromedic evacuation of casualties from the field, and recovery of [[aircraft]] and personnel.

The CH-46 Sea Knight was first procured in [[1960]] under the old designation of '''HRB-1''' to meet the medium-lift requirements of the [[United States Marine Corps]] in all combat and peacetime environments since that time. The final production version was the CH-46F. In all, 524 H-46s were produced for the Navy and Marine Corps. The last Sea Knight rolled off the assembly line in February of 1971.  The fleet is currently being maintained until a suitable replacement is approved.

On [[September 24]], [[2004]] the USN retired the type, seeing it replaced by the [[SH-60 Seahawk|MH-60 Knighthawk]]. The USMC is replacing its CH-46's with the [[V-22 Osprey]]. The first V-22 squadron, HMM-263, will be stood up in March of 2006 and renamed VMM-263.  The replacement process is expected to continue through the other medium helicopter squadrons, into 2014.

The '''Chief of Naval Operations''' ('''CNO''') is the senior military officer in the [[United States Navy]]. The CNO is an [[admiral]] (four-star) and is responsible to the [[Secretary of the Navy]] for the command, utilization of resources and operating efficiency of the operating forces of the Navy and of the Navy shore activities assigned by the Secretary. The CNO has administrative, rather than operational command authority over United States naval forces. The operational [[chain of command]] runs from the [[Secretary of Defense]] directly to the [[combatant commanders]], who have command authority over all military forces in their region.  This structure, in which the service chiefs are responsible for personnel and readiness issues, while the combatant commanders are operationally responsible for the command of the military forces, is intended to allow the United States military the ability to function as a coherent whole.

A member of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], the CNO is the principal naval advisor to the [[President of the United States]], the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the Navy on the conduct of war, and is the principal advisor and naval executive to the Secretary on the conduct of naval activities of the [[United States Department of the Navy]]. Assistants are the [[Vice Chief of Naval Operations]] (VCNO), the [[Deputy Chiefs of Naval Operations]] (DCNOs) and a number of other ranking officers. These officers and their staffs are collectively known as the [[Office of the Chief of Naval Operations]] (OpNav).

'''Clara Petacci''' ('''Claretta Petacci''') ([[February 28]], [[1912]] &amp;ndash; [[April 28]], [[1945]]) was a young [[Rome|Roman]] girl from an upper-class family who became [[Benito Mussolini]]'s mistress. She was twenty-nine years his junior.

During Mussolini's capture by partisans in April [[1945]] it is said that Petacci was offered the opportunity to escape, but she firmly refused and instead tried to protect Mussolini with her body. The Duce was then shot immediately after her. On the following day, [[April 29]], [[1945]], at the Piazzale Loreto in [[Milan]], Mussolini and Petacci's bodies, along with four others, were hanged upside down at an Esso gas station and photographed as a crowd vented their rage upon them.

Petacci is apparently respectfully considered in Italy; without reference to politics, but only as a woman in love who did not abandon him in times of trouble.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Costa Smeralda''' (&quot;Emerald Coast&quot;) is a [[coast]]al area in northern [[Sardinia]], 55 km long and covering more than 30&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2;, with enchanting [[beach]]es and a system of villages built according to an extremely detailed [[urban planning|urban plan]]. The area is a luxurious exclusive [[tourism|tourist]] destination, with high affluence of European and Arabian VIPs from the entertainment, politics and industry.  

The main towns and villages in the area are [[Arzachena]], [[Olbia]], [[Porto Cervo]], [[Liscia di Vacca]], [[Capriccioli]] and [[Romazzino]].

Annually in [[September]] the ''Sardinia Cup'' [[sailing]] [[regatta]] is held off the coast, usually featuring famous boats.

[[archaeology|Achaeological]] sites include Li Muri, Nuragici People's &quot;Tomba dei Giganti&quot; (Giants' Tomb).

The development of the area started in [[1961]], and was financed by a consortium of companies. The president of the consortium and representative figure was Prince [[Aga Khan IV|Karim Aga Khan]]. Famous [[architect]]s involved in the project included Busiri-Vici and Vietti.

'''Chianti''' is [[Italy]]'s most famous red [[wine]]. It used to be easily identified by its squat [[bottle]] enclosed in a straw basket, called ''[[fiasco]]'' (&quot;flask&quot;).

It is produced in [[Tuscany]], in strictly delimited areas among the provinces of [[Province of Florence|Florence]], [[Province of Siena|Siena]], [[Province of Arezzo|Arezzo]] and [[Province of Grosseto|Grosseto]].  It is based mainly on [[Sangiovese]] grapes but also includes other [[List of grape varieties|varieties]]. Chianti is a [[Denominazione di Origine Controllata|DOC]], but corresponds to a much larger area than the region originally known as Chianti. Wine from this smaller region is labeled Chianti Classico and is a [[DOCG]]. It typically has a picture of a black rooster (known in Italian as a ''gallo nero'') on the neck of the [[bottle]]. Chianti Classico that meets slightly more stringent requirements, primarily with respect to aging, may be labelled Chianti Classico Riserva.

Chianti is not the only traditional wine made in Tuscany, and there are also new wines, usually based on sangiovese and some popular french grape that are usually dubbed &quot;[[Super Tuscan|Super Tuscans]]&quot;.

The word &quot;Chianti&quot; is used rather more loosely in the United States, to the chagrin of European wine-makers.

== Chianti Classico region ==

The region consists of five main communities

*Greve in Chianti
**Montefioralle
**Convertoie
**Montegonzi
**Canonica
**Castello di Uzzano
**Castello di Verrazano
*Radda in Chianti
**Volpaia
*Castellina in Chianti
*San Casciano Val di Pesa
**Mercatale Val di Pesa
**Faltignano
**Campoli
*Gaiole in Chianti
**Castello di Brolio

==Trivia==
The wine had a famous mention in a popular film ''[[Silence of the Lambs]]'' in the [[catchphrase]] &quot;I ate his liver with some [[fava bean]]s and a nice Chianti.&quot;

[[Image:Low pressure system over Iceland.jpg|thumb|right|This [[low pressure system]] over Iceland spins counter-clockwise due to the Coriolis effect.]]

The '''Coriolis effect''' is an apparent deflection of a moving object in a [[rotating frame of reference]]. There are examples of this effect in everyday life, such as the direction of [[Cyclone#Structure|rotation of cyclones]]. Due to the effect, cyclones rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. However, contrary to popular opinion, it has no noticeable effect on the rotation of water in sinks and [[toilets]] - see the [[#Draining_bathtubs/toilets|toilets/bathtubs section]] below.
The effect is named after [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]], a French scientist, who described it in 1835, though the mathematics appeared in the tidal equations of [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] in 1778.

== Formula ==

The formula for the Coriolis acceleration is

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}=-2\boldsymbol\omega\times\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

where (here and below) &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the particle in the rotating system, and '''&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega&lt;/math&gt;''' is the angular velocity vector (which has magnitude equal to the rotation rate and points in the direction of the axis of rotation) of the rotating system. The equation may be multiplied by the mass of the relevant object to produce the Coriolis force. See [[Fictitious force]] for a derivation.

Note that this is [[cross product|vector multiplication]].  In non-vector terms: at a given rate of rotation of the observer, the magnitude of the Coriolis acceleration of the object will be proportional to the velocity of the object and also to the sine of the angle between the direction of movement of the object and the axis of rotation.

The ''Coriolis effect'' is the behavior added by the ''Coriolis acceleration''. The formula implies that the Coriolis acceleration is perpendicular both to the direction of the velocity of the moving mass and to the  rotation axis. So in particular:
* if the velocity (as always, in the rotating system) is zero, the Coriolis acceleration is zero
* if the velocity is parallel to the rotation axis, the Coriolis acceleration is zero
* if the velocity is straight (perpendicularly) inward to the axis, the acceleration will follow the direction of rotation
* if the velocity is following the rotation, the acceleration will be (perpendicularly) outward from the axis 

In the formula above, the vectors are 3-d. If we are considering the simpler case of motion restricted to the surface of a rotating turntable the equation simplifies somewhat to:

: &lt;math&gt;-2\omega \boldsymbol k\times (u,v)&lt;/math&gt;

where '''k''' is a unit local vertical and &lt;math&gt;(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity 2-d vector in the plane of the turntable. &lt;math&gt;-2\omega \boldsymbol k\times (u,v)&lt;/math&gt; is perpendicular to '''v''', and the equation may be re-written:

:  &lt;math&gt;-2\omega (u,-v)&lt;/math&gt;

When considering atmospheric dynamics, the Coriolis acceleration (strictly a 3-d vector in the first formula above) appears only in the horizontal equations, due to the neglect of products of small quantities and other approximations. The term that appears is then

: &lt;math&gt;- f \mathbf{k} \times (u,v)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where '''k''' is a unit local vertical, &lt;math&gt;f = 2 \omega \sin(\mbox{latitude})&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''Coriolis parameter'' and &lt;math&gt;(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; are the horizontal components of the velocity.

===What the Coriolis force is not===
* The Coriolis force does not depend on the curvature of the Earth, simply its rotation.  However, the strength of the Coriolis force varies with latitude, and that ''is'' due to the Earth being a sphere.
* Coriolis force is not the [[fictitious force|fictitious]] [[Centrifugal force]] given by &lt;math&gt;\omega\times(\omega\times\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;.  However, the co-existence of Coriolis and centrifugal forces makes simple explanations of the effect of Coriolis in isolation difficult.

== Visualisation of the Coriolis effect ==

[[Image:DSCN8987 orangeparabola e.jpg|frame|right|A fluid assuming a parabolic shape as it is rotating]]

To demonstrate the Coriolis effect, a parabolic [[turntable]] can be used. On a flat turntable the centrifugal force, which always acts outwards from the rotation axis, would lead to objects being forced out off the edge. But if the surface of the turntable has the correct parabolic bowl shape, and is rotated at the correct rate, then the component of gravity tangential to the bowl surface will exactly balance the centrifugal force. This allows the Coriolis force to be displayed in isolation.

Discs cut from cylinders of [[dry ice]] can be used as pucks, moving around almost frictionlessly over the surface of the parabolic turntable, allowing effects of Coriolis on dynamic phenomena to show themselves. To get a view of the motions as seen from a rotating point of view, a video-camera is attached to the turntable in such a way that the camera is co-rotating with the turntable.

When the fluid is rotating on a flat turntable, the surface of the fluid naturally assumes the correct [[parabola|parabolic]] shape.  This fact may be exploited in order to make a parabolic turntable, by using a fluid that sets after several hours, such as a synthetic [[resin]].

== Coriolis in Meteorology ==
Perhaps the most important instance of the  Coriolis effect is in the large scale dynamics of the oceans and the atmosphere.  In meteorology, Coriolis effects tend to dominate centrifugal effects, because the latter is usually balanced by an ambient pressure gradient (exactly analogously to the slope on a parabolic turntable).

=== Flow around a low-pressure area ===

[[image:Coriolis_effect10.png|frame|right|Schematic representation of flow around a low-pressure area in the Northern hemisphere. The pressure gradient force is represented by blue arrows, the Coriolis acceleration (always perpendicular to the velocity) by red arrows]]

If a low pressure area forms in the atmosphere, air will tend to flow in towards it, but will be deflected perpendicular to its velocity by the Coriolis acceleration. A system of equilibrium can then establish itself creating circular movement, or a cyclonic flow. 

The force balance is largely between the [[pressure gradient force]] acting towards the low-pressure area and the Coriolis acceleration acting away from the center of the low pressure. Instead of flowing down the gradient, the air tends to flow perpendicular to the air-pressure gradient and forms a cyclonic flow.

The '''military of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]''' is currently in the rebuilding process after the [[Second Congo War]] officially ended in July 2003. [[Rwandan]]- and [[Ugandan]]-created [[militia]]s have hampered the formation of the new national army by their refusal to disband. The military is one of the most unstable in the region after years of war and underfunding. It is prone to defections. The government in [[Kinshasa]] and the [[U.N.]] are attempting to create a viable force with the ability to perform all tasks it is entrusted with, the most important being bringing stability and security to the nation.  

There are currently over 16,000 United Nations peacekeepers based in Congo to assist Congolese authorities in maintaining security. In recent events the military has made it clear to [[Rwanda]] and [[Uganda]] they will defend their borders from any future incursions by either nation, which could further strain attempts to rebuild the nation's already battered security structure. 
==Organization==
The current organization of the Congo's military establishment is very vague owing to lack of information; it has been made more difficult because of the current reforms being undertaken by the Congo security forces.  
It is known to be broken up into the Army, Navy and Air Force; however, no official names seem to be available owing to the reform process.
==Resources==
A key issue for the Congo's military is the lack of resources. The lack of money restricts the capabilities by not allowing the proper training, payment and weapons to be given to the military. It has been an ongoing issue ever since the [[U.S.]] and most of its allies cut support for the government of [[Mobutu]] at the end of [[Cold War]] and the increasing amount of human rights abuses carried out by his security forces. Although the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] maintains vast natural resources its economy has been torn apart by conflict and corruption. The infrastructure has been widely destroyed, thereby restricting the mobility and logistical ability of any new Congolese national military establishment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most [[Denmark|Danes]] today trace their heritage to a Germanic people who have inhabited Denmark since prehistoric times.  However, with immigration in recent into the country from various parts of the world, the Danish population has become increasingly heterogeneous. [[Danish language|Danish]] is the principal language of [[Denmark]].

During the [[Völkerwanderung]] migrations (times of [[Huns]] and later [[Slavs]] and [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] onslaughts into [[Magna Germania]]), Danes came onto the peninsula of [[Jutland]]. They were repelled by native Juetlanders, Friesians and other native Germanic tribes. Danish attackers left many ships, on which they came, stuck in the moors, which can still be found today. In time the [[Franks|Frankish]]/German emperors married off the Jutland chief's daughters to Danes, thus making them part of the empire as kings.

A small German-speaking minority lives in southern part of Denmark on Jutland, more exactly in northern Sleswig. [[Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig and Holstein]] dukes were for a long time under the Holy Roman Empire also the kings of Denmark. The dukes of Schleswig/Holstein were to also be kings of Denmark, but it was to always remain separate. Despite this the northern part of Schleswig near Tondern was cut off and &quot;given&quot; to Denmark after the first world war at [[Versailles]]. Today most people in border regions of Europe speak both languages.

A mostly [[Inuit]] population inhabits [[Greenland]]; and the [[Faroe Islands]] have a Nordic population with its own language. Education is compulsory from ages seven to 18 and is free through the university level.

The Evangelical Lutheran Church (''Den danske folkekirke'') is state-supported and, according to statistics from January 2002, accounts for about 84.3% of Denmark's religious affiliation. Denmark has religious freedom, however, and other religions exist, both Protestant denominations and other.  The office of the Minister of Religion (''Kirkeministeren'') recognizes 12 different religions for tax and legal purposes; in addition it acknowledges a number of other religious groups for the purpose of conducting wedding ceremonies.

[[Ansgar]] was in [[835]] designated archbishop over the North and East. His bishopric [[Hamburg-Bremen]] remained so until Lund was designed to take on their own archbishopric in [[1103]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Denmark]]'s industrialized market economy depends on imported raw materials and foreign trade. Within the [[European Union]], Denmark advocates a liberal trade policy. Its standard of living is among the highest in the world, and the Danes devote 0,7% of GDP to foreign aid.

Denmark is self-sufficient in energy - producing oil, natural gas and wind-energy. Its principal exports are machinery, instruments and food products. The U.S. is Denmark's largest non-European trading partner, accounting for about 5% of total Danish merchandise trade. Aircraft, computers, machinery, and instruments are among the major U.S. exports to Denmark. There are some 250 U.S.-owned companies in Denmark. Among major Danish exports to the U.S. are industrial machinery, chemical products, furniture, pharmaceuticals, and canned ham and pork.

From 1982, a center-right government corrected accumulated economic pressures, mainly [[inflation]] and balance-of-payments deficits, but lost power in 1993 to a [[Social democracy|Social Democratic]] coalition government led by [[Poul Nyrup Rasmussen]], who remained in office following the March [[1998]] election. The government of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen had success in cutting official unemployment, which peaked at 12.5% and is now below 5.5 %. Average annual growth rates are now 2-3%. In [[November]] [[2001]], a center-right government led by [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] won the election on maintaining the current [[tax]] level, and improving the overall administrational efficiency. 

For the last two years (2004,2005) the danish economy has been surprisingly strong - surplus on the national budget is expected to be 39 billions DKK for 2006.
The government of Denmark is using most of this surplus to reduce the national debt (total net national debt (internal+external) was 417.8 billions DKK at the end of 2005 ).

Danes are proud of their highly developed welfare safety net, which ensures that all Danes receive free health care and need not fear real poverty. Over the last 20 years, however, the number of Danes living on transfer payments has grown to about 1 million working-age persons (roughly 20% of the population), and the system is beginning to show strains. Health care and care for the elderly particularly have suffered, and the need for welfare reform is increasingly discussed. More than one-quarter of the labor force is employed in the public sector. Thus 61% of the adult population in Denmark is either living of transfer payments or employed by the government (2005). The large public sector is financed through high taxes. A [[Value added tax]] of 25% is levied on the sale of most goods and services (including groceries). The income tax in Denmark ranges from 9%-44% for ultra-low to low-income families to 44%-62% progressively for middle class families. 850,000 Danes (31% of everyone employed and 44% of all full-time employees) pay a marginal income tax of 62%. The number of Danes paying a marginal income tax of 62% in 2006 is expected to be 925,000.

==Greenland and the Faroe Islands==
:''Main articles: [[Economy of the Faroe Islands]]  and [[Economy of Greenland]]
Greenland suffered negative economic growth in the early 1990s, but since 1993 the economy has improved. A tight fiscal policy by the Greenland Home Rule Government since the late 1980s helped create a low inflation rate and surpluses in the public budget, but at the cost of rising foreign debts of the Home Rule Government's commercial entities. Since 1990, Greenland has registered a foreign trade deficit.

Following the closure of Greenland's last lead and zinc mine in 1989, Greenland's economy is solely dependent on the fishing industry and Danish grants. Despite resumption of several interesting hydrocarbon and [[mineral]] exploration activities, it will take several years before production may materialize. Greenland's shrimp fishery is by far the largest income earner, since cod catches have dropped to historically low levels. Tourism is the only sector offering any near-term potential, and even this is limited due to the short season and high costs. The public sector plays a dominant role in Greenland's economy. Grants from mainland Denmark and EU fisheries payments make up about one-half of the home-rule government's revenues.

The Faroe Islands also depend almost entirely on fisheries and related exports. Without Danish Government bailouts in 1992 and 1993, the Faroese economy would have gone bankrupt. Since 1995, the Faroese economy has seen a noticeable upturn, but remains extremely vulnerable. Recent off-shore oil finds close to the Faroese area give hope for Faroese deposits, too, which may lay the basis for an economic rebound over the longer term.

==Economy - overview==
This thoroughly modern market economy features high-tech [[agriculture]], up-to-date small-scale and corporate industry, extensive government [[social welfare|welfare]] measures, comfortable living standards, and high dependence on [[foreign trade]]. [[Denmark]] is a net exporter of food. The center-left coalition government is concentrating on reducing the unemployment rate and turning the budget deficit into a surplus, as well as following the previous government's policies of maintaining low inflation and a current account surplus. The coalition also vows to maintain a stable currency. The coalition has lowered marginal income tax rates while maintaining overall tax revenues; boosted industrial competitiveness through labor market and tax reforms; increased research and development funds; and improved welfare services for the neediest while cutting paperwork and delays. Denmark chose not to join the 11 other [[European Union]] members who launched the [[euro]] on [[1 January]] [[1999]].

From then until the [[The end of World War II in Europe|end of the War in Europe]] on [[May 8]] [[1945]],  Eisenhower through SHAEF had supreme command of all operational Allied forces&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|2]]&lt;/sup&gt;, and through his command of ETOUSA, administrative command of all U.S. forces, on the [[Western Front (WWII)#1944 &amp;ndash; 1945|Western Front]] north of the Alps.

As recognition of his senior position in the Allied command, on [[December 20]], 1944, he was promoted to [[General of the Army]] equivalent to the rank of [[Field Marshal]] in most European armies. In this and the previous high commands he held, Eisenhower showed his great talents for leadership and diplomacy. Although he had never seen action himself, he won the respect of front-line commanders. He dealt skillfully with difficult subordinates such as [[Omar Bradley]] and [[George Patton]] and allies such as [[Winston Churchill]], Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery]] and General [[Charles de Gaulle]]. He had fundamental disagreements with Churchill and Montgomery over questions of strategy, but these rarely upset his relationships with them. He negotiated with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Georgy Zhukov|Marshal Zhukov]], and such was the confidence that President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had in him, he sometimes worked directly with [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]. 

Eisenhower was offered the [[Medal of Honor]] for his leadership in the European Theater but refused it, saying that it should be reserved for bravery and valor.

It was never a certainty that ''Overlord'' would succeed. The tenuousness surrounding the entire decision including the timing and the location of the Normandy invasion might be summarized by a short speech that Eisenhower himself wrote, in advance, in case he might need it. In it, he took full responsibility for catastrophic failure, should that be the final result. Long after the successful landings on D-Day and the [[BBC]] broadcast of Eisenhower's brief speech concerning them, the never-used second speech was found in a shirt pocket by an aide. It read:

:&quot;Our landings have failed and I have withdrawn the troops. My decision to attack at this time and place was based on the best information available. The troops, the air and the Navy did all that bravery could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone.&quot;

Following the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[unconditional surrender]] on [[May 8]], [[1945]], Eisenhower was appointed Military Governor of the [[U.S. Occupation Zone]], based in [[Frankfurt-am-Main]]. Germany was divided into four Occupation Zones, one each for the U.S., Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. In addition, upon full discovery of the [[death camp]]s that were part of the [[Final Solution]] of the  [[Holocaust]], he ordered camera crews to comprehensively document evidence of the atrocity so as to prevent any doubt of its occurance.  He made the controversial decision to reclassify German prisoners of war or [[POW]]s in U.S. custody as [[Disarmed Enemy Forces]] or DEFs. As DEFs, they could be compelled to serve as unpaid [[conscript labor]]. An unknown number may have died in custody as a consequence of malnutrition, exposure to the elements, and lack of medical care (see [[Eisenhower and German POWs]]). 

Eisenhower was named Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army in November 1945, and in December 1950 was named Supreme Commander of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], and given operational command of NATO forces in Europe. Eisenhower retired from active service on [[May 31]], [[1952]], upon entering politics.  During this period Eisenhower served as president of [[Columbia University]] from 1948 until 1953, though he was on leave from the University while he served as [[NATO]] commander.

==Presidency 1953-1961==
After his many wartime successes, General Eisenhower returned to the U.S. a great hero. It would not be long before many supporters were pressuring him to run for public office. 

Eisenhower was generally considered a political moderate, and it was not immediately clear which party he would choose to join. Eventually he settled on the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and in 1952 he was nominated as the party's star candidate in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1952|1952 U.S. presidential election]]. Eisenhower easily defeated Illinois Governor [[Adlai Stevenson]] and became the first career soldier since [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to be elected President. Although many presidents have served in the military, Eisenhower would be the only general to serve as President in the 20th century.

===Foreign affairs===
[[Image:Eisenhower 68-91-3.jpg|thumb|right|Eisenhower nominated at the [[1952 Republican National Convention]].]]

Eisenhower's presidency was dominated by the [[Cold War]], the prolonged confrontation with the [[Soviet Union]] which had begun during [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]]'s term of office.

During his campaign, Eisenhower had promised to end the stalemate [[Korean War]], and indeed a cease-fire was signed in July 1953. He signed defense treaties with [[South Korea]] and the [[Republic of China]], and formed an anti-Communist alliance with Asian and Pacific countries, [[SEATO]], to halt the spread of [[Communism]] in Asia.

Eisenhower, while accepting the doctrine of [[containment]] originally developed by [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]], sought to fight the [[USSR]] through more active means as detailed in the State Department memorandum [[NSC-68]]. His covert action policy was laid out in [[Nsc 162/2|NSC 162/2]]. He, along with Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]], developed the tactic of [[covert action]], taking advantage of the newly created [[CIA]] to interfere with suspected Communist governments abroad. An early use of covert action was against the anti-American [[Iran]]ian prime minister [[Mossadeq]] in 1953. The Iranian army ejected him from power with U.S. and British support and replaced him with the [[Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], whom they considered the legitimate ruler. 

Covert action continued throughout Eisenhower's administration. In the newly independent but chaotic [[Congo Crisis|Republic of Congo]], the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[KGB]] had intervened in favor of popularly elected Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba]]. Anti-Communism had become an issue and the U.S. and [[CIA]] gave weapons and covert support to pro-Western and Democratic CIA assets [[Joseph Kasavubu]] and his subordinate, Colonel [[Joseph Mobutu]]. The initial struggle came to a close in December 1960, after Kasavubu and Mobutu overthrew Lumumba and proceeded to turn the country (later known as [[Zaire]]) into an [[autocracy]] which was unstable long after the end of Eisenhower's term. Mobutu [[assassinated]] Lumumba shortly after his overthrow, and some allege that the CIA ([[Sidney Gottlieb]]), collaborated with Mobutu in the assassination.

Eisenhower also increased U.S. involvement in [[Southeast Asia]], a process which had begun under his predecessor Truman. In [[1954]], he sent Dulles to [[Geneva]] as a delegate to the [[Geneva Conference]], which ended the [[First Indochina War]] and temporarily partitioned [[Vietnam]] into a Communist northern half (under [[Ho Chi Minh]]) and a non-Communist southern half (under [[Ngo Dinh Diem]]). In February [[1955]], Eisenhower dispatched the first American soldiers to Vietnam as military advisors to Diem's army. After Diem announced the formation of the Republic of Vietnam (RVN, commonly known as [[South Vietnam]]) in October, Eisenhower immediately recognized the new state and offered military, economic, and technical assistance. On [[July 8]], [[1959]], Major Dale R. Buis and Sergeant Chester M. Ovnand, two U.S. military advisors in Vietnam, became the first American troops to die in what would become the [[Vietnam War]], a conflict which began during Eisenhower's term of office. 

In 1956, Eisenhower strongly disapproved of the actions of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[France]] and [[Israel]] in sending troops to [[Egypt]] in the dispute over control of the [[Suez Canal]] (see [[Suez crisis]]). He used the economic power of the U.S. to force his European allies to back down and withdraw from Egypt.

During his second term he became increasingly involved in [[Middle East|Middle Eastern]] affairs, sending troops to [[Lebanon]] in 1958.

Under Eisenhower's presidency the U.S. developed as a global [[nuclear warfare|nuclear]] power. When Russia also developed their [[nuclear weapons]], fears of mutual annihilation in a [[World War III|Third World War]] intensified. On 30 October 1953, Eisenhower approved the security policy document [[Nsc 162/2|NSC 162/2]], which emphasized nuclear weapons above all other defense means. Nuclear weapons were seen as the most economically feasible means to deter the [[Soviet Union]] from military action against what then was called the &quot;Free World.&quot; American chagrin at the Soviets' 1957 surprise launch of [[Sputnik]], the first artificial satellite, led to many [[Sputnik crisis|strategic initiatives]], including the creation of [[NASA]] in 1958. Eisenhower hoped that after the death of [[Stalin]] in 1953, it would be possible to come to an agreement with subsequent Russian leaders to halt the [[nuclear arms race]]. Several attempts at convening a summit conference were made. The last attempt failed in 1960 when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] withdrew following the shooting down of an American [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane over the Soviet Union.

===Domestic affairs===
Like most Republican presidents, Eisenhower believed that a [[free enterprise]] economy should run itself, and he took little interest in domestic policy. Although his 1952 landslide gave the Republicans control of both houses of the Congress, Eisenhower believed that taxes could not be cut until the budget was balanced. &quot;We cannot afford to reduce taxes, [and] reduce income,&quot; he said, &quot;until we have in sight a program of expenditure that shows that the factors of income and outgo will be balanced.&quot; The Democrats regained control in the 1954 [[U.S. Senate election, 1954|Senate]] and [[U.S. House election, 1954|House elections]], limiting his freedom of action on domestic policy. He forged a good relationship with Congressional leaders, particularly House Speaker [[Sam Rayburn]].

[[Image:Eisenhower in the Oval Office.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Eisenhower in the Oval Office, [[February 29]], [[1956]].]] [[Image:Eisenhower.png|thumb|right|150px|The [[coat of arms]] of Dwight D Eisenhower]]

Eisenhower appointed a Cabinet full of businessmen and gave them wide latitude in handling domestic affairs. He allowed them to take credit for domestic policy and allow him to concentrate on foreign affairs. With respect to the emerging [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|American Civil Rights Movement]], he has been criticized by [[left-wing|liberal]]s for being reluctant to exercise leadership unless forced. In 1957, however, he sent federal troops to [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] after Governor [[Orval Faubus]] attempted to defy a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling that ordered the [[desegregation]] of all public schools.

Eisenhower was also criticized for not taking a public stand against Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s anti-communist campaigns. Privately he held McCarthy in contempt for the senator's attacks on his friend and World War II colleague, General [[George Marshall]], Secretary of State under Truman. He stated &quot;I just won't get down in the gutter with that man&quot;.   Later, it was revealed that Eisenhower worked behind the scenes to bring McCarthy down. 

Eisenhower endorsed the [[Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956]], which created the United States' [[Interstate Highway]]s. It was the largest [[public works]] program in U.S. history, providing a 41,000-mile highway system. Eisenhower had been impressed during the war with the German [[Autobahn]] system, and also recalled his own involvement in a military convoy in 1919 that took 62 days to cross the U.S. Another achievement was a 20% increase in family income during his presidency, of which he was very proud. 

[[Image:Eisenhower and Kennedy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Eisenhower and President-elect John F. Kennedy, December, 1960.]]
Eisenhower retained his popularity throughout his presidency. In 1956 he was re-elected by an even wider margin than in 1952, again defeating Stevenson, and carrying such traditional Democratic states as [[Texas]] and [[Tennessee]]. 

However, there were three [[recessions]] during Eisenhower's administration — July 1953 through May 1954, August 1957 through April 1958, and April 1960 through February 1961. Real [[GDP]] growth averaged just 2.5 percent over those eight years.

Eisenhower had mixed feelings about his Vice President, [[Richard Nixon]], and only reluctantly endorsed him as the Republican candidate at the [[U.S. presidential election, 1960|1960 Presidential election]]. Nixon campaigned against [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] on the great experience he had acquired in eight years as Vice President, but when Eisenhower was asked to name a decision Nixon had been responsible for in that time, he replied (intending a joke): &quot;Give me a week and I might think of something.&quot; This was a blow to Nixon, and he blamed Eisenhower for his narrow loss to Kennedy.

==Retirement and death==
[[Image:Eisenhower 62-2-1USN.JPG|thumb|left|Eisenhower with President Kennedy on retreat in 1962.]]

On January 17, 1961, Eisenhower gave his final televised speech from the [[Oval Office]]. In his farewell speech to the nation, Eisenhower raised the issue of the Cold War and role of the U.S. armed forces. He described the Cold War saying: &quot;We face a hostile ideology global in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose and insidious in method...A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction.&quot;

Earlier in his remarks he had warned about what he saw as unjustified government spending proposals and continued with a warning that &quot;we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the [[Military-industrial complex]]... Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.&quot;

Once Eisenhower left office his reputation declined, and he was seen as having been a &quot;do-nothing&quot; President. This was partly because of the contrast between Eisenhower and his young, activist successor, John F. Kennedy, but also due to his reluctance to support the civil rights movement or to stop [[McCarthyism]]. Such omissions were held against him during the liberal climate of the 1960s and 1970s. Eisenhower's reputation has risen since that time due to his non-partisan nature, his wartime leadership, his action in Arkansas, his being the last President to balance the budget (before the second Clinton term), and an increasing appreciation of how difficult it is today to maintain a prolonged peace. In [[Historical rankings of U.S. Presidents|recent surveys]] of historians, Eisenhower is often ranked in the top ten among all U.S. Presidents.

Eisenhower is purported to have said that his September 1953 appointment of California Governor Earl Warren as Chief Justice of the United States was &quot;the biggest damn fool mistake I ever made&quot;. Some sources place this act on Eisenhower's own list of &quot;My Top Five Lifetime Mistakes&quot;.  Eisenhower disagreed vigorously with several of Warren's decisions. 

Eisenhower retired to the place where he and Mamie had spent much of their post-war time, a working farm adjacent to the battlefield at [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]]. The Gettysburg farm is a [[National Historic Site]] [http://www.nps.gov/eise/]. In retirement, he did not completely retreat from political life; he spoke at the 1964 [[Republican convention]], and also appeared with [[Barry Goldwater]] in a Republican campaign commercial from Gettysburg.[http://livingroomcandidate.movingimage.us/election/index.php?nav_action=election&amp;nav_subaction=overview&amp;campaign_id=168]

[[Image:Eisenhower 67-475-19.jpg|thumb|right|Eisenhower leaving the White House after a visit with President Johnson in 1967.]]

Due to legal issues related to holding a military rank while in a civilian office, Eisenhower resigned his permanent commission as [[General of the Army]] before entering the office of President of the United States. Upon completion of his Presidential term, his commission on the retired list was reactivated and Eisenhower was again commissioned a five star general in the United States Army.

&quot;Ike&quot; Eisenhower died at 12:25 PM on [[March 28]], 1969, at [[Walter Reed Army Hospital]] in [[Washington D.C.]], after a long illness at the age of 78. He lies alongside his wife and their first child, who died in childhood, in a small chapel called the Place of Meditation, at the [[Eisenhower Presidential Library]], located in Abilene. His [[state funeral]] was quite unique because they were presided over by [[Richard Nixon]], who was vice-president under Eisenhower and was already serving as president of the United States. [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/Last_Salute/ch29.htm]

==Legacy==
Eisenhower's picture was on the dollar coin from 1971 to 1979. Nearly 700 million of the copper-nickel clad coins were minted for general circulation, and far smaller numbers of uncirculated and [[proof coinage|proof]] issues (in both copper-nickel and 40% silver varieties) were produced for collectors. Ike reappeared on a [[commemorative]] silver dollar issued in 1990, celebrating the 100th anniversary of his birth.

In 1971, the [[Eisenhower Medical Center]] in [[Rancho Mirage, California]] was named for him.

In 1983, [[The Eisenhower Institute]] was founded in Washington, D.C. as a policy institute to advance Eisenhower's intellectual and leadership legacies.

In 1999, the [[United States Congress]] created the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission]], which is in the planning stages of creating an enduring [[Eisenhower National Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] across the street from the [[National Air and Space Museum]] on the [[National Mall]].

==Trivia==
* He named the presidential retreat [[Camp David]] after his grandson [[David Eisenhower]].
* In 1961 when he handed over the presidency to [[John F. Kennedy]], at 43 the youngest elected president, he was the oldest president to serve, at 70 years and 98 days &amp;ndash; a record since broken by [[Ronald Reagan]]. 
* Eisenhower was the first president affected by the [[22nd Amendment]], limiting;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;787&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Breakdown of discharges by service branch not available

Additionally, in February 2005, the [[Government Accountability Office]] released estimates on the cost of the policy to the U.S. government, totalling nearly $200 million since 1993. 

==Military Readiness Enhancement Act==
On [[April 5]], [[2005]], [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]], a Republican member of the House [[Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats and International Relations]] became a cosponsor of the bill, joining [[Christopher Shays]] of [[Connecticut]] and [[Jim Kolbe]] of [[Arizona]] (both House Republicans, Kolbe is openly gay) and 70 Democrats in sponsoring the [[Military Readiness Enhancement Act]], which would end Don't Ask, Don't Tell.  &quot;We've tried the policy. I don't think it works. And we've spent a lot of money enforcing it,&quot; she said.  &quot;We investigate people. Bring them up on charges. Basically wreck their lives... People who've signed up to serve our country. We should be thanking them.&quot;  She called arguments against gay people serving openly &quot;the same kind of talk we heard about women [and blacks].&quot;

&quot;The odds [of passage] are very small, unless the top military brass would embrace it,&quot; [[Robert Wexler]], a Florida Democrat said, comparing the odds to the chances of snow in South Florida.  Still, Ros-Lehtinen says she will always support the bill. [http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/nation/11360250.htm]

==Criticism==
[[Judith Butler]] argues that the ban displays a paranoid nature which conflates [[speech act|speech]] and conduct: &quot;the statement, then, 'I am a homosexual,' is fabulously misconstrued...A claim that is, in the first instance, reflexive, that attributes a status to only oneself, is taken to be solicitous...to hear the utterance is to 'contract' the sexuality to which it refers...This is a statement construed as a solicitation; a constative taken as an interrogative; a self-ascription taken as an address.&quot; (Butler {{ref|Butler}} 113)

==Situation outside the United States==
{{main|Sexual orientation and military service}}

Most other Western military forces have now removed policies excluding individuals of other sexual orientations (with strict policies on [[sexual harassment]]).

'''Divination''' is the practice of ascertaining information from [[supernatural]] sources.  If a distinction is to be made with [[fortune-telling]], divination has a formal or ritual and often social character, usually in a [[religion|religious]] context; while fortune-telling is a more everyday practice for personal purposes. Divination is often dismissed by [[skeptic]]s as being mere [[superstition]]: in the [[2nd century]], [[Lucian]] devoted a witty essay to the career of a charlatan, ''Alexander the false prophet'', trained by &quot;one of those who advertise enchantments, miraculous incantations, charms for your love-affairs, visitations for your enemies, disclosures of buried treasure, and successions to estates&quot; [http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/lucian/lucian_alexander.htm], though most Romans believed in dreams and charms.  However, advocates say there is plenty of [[anecdotal evidence]] for the efficacy of divination.  Divination is a universal cultural phenomenon which anthropologists have observed as being present in many [[Anthropology of religion|religions]] and cultures in all ages up to the present day. However, in the [[Bible]] most forms of divination are strictly forbidden by [[God]].

[[Science|Scientific research and methods]] have made it possible to predict future events with some success, e.g., [[eclipse|eclipses]], [[meteorology|weather forecasts]] and [[volcanic]] eruptions.  However, this is not divination.  Strictly speaking, divination assumes the influence of some supernatural force or fate, whereas scientific predictions are made from an essentially mechanical, impersonal world-view and rely on empirical [[laws of nature  So, as an operational definition, divination would be all methods of prognostication that have not been shown to be effective using scientific research.

Beyond mere explanations for anecdoctal evidence, there are some serious theories of how divination might work.  One such theory is rooted in the nature of the unconscious mind, a theory which has some empirical scientific basis. Based on this theory, divination is the process by which messages from the unconscious mind are decoded.  The belief in a supernatural agency or [[occult]] force as the source of these messages is what distinguishes this theory from a scientific explanation.

[[Julian Jaynes]] categorized divination according to the following types:

* '''Omens and omen texts.''' &quot;The most primitive, clumsy, but enduring method...is the simple recording of sequences of unusual or important events.&quot; (1976:236) Chinese history offers scrupulously documented occurrences of strange births, the tracking of natural phenomena, and other data. Chinese governmental planning relied on this method of forecasting for long-range strategy. It is not unreasonable to assume that modern scientific inquiry began with this kind of divination; [[Joseph Needham]]'s work considered this very idea.

* '''Sortilege.''' This consists of the casting of lots whether with sticks, stones, bones, beans, or some other item. Modern playing cards and board games developed from this type of divination.

* '''Augury.''' Divination that ranks a set of given possibilities. It can be qualitative (such as shapes, proximities, etc.) [[Dowsing]] (a form of [[rhabdomancy]]) developed from this type of divination. The [[Roman Republic|Romans]] in classical times used [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] methods of augury such as [[hepatoscopy]] (actually a form of extispicy). [[haruspex|Haruspices]] examined the livers of sacrificed animals.

* '''Spontaneous.''' An unconstrained form of divination, free from any particular medium, and actually a generalization of all types of divination. The answer comes from whatever object the diviner happens to see or hear. Some Christians and members of other religions use a form of [[bibliomancy]]: they ask a question, rifle the pages of their holy book, and take as their answer the first passage their eyes light upon. Other forms of spontaneous divination include reading [[aura]]s and [[New Age]] methods of [[Feng Shui]] such as &quot;intuitive&quot; and Fuzion.

By far one of the most popular methods of divination is [[Astrology]], typically categorized as Vedic Astrology ([[Jyotish]]), [[Western Astrology]], and [[Chinese Astrology]], though besides these main three branches many other cultures also have or have had their own forms of Astrology in the past.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Diet of Nuremberg''' is often called the '''Imperial Diet at [[Nuremberg]]'''.

There were several of them because, by the Basic Law for the Empire of [[1356]], each [[Holy Roman Emperor]] had to hold his first [[diet (assembly)|diet]] in Nuremberg after his election. There were also a number of other diets held.

[[1211]] elected [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] of Hohenstaufen emperor.

[[1356]] [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] issued his ''[[Golden Bull]]'' - fixing how the German emperors were elected.

Important to [[Protestantism]] (and the Turks) were the:
:[[1522]] - 1st Diet of Nuremberg
:[[1524]] - 2nd Diet of Nuremberg
:[[1532]] - 3rd Diet of Nuremberg

{{Redirect|Strangelove}}
'''''Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb''''' is a [[1964]] [[Stanley Kubrick]] [[film]] based loosely upon the straight-faced thriller novel ''[[Red Alert (book)|Red Alert]]'' by [[Peter George]]. Refashioned as a [[black comedy]] from the source material by screenwriter [[Terry Southern]], ''Dr. Strangelove's'' subject matter [[satire|satirizes]] the fragile nature of the [[Cold War]] conflict and the doctrine of [[mutual assured destruction|mutually assured destruction]]. The film opens at the fictional Burpelson Air Force Base, where the insane [[General]] Jack D. Ripper has just ordered a preemptive [[nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]] on the [[Soviet Union]]. The rest of ''Dr. Strangelove'' follows the [[US President|American President]] and his advisors, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and a [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] officer as they all scramble to recall Ripper's bomb-wing in order to prevent a nuclear [[Apocalypse]].   
==Cast and crew==
''Dr. Strangelove'' stars British actor/comedian [[Peter Sellers]], who actually improvised much of his dialogue during filming. Sellers plays three roles:
* '''Group Captain Lionel Mandrake'''&amp;mdash;the sane, well-meaning, &quot;by-the-book&quot; [[United Kingdom|British]] exchange officer with an upper-class [[English accent]]. It is said that Sellers' experience mimicking his uptight superiors as an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] airman during [[World War II]] aided him in creating this character. 

* '''President Merkin Muffley'''&amp;mdash;the [[Adlai Stevenson]]-esque American [[Commander in Chief]]&amp;mdash;a decent, but flustered and spineless character. The President's first and last name each crudely imply that he is a ''[[pussy]]'' by nature (&quot;merkin&quot; and &quot;muff&quot; are both associated with the female genitalia). This fundamental quality becomes evident during the famous Hotline scene, in which he seems overly cautious in dealing with [[Soviet Premier]] Dmitri Kisof. For the role, Sellers flattened his natural English accent to sound like an American [[Midwestern United States|Midwesterner]] (another reference to Stevenson, who was from [[Illinois]]), and faked [[common cold|cold]] symptoms to further add to the character's inherent weakness. 

* '''Dr. Strangelove'''&amp;mdash;the sinister German title-character&amp;mdash;an amalgamation of [[RAND Corporation]] strategist [[Herman Kahn]], [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi]]-turned-[[NASA]] rocket scientist [[Wernher von Braun]], &quot;father of the [[hydrogen bomb]]&quot; [[Edward Teller]], and [[John F. Kennedy|JFK]]'s [[Secretary of Defense]], [[Robert McNamara]]. [[Henry Kissinger]] has also been cited as one of the Strangelove character's influences. However, this assertion is highly unlikely, as Kissinger was not a prominent figure in American politics at the time of the film's production. Dr. Strangelove serves as President Muffley's scientific advisor in the War Room, presumably making use of prior expertise as a Nazi physicist. The accent used by Sellers is reportedly based on that of [[Weegee]] (pseudonymn of [[Austrian]] photographer [[Arthur Fellig]]), who was hired by Kubrick as a special effects consultant. Throughout the film, the speeches made by the character of Dr. Strangelove are interrupted by his erratic fits of [[alien hand syndrome]]. At one point, Strangelove's hand reaches out in an attempt to strangle his neck; at another it thrusts itself out in a [[Hitler salute|Nazi salute]]. Strangelove's sinister black glove was actually Kubrick's; Sellers saw Kubrick using it to handle the hot lights on the set one day and thought it would be a good addition to his costume.

At the start of ''Dr. Strangelove'' 's production, Sellers was set to play a fourth role; that of Air Force Major T. J. &quot;King&quot; Kong, the [[B-52 Stratofortress]] bomber captain. However, Sellers fractured his leg during filming, and was prevented from playing the role because of a technical constraint that would have confined him to cramped space of the cockpit set. It has been suggested that Sellers, who was concerned about correctly reproducing the Texan accent required, contrived the injury&amp;mdash;or at least exaggerated it to make it seem worse than it really was. As fate would have it, [[Slim Pickens]], a real-life Texan, was quickly tapped to replace Sellers as Major Kong. It is no coincidence that his performance turned out so authentic; fellow actor James Earl Jones recalls, &quot;He was Major Kong on and off the set&amp;mdash;he didn't change a thing&amp;mdash;his temperament, his language, his behavior.&quot; For the entire course of filming, Pickens was apparently unaware that ''Strangelove'' was to be a comedy, and instead played the role straight, thereby adding to the humor. Kubrick biographer John Baxter further explains in the documentary &quot;Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove&quot;: &lt;blockquote&gt;As it turns out, Slim Pickens had never left the United States. He had to hurry and get his first passport. He arrived on the set, and somebody said, &quot;Gosh, he's arrived in costume!,&quot; not realizing that that's how he always dressed… With the cowboy hat and the fringed jacket and the cowboy boots&amp;mdash;and that he wasn't putting on the character&amp;mdash;that's the way he talked.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Also appearing in the film is [[George C. Scott]] as General Buck Turgidson, a [[strategic bombing]] enthusiast who serves as the thinly-disguised avatar of General [[Curtis LeMay]], the Air Force Chief of Staff who advocated a pre-emptive strike against bases in [[Cuba]] during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis|Missile Crisis]] of 1962, against Kennedy's better judgement. [[Sterling Hayden]] plays General Jack D. Ripper; a young [[James Earl Jones]] plays bombardier Lieutenant Lothar Zogg; [[Keenan Wynn]] plays a Colonel &quot;Bat&quot; Guano, and [[Tracy Reed]] plays Gen. Turgidson's seductive secretary Miss Scott, the film's only female character.

==Synopsis==
{{spoiler}}
Jack D. Ripper, a delusional [[US Air Force]] general, plans to strike the [[Soviet Union]] with a nuclear [[knockout blow]] in order to thwart a [[Communist]] conspiracy which threatens to &quot;sap and impurify&quot; the &quot;precious bodily fluids&quot; of the American people with [[water fluoridation|fluoridated water]].  Exceeding his authority, he convinces everyone at Burpelson Air Force Base that the [[United States]] is in a &quot;shooting war&quot; with the [[Soviet Union]], and orders the 843rd Bomb Wing (which was in the air at the time as part of a training exercise called &quot;Operation Dropkick&quot;) past its [[fail-safe]] points and into [[Russia]]. The provisions of a military protocol known as &quot;Plan R&quot; ('R for Robert') allows lower-echelon commanders to authorize the use of nuclear weapons without Presidential authority during a &quot;time of conflict.&quot; It was apparently put in place after a certain Senator by the name of Buford pointed out that the nuclear deterrence plan of the United States lacked credibility, in that if only the President could authorize a nuclear strike, retaliation could be avoided if the USSR succeeded in wiping him out in the first strike.

From the script:
:'''''Ripper:''''' Mandrake, I suppose it never occurred to you that while we're chatting here so enjoyably, a decision is being made by the President and the Joint Chiefs in the war room at the Pentagon. And when they realize there is no possibility of recalling the wing, there will be only one course of action open: total commitment... Mandrake, do you recall what [[Georges_Clemenceau|Clemenceau]] once said about war?

:'''''Mandrake:''''' No. I don't think I do sir, no.

:'''''Ripper:''''' He said war was too important to be left to the Generals. When he said that, fifty years ago, he might have been right. But today, war is too important to be left to politicians. They have neither the time, the training, nor the inclination for strategic thought. I can no longer sit back and allow communist infiltration, communist indoctrination, communist subversion, and the international communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids.

General Ripper is unaware that the Soviets have constructed a so-called &quot;[[doomsday device]]&quot; which automatically detects any nuclear attack on the Soviet Union, whereupon it destroys all life on Earth via massive [[nuclear fallout]]. Dr. Strangelove explains to the staff assembled in tdo]] firing range.

However it was clear even at the time that this concept had problems of its own. The ship would indeed be capable of holding off an attack by torpedo boats (which typically have no guns of their own), but while operating away from the fleet they would be easy targets for any other capital ship. Thus they were often given torpedoes of their own.

Another problem was that the torpedo-boats were short ranged and thus easy and cheap to produce. However the destroyers had the problem of needing to operate as a screen for the fleet. This required them to have the speed and range of the [[battleships]], so destroyers were often much larger than the boats they were designed to counter.

===First designs===
[[Image:Kotaka.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s ''[[Japanese warship Kotaka|Kotaka]]'' ([[1887]])]]
The first effective design of a torpedo-boat destroyer emerged in [[1885]] with the Japanese [[Japanese warship Kotaka|''Kotaka'']], which ''&quot;was the forerunner of torpedo-boat destroyers that appeared a decade later&quot;'' (Kaigun, David C. Evans). Designed upon Japanese specifications and ordered to the British [[Yarrow shipyards]] in [[1885]], she was transported in parts to Japan, where she was assembled and launched in [[1887]]. She was armed with four 1-pounder (37 mm) quick-firing guns and four [[torpedo]] tubes, reached 19 knots, and at 203 tons, was the largest torpedo boat yet designed. In her trials in [[1889]], ''Kotaka'' demonstrated that she could go beyond a role of coastal defense, and was capable of following larger ships on the high seas. The Yarrow shipyards, builder of the parts for the ''Kotaka'', ''&quot;considered Japan to have effectively invented the destroyer&quot;'' (Howe).

[[Image:ContratorpederoDestructor.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Spanish Navy]]'s ''Destructor'' (1886)]]
Almost immediately after the order of the ''Kotaka'' was placed, [[Fernando Villaamil]] of the [[Spanish Navy]] also placed an order for a torpedo-boat destroyer in November 1885, with the British builder James and George Thompson, of [[Clydebank]], also nearby the Yarrow shipyards. The ship, named ''Destructor'', was laid down at the end of the year, launched in 1886, and commissioned in 1887, thereby becoming the first torpedo-boat destroyer to be completed. Her displacement was 380 tons, and she was equipped with triple expansion engines generating 3,800 HP, for a maximum speed of 22.6 knots. She was armed with one 90 mm [[Hontoria]] cannon, four 57 mm [[Nordenfeldt]] cannon, two 37 mm [[Hotchkiss]] guns and 3 Schwartzkopff torpedo tubes. Her complement was 60 men.  

[[Image:HMS Havock (1893).jpg|thumb|250px|[[Havock class destroyer|HMS ''Havock'' ]] ([[1893]]).]]
The next effective design of torpedo boat destroyer, with the range and speed to keep up with battleships, was the [[Havock class destroyer|''Havock'' class]] of two ships of the [[Royal Navy]], developed in 1892 under the newly appointed Third Sea Lord Rear Admiral [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|&quot;Jackie&quot; Fisher]], and launched in [[1893]]. The ''Havock'' had a 240 tons displacement, a speed of 27 knots, and was armed with a single 12-pounder (76 mm) gun, three 6-pounders (57 mm), and three 46 cm torpedo tubes.

The [[United States]] commissioned its first destroyer, [[USS Bainbridge (DD-1)|USS ''Bainbridge'']], Destroyer No. 1, in [[1902]]. 

The torpedo boat destroyer later on took over the role of the smaller torpedo boats, performing torpedo attacks on fleets, such as the devastating Japanese attack on the Russian fleet in [[Battle of Port Arthur|Port Arthur]] at the opening of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1904, and attacks in the Pacific theatre of [[World War II]].

==World War I==

Torpedo Boat destroyers grew in size and effectiveness in the early part of the 20th century. Innovations such as [[turbine propulsion]], oil-fired rather than coal-fired boilers, and longer ranged &quot;heater&quot; torpedoes led to effective ships being designed by the United Kingdom and Germany.

The threat evolved by [[World War I]] with the perfection of the [[submarine]]. In general, the submarine, or [[U-boat]], of the era was nothing more than a submersible torpedo boat. This change allowed the submarine to hide from the guns of the destroyers and close to firing while underwater. This led to an equally rapid destroyer evolution during the war, which was quickly equipped with [[depth charge]]s and [[sonar]] for countering this new threat.

At the end of the war the state of the art was represented by the British [[V and W class destroyer]].

==Inter-War==
[[Image:Fubuki.jpg|thumb|250px|Japan's ''[[Fubuki class destroyer|Fubuki]]'' destroyer (1928)]]
Destroyer construction continued during the inter-war period, initially with designs evolved from the British V &amp; W Class. A major innovation came with the Japanese [[Fubuki class destroyers]] or special type of 1928, which introduced enclosed turrets capable of anti-aircraft fire and the 24-inch (60cm) oxygen fuelled [[Type 93 torpedo]]. Most other nations replied with similar larger ships, including the US [[Porter-class destroyer]] leader and the British [[Tribal class destroyer (1936)|''Afridi''-class destroyer]] (commonly called &quot;Tribals&quot;)

Anti-submarine sensors included [[sonar]] or [[ASDIC]], although training in their use was indifferent. Anti-sub weapons changed little, and ahead-throwing weapons, a need recognized in WWI, had made no progress.

==World War II==

By [[World War II]] the threat had evolved once again. Submarines were more effective, and [[aircraft]] had become important weapons of naval warfare; once again the fleet destroyers were unequipped for combatting these new targets. They were re-equipped with new [[anti-aircraft]] guns, [[radar]], and [[ahead-throwing ASW]] weapons, in addition to their existing light guns, depth charges, and torpedoes. By this time the destroyers had become large multi-purpose vessels, expensive targets in their own right rather than expendable vessels for the protection of others. This led to the introduction of smaller and cheaper specialized anti-submarine warships by the [[Royal Navy]]: [[corvette]]s and later [[frigate]]s, while the US introduced [[destroyer escort]]s.

==Post War==
Some conventional destroyers were completed in the late 1940's and 1950's which built on wartime experience. These vessels were significantly larger than wartime ships and had fully automatic main guns, unit Machinery, radar, sonar, and antisubmarine weapons such as the Squid mortar. Examples include the British [[Daring class destroyer (1949)|''Daring''-class]], US [[Forrest Sherman class destroyer|''Forrest Sherman''-class]], and the Soviet [[kotlin class (project 56)|Kotlin-class]] destroyers.

Some World War II-vintage ships were modernised for anti-submarine warfrare, and to extend their service lives, to avoid having to build (expensive) brand-new ships.  Examples include the US [[FRAM I]] programme and the British [[Type 15 frigate]]s converted from fleet destroyers.

==The Missile Age==
The advent of surface-to-air ([[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]]) missiles and surface-to-surface ([[Surface-to-surface_missile|SSM]]) missiles, such as the [[Exocet]], in the early 1960's changed naval warfare. Guided missile destroyers ([[DDG]] in the US Navy) were developed to carry these weapons and protect the fleet from air, submarine and surface threats. Examples include the Soviet [[Kashin class destroyer|Kashin-class]], the British [[County class destroyer|''County''-class]], and the American [[Charles F. Adams class destroyer|Charles F. Adams-class]].

==Modern destroyers==
[[Image:HMCS Algonquin (DDG 283).jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[HMCS Algonquin (DDH 283)|HMCS ''Algonquin'']], a Canadian [[Iroquois class destroyer|''Iroquois''-class]] destroyer]]
[[Image:HMS Manchester (D95) Type 42 destroyer.jpg|thumb|right|225px|HMS ''Manchester'' a [[Type 42]] destroyer of the Royal Navy]]

In the [[US Navy]], destroyers operate in support of [[carrier battle group]]s, surface action groups, amphibious groups and replenishment groups. The destroyers currently in use by the US Navy are the [[Arleigh Burke class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke''-class]]. Destroyers (with a DD [[hull classification symbol]]) primarily perform anti-submarine warfare duty while [[guided missile]] destroyers (DDGs) are multi-mission ([[anti-submarine]], [[anti-aircraft]], and anti-surface warfare) surface combatants. The relatively-recent addition of [[cruise missile]] launchers has greatly expanded the role of the destroyer in strike and land-attack warfare.  As the expense of heavier surface combatants has generally removed them from the fleet, destroyer tonnage has grown (a modern [[Arleigh Burke class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke''-class]] destroyer has the same tonnage as a [[World War II]] [[light cruiser]]).  ''Arleigh Burke'' is billed by her builders, the [[Bath Iron Works]], as ton-for-ton the most powerful warship in history.

[[Image:Destroyer Class Ships.jpg|left|Modern Destroyers]]



The Royal Navy currently operates 8 ships of the [[Type 42 destroyer|Type 42]] class.
The destroyers (as well as frigates) are, as always, the workhorses of the fleet, the former optimised for air defence and the latter for surface and subsurface warfare. They are equally at home in large task groups or on independent operations which may include sanctions enforcement, humanitarian relief or anti-drug patrols. British destroyers (of recent times) have an average displacement of around 5,000 tonnes, and are armed with a mixture of guns and missiles including 114 mm (4.5 inch) Mk 8 guns, [[Sea Dart]] Missiles, 20 mm Close range guns, Vulcan Phalanx close in weapons system (CIWS), anti submarine torpedo tubes.

The [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command|Canadian Navy]] currently operates the [[Iroquois class destroyer|''Iroquois''-class]] destroyers, a class of four [[helicopter]]-carrying, anti-aircraft, [[guided missile]] destroyers. Launched in the [[1970s]], the ''Iroquois'''s were the first all [[gas turbine]] powered military ships, using two turbines for cruise power, and another two fast starting &quot;boost&quot; turbines for speeds of up to 29 knots (such an arrangement is known as [[Combined gas or gas|COGOG]]). The design was a major inspiration for the US's later [[Spruance class destroyer|''Spruance''-class]] ships. They were originally fitted out for [[anti-submarine warfare]], but the entire class underwent major retrofits as a part of the Tribal Class Update and Modernization Program, or TRUMP, in the 1990s. These refits had the effect of re-purposing the ships for area air-defence, and the ships are now referred to as air-defence destroyers.

==Future destroyers==
The last US Navy [[Spruance class destroyer|''Spruance''-class destroyer]] in service, [[USS Cushing (DD-985)|USS ''Cushing'']], was decommissioned on [[September 21]] [[2005]].  The [[Zumwalt class destroyer|''Zumwalt''-class]] were planned to replace them; on [[November 1]], [[2001]], the US Navy announced the issuance of a revised Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Future Surface Combatant Program. Formerly known as DD 21, the program will now be called [[DD(X)]] to more accurately reflect the program purpose, which is to produce a family of advanced technology surface combatants, not a single ship class. DD(X) is no longer called ''Zumwalt''-class, and is much larger than traditional destroyers, being nearly three thousand tons heavier than a [[Ticonderoga class cruiser|''Ticonderoga''-class]] [[cruiser]]. It will potentially employ advanced weaponry and an all-electric [[Integrated Power System]].  With the retirement of the ''Spruance'' class, the Navy began commissioning an advanced variant of the ''Arleigh Burke'' class with expanded ASW capabilities, the ''Arleigh Burke'' Flight IIA, beginning with [[USS Oscar Austin (DDG-79)|USS ''Oscar Austin'']].

The current Royal Navy Type 42 destroyers are to be replaced by the new [[Type 45 destroyer|Type 45]] ''Daring''-class from 2006 onwards. A class of 8 ships is envisaged, with an entire programme budget of £6 billion. Displacing around 7,200 tons, they will be equipped with the UK variant of the [[PAAMS|Principal Anti-Air Missile System]] (PAAMS) and BAE [[SAMPSON]] radar. Design and construction of the first ships is split between [[BAE Systems]] and [[Vosper Thornycroft]] under the overall project management of BAE systems. The ships are assembled at [[Scotstoun]], by [[BAE Systems Naval Ships]]. HMS Daring, the first of her class, was christened by Sophie, Countess of Wessex, and launched on the Clyde on [[1 February]] [[2006]].

The $5.2 billion CADRE (Command &amp; Control and Air-Defence Capability Replacement) project is meant to replace Canada’s [[Iroquois class destroyer|''Iroquois''-class]] destroyers whose primary role shifted to area air-defence after TRUMP refits in the 1990s. Although the area air-defence capability had not previously existed, the Canadian Navy now regards “wide area air defence” as part of Canada’s core naval capabilities. When the project began, Canadian Navy destroyers were expected to need replacing by 2005, they are now expected to serve until 2010. There was some work on a replacement design, known to Navy-watchers as the [[Province-class destroyer|''Province''-class]] destroyers, but this was confined largely to studies of a much-improved multi-function three dimensional [[phased array]] [[radar]] system being developed in conjunction with the Dutch and German navies, known as [[APAR]]. Current speculation is that the ships themselves would be similar to a &quot;stretched&quot; [[Halifax class frigate|''Halifax''-class]] frigate.

==Notes==
#{{note|1}} Although there are currently no active battleships in any navy the United States navy still maintains two [[Iowa class battleship|''Iowa''-class]] [[battleship]]s, and could reactivate one or both if necessary.  These ships are maintained as a political necessity, and not likely to ever be reactivated (one, ''[[USS Iowa (BB-61)|Iowa]]'', has never-repaired explosion damage to her center turret).

'''Dorothy Parker''' ([[August 22]] [[1893]] &amp;ndash; [[June 7]] [[1967]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[writer]] and [[poet]] best known for her caustic [[wit]], wisecracks, and sharp eye for [[20th century]] urban foibles.  Also known as '''Dot''' or '''Dottie''', Parker was born '''Dorothy Rothschild''' in the West End district of [[Long Branch, New Jersey]].

==Early life==
She grew up in springville [[Upper West Side]]. Young Dorothy Rothschild attended Blessed Sacrament Convent school, even though Dorothy's father was [[Jewish]] and her mother [[Protestant]]. She later went to a finishing school in [[Morristown, New Jersey]]. Her formal education ended when she was 13. 

Dorothy lost her mother when she was four years old and her stepmother at nine. Her uncle, Martin Rothschild, went down with the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] in [[1912]]. A year later her father died.

Young Dorothy earned money by playing piano at a dancing school, among other things.  She first sold a poem to ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine in [[1916]], and at the same time was hired as an editorial assistant for its sister magazine  ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''; she moved to ''Vanity Fair'' the next year.  In [[1917]] she met and married a Wall Street broker, Edwin Pond Parker II; they were almost immediately separated by [[World War I]].  Her family was not part of the Rothschilds banking dynasty; she joked that she married to escape her name.

==The Round Table years==
In [[1919]] her career took off while writing theatre criticism for ''[[Vanity Fair magazine|Vanity Fair]]'', initially as a stand-in for the vacationing [[P.G. Wodehouse]].  At the magazine she met [[Robert Benchley]], who became a close friend, and [[Robert E. Sherwood]].  They began lunching at the [[Algonquin Hotel]], among the founding members of the [[Algonquin Round Table]].  They were soon joined by [[Franklin Pierce Adams]] and [[Alexander Woollcott]], both newspaper columnists who helped publicize Parker's witticisms, [[Harold Ross]], and many others.

She was fired from ''Vanity Fair'' in [[1920]]-- Benchley and Sherwood resigned in protest-- and began earning a living as a freelance writer. She separated from her husband, and had affairs with reporter-turned-playwright [[Charles MacArthur]] and with the publisher [[Seward Collins]].  When [[Harold Ross]] founded ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in [[1925]], she and [[Robert Benchley]] were considered part of the staff, though at first they contributed little to the magazine.

Parker became famous for her short, viciously humorous poems, many about the perceived ludicrousness of her many (largely unsuccessful) romantic affairs and others wistfully considering the appeal of suicide. She never considered these poems as her most important works.

{{listen|filename=ParkerD-Men.ogg|title=Men|description=A 30 second except of Dorothy Parker's ''Men'' ([http://floozy.com/allison/rilke/dp.index.html#men.html Text of poem])}}

Her greatest period of productivity and success came in the next decade and a half; she published seven volumes of short stories and poetry: ''Enough Rope'', ''Sunset Gun'', ''Laments for the Living'', ''Death and Taxes'', ''After Such Pleasures'',  ''Not So Deep as a Well'' (collected poems), and ''Here Lies''.  After her death, the critic [[Brendan Gill]] noted that these titles &quot;amounted to a capsule autobiography.&quot;  Some of this work was originally published in the ''New Yorker'', to which she also contributed acerbic book reviews, under the byline &quot;Constant Reader&quot;; these were widely read and later published in a collection under that name.  She wrote or co-wrote several plays as well, some well-reviewed, though none of lasting note.

Her best-known story, published in [[Bookman Magazine]] under the title &quot;Big Blonde&quot;, was awarded the [[O. Henry Award]] as the most outstanding short story of [[1929]].  Her short stories, though often witty, were also spare and incisive, and more bittersweet than comic. 

Her friends found her both a source of fun and of tragedy; at least twice she attempted suicide.

==Hollywood and later life==
She married Alan Campbell, an actor with hopes to be a screenwriter, in [[1934]].  (He was reputed to be bisexual-- indeed, Parker did some of the reputing-- but there is no substantial evidence for this.)  She and Campbell moved to Hollywood and worked on more than fifteen films (on a salary of $5200 a week-- an enormous sum during the Depression).  With Robert Carson and Campbell, she wrote the script for the [[1937]] film ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star is Born]]'', which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing - Screenplay.  Her marriage with Campbell was tempestuous; they divorced in [[1947]], remarried in [[1950]], and remained together on and off until his death in [[1963]] in [[West Hollywood]].

During the 1930s she became involved in left-wing politics, helping to found the Anti-Nazi League in Hollywood, and drifted away from some of her Round Table friends.  She was named as a [[communist]] by the [[Red Channels]] publication in 1950 and was investigated by the [[FBI]] for her suspected involvement in communism during the [[Joseph McCarthy|McCarthy]] era. As a result, she was placed on the [[Hollywood blacklist]] by the [[movie studio]] bosses. 

From [[1957]] to [[1962]] she wrote book reviews for ''Esquire'', though these were increasingly erratic due to her problems with alcohol.  She died of a heart attack at the age of 73 in [[1967]] at the Volney Apartments in New York. In her will, she bequeathed her estate to the Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] foundation. Following King's death, her estate was passed on to the [[NAACP]]. Her executor, [[Lillian Hellman]], bitterly but unsuccessfully contested this disposition...

==Parker in culture==
At the height of her fame, George Oppenheimer wrote a play based on Parker, ''Here Today'' ([[1932]]); the character based on her was portrayed by [[Ruth Gordon]].

Her life was the subject of the [[1987]] film &lt;cite&gt;[[Dorothy And Alan At Norma Place]]&lt;/cite&gt; and the [[1994 in film|1994]] [[film]] &lt;cite&gt;[[Mrs threat of underground facilities used for purposes ranging from command-and-control, to weapons storage and staging, to the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction. SPO is also developing significantly more cost-effective ways to counter proliferated, inexpensive cruise missiles, UAVs, and other platforms used for weapon delivery, jamming, and surveillance. SPO is investing in novel space technologies across the spectrum of space control applications including rapid access, space situational awareness, counterspace, and persistent tactical grade sensing approaches including extremely large space apertures and structures.

#The [[Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems Office (DARPA)|Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) Office]] is the DARPA activity charged with leading the DoD effort to develop and demonstrate the Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems.

==Controversy==
DARPA received media attention in 2002 and 2003 after its creation of projects like the [[Information Awareness Office]] and [[Combat Zones That See]] (CTS), which civil liberties activists on both the left wing and right wing claim are unacceptably [[Orwellian]].

==ARPA and DARPA in culture==
In the [[Computer and video games|video game]] series ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', both ARPA and DARPA are mentioned as part of the plotline, and references how ARPA eventually became DARPA in the future. Note also the controversial proposal for a [[Policy Analysis Market]], using an electronic futures market to aid allowed trading of futures contracts based on possible political developments in several [[Middle Eastern| Middle East]] countries

'''Dunstan''' ([[909]]&amp;ndash;[[May 19]] [[988]]) was an [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] ([[961]]&amp;ndash;[[988]]) who was later [[canonization|canonized]] as a [[saint]]. He gained fame for the many stories told about his cunning in dealing with the [[Devil]].

He began his career at [[Glastonbury]], becoming abbot in [[945]].  The abbey flourished under his administration, with a substantial extension of the irrigation system on the surrounding [[Somerset Levels]]. Following the accession of King [[Edwy of England]], he became less influential and went overseas to [[Flanders]]. On his return, in [[957]], he imported [[Benedictine]] customs, becoming bishop of [[Worcester, England|Worcester]] and [[London]] in [[959]], and in [[961]] became Archbishop of Canterbury, under King [[Edgar of England]]. Having crowned Edgar in [[973]], he performed the same service for his successor, [[Edward the Martyr]], and later for [[Ethelred the Unready]]. The service is still used as the basis for contemporary [[United Kingdom|British]] coronations. He died in [[988]] and was canonized in [[1029]].

He functions as the [[patron saint]] of [[goldsmith]]s, and himself worked as a [[blacksmith]], [[painter]], and [[jeweller]]. [[English literature]] contains many references to him, for example in [[A Christmas Carol]] by [[Charles Dickens]], and in this folk rhyme:

:St Dunstan, as the story goes,
:Once pull'd the devil by the nose
:With red-hot tongs, which made him roar,
:That he was heard three miles or more.

From this the tongs have become a symbol of St Dunstan and are featured in the arms of [[Tower Hamlets]].

Another story relates how Dunstan nailed a horseshoe to the Devil's hoof when he was asked to reshod the Devil's horse. This caused the Devil great pain, and Dunstan only agreed to remove the shoe and release the Devil after he promised never to enter a place where a horseshoe is over the door. This is claimed as the origin of the lucky horseshoe.

The Church marks his [[feast day]] on [[May 19]].

==Popular culture==
* In the [[Dark Horse Comics]] series [[Hellboy]] by [[Mike Mignola]], the legend of St. Dunstan is referenced in the story ''Box Full of Evil'' (a two-issue tale included in the graphic novel ''The Right Hand of Doom'').  The story is embellished upon so that not only did St. Dunstan pinch the devil's nose with tongs, he also hammered the devil's head on an anvil before sealing him away in a box.  A thousand years later, in the present day, the box and its key are recovered by the scam artist Igor Bromhead, who opens it.  In doing so he unleashes its captive devil Ualac, a minor demon of Hell who covets Hellboy's Crown of the Apocalypse.
*In [[Robertson Davies|Robertson Davies']] acclaimed novel ''[[Fifth Business]]'', at the prompting of his lover, the protagonist changes his name from Dunstable to [[Dunstan Ramsay]] based on the saint's life and personality.  Ramsay is meant to personify Saint Dunstan in the novel, especially considering the saint's meeting with the [[Devil]].
* [[Manly Wade Wellman]] often made reference to St. Dunstan in his stories.  His [[occult detective]] character [[Judge Pursuivant]] carried a [[sword cane]] with a silver blade forged by the saint.  A later character, [[John Thunstone]] had even closer connections to the character.  The name &quot;Thunstone&quot; was meant to evoke &quot;Dunstan.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Deprogramming''' refers to actions to force a person to abandon allegiance to a religious group. Most deprogrammings in the U.S. and Japan are commissioned by parents of adult children, which has lead to controversies over [[freedom of religion]] and [[civil rights]]. 

Supporters of deprogramming portray the practice as an antidote to illegitimate or deceptive [[religious conversion]] practices by &quot;[[cult]]s&quot;, variously called [[mind control]], [[brainwashing]], [[thought reform]], or [[coercive persuasion]]. They describe it as a last resort for families who feel that their loved ones have been taken away from them.

The validity and legality of deprogramming has been attacked by members of [[new religious movement]]s (NRM), by professor [[Eileen Barker]], and other scholars.  Their common argument asserts that it is dangerous and illegal to [[kidnap]] someone from any organization in which they voluntarily participate.  Barker further argues that if the deprogramming fails then it will only widen the rift between the member of the NRM and his or her family.

Sometimes the word ''deprogramming'' is used in a wider sense, to mean the freeing of someone (often oneself) from any previously uncritically assimilated [[idea]].

== Deprogramming procedures ==

There has never been any &quot;standard&quot; deprogramming procedure and the descriptions vary greatly. There are many anecdotal reports and studies involving interviews of former deprogrammees. [[Steve Dubrow-Eichel]] did a professional study and analysis of the deprogramming of an [[ISKCON]] member which he accompagnied and taped to a great part (with voluntary consent of all participants).

Deprogrammers generally operate on the assumption that the persons they are paid to extract from religious organizations are victims of [[mind control]] (or &quot;[[brainwashing]]&quot;). Books written by deprogrammers and [[exit counseling|exit counselor]]s assert that the most essential part of &quot;freeing the mind&quot; of the person is to convince him that he had been under &quot;control&quot;. 

In practice, the vast majority of the time spent during deprogramming sessions is the marshalling of evidence aimed at proving that the &quot;cult&quot; deceived and manipulated the recruit into joining. Once the person accepts this premise, the remainder of the process is relatively easy.

Psychologist Steve Dubrow-Eichel found in published deprogramming accounts besides a lot of variations a number of common factors:
* voluntary or involuntary removal from the cultic milieu
* establishing a personal relationship
* disputing cult information and imparting new information on the cult
* interference with cult-supported attentional patterns used to block oneself from outside influences (chanting, self-induced trance states, etc.)
* an overt or covert sign that the deprogrammee has renounced his or her allegiance to the cult

The deprogramming observed by Dubrow-Eichel did not stress emotion, but information and logical analysis of contradiction between words and deeds of the ISCON leaders.

[[Ted Patrick]], one of the pioneers of deprogramming, used a confrontational method:
:&quot;When you deprogram people, you force them to think. ... But I keep them off balance and this forces them to begin questioning, to open their minds. When the mind gets to a certain point, they can see through all the lies that they've been programmed to believe. They realize that they've been duped and they come out of it. Their minds start working again. &quot;

Sylvia Buford, an associate of Ted Patrick who has assisted him on many deprogrammings, described five stages of deprogramming (Stoner, C., &amp; Parke, J. (1977). All God's children: The cult experience - salvation or slavery? Radrior, PA: Chilton ):
* Discredit the figure of authority:  the cult leader
* Present contradictions (ideology vs. reality): &quot;How can he preach love when he exploits people?&quot; is an example.
* The breaking point:  When a subject begins to listen to the deprogrammer; when reality begins to take precedence over ideology.
* Self-expression:  When the subject begins to open up and to voice some of his own gripes against the cult.
* Identification and transference:  when the subject begins to identify with the deprogrammers, starts to think of himself as an opponent of the cult rather than a member of it. 

=== Deprogramming and kidnapping ===

Deprogramming has often been associated with [[kidnapping]], which has in some cases been part of the procedure. The percentage of cases involving kidnapping varies a lot, depending on the source.  Joseph Szimhart, a former deprogrammer, says ''&quot;until [[1992]], in a low percentage of my cases, included situations in which families elected to confine and sometimes abduct a 'cultist' to a deprogramming.&quot;'' (Kent &amp; Szimhart, 2002). Former deprogrammer Rick Ross states that 90% of his deprogrammings since [[1982]] had been voluntary  [http://www.rickross.com/reference/deprogramming/deprogramming9.html], other figures talk about 30% of the cases including kidnapping.

=== Deprogramming and violence ===

The deprogramming accounts vary a lot regarding the use of force, with the most dramatic accounts coming from deprogrammees who returned to the cult.

[[Steven Hassan]] in his book ''Releasing the Bonds'' spoke decidedly against coercive deprogramming methods using force or threats.

The deprogramming case observed by Dubrow-Eichel did not include any violence.

Sociologist Eileen Barker wrote in [http://www.cesnur.org/2001/london2001/barker.htm Watching for Violence]:
:&quot;Although deprogramming has become less violent in the course of time ... Numerous testimonies by those who were subjected to a deprogramming describe how they were threatened with a gun, beaten, denied sleep and food and/or sexually assaulted. But one does not have to rely on the victims for stories of violence: [[Ted Patrick]], one of the most notorious deprogrammers used by CAGs (who has spent several terms in prison for his exploits) openly boasts about some of the violence he employed; in November 1987, [[Cyril Vosper]], a Committee member of the British cult-awareness group, [[Family Action Information Resource|FAIR]], was convicted in Munich of &quot;causing bodily harm&quot; in the course of one of his many deprogramming attempts; and a number of similar convictions are on record for prominent members of CAGs elsewhere.&quot; 

In ''Colombrito vs. Kelly'', the Court accepted the definition of deprogramming by J. Le Moult published in 1978 in the Fordham Law Review:
:&quot;Deprogrammers are people who, at the request of a parent or other close relative, will have a member of a religious sect seized, then hold him against his will and subject him to mental, emotional, and even physical pressures until he renounces his religious beliefs. Deprogrammers usually work for a fee, which may easily run as high as $25,000. The deprogramming process begins with abduction. Often strong men muscle the subject into a car and take him to a place where he is cut from everyone but his captors. He may be held against his will for upward of three weeks. Frequently, however, the initial deprogramming only last a few days. The subject's sleep is limited and he is told that he will not be released until his beliefs meet his captors' approval. Members of the deprogramming group, as well as members of the family, come into the room where the victim is held and barrage him with questions and denunciations until he recants his newly found religion &quot;

Exit counselor Carol Giambalvo writes in [http://www.csj.org/studyindex/studyintervention/study_deprog_threfrmconsult.htm From Deprogramming to Thought Reform Consultation]
:&quot;It was believed that the hold of the brainwashing over the cognitive processes of a cult member needed to be broken – or &quot;snapped&quot; as some termed it – by means that would shock or frighten the cultist into thinking again. For that reason in some cases cult leader's pictures were burned or there were highly confrontational interactions between deprogrammers and cultist. What was often sought was an emotional  response to the information, the shock, the fear, and the confrontation. There are horror stories – promoted most vehemently by the cults themselves – about restraint, beatings, and even rape. And we have to admit that we have met former members who have related to us their deprogramming experience – several of handcuffs, weapons wielded and sexual abuse. But thankfully, these are in the minority – and in our minds, never justified. Nevertheless, deprogramming helped to free many individuals held captive to destructive cults at a time when other alternatives did not seem viable. &quot;

== History ==

The American Ted Patrick was one of its most prominent proponents. Most of the deprogramming cases took place in the [[United States]], with only sporadic cases in [[Western Europe]].  In Europe, attempts to justify deprogramming continue on the basis of opinions by psychiatrists and psychologists, even though in the United States, such opinions have been successfully challenged in court and debunked by the [[APA]]. [http://www.cesnur.org/conferences/BrainWash.htm]

:&quot;The number of forcible deprogrammings had diminished by the end of the [[1980s]]. Not only did the anticult movement lose the academic battle to make its theories accepted, the legal battle to make its activity excusable, and the legislative battle to pass laws that would allow it to 'legalize' its activity, but it also became obvious how easy it was to defeat deprogramming. The person just had, at some point, to pretend to go along with deprogrammers. The deprogrammer then 'recognized' that the person had snapped out of the cult 'mind-control' (which proves that this notion is based on nothing else than animus towards the person's choice) and switched to the 'rehabilitation' phases, then released him - after which the deprogrammer found himself in front of the Court.&quot; [http://bernie.cncfamily.com/sc/can.htm]

==Controversy and related issues==

One of the points which fired deprogramming controversies was the fact that they were in the majority of cases successful.

One of main objections raised to deprogramming (as well as to [[exit counseling]]) is the contention that they begin with a false premise. Lawyers for some groups who have lost members due to deprogramming, as well as some [[civil libertarian]]s, [[sociologist]]s and [[psychologist]]s, argue that it is not the religious groups but rather the deprogrammers who are the ones who deceive and manipulate people.

Public support for deprogramming hinges on the degree to which people agree or disagree with the [[mind control]] model. In the United States, from the mid-[[1970s]] and throughout the [[1980s]] [[mind control]] was widely accepted, and the vast majority of [[newspaper]] and [[magazine]] accounts of deprogrammings assumed that recruits' relatives were well justified to seek [[conservatorship]]s and to hire deprogrammers. It took nearly 20 years for public opinion to shift.

One aspect that gradually became disturbing from a civil rights point of view, was that relatives would use deception, or legal dealings or even kidnapping to get the recruit into deprogrammers' hands, without allowing the person any recourse to a lawyer or psychiatrist of their own choosing. In the old days, there would be a sanity hearing first, and only then a commitment to an asylum or involuntary therapy. But with deprogramming, judges routinely granted parents legal authority over their adult children without a hearing.

After 10 or 15 years of this, some adult children began suing their parents or deprogrammers. Also, in the mid-1980s, psychologist [[Margaret Singer]] lost her status as an [[expert witness]] when the APA declined to endorse the DIMPAC report. From this point on, deprogramming's legal basis almost immediately vanished, and some deprogrammers re-styled themselves as &quot;exit counselors&quot;. See also ''[[Brainwashing#Brainwashing_controversy_in_new_religious_movements|Brainwashing controversy in new religious movements]]''.

Since that time, deprogramming has been virtually unknown in the United States.

Deprogrammers claim that the voluntary participation is due to &quot;[[mind control]],&quot; a controversial theory that a person's thought processes can be changed by outside forces. They justify this intervention or &quot;therapy&quot; as necessary to bring the person out from under the influence of the group's &quot;mind control.&quot; The existence of mind control is widely disputed, and sometimes dismissed as [[pseudoscience]] by the [[psychiatry|psychiatric establishment]].  Modern [[behaviorism|behavorist psychology]], however, can do much to explain the ability of external forces to control actions even if it has studied little regarding the internal thought processes associated with them (although [[relational framing]] and other theoretical constructs hedge into such territory).  Present-day psychological principles suggest that traditional deprogramming approaches would almost certainly be inferior to other forms of intervention.  Even supposing mind control is possible, it would be extremely difficult to prove to a legal standard that any individual person's mind has been controlled.  In light of the legal and psychological issues, less intrusive and more patient-oriented interventions will likely replace this practice completely.

Deprogramming has fallen into disfavor because of its controversial aspects.  As a result of the CAN judgement, a number of prominent [[anti-culu.com/ ''Duke's'' restaurant website]

[[Image:Distservmedal.jpg|right]]

The '''Distinguished Service Medal''' is a [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|military award]] of the [[United States Army]] which is presented to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the [[United States military]], has distinguished himself or herself by exceptionally meritorious service to the Government in a duty of great responsibility. The performance must be such as to merit recognition for service which is clearly exceptional. Exceptional performance of normal duty will not alone justify an award of this decoration.

Separate Distinguished Service Medals exist for the different branches of the military as well as a fifth version of the medal which is a senior award of the United States Department of Defense.  The Army version of the Distinguished Service Medal is typically referred to simply as the &quot;Distinguished Service Medal&quot; while the other branches of service use the service name as a prefix.  

For service not related to actual war, the term &quot;duty of a great responsibility&quot; applies to a narrower range of positions than in time of war, and requires evidence of conspicuously significant achievement. However, justification of the award may accrue by virtue of exceptionally meritorious service in a succession of high positions of great importance.

Awards may be made to persons other than members of the Armed Forces of the [[United States]] for wartime services only, and then only under exceptional circumstances, with the express approval of the President in each case.

==Design of the Distinguished Service Medal==
The medal consists of the Coat of Arms of the United States in Gold surrounded by a circle of Dark Blue enamel, 1.5 inches (38 mm) in diameter, bearing the inscription &quot;&lt;small&gt;FOR DISTINGUISHED SERVICE MCMXVIII&lt;/small&gt;&quot;. On the reverse is a scroll for the name of the recipient (which is to be engraved) upon a trophy of flags and weapons. The medal is suspended by a bar attached to the ribbon.  The ribbon is 1 3/8 inches (35 mm) wide and consists of the following stripes: 5/16 inch (8 mm) scarlet 67111; 1/16 inch (2 mm) ultramarine blue 67118; 5/8 inch (16 mm) white 67101; 1/16 inch (2 mm) ultramarine blue; and 5/16 inch (8 mm) scarlet.

Additional awards of the Distinguished Service Medal are denoted by [[oak leaf cluster]]s.

==History of the Distinguished Service Medal==
The Distinguished Service Medal was authorized by Presidential Order dated [[January 2]], [[1918]], and confirmed by Congress on [[July 9]], [[1918]]. It was announced by War Department General Order No. 6, [[January 12]], [[1918]], with the following information concerning the medal: &quot;A bronze medal of appropriate design and a ribbon to be worn in lieu thereof, to be awarded by the President to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the Army shall hereafter distinguish himself or herself, or who, since [[April 6]], [[1917]], has distinguished himself or herself by exceptionally meritorious service to the Government in a duty of great responsibility in time of war or in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United States.&quot; The Act of Congress on [[July 9]], [[1918]], recognized the need for different types and degrees of heroism and meritorious service and included such provisions for award criteria. The current statutory authorization for the Distinguished Service Medal is Title 10, [[United States Code]], Section 3743.

Among the first awards of the Distinguished Service Medal for service in World War I, were those to the Commanding Officers of the Allied Armies: Marshals Foch and Joffre, [[Henri Philippe Pétain|General Petain]] of France, Field Marshal Haig of the United Kingdom, General Monash of Australia, General Diaz of Italy, General Gillain of Belgium,then Colonel Douglas MacArthur, and General Pershing.

The '''Defense Distinguished Service Medal''' is a [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|United States military award]] which is presented for exceptionally distinguished performance of duty contributing to national security or defense of the [[United States]].  The decoration is awarded only at the highest levels of the military while assigned to a joint activity. The DDSM may also be awarded to other senior officers whose direct and individual contributions to [[national security]] or defense are recognized as being so exceptional in scope and value as to be equivalent to contributions normally associated with positions encompassing broader responsibilities.

It is the [[United States]]'s highest peacetime defense award. Normally, such responsibilities deserving of the Defense Distinguished Service Medal are held by the most senior officers such as the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], the Chiefs and Vice Chiefs of the Services, and [[Commander]]s and Deputy Commanders of the Unified Commands whose duties bring them into direct contact with the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] and other senior officials. 

The medal is [[gold]] in color and on the obverse it features a medium blue [[enamel]]ed pentagon (point up). Superimposed on this is an [[Bald Eagle|American bald eagle]] with wings outspread facing left grasping three crossed arrows in its talons and on its breast is a shield of the United States. The pentagon and eagle are enclosed within a gold pieced circle consisting, in the upper half of thirteen five-pointed stars and in the lower half, a wreath of [[laurel]] on the left and [[olive]] on the right. At the top is a suspender of five graduated gold rays. The reverse of the medal has the inscription &quot;For Distinguished Service&quot; at the top in raised letters, and within the pentagon the inscription &quot;From The Secretary of Defense To,&quot; all in raised letters. This decoration takes precedence over the [[Distinguished Service Medal (USA)|Distinguished Service Medal]]s of the separate services and is not to be awarded to any individual for a period of service for which an [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] or [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] Distinguished Service Medal is awarded.

'''Davis''' is a city located in [[Yolo County, California]].  As of the local census, the city had a total population of 64,821 (60,308 in 2000).  Davis is well-known in the state of [[California]] as being a socially and environmentally conscious university town.

== History ==
Davis grew around a [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] depot which was built in 1868. It was then known as &quot;Davisville&quot;, named for [[Jerome C. Davis]], a prominent local farmer. However, the post office at Davisville shortened the town name to simply &quot;Davis&quot; in 1907. The name stuck, and the city of Davis was incorporated in March  1917.

From its inception as a farming community, Davis has been known for its contributions to agriculture along with veterinary care and [[animal husbandry]]. This has especially been true ever since the [[University of California]] decided to build a [[land grant]] university there in 1908. Now the city is also known for its contributions in the areas of [[biotechnology]], [[medicine]] and other [[life sciences]].

== Geography ==
[[Image:CAMap-doton-Davis.png|right|frame| Location of Davis in Yolo County, California, USA]]Davis is located at {{coor dms|38|33|14|N|121|44|17|W}} (38.553856, -121.738095){{GR|1}} in [[Yolo County, California]]. The city is 18 km (11 mi) west of [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], 113 km (72 mi) northeast of [[San Francisco]], 619 km (385 mi) north of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], at the intersection of [[Interstate 80]] and [[California State Highway 113]].  Neighboring towns include [[Dixon, California|Dixon]], [[Winters, California|Winters]], and [[Woodland, California|Woodland]].

Davis lies in the [[Sacramento Valley]] portion of the [[Central Valley]] in [[Northern California]], at an elevation of about 16 [[metre | m]] (52 [[foot (unit of length) | ft]]) above [[sea level | MSL]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 27.1 [[square kilometre|km&amp;sup2;]] (10.5 [[square mile|mi&amp;sup2;]]).  27.1 km&amp;sup2; (10.4 mi&amp;sup2;) of it is land and 0.1 km&amp;sup2; (0.04 mi&amp;sup2;) of it is water.  The total area is 0.19% water.

The [[topography]] of Davis is very flat, which has helped Davis to become known as a haven for [[bicycle | bicyclists]].

== Climate ==
The climate in Davis resembles that of nearby [[Sacramento, CA | Sacramento]]. Davis is, however, closer to [[San Francisco Bay]] and the [[Sacramento River Delta]], which moderates the more extreme temperatures found elsewhere in the [[Sacramento Valley]] and nearby [[San Joaquin Valley]]. Summers in Davis are dry and hot, while winters are rainy and mild.

== Demographics ==
As of the [[United States 2000 Census]]{{GR|2}}, there are 60,308 people, 22,948 households, and 11,290 families residing in the city.  The [[population density]] is 2,228.2/km&amp;sup2; (5,769.2/mi&amp;sup2;).  There are 23,617 housing units at an average density of 872.6/km&amp;sup2; (2,259.3/mi&amp;sup2;).  The racial makeup of the city is 70.07% [[Race (U.S. Census)|White]], 2.35% [[Race (U.S. Census)|Black]] or [[Race (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.67% [[Race (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 17.54% [[Race (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.24% [[Race (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 4.26% from [[Race (U.S. Census)|other races]], and 4.87% from two or more races.  9.61% of the population are [[Hispanic American | Hispanic]] or [[Race (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race.

There are 22,948 households out of which 26.4% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 38.3% are [[Marriage | married couples]] living together, 8.2% have a female householder with no husband present, and 50.8% are non-families. 25.0% of all households are made up of individuals and 5.2% have someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older.  The average household size is 2.50 and the average family size is 3.00.

In the city the population is spread out with 18.6% under the age of 18, 30.9% from 18 to 24, 27.1% from 25 to 44, 16.7% from 45 to 64, and 6.6% who are 65 years of age or older.  The median age is 25 years.  For every 100 females there are 91.2 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there are 87.8 males.

The median income for a household in the city is $42,454, and the median income for a family is $74,051. Males have a median income of $51,189 versus $36,082 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city is $22,937.  24.5% of the population and 5.4% of families are below the [[poverty line]].  Out of the total population, 6.8% of those under the age of 18 and 2.8% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line.

Demographics are unusual, even among &quot;college towns&quot;. This city of approximately 65,000 people is home to a university campus of 31,000 students.

==Bicycling==
Being flat, Davis is naturally a very good place for bicyclists. The town has taken advantage of that precursor, and when it expands, new bike paths are usually mandated by the city. As a result, Davis is covered in bike paths, and biking is one of the more common types of transportation, used especially by [[UC Davis]] students because of bicycling's relative inexpensiveness. Davis has been referred to as the &quot;Most bicycle friendly town in the world&quot;, as most of the bike paths are in good repair, and one can get just about anywhere without leaving bike paths or bike lanes in streets.

== Sights and Events ==
===Farmers Market===
Every Wednesday evening and Saturday morning, families and friends flock to the Central Park (on 4th and C street) in Davis to buy fresh produce, a healthy meal or baked goods at the '''Davis Farmers Market'''.  Open rain or shine, this event allows the participation of independent farmers, non-profit organizations, craftsmens and local businesses represented in a communal atmosphere. 

The times for the year-round Saturday market are from 8:00 a.m.-1:00 p.m. while the Wednesday market changes times with the season.  During the month of April to October runs the popular ''Picnic in the Park'' from 4:30-8:30 p.m. while during October through March the market is from 2:00-6:00 p.m. 

Available products include fruits and vegetables that are currently in season, baked goods, and dairy and meat products, often from certified organic farms.  With such a wide variety of produce and foods, many people can do the majority of their shopping here.  The available stands, shoppers and overall atmosphere greatly depend on each particular market.  For example ''Picnic in the Park'' is geared towards family attendance during dinner time because of the presence of a band and multiple restaurants.  Some of which include The Buckhorn, Katmandu and The Hotdogger.  While during the fall and winter months this market becomes smaller in size and geared mainly towards weekly shoppers.  The Saturday market includes some local restaurants along with a performing group, craft persons and various non-profit organizations.

=== Toad Tunnel ===
[[Image:toadhotel.jpg|thumb|The Post Office is a great place to stay if you're a toad.]]

Davis' '''[[Toad]] Tunnel''' has drawn much attention over the years including a mention on [[The Daily Show]].  Because of the building of an overpass, animal lovers worried about toads being killed by cars commuting from South Davis to North Davis, since the toads hopped from one side of a dirt lot (which the overpass replaced) to the reservoir at the other end. After much controversy, a decision was made to build a toad tunnel, which runs beneath the Pole Line Road overpass.

The tunnel has created problems of its own.  The toads originally refused to use the tunnel and so the tunnel was lighted to encourage its use.  The toads then died from the heat of the lamps inside the tunnel.  The exit to the toad tunnel has been decorated by the Post-Master to resemble a toad town.

=== Whole Earth Festival ===
The '''Whole Earth Festival''' [http://wef.ucdavis.edu (WEF)] is a three-day music and education festival in the Spring, which usually takes place during Mother's Day Weekend on UC Davis' main quadrangle.  It is considered by many to be a must-see Davis event.  Every year, thousands of environmentally conscious, politically active and/or music-loving people make the pilgrimage to Davis for this event, for which the UCD quad is filled with hundreds of craft booths, music acts, education booths, and food booths.

A continuous stream of bands, speakers and various workshops occurs throughout the weekend on each of WEF's three stages and other specialty areas. The majority of the festival is solar powered.

WEF is organized primarily by UC Davis students, in association with the Associated Students of UC Davis (ASUCD) and the university.

=== UC Davis Arboretum ===
The [[University of California, Davis, Arboretum]] is a fine [[arboretum]] and [[botanical garden]].  California natives and desert plants are just two of the different plant types grown there.  In addition there is a nice redwood grove at one end of the arboretum.  There is a small river running through the arboretum and a pond in its center, which is home to many ducks and geese.  You can also occasionally see herons, kingfishers, and cormorants.  Tours of the arboretum are often held for children who are still in grade school.

=== Picnic Day ===
'''Picnic Day''' is an annual event held on the [[University of California, Davis]] during the month of April and is the largest student-run event in the US.  Picnic Day starts off with a parade (which starts and ends with the California Aggie Marching Band-Uh. Yes, they march it twice!) that runs through campus and around downtown Davis and ends with the Battle of the Bands, which lasts until the last band stops playing (sometimes until 2 am). There are over 150 free events  and over 50,000 attend every year. Other highlights include: the [[Dachshund]] races, aka: the Doxie Derby, held in the Rec Hall, the Davis Rock Challenge, the Chemistry Magic Show (sells out in advance), the sheep dog trials, and of course the wonderful food made by student groups. Picnic Day is also known for the copious amounts of alcohol students consume all day long.

===Domestication and use===
[[Image:Elephant.pair.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[African]] Savannah Elephant (left) and [[Asian]] Elephant at an [[England|English]] [[zoo]].]]

Elephants have been [[working animals]] used in various capacities by humans. Seals found in the Indus Valley suggest that the elephant was first domesticated in ancient India. However, elephants have never been truly domesticated: the male elephant in his periodic condition of ''[[musth]]'' is dangerous and difficult to control. Therefore elephants used by humans have typically been female, war elephants being an exception, however: as female elephants in battle will run from a male, only males could be used in war. It is generally more economical to capture wild young elephants and tame them than breeding them in captivity (see also [[Elephant &quot;Crushing&quot;|elephant &quot;crushing&quot;]]).

[[War elephant]]s were used by armies in the Indian sub-continent, and later by the [[Persian empire]]. This use was adopted by [[Hellenistic]] armies after Alexander the Great experienced their worth against king [[Poros]], notably in the [[Ptolemaic]] and [[Seleucid]] diadoch empires. The [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] general [[Hannibal]] took elephants across the [[Alps]] when he was fighting the [[Roman Republic|Romans]], but brought too few elephants to be of much military use, although his horse cavalry was quite successful; he probably used a now-extinct third African (sub)species, the North African (Forest) elephant, smaller than its two southern cousins, and presumably easier to domesticate. A large elephant in full charge could cause tremendous damage to infantry, and cavalry horses would be afraid of them (see [[Battle of Hydaspes]]).

Throughout [[Siam]], [[India]], and most of South Asia elephants were used in the military for heavy labor, especially for uprooting trees and moving logs, and were also commonly used as executioners to [[crushing by elephant|crush the condemned underfoot]].

[[Image:Elephant-tracks.jpg|thumb|right|top|200px|Elephant footprints (tyre tracks for scale)]]
Elephants have also been used as mounts for safari-type [[hunting]], especially Indian ''shikar'' (mainly on tigers), and as ceremonial mounts for royal and religious occasions, whilst Asian elephants have been used for [[transport]] and [[entertainment]], and are common to [[Circus (performing art)|circuses]] around the world.

African elephants have long been reputed to not be domesticable, but some entrepreneurs have succeeded by bringing Asian [[mahout]]s from [[Sri Lanka]] to Africa. In Botswana, [[Uttum Corea]] has been working with African elephants and has several young tame elephants near [[Gaborone]]. African elephants are more temperamental than Asian elephants, but are easier to train. Because of their more sensitive temperaments, they require different training methods than Asian elephants and must be trained from infancy hence Corea worked with orphaned elephants. African elephants are now being used for (photo) safaris. Corea's elephants are also used to entertain tourists and haul logs.

It should be noted that elephants cannot jump.

===The Elephant Trap===
Another more effective method is practiced in the Indian Subcontinent which is far less physical and brutal, and more psychological. It is called the &quot;elephant trap&quot;. The following is taken from a newsletter. &quot;From when an elephant is a baby they tie him for certain periods with a rope to a tree. The young elephant tries his hardest to escape, he pulls and wriggles and jumps and crawls yet the rope just tightens and to the tree it remains tied. Learning that, the elephant doesn’t try to escape and accepts his confinement. A couple of years pass and the elephant is now an adult weighing several tons. Yet the trainer continues to tie the elephant to the tree with the same rope he’s always used, for the simple reason that the elephant has the concept in his mind that the rope is stronger than him. Abiding to this conditioning the elephant is trapped for life. To break free all the elephant has to do is erase that limiting thought for in fact he is free to go.&quot;

===Elephants in Culture===
====Pop culture====
[[Image:KandyPerahara.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Esala Perahera]] in [[Kandy]], [[Sri Lanka]]]]

* [[Jumbo]], a [[Circus (performing art)|circus]] elephant, has entered the English language as a synonym for &quot;large&quot;;
* [[Dumbo]], the flying elephant in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] movie;
*The French children's storybook character [[Babar the Elephant]] (an elephant king) created by [[Jean de Brunhoff]] and also an animated TV series;
* ''[[The Elephant's Child]]'' is one of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Just So Stories]]'';
* The [[Thai Elephant Orchestra]], a musical instrument playing group of Elephants from the [[National Elephant Institute|Thai Elephant Conservation Center]] in [[Lampang]];
*[[Joseph Merrick]], a British man in [[Victorian England]], who suffered from substantial deformities, and was nicknamed &quot;[[The Elephant Man]]&quot; due to the nature and extent of his condition;
*The fictional planet in [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]''  novels consists of a [[Discworld (world)|flat disc-shaped world]] carried on the backs of four elephants who ride through space on a space turtle, [[Great A'Tuin]].

A common [[adage]] is that &quot;Elephants never forget&quot;, and later scientific evidence seems to support they have good memories.

====Religion====
* A [[White elephant (pachyderm)|white elephant]] is considered holy in [[Thailand]].
* [[Ganesh]], the [[Hindu]] god of wisdom, has an elephant's head.
* [[Elephants used for festival, south India]]

====Politics and secular Symbolism====
*The elephant, and the white elephant in particular, has often been used a symbol of royal power and prestige in Asia;
*The elephant is also the symbol for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] of the United States, originating in an [[1874]] cartoon by [[Thomas Nast]] of ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' (Nast also originated the [[donkey]] as the symbol of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]);
* See also the Danish royal [[Order of the Elephant]].

===Elephant rage===

There is a cause of elephant rage that is not the result of human activity.  Since male elephants are ostracized from their herds when they become [[sexually mature]], their [[sex hormones]] can lead to aggressive behaviour.

At least a few elephants have been suspected to be drunk during their attacks. In December 1998, a herd of elephants overran a village in India. Although locals reported that nearby elephants had recently been observed drinking beer which rendered them &quot;unpredictable&quot;, officials considered it the least likely explanation for the attack [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/241781.stm]. An attack on another Indian village occurred in October 1999, and again locals believed the reason was drunkenness, but the theory was not widely accepted [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/482001.stm]. Purportedly drunk elephants raided yet another Indian village again on December 2002 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2583891.stm].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Evolutionary linguistics''' is the scientific study of the origins and development of language. The main problem in this research is the lack of empirical data: spoken language leaves no traces behind. This led to an abandonment of the field for many decades. Recently, however, the field is reviving due to the development of new technologies.  
 
[[August Schleicher]] (1821-1868) and his ‘Stammbaumtheorie’ are often quoted as the starting point of evolutionary linguistics. Inspired by the natural sciences, especially biology, Schleicher was the first to compare languages to evolving species. He introduced the representation of language families as an evolutionary tree in articles published in 1853. 

The Stammbaumtheorie proved to be very productive for [[comparative linguistics]], but didn’t solve the major problem of evolutionary linguistics: the lack of fossil records. The field was quickly abandoned, but recent developments in technology have enabled researchers to implement and test evolutionary language models.

One of these researchers is Professor Dr. [[Luc Steels]], head of the research units of Sony CSL in [[Paris]] and the AI Lab at the Free University of Brussels ([[VUB]]). He and his team are investigating ways in which artificial agents self-organize languages with natural-like properties and how meaning can co-evolve with language. Their research is based on the hypothesis that language is a complex adaptive system that emerges through adaptive interactions between agents and continues to evolve in order to remain adapted to the needs and capabilities of the agents. This ongoing research has cumulated over the past ten years and has been implemented in [[Construction grammar#Fluid Construction Grammar|Fluid Construction Grammar (FCG)]], a formalism for construction grammars that has especially been designed for the origins and evolution of language.

The approach of computational modeling and the use of robotic agents grounded in real life is theory independent. It enables the researcher to find out exactly what cognitive capacities are needed for certain language phenomena to emerge. It also forces the researcher to formulate his hypotheses in a precise and exact manner, whereas theoretic models often stay very vague. The precision and theory independence of these kinds of experiments make them of great value for the scientific debate.

[[Image:Silvermine Echelon Antenna 4 - Through the wire.JPG|thumb|right|Antenna 4 (through the wire) in former Echelon intelligence gathering station at [[Silvermine]], [[Cape Peninsula]], [[South Africa]].]]

'''ECHELON''' is a highly secretive world-wide [[SIGINT|signals intelligence]] and analysis network run by the [[UKUSA Community]]. [http://cryptome.org/echelon-nh.htm] ECHELON can capture [[radio]] and [[satellite]] communications, [[telephone]] calls, [[fax]]es and [[e-mail]]s nearly anywhere in the world and includes computer automated analysis and sorting of intercepts. [http://cryptome.org/echelon-60min.htm] ECHELON is estimated to intercept up to 3 billion communications every day.  However, claims that the NSA uses ECHELON to monitor every single electronic communication in the world are untrue, because such an effort would require the most massive communications and computing system on the planet and consume tremendous power and resources.

==History==

Reportedly created to monitor the military and diplomatic communications of the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[East Bloc]] allies during the [[Cold War]] in the early sixties, ECHELON is today believed to also search for hints of [[terrorism|terrorist]] plots, drug-dealers' plans, and political and diplomatic intelligence. But some critics claim the system is also being used for large-scale commercial theft and invasion of [[privacy]]. 
 
In May [[2001]], the [[European Parliament]] produced a report on ECHELON [http://cryptome.org/echelon-ep.htm] which, amongst other things, recommended that citizens of member states routinely use [[cryptography]] in their communications to protect their privacy. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the government introduced the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act]] which gives authorities the power to demand that citizens hand over their [[key (cryptography)|encryption keys]], without a judge-approved warrant. In April [[2004]], the European Union decided to spend 11 million EUR developing secure communication based on [[quantum cryptography]] &amp;mdash; the [[SECOQC]] project &amp;mdash; a system that would theoretically be unbreakable by ECHELON or any other espionage system.

ECHELON monitoring of mobile phones in [[Pakistan]] was reportedly used to track [[Khalid Shaikh Mohammed]] before he was arrested in [[Rawalpindi]] on [[March 1]], [[2003]].

Before the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and the legislation which followed it, US intelligence agencies were generally prohibited from spying on people inside the US and other western countries' intelligence services generally faced similar restrictions within their own countries.  There are allegations, however, that ECHELON and the UKUSA alliance were used to circumvent these restrictions by, for example, having the UK facilities spy on people inside the US and the US facilites spy on people in the UK, with the agencies exchanging data (perhaps even automatically through the ECHELON system without human intervention).

The proposed US-only &quot;[[Total Information Awareness]]&quot; program relied on technology similar to ECHELON, and was to integrate the extensive sources it is legally permitted to survey domestically, with the &quot;taps&quot; already compiled by ECHELON. It was cancelled by the U.S. Congress in [[2004]].

It has been alleged that in [[2002]] the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush Administration]] extended the ECHELON program to [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|domestic surveillance]].  This controversy was the subject of the [[New York Times]] eavesdropping exposé of [[December]], [[2005]]. [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/16program.html] [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/12/16/echelon_in_your_backyard] [http://www.redstate.org/story/2005/12/22/124426/39] [http://www.niagarafallsreporter.com/hanchette185.html]. Testimony by CIA director [[George Tenet]] during the late 1990s indicated that the use of ECHELON during the Clinton administration was authorized by the [[FISA Court]], as required by law [http://thinkprogress.org/2005/12/20/the-echelon-myth/].

==Organization==

The members of the [[English language|English-speaking]] alliance are part of the [[UKUSA]] intelligence alliance that has maintained ties in collecting and sharing intelligence since [[World War II]]. Various sources claim that these states have positioned electronic-intercept stations and space satellites to capture most [[radio]], [[satellite]], [[microwave]], [[mobile phone|cellular]] and [[fiber-optic]] communications traffic. The captured signals are then processed through a series of [[supercomputer]]s, known as ''dictionaries'', that are programmed to search each communication for targeted addresses, words, phrases or even individual voices. 

Each member of the UKUSA alliance is assigned responsibilities for monitoring different parts of the globe. [[Canada|Canada's]] main task used to be monitoring northern portions of the former [[Soviet Union]] and conducting sweeps of all communications traffic that could be picked up from [[embassy|embassies]] around the world. In the post-[[Cold War]] era, a greater emphasis has been placed on monitoring satellite, radio and cellphone traffic originating from [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], primarily in an effort to track drugs and non-aligned paramilitary groups in the region. The [[United States]], with its vast array of spy satellites and listening posts, monitors most of [[Latin America]], [[Asia]], Asiatic [[Russia]] and northern [[China]]. Britain listens in on [[Europe]] and [[Russia]] west of the [[Urals]] as well as [[Africa]]. [[Australia]] hunts for communications originating in [[Indochina]], [[Indonesia]] and southern [[China]]. [[New Zealand]] sweeps the western [[Pacific ocean|Pacific]].

Supporters stress that ECHELON is simply a method of sorting captured signals and is just one of the many arrows in the intelligence community's quiver, along with increasingly sophisticated [[bugging]] and [[communications interception]] techniques, satellite tracking, through-clothing scanning, automated biometric recognition systems that can recognize faces, fingerprints &amp; [[retina]] patterns.

The U.S. [[National Security Agency]], with headquarters at [[Fort Meade]] just outside [[Washington, DC]], has a global staff of 38,000 and a budget estimated at more than US$3.6-billion. The UK equivalent organisation is the Government Communications Headquarters [[GCHQ]] based near Cheltenham. Further, smaller organisations exist to provide communications technology and expertise (e.g. Her Majesty's Government Communication Centre [[HMGCC]]).

By comparison, [[Canada]]'s communications-intelligence operations are conducted by the [[Communications Security Establishment]] (CSE), a branch of the Canadian [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]]. It has a staff of 890 people and an annual budget of $110-million (Cdn). The CSE's headquarters is the Sir [[Samuel Leonard Tilley|Leonard Tilley]] Building on Heron Road in the nation's capital of [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], and its main communications intercept site is located on an old armed-forces radio base in [[Leitrim, Ontario|Leitrim]], just south of Ottawa. 

UKUSA member nations Australia and New Zealand have already confirmed that ECHELON exists (though not specifying any details of its capabilities or operations), and the Netherlands (which isn't an ECHELON participant) have also confirmed the spynet's existence (through a parliamentary hearing). Furthermore, former [[CIA]] Director [[R. James Woolsey]] has admitted using the system to uncover information about foreign companies using [[bribery|bribes]] to win contracts. The information was passed on to US companies and foreign governments were pressed to stop the bribes. Media coverage of a couple of such events tended to give the impression that ECHELON was being used to give the trade secrets of foreign companies to US companies. European aerospace company [[Airbus]] lost a $6 billion contract with Saudi Arabia after the NSA reported that Airbus officials had been bribing Saudi officials to secure the contract [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/820758.stm]. 

==Limits==

The limits of a large system such as ECHELON are defined by its very size. Though the system intercepts 3 billion communications daily, clients must know which intercepted communications to monitor before they can realize an intelligence advantage. For example, in the months before the [[September 11 attacks]] on the United States, [[signal intelligence]] produced by ECHELON developed considerable &quot;chatter&quot;, or snippets of dialogue, that suggested some sort of attack was imminent. Analysts were unable to pin down the details of the attack, though, because operatives planning the attack relied largely on non-electronic communications. Even overt signals, such as a dramatic increase in trading activity of [[stock options]] on companies that were to be damaged in the attacks, failed to alert analysts, apparently because they did not know where within the daily deluge of electronic messages to look, much less how to connect the dots pointing to a specific attack.

==Hardware==

An [http://www.techworld.com/storage/news/index.cfm?NewsID=2430 article] by Chris Mellor claims that ECHELON is built by [[Raytheon]], [[Lockheed Martin]],  and [[Zeta Associates]]. [[Margaret Newsham]] [http://www.agitprop.org.au/stopnato/20000221echelbladn.htm claims] that she designed the software for the system at [[Lockheed Martin]] in [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]], [[California]], under the code name ''P415''. The two main programs are called SILKWORTH and SIRE.

==Ground stations==
Some of the known or suspected ground stations belonging to or participating in the ECHELON network include the following:

===The largest and best-attested ground stations===
* [[Fort Meade]] ([[Maryland]], US) (headquarters of [[NSA]])
* [[Geraldton, Western Australia|Geraldton]] ([[Western Australia]], Australia)
* [[Menwith Hill]] ([[Yorkshire]], UK)
* [[Misawa Air Base]] ([[Japan]])

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about equations in mathematics. For the chemistry term, see [[chemical equation]].''

An '''equation''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] statement, in [[table of mathematical symbols|symbols]], that two things are [[equality (mathematics)|the same]]. Equations are written with the [[equals sign]], as in
:2 + 3 = 5.
Equations are often used to state the equality of two [[expression (mathematics)|expressions]] containing one or more [[variable]]s. For example, given any value of ''x'', it is always true that
:''x'' &amp;minus; ''x'' = 0.
The two equations above are examples of [[identity (mathematics)|identities]]: equations that are [[true (logic)|true]] regardless of the values of any variables that appear within them. The following equation is not an identity:
:''x'' + 1 = 2.
The above equation is false for an infinite number of values of ''x'', except the unique [[root (mathematics)|root]] of the equation, '''x=1'''. Therefore, if the equation is known to be true, it carries information about the value of ''x''. In general, the values of the variables for which the equation is true are called ''solutions''. To [[equation solving|solve an equation]] means to find its solutions.

Many authors reserve the term '''equation''' for an equality which is not an identity. The distinction between the two concepts can be subtle; for example,
:(''x'' + 1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2''x'' + 1
is an identity, while
:(''x'' + 1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x'' + 1
is an equation, whose roots are ''x=0 and x=1''. Whether a statement is meant to be an identity or an equation, carrying information about its variables can usually be determined from its context.

Letters from the beginning of the alphabet like ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ... are often considered [[constant]]s in the context of the discussion at hand, while letters from end of the alphabet, like ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', are usually considered variables.

==Properties==
If an equation in [[elementary algebra|algebra]] is known to be true, the following operations may be used to produce another true equation:

# Any quantity can be [[addition|added]] to both sides.
# Any quantity can be [[subtraction|subtracted]] from both sides.
# Any quantity can be [[multiplication|multiplied]] to both sides.
# Any nonzero quantity can [[division (mathematics)|divide]] both sides.
# Generally, any [[function (mathematics)|function]] can be applied to both sides.

The algebraic properties (1-4) imply that equality is a [[congruence relation]] for a [[field (mathematics)|field]]; in fact, it is essentially the only one.

The most well known system of numbers which allows all of these operations is the [[real numbers]], which is an example of a [[field (mathematics)|field]].  However, if the equation were based on the [[natural number]]s for example, some of these operations (like division and subtraction) may not be valid as negative numbers and non-[[whole numbers]] are not allowed.  The [[integers]] are an example of an [[integral domain]] which does not allow all divisions as, again, whole numbers are needed.  However, subtraction is allowed, and is the [[inverse operator]] in that system.

If a function that is not [[injective]] is applied to both sides of a true equation, the resulting equation will still be true, but it may be less useful. Formally, one has an [[Logical conditional|implication]], not an [[Logical biconditional|equivalence]], so the solution set may get larger. The functions implied in properties (1), (2), and (4) are always injective, as is (3) if we do not multiply by [[0 (number)|zero]]. Some generalized [[Product (mathematics)|products]], such as a [[dot product]], are never injective.

      <comment>/* Examination of definition */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Naturalism''', sometimes also called '''definism''', is a theory in [[meta-ethics]] that holds that ethical terms can be [[definition|defined]]; the meaning of [[ethics|ethical]] sentences can be given in totally non-ethical terms.  So to the question, &quot;Can the meaning of ethical sentences be restated in other words that do not use [[norm (philosophy)|normative]] concepts like 'good' and 'right'?&quot; the naturalist answers, &quot;Definitely.&quot;  On the naturalist's view, ultimately, [[goodness and value theory|goodness]] and right are ''natural properties''--they are ultimately [[properties]] of things that can be located in the [[natural]] [[world]]. The opposite view, [[ethical non-naturalism]], was famously defended by [[G. E. Moore]].

We might give a more detailed definition, in terms of [[proposition]]s and [[reduction]], that, in generalities, expresses the general understanding of the term:

:''Naturalism'' is the view that ethical sentences express propositions and that they can be reduced to nonethical sentences.

==Examination of definition==
The first part of the defintion, &quot;that ethical sentences express propositions&quot; expresses a view called [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]].

 ethical naturalism combines cognitivism with [[moral reductionism]]&amp;mdash;the idea that ethical sentences &quot;can be reduced to nonethical sentences&quot;. Thus, this theory holds that the meaning of ethical statements can be expressed without using ethical terms such as &quot;good&quot; and &quot;right&quot;. In this way, ethical statements become a kind of shorthand, or useful abbreviation, for claims about what are ultimately nonethical facts about human needs or desires.

==Theory of value==
The [[value theory|theory of value]] &amp;mdash; an important branch of [[ethics]] &amp;mdash; contains a number of theories of what &quot;good&quot; means or, construed differently, what general sorts of things are good.  One could look at the theory of value as a way of determining how to reduce goodness to nonethical properties, for there are many examples of such reductions in value theory.  [[Hedonism]], for example, is the view that goodness is ultimately just [[pleasure]].  It should be noted, however, that not all philosophers working on value theory would view their theories as ''reductions''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{attention}}
&lt;!-- ''The following started as a portion of [[User:Larry Sanger/Larry's Text|Larry's Text]], which consists of lectures given by Wikipedia co-founder [[Larry Sanger]] in courses that he taught at [[Ohio State University]].  Wikification and NPOVing are invited.'' --&gt;

'''Ethical non-naturalism''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] position that asserts that [[ethics|ethical]] statements express [[proposition]]s that cannot be reduced to non-ethical statements. 

==Definitions and examples==
[[Ethical naturalism]] and non-naturalism are subcategories of [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]], which holds that ethical statements express propositions. Naturalism is the view that such statements can be further [[reduction|reduced]] to non-ethical statements; non-naturalism is the view that they cannot.

According to [[G. E. Moore]], &quot;[[goodness and value theory|Goodness]] is a simple, undefinable, non-natural [[property (philosophy)|property]].&quot; To call goodness &quot;non-natural&quot; does not mean that it is [[supernatural]] or [[God|divine]]. It does mean, however, that goodness cannot be reduced to natural properties such as needs, wants or pleasures. Moore also stated that a reduction of ethical properties to a divine command would be the same as stating their naturalness. This would be an example of what he referred to as &quot;the [[naturalistic fallacy]].&quot;

Moore claimed that goodness is &quot;[[definition|indefinable]],&quot; i.e., it cannot be defined in any other terms. This is the central claim of non-naturalism. Thus, the meaning of sentences containing the word &quot;good&quot; cannot be explained entirely in terms of sentences not containing the word &quot;good.&quot; One cannot substitute words referring to [[pleasure]], needs or anything else in place of &quot;good.&quot;

Some properties, such as hardness, roundness and dampness, are clearly natural properties. We encounter them in the real world and can [[perception|perceive]] them. On the other hand, other properties, such as being good and being right, are not so obvious. A great novel is considered to be a good thing; goodness may be said to be a property of that novel. Paying one's debts and telling the truth are generally held to be right things to do; rightness may be said to be a property of certain human [[action theory|action]]s.

However, these two types of property are quite different. Those natural properties, such as hardness and roundness, can be perceived and encountered in the real world. On the other hand, it is not immediately clear how to physically see, touch or measure the goodness of a novel or the rightness of an action.

==A difficult question==
Moore did not consider goodness and rightness to be natural properties, i.e., they cannot be defined in terms of any natural properties. How, then, can we know that anything is good and how can we distinguish good from bad? 

Moral epistemology, the part of epistemology (and/or ethics) that studies how we know moral facts and how moral beliefs are justified, has proposed an answer. British epistemologists, following Moore, suggested that humans have a special [[Ability|faculty]], a faculty of moral [[intuition]], which tells us what is good and bad, right and wrong. 

Moral [[intuitionism|intuitionists]] assert that, if we see a good person or a right action, and our faculty of moral intuition is sufficiently developed and unimpaired, we simply intuit that the person is good or that the action is right. Moral intuition is supposed to be a mental process different from other, more familiar faculties like sense-perception, and that moral judgments are its outputs. When someone judges something to be good, or some action to be right, then the person is using the faculty of moral intuition. The faculty is attuned to those non-natural properties. Perhaps the best ordinary notion that approximates moral intuition would be the idea of a [[conscience]].

==Another argument for non-naturalism==
Moore also introduced what is called the [[open question argument]], a position he later rejected. 

Suppose a definition of &quot;good&quot; is &quot;pleasure-causing.&quot; In other words, if something is good, it causes pleasure; if it causes pleasure, then it is, by definition, good. Moore asserted, however, that we could always ask, &quot;But are pleasure-causing things good?&quot; This would always be an [[open question]]. There is no foregone conclusion that, indeed, pleasure-causing things are good. 
In his initial argument, Moore concluded that any similar definition of goodness could be criticized in the same way.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:&lt;span class=&quot;decial attention has been given to women fighters, who made up some 30% of the EPLF's combat troops. By [[1998]], the army had shrunk to 47,000.

In order to fund the demobilization program, the government cut other expenditures, campaigned to raise voluntary contributions, took its first loans, and sought external aid. [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Israel]], and the [[U.S.]] have provided assistance.

Although committed to demobilization, the Government of Eritrea feels it has some legitimate [[security]] concerns and continues to seek U.S. assistance to upgrade its equipment and training with a goal of producing a smaller, more professional, and more efficient army. United States military assistance so far has included deploying in-country training teams, establishing a de-[[land mine|mining]] training program, ship visits during which U.S. service personnel contribute labor and materials for various community relations projects, and the training of Eritrean [[military officer]]s in the United States.

The Eritrean Army is equipped with a hodgepodge of captured [[Ethiopia]]n equipment, mostly of [[Soviet]] origin.

The Military of Eritrea, depending on annual fluctuation, trades positions with [[North Korea]] as the nation that maintains the title as the most militarized state in the world (highest number of active personnel versus total population).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Eritrea}}
[[Eritrea]] is a member in good standing of the [[African Union]] (AU), the succesor of the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU). But it has withdrawn its representative to the AU in protest of the AU's lack of leadership in facilitating the implementation of a binding border decision demarcating the border between Eritrea and [[Ethiopia]]. Eritrea's relationship with the [[United States]] is complicated. Although the two nations have a close working relationship regarding the on-going war on terror, there has been a growing tension in other areas. Eritrea's relationship with [[Italy]] and the [[EU]] has become equally strained in many areas in the last three years.  

Within the region, Eritrea's relations with Ethiopia turned from that of close alliance to a deadly rivalry that cost an estimated one hundred thousand live between May, 1998 to June 2000. 

Eritrea broke diplomatic relations with the [[Sudan]] in December 1994. This action was taken after a long period of increasing tension between the two countries due to a series of cross-border incidents involving the [[Eritrean Islamic Jihad]] (EIJ). Although the attacks did not pose a threat to the stability of the Government of Eritrea (the infiltrators have generally been killed or captured by government forces), the Eritreans believe the [[National Islamic Front]] (NIF) in [[Khartoum]] supported, trained, and armed the insurgents. After many months of negotiations with the Sudanese to try to end the incursions, the Government of Eritrea concluded that the NIF did not intend to change its policy and broke relations. Subsequently, the Government of Eritrea hosted a conference of Sudanese opposition leaders in June 1995 in an effort to help the opposition unite and to provide a credible alternative to the present government in Khartoum.  Eritrea resumed diplomatic relations with Sudan on December 10, 2005.[http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/051210/2005121017.html]

'''Disputes - international:'''
dispute over alignment of boundary with Ethiopia led to armed conflict in 1998. The conflict was slowed by an OAU-sponsored peace treaty signed in December 13, 2000.
In April of 2002 Ethiopia and Eritrea agreed on a common border, drawn up by an independent commission in [[The Hague]] under the auspices of the [[United Nations]].

The '''Republic of Estonia''', or '''Estonia''' ([[Estonian language|Estonian]]: ''Eesti Vabariik'' or ''Eesti'') is a country in [[Northern Europe]] and a member state of [[European Union]] since [[2004]]. It is separated from [[Finland]] in the north by the narrow [[Gulf of Finland]] and from [[Sweden]] in the west by the middle part of the [[Baltic Sea]]. Estonia has land borders with its fellow [[Baltic countries|Baltic country]] [[Latvia]] to the south and [[Russia]] to the east.  

== History ==
{{main|History of Estonia}}
Human settlement in Estonia became possible when the ice, from the last [[Ice Age|glacial era]], melted away 11,000–13,000 years ago.  The oldest known settlement in Estonia was located on the [[Pärnu|Pärnu River]], near the town of Sindi (Pulli settlement, by village Pulli - on right bank of Pärnu River). It dates back to the middle of the 8th millennium BC. 

Estonia was first [[christianization|christianised]] when the [[Germany|German]] &quot;[[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]]&quot; and [[Denmark]] conquered the land by [[1227]]. Subsequent foreign powers that controlled Estonia at various times included Denmark, [[Sweden]], [[Poland]] and finally ([[1710]] de facto, [[1721]] de jure, see [[Treaty of Nystad]]) [[Russia]].  However, the upper classes and the higher middle class remained primarily [[Baltic German]] until roughly 1918. During and immediately after World War II, the remaining Germans were forced out by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and, later, [[Stalin]].

Following the collapse of [[Imperial Russia]] after the [[October Revolution]], Estonia declared itself an independent republic on [[February 24]], [[1918]]. After the [[Estonian Liberation War]] and [[Treaty of Tartu]] signed in [[February 2]], [[1920]] Estonia maintained this independence for twenty-two years, and the very same parliamentary government was reinstated in [[1992]], after the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. It included a parliament called ''Riigikogu'', elected by all Estonian citizens aged 18 or above. ''Riigikogu'' was disbanded in [[1934]] and the country was ruled by decree by [[president]] [[Konstantin Päts]] until the parliamentary elections in [[1938]].

The country was occupied by Soviet troops in [[June]] [[1940]], as a consequence of the [[1939]] [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Many of its political and intellectual leaders were killed or repressed, including Estonia's first president Konstantin Päts, who was deported to [[Russia]]. The country was occupied by the German [[Third Reich]] from [[1941]] to [[1944]], when Soviet forces reconquered it. Estonia regained its independence on [[August 20]], [[1991]], with the [[Singing Revolution]] and the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]]. [[August 20]] is now a national holiday in Estonia.

The last Russian troops left on [[August 31]], [[1994]], and Estonia joined [[NATO]] on [[March 29]], [[2004]] and the [[European Union]] on [[May 1]], [[2004]].

Estonia signed a border agreement with [[Russia]] on [[May 18]], [[2005]], slightly redefining the border they had been using since [[1991]], which the [[Riigikogu]], the Estonian parliament, ratified on [[June 20]], [[2005]]. However, Russia took exception to Estonia's preamble to the law, which makes references to the Estonian state's uninterrupted legal continuity during the Soviet period and indirect references to the [[Occupation of Baltic Republics|Soviet occupation]] of Estonia and announced that it is revoking its signature and that it desires to restart negotiations with Estonia.   
   
Estonia has said that there is no need to renegotiate the border and that it has no land claims against Russia. 

=== Etymology ===

After Estonia regained independence in 1991, a public debate ensued on the chosen [[English language]] name for Estonia. The ending ''–onia'' in the name ''Estonia'' (earlier also ''Esthonia'') is of [[Latin]] origin. Many Estonians tend to identify more with Northern Europe, and would prefer the country to have a more Nordic-sounding name. The most widely-known of these alternative English language names is ''Estland'', which is in fact the name for the country in most other [[Germanic languages]] (e.g., [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]).

== Politics ==
[[Image:Estonian parliament building.jpg|thumb|right|256px|The Estonian Parliament building in Tallinn]]
{{main|Politics of Estonia}}
Estonia is a [[constitution]]al [[democracy]], with a president elected by its unicameral [[parliament]] (elections every four years). The government or the [[executive branch]] is formed by the prime minister, nominated by the president, and a total of 14 ministers. The government is appointed by the president after approval by the parliament.

[[Legislative]] power lies with the unicameral parliament, the [[Riigikogu]] or State Assembly, which consists of 101 seats. Members are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. The supreme [[judiciary]] court is the National Court or ''Riigikohus'', with 19 justices whose chairman is appointed by the parliament for life on nomination by the president.

[[Internet voting]] has already been used in local elections in Estonia, and the lawmakers in Estonia have authorized internet voting for parliamentary elections as well. [http://news.com.com/Estonia+pulls+off+nationwide+Net+voting/2100-1028_3-5898115.html (see COM)].

== Counties ==
{{main|Counties of Estonia}}
Estonia numbers 15 main administrative subdivisions. Due to the geographical and demographic size of these subdivisions, they are to be considered counties rather than states (Estonian: pl. ''maakonnad''; sg. - ''maakond''). Here is a list of them:
[[Image:Estonia counties.png|thumb|400px|Counties of Estonia]]
*[[Harju County]] (Estonian: ''Harjumaa'')

== Geography ==
[[Image:En-map.png|right|Map of Estonia]]
{{main|Geography of Estonia}}

Estonia lies on the eastern shores of the [[Baltic Sea]] on the level northwestern part of the rising east European platform between 57.3° and 59.5° N and 21.5° and 28.1° E. Average elevation reaches only 50&amp;nbsp;m, and the country's highest point is the [[Suur Munamägi]] in the southeast (318&amp;nbsp;m).

[[Oil shale]] (or kukersite) and [[limestone]] deposits, along with forests which cover 47% of the land, play key economic roles in this generally resource-poor country. Estonia boasts over [[List of lakes in Estonia|1,400 lakes]] (most very small, with the largest, [[Lake Peipus]], (Peipsi in Estonian) being 3,555 km²), numerous [[bogs]], and 3,794 kilometers of coastline marked by numerous bays, straits, and inlets. The number of islands and islets is estimated at some 1,500, with two of them large enough to constitute their own counties, [[Saaremaa]] and [[Hiiumaa]].

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Estonia}}

As a member of the [[European Union]], Estonia is part of the world's largest economic zone. In [[1999]], Estonia experienced its worst year economically since it regained independence in [[1991]], largely because of the impact of the August [[1998]] Russian financial crisis. Estonia joined the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] in November 1999 — the second Baltic state to join — and continued its [[EU]] accession talks. [[Privatization]] of energy, [[telecommunications]], railways, and other state-owned companies is a continuing process. With assistance from the European Union, the [[World Bank]] and the [[Nordic Bank]], Estonia completed most of its preparations for EU membership by the end of [[2002]] and now has one of the strongest economies of the new member states of the European Union, which Estonia joined on [[1 May]] [[2004]]. The Estonian economy is growing fast, partly due to a number of [[Scandinavia]]n companies relocating their routine operations and [[Russia]]n oil transit using Estonian ports. Estonia has a strong [[information technology]] (IT) sector. [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP PPP per capita]] is at $17,672, the highest among the [[Baltic states]].
[[Image:Seascape.jpg|thumb|right|256px|The north-west coast of [[Estonia]] near [[Nõva]], [[Lääne_County|Lääne county]]]]
In 1994, Estonia became among the first in the world to adopt a [[flat tax]], with a uniform rate of 26% regardless of the income a person makes. In January 2005 the personal income tax rate was reduced to 24%. A subsequent reduction to 23% followed in January 2006. In the following years the income tax rate will be decreased by 1% annually to reach 20% by January 2009.

Since [[January 1]], [[2000]], companies have not had to pay income tax on re-invested income. However, tax is due on profit distributions (incl. hidden distributions) at a rate of 24%. Despite the fact that only the moment of taxation was shifted from earning profits to their distribution, leaving the rest of the corporate taxation system mostly unchanged, the current legislation is said to be in violation of one of the fundamental freedoms of the European Union - free movement of capital. Estonia is to remove this hindrance by January 2009 when the temporary derogation expires.

In June 1992, Estonia replaced the [[Ruble]] with its own freely convertable currency, the [[Kroon]] (EEK). A currency board was created and the new currency was pegged to the German Mark at the rate at 8 EEK for 1 DEM. When Germany introduced the [[Euro]] the peg was changed to 15.6466 Kroon for 1 Euro.
The Estonian government is intending to adopt the [[Euro]] as the country's currency on [[1 January]] [[2007]], and finalised the design of Estonia's Euro coins in late 2004.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Estonia}}
Indigenous Estonian-speaking ethnic Estonians constitute nearly 70 percent of the population. First and second generation immigrants from various parts of the former Soviet Union, mainly [[Russia]] comprise most of the remaining 30 percent. The latter, mostly Russian-speaking ethnic minorities reside predominantly in the capital city (Tallinn) and the industrial urban areas in northeastern Estonia ([[Ida-Virumaa]] county). There is also a small group of [[Finland|Finnish]] descent.

The country's official language is [[Estonian language|Estonian]], which is closely related to [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. [[Russian language|Russian]] is also widely spoken as a secondary language by 30-70 year old ethnic Estonians because Russian was a compulsory second language in school during the Soviet era. Younger people, born at the end of or following the Soviet era, can usually speak [[English language|English]], having learned it as their first foreign language.

Estonia has the second highest [[HIV]] adult prevalence rate in Europe after [[Ukraine]] (1.1% in 2001).

=== Ethnicity ===
According to the most recent national census taken in 2003, the population of Estonia comprised the following self-reported ethnic groups:
* 68.4% [[Estonians]]
* 25.7% [[Russians]] 
* 2.1% [[Ukrainians]]
* 1.2% [[Belarusians]]
* 0.8% [[Finns]]
* 1.7% others

=== Religion ===
[[Image:FL-Tallinn.jpg|thumb|220px|Tallinn, churches in the background]]
The predominant religion of indigenous ethnic Estonians is the [[Christianity|Christian]] belief in the form the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Evangelical Lutheran]] confession, however less than a quarter of ethnic Estonians define themselves as active believers at present. Most believers amongst the Russian minority are [[Eastern Orthodox]]. The [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] has since 1920s recognised a separate national [[Estonian Orthodox Church]], which has led to strained relations with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], which claimed sole authority over Orthodox believers in the country during the period of Soviet rule.

Today, over 31% of the adult population are active followers of a particular faith, and they are made up of:
* 15% [[Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church]]
* 14% [[Orthodox]]
* 0.5% [[Baptist]]s
* 0.5% [[Roman Catholic]]s

There are also a number of smaller Protestant and [[Jewish]] groups, as well as some [[neopagans]] who revere the local ancient deity [[Taara]].

[[sr:Естонијаnfuchs-pronunciation.ogg|&lt;small&gt;listen&lt;/small&gt;}}), for the skillful military campaigns he waged on behalf of the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] in [[North Africa]]. He was later put in command of the German forces following the Allied invasion at [[Normandy]] in the final effort to defend the Fatherland. 

Rommel is often remembered not only for his remarkable military prowess, but also for his [[chivalry]] towards his adversaries - being one of the German commanders who disobeyed the [[Commando Order|commando order]]. He is also noted for possibly having taken part in a plot to assassinate Hitler, for which he was forced to commit suicide before the war's end.

==Early life and career==
Rommel was born in [[Heidenheim]], approximately 45 [[kilometre|km]] from [[Ulm]], in the state of [[Württemberg]]. He was baptised on the [[November 17]] [[1891]].  He was the second son of a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Headmaster of the secondary school at [[Aalen]], Erwin Rommel the elder and Helene von Luz, a daughter of a prominent local dignitary. The couple also had three more children, two sons, Karl and Gerhard, and a daughter, Helene. Later recalling his childhood, Rommel (The Desert Fox) wrote that &quot;my early years passed very happily&quot;. At the age of 14, Rommel and a friend built a full-scale glider that was able to fly, although not very far. Young Erwin considered becoming an [[aeronautical engineering|engineer]]; however, on his father's insistence, he joined the local 124th Württemberg Infantry Regiment as an officer cadet in [[1910]] and, shortly after, was sent to the Officer Cadet School in [[Gdansk|Danzig]].

[[Image:Rommel cadet.jpg|thumb|right|160px|A young Rommel as an officer cadet around 1910]]
While at Cadet School, early in [[1911]], Rommel met his future wife, Lucie Maria Mollin. He graduated in November [[1911]] and was commissioned as a [[Lieutenant]] January [[1912]]. Rommel and Lucie married in [[1916]], and in [[1928]], they had a son, [[Manfred Rommel|Manfred]], who would later become the mayor of [[Stuttgart]]. Scholars [[John Bierman|Bierman]] and [[Colin Smith|Smith]] argue that, during this time, Rommel also had an affair with [[Walburga Stemmer]] in [[1912]] and that relationship produced a daughter named Gertrud (''[[The Battle of Alamein: Turning Point, World War II|1 p. 56]]'').

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], Rommel served in [[France]], as well as on the [[Romania|Romanian]] and [[Italy|Italian]] fronts, during which time he was wounded three times and awarded the [[Iron Cross|Iron Cross - First and Second Class]]. Rommel became the youngest recipient of [[Prussia]]'s highest medal, the [[Pour le Mérite]], an honor traditionally reserved for generals only and which he received after fighting in the mountains of west [[Slovenia]] - [[Battle of the Isonzo]] - Soca front. The award came as a result specifically from the [[Battle of Longarone]], and the capture of [[Mount Matajur]] - [[Slovenia]] and its defenders, numbering 150 Italian officers, 7000 men and 81 artillery guns. His batallion also played a key role in the decisive victory of the Central Powers over the [[Italian Army]] named the [[Battle of Caporetto]].

===Inter-War Years===
After the war Rommel held battalion commands, and was instructor at the Dresden Infantry School from [[1929]]-[[1933]] and the Potsdam War Academy from [[1935]]-[[1938]]. Rommel's war diaries, ''Infanterie greift an'' (''[[Infantry Attacks]]''), published in [[1937]], became a highly regarded military textbook, and also attracted the attention of [[Adolf Hitler]], who placed him in charge of the training of the ''[[Hitler Jugend]]'' that same year, all the while retaining his place at Potsdam. In [[1938]], Rommel, now a colonel, was appointed commandant of the War Academy at Wiener Neustadt. Here Rommel started his follow up to ''Infantry Attacks'', ''Panzer greift an'' (''Tank Attacks'' sometimes translated as ''[[The Tank In Attack]]'' ).  Rommel was removed after a short time; however, he was placed in command of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s personal protection battalion (''Führer-Begleitbattalion'').

==World War II==
[[Image:Rommel France 1940.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Rommel during the French campaign of 1940]]
===Poland 1939===
In the [[autumn]] of 1938 Hitler selected Rommel to be in charge of the Wehrmacht unit assigned to protect him during his visits to occupied [[Czechoslovakia]]. Just prior to the invasion of [[Poland]] he was promoted to [[Major General]] and made commander of the ''Führer-Begleitbattalion'', responsible for the safety of Adolf Hitler's mobile headquarters during the campaign.

===France 1940===
In [[1940]], only three months before the invasion, Rommel was given command of the [[German 7th Panzer Division|7th Panzer Division]], later nicknamed ''Gespenster-Division'' (the ''&quot;Ghost Division&quot;'', due to the speed and surprise it was consistently able to achieve, to the point that even the German High Command lost track of where it was), for ''[[Fall Gelb]]'' (&quot;Case Yellow&quot;), the invasion of [[France]] and the [[Low Countries]]. Remarkably, this was Rommel's first command of a Panzer unit. He showed considerable skill in this operation, repulsing a counter-attack by the [[British Expeditionary Force|BEF]] (British Expeditionary Force) at [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Arras]]. 7th Panzer was one of the first German units to reach the [[English Channel]] (on [[10 June]]) and would capture the vital port of [[Cherbourg]] ([[19 June]]). As a reward Rommel was promoted and appointed commander of the [[German 5th Light Division|5th Light Division]] (later reorganized and redesignated as the 21st Panzer) and of the [[German 15th Panzer Division|15th Panzer Division]], which were sent to [[Libya]] in early [[1941]] to aid the defeated and demoralized Italian troops, forming the ''[[Deutsches Afrika Korps]]'' 
({{Audio|De-Deutsches_Afrikakorps-pronunciation.ogg|&lt;small&gt;listen&lt;/small&gt;}}). It was in [[Africa]] where Rommel achieved his greatest fame as a commander.

===Africa 1941-43===
[[Image:AKrommel.jpg|thumb|250px|Erwin Rommel, 1941]]
Rommel spent most of 1941 building his organization and re-forming the shattered Italian units, who had suffered a string of defeats at the hands of [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] forces under Major General [[Richard O'Connor]]. An offensive pushed the Allied forces back out of [[Libya]], but it stalled a relatively short way into Egypt, and the important port of [[Siege of Tobruk|Tobruk]], although surrounded, was still held by Allied forces under an [[Australia]]n General, [[Leslie Morshead]]. The Allied Commander-in-Chief, General [[Archibald Wavell]] made two unsuccessful attempts to relieve Tobruk ([[Operation Brevity]] and [[Operation Battleaxe]]).

Following the costly failure of Battleaxe, Wavell was relieved by Commander-in-Chief India, General [[Claude Auchinleck]]. Auchinleck launched a major offensive to relieve Tobruk ([[Operation Crusader]]) which eventually succeeded. During the confusion caused by the Crusader operation, Rommel and his staff several times ended up behind British lines. On one occasion Rommel went into a hospital for New Zealand soldiers - still under the control of the British. &quot;He inquired if anything was needed, promised the British medical supplies and drove off unhindered.&quot; - (''The Rommel Papers'', chapter 8 by General [[Fritz Bayerlein]].) 

Crusader was a defeat for Rommel. After several weeks of fighting Rommel ordered the withdrawal of all his forces from the area around Tobruk ([[December 7]] [[1941]]) and retreated back towards El Agheila. The British followed, attempting to cut off the retreating troops as they had done in 1940 but Rommel launched a counter-attack on [[January 20]] [[1942]] and mauled the British. The Afrika Korps retook Benghazi and the British pulled back to the Tobruk area and commenced building defensive positions.

In the early summer of 1942 ([[May 24]] [[1942]]) Rommel's army attacked. In a classic ''[[blitzkrieg]]'', Rommel outflanked the British  at [[Battle of Gazala|Gazala]], surrounded and reduced the strongpoint at [[Battle of Bir Hakeim|Bir Hakeim]] and forced the British to quickly retreat, in the so-called &quot;Gazala Gallop&quot;, to avoid being completely cut off. Tobruk, isolated and alone, was now all that stood between the Afrika Korps and Egypt. On [[21 June]] [[1942]], after a swift, coordinated and fierce [[combined arms]] assault, the city surrendered along with its 33,000 defenders. Only at the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]], earlier that year, had more British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] troops been captured. Allied forces were comprehensively beaten. Within weeks they had been pushed back far into [[Egypt]]. 

[[Image:Rommel in Africa1941.jpg|left|thumb|310px|Rommel in Africa - Summer 1941]] 
Rommel's offensive was eventually stopped at the small railway town of [[El Alamein]], just 60 miles from [[Alexandria]]. The [[First Battle of El Alamein]] was lost by Rommel due to a combination of supply problems (created by [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] and [[Royal Navy]] interdiction, assisted by [[Ultra]]) and improved British tactics. Britain, with her back to the wall, was very close to their supplies and had fresh troops on hand to reinforce her positions. Auchinleck's tactics of continually attacking the weaker Italian forces during the battle forced Rommel to use the [[Deutsches Afrika Korps|Afrika Korps]] in a &quot;fire brigade&quot; role and gave Auchinleck the initiative. Rommel tried again to break through British lines during the [[Battle of Alam Halfa]]. He was decisively stopped by the newly arrived Allied commander, Lieutenant General [[Bernard Montgomery]], who had achieved overwhelming material superiority.

With Allied forces from [[Malta]] interdicting his supplies at sea, and the massive distances they had to cover in the desert, Rommel could not hold the El Alamein position forever. Still, it took a large set piece battle, the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]], to force his troops back. After the defeat at El Alamein, despite urgings from [[Hitler]] and [[Mussolini]], Rommel's forces did not again stand and fight until they had entered [[Tunisia]]. Even then, their first battle was not against the [[British Eighth Army]], but against the [[U.S. II Corps]]. Rommel inflicted a sharp reversal on the American forces at the [[Battle of the Kasserine Pass]].

Turning once again to face the British Commonwealth forces in the old French border defences of the [[Mareth Line]], Rommel could only delay the inevitable. [[Ultra]] was a major factor that led to the defeat of his forces.  He left Africa after falling sick, and the men of his former command eventually became [[prisoners of war]].  

Some historians contrast Rommel's withdrawal of his army back to Tunisia against Hitler's dreams of much greater success than even his capture of Tobruk (in sharp contrast to the fate suffered by the [[German 6th Army]] at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] under the command of [[Friedrich Paulus]] which stood its ground and was annihilated).

Sometimes in this period, it is recorded a failed desperate British attempt to capture Rommel from his headquarters, 250 miles behind the enemy lines. [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/theartofwar/valgal/valour/INF3_0437.htm]

===France 1943-1944===
[[Image:Blaskowitz, Rommel, Rundstedt2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Field Marshall Erwin Rommel (center) discusses the upcoming Allied invasion of France with Colonel General [[Johannes Blaskowitz]] and Field Marshall [[Gerd von Rundstedt]].]]
Back in Germany, Rommel was for some time virtually &quot;unemployed&quot;. However, when the tide of war shifted against Germany, Hitler made Rommel the commander of Army Group B, responsible for defending the French coast against a possible Allied invasion. Dismayed with the situation he found, the slow building pace and realizing he had just months before an invasion, Rommel invigorated the whole fortification effort along the Atlantic coast, under his direction work was significantly sped up, millions of mines laid, and thousands of tank traps and obstacles were set up on beaches and throughout the countryside.

After his battles in Africa, Rommel concluded that any offensive movements would be impossible due to the overwhelming Allied [[air superiority]]. He argued that the tank forces should be dispersed in small units and kept in heavily fortified positions located as close to the front as possible, so they wouldn't have to move far and en masse when the invasion started. He wanted the invasion stopped right on the beaches. However his commander, [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], felt that there was no way to stop the invasion near the beaches due to the equally overwhelming firepower of the [[Royal Navy]]. He felt the tanks should be formed into large units well inland near [[Paris]], where they could allow the Allies to extend into France and then be cut off. When asked to pick a plan, Hitler then vacillated and placed them in the middle, far enough to be useless to Rommel, not far enough to watch the fight for von Rundstedt. Rommel's plan nearly came to fruition anyway. 

During [[D-Day]] several tank units, notably the [[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend|12th SS Panzer Division]], were close enough to the beaches to potentially create serious havoc. Hitler refused however to release the panzer reserves as he believed the Normandy landings were a diversion. Hitler and the German High Command expected the main allied assault in the Pas de Calais, thanks to the success of a secret allied deception campaign ([[Operation Fortitude]]). Facing only small scale German attacks, the allies quickly secured the [[beachhead]].

===The plot against Hitler===
[[Image:LangRugeSpeidelRommel May1944.jpg|right|thumb|250px|May 1944, Rommel with his closest staff members, his chief of staff General [[Hans Speidel]], chief naval aide Admiral [[Friedrich Ruge]] and his personal aide Captain [[Hellmuth Lang]], all of whom were heavily involved in the anti-Nazi conspiracy within the Wehrmacht.]]
On [[July 17]], [[1944]] Rommel's [[Charley Fox|staff car was strafed]] by an [[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]] [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]], and he was hospitalized with major head injuries. In the meantime, after the failed [[July 20 Plot]] against [[Adolf Hitler]] a major crackdown was conducted throughout the Wehrmacht. As the investigation proceeded, numerous connections started appearing that tied Rommel with the conspiracy, in which many of his closest aides were deeply involved. At the same time, local Nazi party officials reported on Rommel's extensive and scornful criticism of Nazi leadership during the time he was hospitalized. [[Martin Bormann|Bormann]] was certain of Rommel's involvement, [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] was not. 

The true extent of Rommel's knowledge of, or involvement with, the plot is still unclear. After the war, however, his wife maintained that Rommel had been against the plot as it was carried out. It has been stated that Rommel wanted to avoid giving future generations of Germans the perception that the war was lost because of a backstab, the infamous [[Dolchstoßlegende]], as it was commonly believed by some Germans following WWI. Instead, he favored a coup where Hitler would be taken alive and made to stand trial before the public.  
[[Image:Erwin rommel death.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A memorial at the site of Field Marshall Erwin Rommel's [[suicide]] outside of the town of Herrlingen, [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]] (west of [[Ulm]])]]

Due to Rommel's popularity with the German people, Hitler gave him an option to commit [[suicide]] with [[cyanide]] or face a humiliating sham trial before [[Roland Freisler]]'s &quot;[[Volksgerichtshof|People's Court]]&quot; and the murder of his family and staff. Rommel ended his own life on [[October 14]], [[1944]], and was buried with full military honours. After the war his diary was published as ''The Rommel Papers''. He is the only member of the [[Third Reich]] establishment to have a museum dedicated to his person and his career. His grave can be found in Herrlingen, a short distance west of [[Ulm]].

==In fiction==

He was portrayed by [[James Mason]] in the [[1951]] [[Film|movie]] ''The Desert Fox'', and also by [[Karl Michael Vogler]] in the [[1970]] biographical [[film]] ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'', starring [[George C. Scott]], and by [[Hardy Kruger]] in the [[1988]] television [[miniseries]] ''[[War and Remembrance]]''.

In [[Philip K. Dick]]'s [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] novel &quot;[[The Man in the High Castle]]&quot;, it is mentioned that Rommel is currently the Nazi-appointed president of the United States of America in the early 1960s.

In [[Douglas Niles]]'s and [[Michael Dobson]]'s alternate history novel ''[[Fox on the Rhine]]'', Hitler was killed by the bomb plot of [[July 20]] [[1944]]. This led to Rommel's survival, and a different quick offensive strike. This was repelled and the book ended with his surrender to the Americans and British, believing that the Germans would be better off with the western powers than with the Soviets. ''Fox on the Rhine'' was followed by a sequel book ''Fox on the Front''.

In [[Donna Barr]]'s novel ''Bread and Swans'' the historical Rommel shares his concerns and career with a fictitious younger brother, Pfirsich,
aka [[The Desert Peach]].  Both Rommels also appear as focal characters of Barr's long-running comic strip series about &quot;The Peach.&quot;

==Quotations about Rommel==
&lt;!-- only a few selected quotes to be included in main article here --&gt;
*The [[British Parliament]] considered a censure vote against [[Winston Churchill]] following the surrender of Tobruk. The vote failed, but in the course of the debate, Churchill would say:
**''&quot;We have a very daring and skillful opponent against us, and, may I say across the havoc of war, a great General.&quot;''
*[[Churchill]] again, on hearing of Rommel's death:
**''&quot;He also deserves our respect, because, although a loyal German soldier, he came to hate Hitler and all his works, and took part in the conspiracy to rescue Germany by displacing the maniac and tyrant. For this, he paid the forfeit of his life. In the sombre wars of modern democracy, there is little place for chivalry” ''  
*[[Theodor Werner]] was an officer who, during World War I, served under Rommel.
**''&quot;Anybody who came under the spell of his personality turned into a real soldier. He seemed to know what the enemy were like and how they would react.&quot;''
*Attributed to General [[George S. Patton]] in North Africa (referring to ''&quot;[[Infantry Attacks]]&quot;'')
**''&quot;Rommel, you magnificent bastard! I read your book!&quot;''

==Quotations==

*&quot;Sweat saves blood, blood saves lives, and brains saves both.&quot;
*&quot;Mortal danger is an effective antidote for fixed ideas.&quot;
*&quot;The best form of welfare for the troops is first-rate training.&quot;
*&quot;Don't fight a battle if you don't gain anything by winning.&quot;
*&quot;In a man-to-man fight, the winner is he who has one more round in his magazine.&quot;
*&quot;Courage which goes against military expediency is stupidity, or, if it is insisted upon by a commander, irresponsibility.&quot;
*&quot;So long as one isn't carrying one's head under one's arm, things aren't too bad.&quot;
*&quot;A risk is a chance you take; if it fails you can recover.  A gamble is a chance taken; if it fails, recovery is impossible.&quot;
*&quot;There is one unalterable difference between a soldier and a civilian: the civilian never does more than he is paid to do.&quot;
*&quot;What difference does it make if you have two tanks to my one, when you spread them out and let me smash them in detail?&quot;
*&quot;The best plan is the one made when the battle is over.&quot;
*&quot;In the absence of orders, go find something and kill it.&quot;
*&quot;The officers of a panzer division must learn to think and act independently within the framework of the general plan and not wait until they receive orders.&quot;
*&quot;Men are basically smart or dumb and lazy or ambitious. The dumb and ambitious ones are dangerous and I get rid of them. The dumb and lazy ones I give mundane duties. The smart ambitious ones I put on my staff. The smart and lazy ones I make my commanders.&quot;
*&quot;Be an example to your men, in your duty and in private life. Never spare yourself, and let the troops see that you don't in your endurance of fatigue and privation. Always be tactful and well-mannered and teach your subordinates to do the same. Avoid excessive sharpness or harshness of voice, which usually indicates the man who has shortcomings of his own to hide.&quot;
*&quot;The future battle on the ground will be preceded by battle in the air. This will determine which of the contestants has to suffer operational and tactical disadvantages and be forced throughout the battle into adoption compromise solutions.&quot;
*&quot;Anyone who has to fight, even with the most modern weapons, against an enemy in complete command of the air, fights like a savage against modern European troops, under the same handicaps and with the same chances of success.&quot;
*&quot;One must not judge everyone in the world by his qualities as a soldier: otherwise we should have no civilization.&quot;
*&quot;The art of concentrating strength at one point, forcing a breakthrough, rolling up and securing the flanks on either side, and then penetrating like lightning deep into his rear, before the enemy has time to react-is ''[[Blitzkrieg]]''.&quot;
*&quot;Messages can't be intercepted if they aren't sent, can they?&quot; 
*&quot;This business with the Jews has got to stop.&quot;

*ngs the problem of the carrier being easily spotted by forces attacking the convoy and perhaps presenting them with a juicy (and possibly easy) target.
* Or it can be some way off from the convoy. While this adds the problem of the time needed for aircraft to travel to the convoy this is a fairly minor problem compared with the matter of being spotted by forces attacking the convoy.

''HMS Audacity'' was sunk while operating in the second position, the one that was later banned by the [[Admiralty]] as too risky.

&lt;/table&gt;

==Post World War II==
Following the war, this class of ship was retired, primarily because as the navies were reduced in size it was better to keep the larger and more useful fleet carriers in preference to them.

Just about every important class of ship or patrol boat from World War II can be found in a museum or in a port, somewhere in the United States, except for the escort carrier and the light carrier. There are no survivors from either type of ship: all were destroyed during the war or broken up in the decades following it. The last escort carrier, [[USS Gilbert Islands (CVE-107)|USS ''Gilbert Islands'' (CVE-107)]] was broken up for scrap starting in 1976.

      <comment>Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/199.243.125.2|199.243.125.2]] ([[User talk:199.243.125.2|talk]]) to last version by Flume</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Extreme sport''' (practically synonymous with the term '''action sport''' and also called adventurous sports) is a general term for [[sport]]s featuring speed, height, danger or spectacular stunts. A feature of such activities in the view of some is their alleged capacity to induce a so-called ‘‘[[adrenaline]] rush’’ in participants (a misnomer, since often the rush or high obtained is a product of increased levels of [[dopamine]] [[endorphin]]s and [[serotonin]]).

Extreme sports are often associated with young adults wishing to push themselves to the limits of their physical ability and fear, in turn pushing the boundaries of a particular sport. This youthful demographic accounts too for extreme sports’ frequent association with [[youth culture]], including its clothing, [[fashion]]s, and [[music]].

Some contend that the distinction between an extreme sport and a conventional one is as much to do with [[marketing]] as it is to do with perceptions about levels of danger involved or the amount of adrenaline generated. [[Snowboarding]] thus has a more extreme ‘‘image’’ than [[skiing]] due to differing marketing strategies and the fact of being a newer sport, even though skiing is a faster and at least equally dangerous activity. Furthermore a sport like [[Rugby Union]], though dangerous and adrenaline-inducing, would not fall into the category of extreme sports due to its traditional image.  

The term gained popularity with the advent of the [[X Games]], a made-for-television collection of events. [[Advertisers]] were quick to recognise the appeal of the event to the public, as a consequence competitors and organisers are not wanting for sponsorship these days. The high profile of extreme sports and the culture surrounding them has also led people to invent jokey parodies, such as [[Extreme ironing]], [[urban housework]], [[extreme croquet]], [[extreme unicycling]], ''''house gymnastics'''', and [[extreme wheelbarrow]].

Some purists repudiate the [[stereotype|stereotypical]] &quot;adrenaline junkie&quot; tag. The practitioners would claim they enjoy developing their physical and/or mental skills, seek mastery of inhospitable environments, look to escape from the mundane rigours of day-to-day existence, or simply love the wilderness environment in which many of these sports take place. ''''Bob Drury'''', a [[paragliding|paraglider]] pilot says &quot;We do these things not to escape life, but to prevent life escaping us&quot; -- even though accidents in these sports could be fatal. Many participants also don't think of their activities as either ''extreme'' or ''sports'' at all. To the most passionate purists, the ''sport'' label doesn't fit because they aren't competing to win anything. Worse, the ''extreme'' label has frequently been blamed for stereotyping participants in these activities as stupid, reckless, and even suicidal.

Some of the sports have existed for decades and their proponents span generations, some going on to become well known personalities. [[Rock climbing]] and [[ice climbing]] have spawned publicly recognisable names such as [[Edmund Hillary]], [[Chris Bonington]] and more recently [[Joe Simpson (mountaineer)|Joe Simpson]]. Another example is [[surfing]], which was originally invented centuries ago by the native inhabitants of [[Hawaii]].

Several so-called extreme sports, including snowboarding, were included in the [[2002 Winter Olympic Games]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ædgyth''' or '''Edith of England''' ([[910]] - [[January 26|26 January]] [[946]]) was the daughter of [[Edward the Elder]], King of [[England]] and Ælfflæd. Edith's grandfather was [[Alfred the Great]], King of the [[West Saxons]] (or King of Wessex).

King [[Athelstan of England]] sent two of his sisters to Germany, instructing [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor]] to choose whichever one pleased him best. Otto chose Edith and married her in [[929]]. The remaining sister Algiva or Adiva was married to a &quot;king near the Jupiter mountains&quot; (the [[Alps]]). The precise identity of this sister is debated. She may have been [[Eadgifu of England]] who married King [[Charles III of France]], or another sister otherwise unknown to history.

Like her brother, Athelstan, Edith was devoted to the cult of [[Saint Oswald]], and was instumental in introducing this cult into Germany after her marriage to the emperor.

Edith and Otto's children were:
# Liutgarde, married [[Conrad the Red]]
# [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia]] ([[930]]-[[September 6]], [[957]])

Her tomb is located at the [[Cathedral of Magdeburg]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Kingdom of the East Seaxe''' (one of the seven traditional kingdoms of the so-called Anglo-Saxon [[Heptarchy]]) was founded around [[500]] AD and covered the territory currently occupied by the counties of [[Essex]], [[Hertfordshire]] and [[Middlesex]].

The kingdom was bounded to the north by the [[River Stour]] and [[Kingdom of East Anglia]], to the south by the [[River Thames]] and [[Kent]], to the east lay the [[North Sea]] and to the west [[Mercia]]. The earliest record of the kingdom dates to [[Bede]]'s History Eccl., which noted the arrival of Bishop (later Saint) [[Mellitus]] in London in [[604]]. The territory included the remains of two provincial [[ancient Rome|Roman]] capitals [[Colchester]] and [[London]]. For a brief period in the [[8th century]] the kingdom also encompassed the Kentish Kingdom to the South, but by the mid 8th century much of the kingdom, including London, had fallen to [[Mercia]]. After the defeat of the Mercian king [[Beornwulf]] around  [[825]] AD, the kingdom became a possession of the [[West Saxon kingdom|Wessex]] king [[Ecgbert]]. In [[870]] the territory was ceded by Wessex, under the [[Treaty of Wedmore]], to the [[Danelaw]] kingdom of [[East Anglia]]. The modern [[England|English]] [[county]] of Essex maintains the historic northern and the southern borders, but only covers the territory east of the [[River Lee]].

The dates, names and achievements, like those of most early rulers in the [[Heptarchy]], remain conjectural. The dynasty claimed descent from the god [[Seaxneat]], rather than the god [[Woden]] (from whom the other [[Saxon people|Saxon]] tribes claimed descent). The list of kings may omit whole generations.

This was a time when spellings varied widely, even within a document.  A number of variations of the details below exist. Amongst these are the preference between þ and ð (hard and soft &quot;th&quot;).

The character '7' was used as the ampersand '&amp;' in contemporary Anglo-Saxon writings.  The era pre-dates the emergence of forms of writing accepted today, notably [[minuscule]], and the letters 'W' and 'U'.  Where W was followed by U this was generally rendered as 'VV' (which was also used for 'W' alone).

      <id>rder to pick up moving targets. This is distinct from most other radars because looking for the frequency shift means that the system is not looking for returns in the same frequency that they are sent out, so the radar can be used continuously. It has the ability to 'look' from a long range, which the military refers to as a high stand off capability. The antenna can be tilted to either side of the aircraft where it can develop a 120 degree field of view covering nearly 50,000 [[square kilometre|km²]] (19,305 mile²) and is capable of detecting targets at more than 250 km (more than 152 miles). Any objects of sufficient size (vehicle) and density that are moving will show up on the radar.  The radar cannot pick up stationary objects. Objects with a lot of angles (e.g. the inside of a pick-up bed) will give a much better radar signature (called specular returns). In addition to being able to detect, locate and track large numbers of ground vehicles the radar has some limited capability to detect helicopters, rotating antennas and low, slow-moving fixed wing aircraft. Radar operating modes include wide area surveillance, ground moving target indicator (GMTI), fixed target indicator (FTI) target classification and [[synthetic aperture radar]]. 

The radar and computer subsystems on the E-8C can gather and display broad and detailed battlefield information. Data is collected as events occur. This includes position and tracking information on enemy and friendly ground forces. The information is relayed in near-real time to the [[United States Army|US Army]]'s common ground stations via the secure jam-resistant surveillance and control data link (SCDL) and to other ground command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I) nodes beyond line-of-sight via ultra high frequency satellite communications. 

[[Image:GMTI_JSTARS.jpg|370px|thumb|left|Joint STARS GMTI Overlaid on Aerial Image]]

Other major E-8C prime mission equipment are the communications/datalink (COMM/DLX) and operations and control (O&amp;C)subsystems. Eighteen operator workstations display computer-processed data in graphic and tabular format on video screens. Operators and technicians perform battle management, surveillance, weapons, intelligence, communications and maintenance functions.

== Role ==
In support of air-to-ground operations, the E-8C can provide real time information needed to increase ground [[situation awareness]] with intelligence support, attack support and targeting operations including attack aviation, naval surface fire, field artillery and friendly maneuver forces. It also provides information for air and land commanders to gain and maintain control of the battle-space and execute against enemy forces. 

As a battle management and command and control asset, the E-8C can support the full spectrum of roles and missions from peacekeeping operations to major theater war. However, as capable as the E-8's systems are, the information returned has very little detail.  While it can pick up moving vehicles on the complete other side of the battlefield, it can give very little information about the vehicles.  Approximate number of vehicles, location, speed, direction of travel, and the time that the target was detected is about all that can be detected.  Identifying who the target is, what equipment they have, whether it is friendly, hostile, or bystanders, is not possible with this system. That is one of the reasons why it is a joint system, so that other sensors from the other services may reference each other to positively verify JSTARS reports. In the Army, JSTARS is analyzed in the [[Common Ground Station]] (CGS) and disseminated from there.

== History ==
Joint STARS evolved from [[United States Army|US Army]] and [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] programs to develop, detect, locate and attack enemy armor at ranges beyond the forward area of troops. In 1982, the programs were merged and the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] became the lead agent. The concept and sensor technology for the E-8 was developed and tested on the [[Tacit Blue]] experimental aircraft. The prime contract was awarded to [[Northrop Grumman]] (formerly Grumman Aerospace Corporation) in September 1985 for two E-8C development systems. These aircraft deployed in 1991 to participate in [[Operation Desert Storm]], even though they were still in development. The joint program accurately tracked mobile [[Iraq]]i forces, including tanks and [[Scud]] missiles. Crews flew developmental aircraft on 49 combat sorties accumulating more than 500 combat hours and a 100 % mission effectiveness rate. 

Joint STARS developmental aircraft were also called to support the [[NATO]] peacekeeping mission, Operation [[Joint Endeavor]], in December 1995. While flying in friendly air space, the test-bed E-8A and pre-production E-8C aircraft monitored ground movements to confirm compliance with the Dayton Peace Treaty agreements. Crews flew 95 consecutive operational sorties and more than 1,000 flight hours with a 98 % mission effectiveness rate. 

The [[93d Air Control Wing]], which activated [[January 29]], [[1996]], accepted its first aircraft, [[June 11]], [[1996]], and deployed in support of Operation [[Joint Endeavor]] in October. The designated 93d Air Expeditionary Group (Provisional) monitored treaty compliance while [[NATO]] rotated troops through [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]]. The first production E-8C and a pre-production E-8C flew 36 operational sorties and more than 470 flight hours with a 100 % effectiveness rate. The wing declared initial operational capability [[December 18]], [[1997]] after receiving the second production aircraft. Operation Allied Force saw Joint STARS in action again from February to June 1999 accumulating more than 1,000 flight hours and a 94.5 % mission-effectiveness rate in support of the U.S. lead [[Kosovo War]].

On [[October 1]], [[2002]], the 93d Air Control Wing (ACW) was &quot;blended&quot; with the [[116th Bomb Wing]] (BW) in a ceremony at [[Robins AFB]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  The 116 BW was an [[Air National Guard]] (ANG) wing equipped with the [[B-1B]] Lancer bomber at [[Robins AFB]].  As a result of a USAF reorganization of the [[B-1B]] force, all B-1Bs were assigned to active duty wings, resulting in the 116 BW lacking a current mission.  Extensive efforts by the [[Governor]] and congressional delegation of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] led to the resulting &quot;blending&quot;, with the newly created wing designated as the [[116th Air Control Wing]] (ACW).  The 93 ACW was deactivated the same day.  The 116 ACW constituted the first fully blended wing of active duty and [[Air National Guard]] airmen. The wing's first and current Commander is [[Brigadier General]] Tom Lynn, while the Deputy Commander is an active duty airman.  The next Wing Commander is planned to be an active duty airman with an ANG Deputy.  

The 116 ACW has been heavily involved in both [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] ([[Afghanistan]]) and Operation Iraqi Freedom, earning high marks for operational effectiveness and recently completing 10,000 combat hours.  The wing took delivery of the 17th and final E-8C on [[March 23]], [[2005]].

The E-8C Joint STARS routinely supports various taskings of the Combined Force Command Korea during the [[North Korea]]n winter exercise cycle and for the [[United Nations]] enforcing resolutions on Iraq. The twelveth production aircraft, outfitted with an upgraded operations and control subsystem, was delivered to the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] [[November 5]], [[2001]].

The [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] were impressed by the performance of the Joint STARS system in the Gulf War and subsequent joint operations and commenced studies to procure a similar system. The [[Raytheon Corporation]] was awarded the contract to provide a system comprising the ASARS-2 radar on the [[Bombardier Global Express]] jet. The ASARS-2 is an upgraded version of the [[Lockheed U-2]]'s radar. The system, known as the [[Raytheon Sentinel|'''A'''irborne '''ST'''and '''O'''ff '''R'''adar]] (ASTOR) will enter service in 2005.

The E-8 is slated to be replaced (along with the [[EC-135]] and the [[E-3 Sentry]]) by the [[E-10_MC2A|E-10A Multisensor Command and Control Aircraft (MC2A)]], based upon the Boeing 767-400ER airframe and equipped with the '''M'''ulti-'''P'''latform '''R'''adar '''T'''echnology '''I'''nsertion '''P'''rogram ('''MP-RTIP''') 2-D AESA radar.  Northrop Grumman is teamed with Boeing and Raytheon to produce a testbed version of the E-10A.

==Proposed engine upgrades==

The USAF has identified re-engining of the E-8C as an &quot;unfunded priority.&quot;  Newer but still used engines would reportedly result in lower maintenance costs, reduced fuel usage, and better performance for the aircraft.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Eric Cheney''' ([[January 5]], [[1924]] - [[December 30]], [[2001]]) was an independent [[United Kingdom|British]] [[motorcycle]] designer and manufacturer.

Initially a [[motocross]] racer, following an accident he moved into bike preparation and design. He designed primarily motorcycle chassis and suspension systems, his most noted successes were in the world road-racing championships. His designs were the last British ones to win a Grand Prix. He never worked for any of the major manufacturers but maintained a productive relationship with [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]] in its heyday.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Econometrics''''' literally means 'economic [[measurement]]'.  It is a combination of [[mathematical economics]], statistics, economic statistics and economic theory.  

The two main purposes of econometrics are to give [[empiricism|empirical]] content to economic theory and also to empirically verify economic theory.  For example, econometrics could empirically verify if indeed a given [[demand curve]] slopes downward as economic theory would suggest.  Empirical content is also given in that a numerical value would be given to this slope, while economic theory alone is usually mute on actual specific values.

Arguably the most important tool of econometrics is [[regression analysis]] (for an overview of a linear implementation of this framework, see [[linear regression]]).

Econometric analysis can often be divided into [[time-series analysis]] and [[cross-sectional analysis]].  Time-series analysis examines variables over time, such as the effect of interest rates on national expenditure.  Cross-sectional analysis studies relationship between different variables at a point in time. For instance, the relationship between income, locality, and personal expenditure.  When time-series analysis and cross-sectional analysis are conducted simultaneously on the same [[Statistical sample|sample]], it is called [[panel analysis]]. If the sample is different each time, it is called pooled cross section data. Multi-dimensional panel data analysis is conducted on data sets that have more than two dimensions. For example, some forecast data sets provide forecasts for multiple target periods, conducted by multiple forecasters, and made at multiple horizons. The three dimensions provide more information than can be gleaned from two dimensional panel data sets.

A simple example of a relationship in econometrics is:

:Personal Expenditure = Propensity to Spend * Income + random error 

This statement asserts that the amount a person spends is dependent on his or her [[income]] and his or her willingness to spend [[money]].  If we can observe personal expenditure and income, techniques such as [[Linear regression|regression analysis]] can then be applied to find the value of the coefficients, here just the propensity to spend.  The estimated coefficient can then be compared across samples (such as different countries or income brackets) and conclusions made. 

The above example can also be used to illustrate the many difficulties facing the applied econometrician. For instance, do we really know that the above relationship is correct? Perhaps the true relationship between personal expenditure and income is non-linear (that is, curved). Even if we know the correct theory, it is not certain we can measure personal expenditure and income correctly. For instance, the value of work by  [[homemaker]]s is not recorded although it contributes to income. There are also a variety of statistical pitfalls that potentially lead to incorrect conclusions. Econometrics has dealt extensively with such issues. Often it turns out to be difficult to fully implement the resulting methods in practice.

      <comment>Emacs Lisp differs heavily from CL/Scheme, because of the scope thing</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Emacs Lisp''' is a dialect of the [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] [[programming language]] used by the [[GNU Emacs]] and [[XEmacs]] [[text editor]]s (which we will collectively refer to as [[Emacs]] in this article.) It is used  for implementing most of the editing functionality built into Emacs, the remainder being written in [[C programming language|C]]. Users of Emacs commonly write Emacs Lisp code to customize and extend Emacs.

Emacs Lisp is sometimes called ''Elisp'', at the risk of confusion with an unrelated Lisp dialect with the same name. In terms of features, it is closely related to the [[Maclisp]] dialect. It supports [[procedural programming|imperative]] and [[functional programming|functional]] programming methods. Lisp was chosen as the extension language for Emacs because of its powerful features, including the ability to treat functions as data.

The Lisp dialect used in Emacs differs substantially from [[Common Lisp]] and [[Scheme]], dialects used for applications programming. Chiefly, Emacs Lisp uses dynamic rather than lexical [[scope (programming)|scope]]. That is, variables bound in a calling function can be referenced from a called function.

Writing Emacs Lisp is not the only method of customizing GNU Emacs. Since version 20, GNU Emacs has included a &quot;Customize&quot; facility which allows users to set common customization variables through a graphical interface. &quot;Customize&quot; works by writing Emacs Lisp code for the user, and is limited to simple customizations. Not every user needs the full degree of extensibility offered by Emacs; those that do must write their own Emacs Lisp code.

==Example==
Here is a simple example of an Emacs extension written in Emacs Lisp. In Emacs, the editing area can be split into separate areas called ''windows'', each displaying a different ''buffer''. A buffer is, roughly speaking, a region of text loaded into Emacs' memory (possibly from a file), which can be saved into a text document.

The user command for opening a new window is &quot;&lt;tt&gt;C-x 2&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; (which means to press the od.

=== Second Generation (1953-1960) ===
[[Image:F-100.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A &quot;second generation&quot; North American [[F-100 Super Sabre]]. This was the first American jet aircraft to break the sound barrier in level flight.]]
The second generation describes the integration of many new technologies to greatly improve the fighting capability of the jet fighter. The introduction of guided missiles such as the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] and [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] moved combat to beyond visual range (though it often devolved into [[dogfights]] in visual range), necessitating the standardization of radar to acquire targets. Designers experimented with a variety of aeronautical concepts, such as the [[swept wing]] [[delta wing]], [[variable-sweep]] wings, and [[area-rule]]d fuselages. With the aid of swept wing, these were the first aircraft to break the sound barrier.


The primary specializations of this era were the [[fighter-bomber]] (such as the [[F-105]] and the [[Sukhoi Su-7]], and the interceptor ([[English Electric Lightning]] and [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25]]). The interceptor was an outgrowth of the vision that guided missles would completely replace guns and combat would take place at beyond visual range. As a result, interceptors were designed with a large missile payload and a powerful radar, sacrificing agility in favor of speed and [[rate of climb]].

===Third Generation (1960-1970) ===
[[Image:F-4 Phantom II in flying.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A &quot;third generation&quot; F-4 Phantom II.]]
The third generation is marked by the maturation of technologies introduced in the second generation: radar, missiles, avionics, etc. Most significantly, as a result of combat experience with guided missiles, designers conceded that combat could and would degernate into close dogfights. Guns again became standard, and maneuverability was once again a priority. At this time, aeronautical development approached maturity, and growth in combat capability was accomplished via the introduction of new avionics, radars, and missiles.

These innovations, while greatly improving the capabilities of fighters (the F-4 could carry a similar payload as the [[B-24 Liberator]], a WWII heavy bomber), also came at a considerable increase at cost. Whereas militaries had previously specialized specialized fighters for specific roles such as night fighter, heavy fighter, strike fighter. To counter the growing cost of fighters, militaries began to consolidate missions. The [[F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell F-4 ''Phantom II'']] was designed as a pure interceptor for the [[US Navy]], but became a highly successful multi-role aircraft for the [[US Air Force]], [[US Navy]] and [[US Marine Corps]] as well as many other nations. It is the only combat aircraft to be simultaneously flown by all three US air forces. However, the subsequent [[General Dynamics F-111]], intended as a multi-role, multi-service fighter, proved to be a near-disaster, so ineffectual as a fighter that the Navy version was abandoned, and the type eventually matured as a [[bomber]].

===Fourth Generation 1970-1990===
[[Image:F-15 vertical deploy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A &quot;fourth generation&quot; F-15 Eagle.]]
In reaction to the continually rising cost of fighters and the demonstrated success of the [[F-4 Phantom II]], multirole fighters became popular during this period, and even aircraft designed for a specific role (as the [[F-4]] had) acquired multi-role capability. Fighters such as the [[MiG-23]] and [[Panavia Tornado]] have versions specially suited for various roles, while the multirole warplanes including the [[F/A-18 Hornet]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000]]. This was facilitated by avionics which could switch seamlessly between air and ground modes. As development costs increased, economics further pushed the development for multirole aircraft.

Unlike interceptors of the previous era, most modern air-superiority fighters have been designed to be agile dog-fighters. [[Fly-by-wire]] controls and [[relaxed stability]] is common among modern fighters. Aircraft here make up most of the &quot;third&quot; and &quot;fourth generations&quot; of fighter jets.

===Generation 4.5===

[[Image:Joint Strike Fighter.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, a &quot;fifth generation&quot; jet fighter.]]
The current cutting edge of fighter design combines previous emphasis on versatility with new developments such as [[glass cockpit]]s, [[thrust vectoring]], [[composite materials]], [[supercruise]], and [[stealth technology]]. With the exception of the [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]], none of these fighters have been tested in combat to date. Fighters listed here are representative of the 4.5th and 5th generation, including the [[PAK FA]], the first fighter to be assigned one(fifth).

Current developments include reducing the [[radar]] visibility of fighters--techniques known as [[Stealth technology|stealth]]--as well as increased range at supersonic speeds ([[supercruise]]) and better maneuverability.  Ultimately, most authorities believe that there is no future for crewed fighter planes as they will eventually be replaced by [[Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle]]s (UCAV) .  However, the world's major air forces are all in the process of replacing their craft with a new generation of planes, so the transition is likely some time away yet.

The [[F-5 Freedom Fighter]] (or '''Tiger II''') is a [[fighter aircraft]], designed and built by [[Northrop]] in the [[United States|USA]], beginning in [[1962]].

Originally designed by [[Northrop]] (designated N-156) as a low-cost, low-maintenance fighter, there was little market for such a craft. The [[U.S. Army]] expressed interest in it for ground support, but operating fixed-wing aircraft was a [[U.S. Air Force]] responsibility and the Air Force would neither agree to operate the N-156 nor to allow the Army to operate fixed-wing combat aircraft. The F-5 proved to be a successful combat aircraft that never entered frontline service with the US due to diverging priorities of the US services.

When the [[Military Assistance Program]] under the Kennedy Administration needed a low cost fighter for distribution to less-developed nations, the '''N-156F''' was at the top of the pile, and subsequently became the '''F-5A'''. The first contract for the production F-5A was issued in [[1962 in aviation|1962]], the first overseas order coming from [[Norway]] in February [[1964 in aviation|1964]]. 636 F-5As were built before production ended in [[1972 in aviation|1972]]. These were accompanied by 200 two-seat '''F-5B''' aircraft. These were operational trainers, lacking the nose-mounted cannon but otherwise combat-capable.

The [[USAF]] made a combat evaluation of the F-5A under the ''Skoshi Tiger'' (little tiger) program in [[1965 in aviation|1965]]. 12 aircraft were delivered for trials to the [[4503rd Tactical Fighter Wing]] (subsequently the [[10th Fighter Commando Squadron]]), redesignated '''F-5C'''. They performed combat duty in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], flying more than 3,500 sorties from the [[3rd Tactical Fighter Wing]] at [[Bien Hoa]] in [[South Vietnam]]. Two aircraft were lost in combat. The program was short-lived, more a political gesture than a serious consideration of the type for U.S. service. The 10th FCS's surviving aircraft were subsequently turned over to the air force of South Vietnam. Ironically, when Bien Hoa was later overrun by Communist forces, several of the aircraft were captured and used operationally by the [[North Vietnamese Army|NVAF]], in particular against China.

In [[1970 in aviation|1970]] Northrop won a competition for an improved '''International Fighter Aircraft (IFA)''' to replace the F-5A. The resultant aircraft, initially known as '''F-5A-21''', subsequently became the '''F-5E'''. It was lengthened and enlarged, with increased wing area and more sophisticated [[avionics]], initially with an Emerson AN/APQ-159 [[radar]] (the F-5A and -B had no radar). Various specific avionics fits could be accommodated at customer request. A two-seat combat-capable trainer, the '''F-5F''', was offered. Unlike the gunless F-5B, it retained a single [[M39 cannon]] in the nose, albeit with a reduced ammunition capacity. A [[reconnaissance]] version, the '''RF-5E Tigereye''', with a sensor package in the nose displacing the radar and one cannon, was also offered.

The F-5E eventually received the official popular name '''Tiger II'''. It is sometimes incorrectly thought to be the only aircraft designated as its own replacement; in fact, the previous &quot;Tiger&quot; was the [[F-11 Tiger|Grumman F11F/F-11]]. The [[AV-8 Harrier II | AV-8B Harrier II]], which followed the [[Hawker-Siddeley Harrier|AV-8A/C Harrier]], is the only aircraft to have truly been designated as its own replacement.

Northrop built 792 F-5Es, 140 F-5Fs and 12 RF-5Es. More were built under license overseas: 56 F-5Es and -Fs plus 5 RF-5Es in [[Malaysia]] (they plan to sell them after being upgraded), 90 F-5Es and -Fs in [[Switzerland]] (of which some are currently rented to [[Austria]] to bridge the gap between the retirement of  the [[Saab Draken]] fleet and the delivery of new [[Eurofighter Typhoon|Eurofighter]] jets), 68 in [[South Korea]], and 380 in [[Taiwan]]. 

Various F-5 versions remain in service with many nations. The most advanced are those of [[Singapore]], which has approximately 49 modernised and re-designated '''F-5S''' (single-seaters) and '''F-5T''' (two-seaters) aircraft. Upgrades include new radar, manufactured by [[Israel]], updated cockpits with multi-function displays, and compatibility with the [[Rafael Python]] and [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]] [[air-to-air missile]]s.

Although the United States does not use the F-5 in a frontline role, it was adopted for an opposing-forces (OPFOR) &quot;''aggressor''&quot; training role because of its performance similarities to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[MiG-21]]. A trainer version, the [[T-38 Talon]], was adopted by the [[U.S. Air Force]] as a pilot's first introduction to [[supersonic]] flight.

The F-5E saw service with the US Air Force from 1975 until 1990, serving in the [[64th Aggressor Squadron]] and [[65th Aggressor Squadron]] at [[Nellis Air Force Base]] in Nevada, and with the 527th Aggressor Squadron at Alconbury RAF Base in the UK and the 26th Aggressor Squadron at Clark AB in the Phillipines.  The Marines purchased ex-USAF models in 1989 to replace their [[F-21]]s.  Serving with VMFT-401 at Yuma MCAS, the F-5 fleet continues to be modernized with F-5N replacements purchased from Switzerland.  The US Navy used the F-5E extensively at The [[Naval Fighter Weapons School]] at[[NAS Miramar]], VF-127, VF-43 and VF-45.  Currently, the only Navy unit flying the F-5 is [[VFC-13]] at Fallon NAS in Nevada.

Northrop attempted to develop an advanced version of the F-5E, originally designated '''F-5G''', as an export competitor for the [[F-16]]. The -5G was later redesignated the [[F-20 Tigershark]]. 

The [[F/A-18_Hornet|F/A-18 Hornet]] was derived from the [[YF-17 Cobra]], which in turn was based in part on the F-5 Tiger II.

==Foreign variations==
[[Iran]] has reverse engineered its F-5 fighters supplied to it before the Iranian Revolution and developed two indigenous fighters: the [[Saeqeh]] Fighter and the [[Azarakhsh]] Fighter.

==Use in fiction==
* [[Apocalypse Now]] features 4-5 aircraft dropping Napalm on a battlefield. These undoubtedly belonged to the [[Phillippine Air Force]], who provided numerous aircraft (including helicopters) for the film. Interestingly, the aircraft are portrayed as American in the film.

[[Image:Ferapontov.jpg|300px|thumb|Fresco by [[Dionisius]] representing [[Saint Nicholas]].]]
[[Image:Indischer Maler des 6. Jahrhunderts 001.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Fresco from [[Ajanta]], c 200 BCE - 600 CE]]
A '''fresco''' (plural '''''frescoes''''') is a term for several related [[painting]] types. The word comes from the [[Italian language|Italian]] phrase ''buon fresco'' (&quot;really fresh&quot;) a technical term in opposition to ''[[fresco-secco|in secco]]'' (&quot;on dry surface&quot;). 

True fresco (''buon fresco'') technique consists of painting in [[pigment]] in a [[water]] [[medium]] on wet or fresh [[Mortar (masonry)#Lime mortar|lime mortar]] or [[plaster]]. ''In secco'' painting is done on dry plaster and with the pigments in a binding medium, like [[egg (food)|egg]]. The difference between the two techniques is that as it dries the wet plaster absorbs the pigment and the painting becomes part of the wall surface rather than resting on top of it.  This makes a durable work of art;  if the wall is destroyed the painting can often be reassembled because of the size of the plaster parts.

Because of the need to work on freshly-laid plaster, careful study of the wall surface can reveal the area worked on in one day. In [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance Italy]] this was commonly called a ''giornata'' (&quot;daily amount&quot;). These divisions are perceptible with some [[magnification]] and even the naked eye if the plastering technique was not good.

Painters in fresco often add details later ''in secco''. These details are not part of the wall and so they are much less durable. [[Egypt]]ian wall paintings in [[tomb]]s are usually ''in secco'', while the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] wall paintings at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] are in fresco.

[[Andrea Palladio]], the famous Italian [[architect]] of the [[16th century]], built many [[mansion]]s with plain exteriors and stunning interiors filled with frescoes.

'''Fire''', a form of [[combustion]] is a [[chemical reaction]] involving two or more chemicals where the molecules will readily react with each other to form additional chemicals. Linguistically, the word ''fire'' refers to the combination of the brilliant glow and large amount of [[heat]] released during a rapid, self-sustaining burning of combustible [[fuel]]. Fire is not a state of matter: rather, it is an [[exothermic]] [[oxidation]] process by which heat and light energy are given out. Fire starts when a fuel with adequate supply of [[oxygen]] or other [[oxidizer]] is subjected to enough heat, and it is sustained by the further release of heat [[energy]] in the process, as well as a continuous supply of oxygen and combustible fuel. A [[match]] or [[lighter]] is usually used to start a fire, which can then propagate to other combustibles) because matches and lighters are designed with materials of low burning point. Fire is extinguished when one or more elements of heat, oxidizer, or fuel is removed; this concept is used in the [[fire triangle]]. The unburnable solid remains of a fire are termed ash. 

[[Flame]]s can conduct [[electricity]], as a small portion of any fire is [[ion|ionized]]. This has been demonstrated in the laboratory and also in large [[wildfire]]s that occur in the vicinity of [[power line]]s.

==Controlling fire==
[[Image:Log in fireplace.jpg|thumb|left|225px|A log burning in a [[fireplace]].]]
Controlling fire for the purposes of providing heat and light was one of [[human]]kind's first great achievements. The ability of fire to generate heat and light made possible migration to colder climates and enabled people to [[cooking|cook]] food — a decisive step in the perennial fight against [[disease]]. [[Smoke signals]] were an early use of fire for communication, and fire soon enabled advancements in [[metallurgy]] such as [[smelting]] and [[forging]]. [[Archaeology]] indicates that ancestors of modern humans such as ''[[Homo erectus]]'' seem to have been using controlled fire as early as some 790,000 years ago. The [[Cradle of Humankind]] site has evidence for controlled fire 1 million years ago. 

By the time of the [[Neolithic Revolution]], during the introduction of grain based agriculture, people the world over used fire as a tool in landscape management.  These fires were typically [[controlled burn]]s or &quot;cool fires&quot;, as opposed to uncontrolled &quot;hot fires&quot; that damage the soil. Such hot fires destroy plants and animals, and endanger communities. This is especially problem in the forests of today where traditional burning is prevented in order to encourage the growth of timber crops. Cool fires are generally conducted in the spring and fall. They clear undergrowth, burning up [[biomass]] that could trigger a hot fire should it get too dense. They provide a greater variety of environments, which encourages game and plant diversity. For humans, they make dense, impassable forests traversable.
[[Image:Gas burner on stove.JPG|thumb|right|225px|A lit gas burner on a stove.]]
The modern applications of fire are numerous. In its broadest sense, fire is used by nearly every human being on earth in a controlled setting every day. Owners of [[internal combustion]] vehicles use fire every time they drive. Thermal [[Power station|power stations]] provide [[electricity]] for  a large percentage of humanity. However, fire is also used more directly; many nomadic peoples still use fire for cooking. It is also used for [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]], and as a [[weapon]].

In fact, the use of fire for [[warfare]] has a long [[military history|history]] up to the present day. [[Homer]] detailed its use by Greek [[commando|commandoes]] who hid in a [[Trojan Horse|wooden horse]] to burn [[Troy]] during the [[Trojan war]]. Later the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] fleet used [[Greek fire]] to attack ships and men. In the [[Vietnam War]], the Americans dropped a modern version, [[napalm]], from the air. More recently many villages were burned during the [[Rwandan Genocide]]. [[Aerial bombing of cities]], including [[firebombing]], using [[incendiary bomb]]s was also frequently used during [[World War II]]. [[Molotov cocktail]]s are cheap to construct and are in common use as well.

==Fire and religion==
[[Image:Rubens - Vulcano forjando los rayos de Júpiter.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Vulcan of ancient mythology, using fire for his forge]]
Fires and burning have often been used in [[religion|religious]] rites and symbolism. One reason may be that the [[smoke]] of the fire disperses upwards, into what may be considered into the [[heaven]]s, considered by many religions to be the home of their supernatural deities.

Fire is one of the four [[classical element]]s, as well as one of the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|five Chinese elements]]. In [[Hinduism]] fire is one of five sacred elements of which all living creatures are comprised and is considered an eternal witness essential to sacred religious ceremonies.

Fire is a symbol of [[Ahura Mazda]], or God, of the [[Zoroastrian]] religion. A Zoroastrian church is known as a [[Agiary|Fire Temple]]. Fire is also an important part of [[Calcination]], the fire operation in the art of [[alchemy]].

In Roman mythology, [[Vulcan]] is the god of fire.  The analogue in Greek mythology is [[Hephaestus]]. In Greek mythology, [[Prometheus]] is the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] chiefly honored for stealing fire from the gods in the stalk of a fennel plant and giving it to mortals for their use.

In [[Judaism]] fire also has great significance, candles are lit to usher in holidays and to separate [[Shabbat]] from the rest of the week, as well as to remember the dead; another important fire symbol is the Eternal Flame, which was a fire kept in the [[Temple in Jerusalem|First]] and [[Second Temple]] was never supposed to go out.

In [[Christianity]], fire is a [[symbol]] of the [[Holy Ghost]] and is often used in descriptions of [[Hell]].

==Fire as a power source==
[[Image:ChineseCoalPower.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A [[coal power plant]] in the [[People's Republic of China]].]]
Fire has supplied much of the energy which has helped humans since ancient times. [[Wood]] was a [[prehistory|prehistoric]] fuel. The use of [[fossil fuel]]s such as [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]] and [[coal]] in [[fossil fuel power plant|power plant]]s supplies the vast majority of the world's electricity today. The [[International Energy Agency]] states it is nearly 80%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/statlist/index.htm &quot;Share of Total Primary Energy Supply&quot;, 2002; International Energy Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;. Mexico is typical with thermal energy providing 76% of all energy &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geni.org/globalenergy/library/national_energy_grid/mexico/index.shtml  &quot;Mexico Grid Summary&quot;, 2000; Global Energy Network Institute]; thermal energy defined as oil, gas and coal&lt;/ref&gt;.

The burning of wood is often the first association to the word &quot;fire&quot;. It is common in a [[developing countries|developing country]] for wood to be the primary energy source as well. For instance, in [[Africa]], 65% of the energy used comes from the burning of [[biomass]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/archi faction now, so Carthage was the first city to respond to the plea and send troops to the area. Most likely unwilling to see Carthaginian power spread further over Sicily and get too close to Italy, Rome responded by entering into an alliance with the Mamertines. In [[264 BC]], Roman troops were deployed to Sicily (the first time a Roman army acted outside the Italian peninsula) and forced a reluctant Syracuse to join their alliance. Soon enough the only parties in the dispute were Rome and Carthage and the conflict evolved into a struggle for the possession of Sicily.

==Land warfare==
Sicily is a hilly island, with geographical obstacles and a terrain where lines of communication are difficult to maintain. For this reason land warfare played a secondary role in the First Punic War. Land operations were mostly confined to small scale raids and skirmishes between the armies, with hardly any pitched battle. [[Siege]]s and land blockades were the most common operations for the regular army. The main targets of blockading were the important naval ports, since neither of the belligerent parties were based in Sicily and both needed a continuous supply of reinforcements and communication with the mainland.

Despite these general considerations, at least two large scale land campaigns were fought during the First Punic War. In [[262 BC]], Rome besieged the city of [[Agrigentum]], an operation that involved both consular armies - a total of four [[Roman legion]]s - and took several months to resolve. The garrison of Agrigentum managed to call for reinforcements and a Carthaginian relief force commanded by [[Hanno]] came to the rescue. With the supplies from Syracuse cut, the Romans found themselves also besieged and constructed a line of [[circumvallation]]. After a few skirmishes, the [[battle of Agrigentum]] was fought and won by Rome, and the city fell.

Inspired by this victory, Rome attempted ([[256 BC|256]]/[[255 BC]]) another large scale land operation, this time with different results. Following several naval battles, Rome was aiming for a quick end to the war and decided to invade the Carthaginian colonies of Africa, to force the enemy to accept terms. A major fleet was built, both of transports for the army and its equipment and warships for protection. Carthage tried to intervene but was defeated in the [[battle of Cape Ecnomus]]. As a result, the Roman army, commanded by [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]], landed in Africa and began ravaging the Carthaginian countryside. At first Regulus was victorious, winning the [[battle of Adys]] and forcing Carthage to sue for peace. The terms were so heavy that negotiations failed and, in response, the Carthaginians hired [[Xanthippus]], a [[Spartan]] [[mercenary]], to reorganize the army. Xanthippus managed to cut off the Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthiginian naval supremacy, then defeated and captured Regulus at the [[battle of Tunis]].

Towards the end of the conflict ([[249 BC]]), Carthage sent general [[Hamilcar Barca]] ([[Hannibal]]'s father) to Sicily. Hamilcar managed to gain control of most of inland Sicily; in desperation, the Romans appointed a [[Roman dictator|dictator]] to resolve the situation. Nevertheless, Carthaginian success in Sicily was secondary to the progress of the war at sea; Hamilcar remaining undefeated in Sicily became irrelevant following the Roman naval victory at the [[battle of the Aegates Islands]] in [[241 BC]].

==Naval warfare==
Due to the difficulty of operating in Sicily, most of the First Punic War was fought at sea, including the most decisive battles. Moreover, naval warfare permitted an efficient blockade of enemy ports, and consequently of reinforcement and supply for the inland troops. Both sides of the conflict had publicly funded fleets. This fact compromised Carthage and Rome's finances and eventually decided the course of the war. 

At the beginning of the First Punic War, Rome had virtually no experience in [[naval warfare]], whereas Carthage had a great deal of experience on the seas thanks to its centuries of sea-based trade. Nevertheless, the growing Roman Republic soon understood the importance of Mediterranean control in the outcome of the conflict. 

The first major Roman fleet was constructed after the victory of Agrigentum in [[261 BC]]. Some historians have speculated that since Rome lacked advanced naval technology the design of the warships was probably copied verbatim from captured Carthaginian [[trireme]]s and [[quinquereme]]s or from ships that have beached on Roman shores due to storms. Other historians have pointed out that Rome did have experience with naval technology, as she patrolled her coasts against [[piracy]]. Regardless of the state of their naval technology at the start of the war, Rome quickly adapted.

Perhaps in order to compensate for the lack of experience, and to make use of standard land military tactics on sea, the Romans equipped their new ships with a special boarding device, the ''[[corvus (weapon)|corvus]]''. Instead of manuevering to ram, which was the stardard naval tactic at the time, corvus  equipped ships would maneuver alongside the enemy vessel, deploy the bridge which would attach to the enemy ship through spikes on the end of the bridge, and send [[legionnaires]] across as boarding parties.

The new weapon's efficiency was first proved in the [[battle of Mylae]], the first Roman naval victory, and continued to prove its value in the following years, especially in the huge [[Battle of Ecnomus]]. The addition of the ''corvus'' forced Carthage to review its military tactics, and since the city had difficulty in doing so, Rome had the naval advantage. Later, as Roman experience in naval warfare grew, the ''corvus'' device was abandoned due to its impact on the navigability of the war vessels. 

Despite the Roman victories in sea, the Roman Republic lost most ships and crews during the war, largely due to storms. On at least two occasions ([[255 BC|255]] and [[253 BC]]) whole fleets were destroyed in bad weather. The weight of the ''corvus'' on the prows of the ships made the ships unstable and caused them to sink in bad weather. Towards the end of the war Carthage ruled the seas, as Rome was unwilling to finance the construction of yet another expensive fleet. Nevertheless the Carthaginian faction that opposed the conflict, led by the land-owning [[aristocrat]] [[Hanno the Great]], gained power and in [[244 BC|244]] started the demobilization of the fleet, giving the Romans a chance to attain again naval superiority. Rome did build another fleet paid for with donations from wealthy citizens and the First Punic War was decided in the naval battle of the [[Aegadian Islands|Aegates Islands]] ([[March 10]] [[241 BC]]), where the new Roman fleet under consul [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]] scored a victory. Carthage lost most of its fleet and was economically incapable of funding another, or to find manpower for the crews. With no fleet, Hamilcar Barca was cut from Carthage and forced to surrender.

==Aftermath==
Rome won the First Punic War after 23 years of conflict and in the end replaced Carthage as the dominant naval power of the Mediterranean. In the aftermath of the war, both states were financially and demographically exhausted. To determine the final borders of their territories, they drew what they considered a straight line across the Mediterranean. [[Hispania]], Corsica, Sardinia and Africa remained Carthaginian. All that was north of that line was signed over to Rome. Rome's victory was greatly influenced by its persistent refusal to admit defeat and by accepting only total victory. Moreover, the Roman Republic's ability to attract private investments in the war effort, by playing on their citizens' patriotism to fund ships and crews, was one of the deciding factors of the war, particularly when contrasted with the Carthaginian nobility's apparent unwillingness to risk their fortunes for the common good. The end of the First Punic War also resulted in the official birth of the Roman navy, which greatly assisted the expansion of the Roman state.

===Casualties=== 
The exact number of casualties on each side is always difficult to determine, due to bias in the historical sources, normally directed to enhance Rome's value. (History is often written by the victors.)

According to sources (excluding land warfare casualties):
*Rome lost 700 ships (mainly to bad weather and incompetent leaders) and at least part of their crews.
*Carthage lost 500 ships and at least part of their crews.
*Each ship's crew was of about 100 men.

Although uncertain, the casualties were heavy for both sides. [[Polybius]] commented that the war was, at the time, the most destructive in terms of casualties in the history of warfare, including the battles of [[Alexander the Great]]. Analyzing the data from the Roman ''[[census]]'' of the 3rd century BC, [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] noted that during the conflict Rome lost about 50,000 citizens. This excludes auxiliary troops and every other man in the army without citizen status, who would be outside the head count.

===Peace terms===
The peace terms designed by the Romans were particularly heavy for Carthage, which was in no position to negotiate. The Romans demanded that:

*Carthage evacuate Sicily
*Carthage return their prisoners of war without ransom, while paying heavy ransom on their own
*Carthage refrain from attacking Syracuse and her allies
*Carthage transfer a group of small islands north of Sicily to Rome
*Carthage evacuate all of the small islands between Sicily and Africa
*Carthage pay a 2200 [[Talent (weight)|talent]] indemnity in ten annual instalments, plus an additional indemnity of 1000 talents immediately

Further clauses determined that the allies of each side would not be attacked by the other, no attacks were to be made by either side upon the other's allies and both sides were prohibited from raising troops within the territory of the other. This prevented the Carthaginians access to any Roman mercenary manpower.

===Political results===
In the aftermath of the war, Carthage had virtually no funds. When Hanno the Great refused to pay the disbanded military armies, an internal conflict, the [[Mercenary War]], broke out. After a hard struggle the combined efforts of Hamilcar Barca and Hanno the Great were finally able to defeat the mercenaries. However, during this conflict, Rome took the opportunity to strip Carthage of [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]] as well.

Perhaps the most immediate political result of the First Punic War was the downfall of Carthage as a major naval power. Conditions signed in the peace treaty compromised Carthage's economic situation and prevented the city's recovery. The indemnity demanded by the Romans caused additional strain on the city's finances and forced Carthage to look to other areas of influence for the money to pay Rome. An interesting comparison can be drawn with the politics of [[Germany]] following the defeat in [[World War I]] and the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which then led into [[World War II]]. 

As for Rome, the end of the First Punic War marked the start of the expansion beyond the Italian Peninsula. Sicily became the first [[Roman province]] ([[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicilia]]) governed by a former [[praetor]], instead of an ally. Sicily would become very important to Rome as [[Grain supply to the city of Rome|a source of grain]].

==Chronology==
*'''[[264 BC]]''' - The Mamertines plead assistance to both Rome and Carthage to deal with the attacks of Hiero II of Syracuse. Rome responds only after Carthage. 

*'''[[263 BC]]''' - Hiero II is defeated by consul [[Manius Valerius Messalla]] and is forced to change Syracuse's alliance to Rome. 

*'''[[262 BC]]''' - Roman intervention in Sicily. The city of Agrigentum, occupied by Carthage, is besieged.

*'''[[261 BC]]''' - [[Battle of Agrigentum]], which results in a Roman victory. Rome decides to build a fleet to threaten Carthaginian domination in the sea.

*'''[[260 BC]]''' - First naval encounter ([[battle of the Lipari Islands]]) is a disaster to Rome, but soon afterwards, [[Gaius Duilius]] wins the [[battle of Mylae]] with the help of the ''[[corvus (weapon)|corvus]]'' engine.

*'''[[259 BC]]''' - The land fighting is extended to [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]].

*'''[[258 BC]]''' - Naval [[battle of Sulci]]: Roman victory.

*'''[[257 BC]]''' - Naval [[battle of Tyndaris]]: Roman victory.

*'''[[256 BC]]''' - Rome attempts to invade Africa and Carthage attempts to intersect the transport fleet. The resulting [[battle of Cape Ecnomus]] is a major victory for Rome, who lands in Africa and advances on Carthage. The [[battle of Adys]] is the first Roman success in African soil and Carthage sues for peace. Negotiations fail to reach agreement and the war continues.

*'''[[255 BC]]''' - The Carthaginians employ a [[Sparta]]n general, [[Xanthippus]], to organize their defences and defeat the Romans at the [[battle of Tunis]]. The Roman survivors are evacuated by a fleet to be destroyed soon afterwards, on their way back to Sicily. 

*'''[[254 BC]]''' - A new fleet of 140 Roman ships is constructed to substitute the one lost in the storm and a new army is levied. The Romans win a victory at [[battle of Panormus|Panormus]], in Sicily, but fail to make any further progress in the war. Five Greek cities in Sicily defect from Carthage to Rome. 

*'''[[253 BC]]''' - The Romans then pursued a policy of raiding the African coast east of Carthage. After an unsuccessful year the fleet head for home. During the return to Italy the Romans are again caught in a storm and lose 150 ships.

*'''[[251 BC]]''' - The Romans again win at Panormus over the Carthaginians, led by Hasdrubal. As a result of the recent losses, Carthage endeavours to strengthen its garrisons in Sicily and recapture Agrigentum. Romans begin siege of Lilybaeum.

*'''[[249 BC]]''' - Rome loses almost a whole fleet in the [[battle of Drepana]]. In the same year [[Hamilcar Barca]] accomplishes successful raids in Sicily and yet another storm destroys the remainder of the Roman ships. Aulus Atilius Caiatinus is appointed dictator and sent to Sicily.

*'''[[248 BC|248]]''' - Beginning of a period of low intensity fighting in Sicily, without naval battles. This lull would last until [[241 BC]].

*'''[[244 BC]]''' - With little to no naval engagements, [[Hanno the Great]] of Carthage advocates demobilization of large parts of the Cathaginian navy to save money. Carthage does so.

*'''[[242 BC]]''' - Rome constructs another major battle fleet.

*'''[[241 BC]]''' - On [[March 10]] takes place the [[Battle of the Aegates Islands]], with a decisive Roman victory. Carthage is force to accept peace terms and the First Punic War ends.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''false document''' is a form of [[verisimilitude]] that attempts to create in the reader (viewer, audience, etc) a sense of authenticity beyond the normal and expected [[suspension of disbelief]]. That is, it wants to fool the audience briefly into thinking that what is being presented is actually a fact. This is not to be confused with a [[mockumentary]], an admittedly [[fictional film]] done in the manner of a documentary.

In practice, the device takes a very simple form. The [[work (fine arts)|work of art]] (be it a text, a moving image, a comic book or whatever) usually is composed of or includes some piece of [[forgery]]. The false document effect can be achieved in many ways including faked police reports, newspaper articles, bibliographical references and documentary footage. The effect can be extended outside of the confines of the text by way of supplementary material such as badges, ID cards, diaries, letters or other objects.

The moral and legal implications of false document art are, by necessity, complex and perhaps insoluble. The difference between a great artistic achievement and a stunning forgery is slim. Sometimes the false document technique can be the subject of a work instead of its technique, though these two approaches are not mutually exclusive as many texts which engage falseness do so both on the literal and the thematic level.

==Origin of the false document technique==
One of the earliest examples of the technique is the 16th century [[romance (genre)|romance]] ''[[Amadis de Gaula|Amadis of Gaul]]'' ([[1508]], [[Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo]]).

== False documents in film==
The 1973 film ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' claims to be based on true events, but this is not the case.

== False documents in art==
[[Orson Welles]]' ''[[F for Fake]]'' is a prime example of a film which is both about [[falsification]] ([[art forgery]] and the journalism surrounding art forgery) as well as having falsified moments within the film. The movie follows the exploits of a famous art forger, his biographer [[Clifford Irving]], and the subsequent fake [[autobiography]] of [[Howard Hughes]] that Irving tries to publish. The issues of veracity and forgery are explored in the film while at the same time, Welles tricks the audience by incorporating fake bits of narrative alongside the documentary footage.

Another artist who has run afoul of the technique is the artist [[JSG Boggs]], whose life and work have been extensively explored by author and journalist [[Lawrence Weschler]]. Boggs draws currency with exceptional care and accuracy, but he only ever draws one side. He then attempts to buy things with the piece of paper upon which he has drawn the currency. His goal is to pass each bill for its face value in common transactions. He buys lunch, clothes, and lodging in this manner, and after the transactions are complete his bills fetch many times their face value on the art market along with accompanying evidence (receipts, photos, and the like) which prove the veracity of the actual transaction. Boggs does not make any money off of the much larger art market value of his work. He only exists on the profit of the actual transaction. He has been arrested in many countries, and there is much controversy surrounding his work.

Mostly, however, the technique is employed in more mundane ways that hark back to its nineteenth century origins. Whether a particular piece of art is a false document, or is using false documentary techniques in a central way, is of course arguable. Usually, the character and extent of the use is examined.

== False documents, fakery and forgery ==
Documentary filmmaking, and other attempts at actual documentation, can wittingly and unwittingly participate in the form as its goals of authenticity are so closely aligned with direct false documentation (that is, in both cases there is an element of authenticity and an element of narrative fudging). In Schwarzenegger's ''Pumping Iron'' for example, Arnold talks about how his father died in the months preceding a major body building competition. He uses this [[anecdote]] to illustrate how important the final months before a competition are to a truly dedicated bodybuilder. He says that, though his father's funeral was set during the penultimate month, he did not attend because he could not be distracted from training. However, in the companion book it is revealed that at the time of printing, Arnold's father had not died. It does not say the story was a lie, it merely provides contrary evidence. Schwarzenegger was executive producer of both the film and the companion book. It has been theorized by Professor Sally Robinson that Schwarzenegger was intentionally undermining his own narrative, effectively creating a mildly self-deprecating re-examination of his own obsessions for perfection at any cost. In the end, whether Arnold intentionally fabricated the story for a desired effect is left to the audience.

* ''[[Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonder]]'' by [[Lawrence Weschler]]
* ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'' by [[Jean Baudrillard]]

== False documents in fiction ==
Several fiction writers use the technique of inventing a piece of literature or non-fiction and referring to this work as if it actually existed, often also quoting from the work. 

Blurring the line of reality and fiction is an important component of horror, mystery, [[Detective fiction|detective]] and fantasy narratives because they wish to engender in the reader a sense of wonder, and of danger, both of which need to feel more present than a typical narrative form would allow. For this reason, false documentary techniques have been in use for at least as long as these literary genres have been around. ''[[Frankenstein]]'' draws heavily on a forged document feel, as does ''[[Dracula]]'', ''[[The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' and many of the works of [[Jules Verne]] and [[H.G. Wells]].  [[Vladimir Nabokov|Vladimir Nabokov's]] ''[[Pale Fire]]'' is a particularly elaborate variation.

The following is a list of &quot;false document&quot; fictional documents:

* [[Miguel de Cervantes]] claims that all the chapters but the first in [[Don Quixote]] are translated from an Arabic manuscript by ''Cide Hamete Benengeli''. He is parodying a plot device of [[chivalric romance|chivalry book]]s. For instance, [[Joanot Martorell]] in the introductory letter to [[Tirant lo Blanc]] claims to be not the creator of a fiction, but the translator of an English historical manuscript.
* [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' was supposedly the [[aems. To cross even the Atlantic ocean, such a vessel needs to be refueled en route. These limitations were not much hardship for a WWII anti-submarine vessel but would seriously hinder a battle fleet in which destroyers were replaced by such frigates.

In the 1960s and 1970s, &quot;guided missile frigates&quot; have brought an anti-air warfare (AAW) capability to the frigate mission, but they have some limitations. Designed as cost-efficient surface combatants, they lack the multi-mission capability necessary for modern surface combatants faced with multiple, high-technology threats and offer limited capacity for growth. Until 1975 in the US Navy, these vessels were called &amp;quot;[[Ocean escort|Ocean Escort]]s&amp;quot; and designated &amp;quot;DE&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;DEG&amp;quot; (a holdover from the Second World War, when they were called &amp;quot;[[Destroyer escort|Destroyer Escort]]s&amp;quot;). Other navies called them &quot;frigates&quot; from the end of World War II on.

[[Image:Frigate Class Ships.jpg|left|Modern Frigates]]

From the 1950s to the 1970s, guided missile &quot;frigates&quot; were commissioned in the United States Navy, which were actually AAW [[cruisers]] built on [[destroyer]]-style hulls; some of them (the American ''Bainbridge''-, ''Truxtun''-, ''California''- and ''Virginia''-classes) were nuclear powered. These were far larger than any other frigates ever seen (though the use of these &quot;frigates&quot; in comparison to the larger &quot;cruisers&quot; was analogous to the relationship between age of sail frigates and [[ships of the line]]), and all were properly reclassified as &quot;guided missile cruisers&quot; in 1975 (except for the smaller [[Farragut class destroyer (1958)|''Farragut''-class]] class ships, which were reclassified as [[guided missile destroyer]]s) and struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] in the [[1990s]]. With the improvement of the anti-air and anti-missile missiles (like the [[MBDA Aster|Aster 15]]), such frigates are increasingly used as a fleet defense platform.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, some frigates are specialised in [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW). They bear improved [[sonar]] equipment, [[torpedo]]es, and even missile-carried anti-submarine torpedoes like [[ASROC]]. They retain minimal anti-surface capabilites with anti-ship missiles (like the [[Exocet]]), but carry weapons against air threats only for self-defense.

Especially for ASW, most modern frigates have [[Helipad|landing decks]] aft and [[hangar]]s to carry [[helicopter]]s: Without the need of closing distance to detected unknown subsurface contacts and thus risking to be attacked a frigate utilizes its helicopters equipped with sensors such as [[sonobuoy]]s, wire-mounted dipping sonar and [[magnetic anomaly detector]]s to identify possible threats and combat confirmed targets with [[torpedo]]es or [[depth-charge]]s carried by the helicopter. With their onboard radar helicopters can also be used to reconnoiter for targets over the horizon and if equipped with [[anti-ship missile]]s such as [[Penguin missile|''Penguin'']] for anti-surface warfare as well. They are invaluable for [[search and rescue]] operation and largely replaced the use of [[dinghy|dinghies]] or the manouvre of bringing ships alongside for duties such as ferrying personell, mail and cargo between ships or ship-to-shore. With helicopters theses tasks can be accomplished faster and less dangerously and also allows the frigate to keep course.

Modern times have seen the arrival of [[Stealth technology|stealth]] frigates fitted with anti-missile capabilities. Their shapes, designed to offer a minimal radar signature, also give them a good air penetration; the manoeuverability of these frigates has been compared to those of sailing ships. A good example is the French [[La Fayette class frigate|''La Fayette''-class]] with the [[MBDA Aster|Aster 15]] missile.

Some new classes of frigates are optimized for high-speed deployment and combat with small craft ahead of the usual idea of sea combat between equal opponents, an example of this school of thought is the American [[Littoral Combat Ship]], as exemplified by the first ship of the type, [[USS Freedom (LCS-1)|USS ''Freedom'']].

[[Image:1francisco-franco.jpg|frame|right|150px|Francisco Franco]]
'''Francisco Paulino Hermenegildo Teódulo Franco y Bahamonde''' ([[Pronunciation|pron.]] [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] : {{IPA|[fran'θisko 'franko]}}; [[December 4]] [[1892]] &amp;ndash; [[November 20]] (or possibly [[November 19]] {{ref_label|Deathdate|*|none}}) [[1975]]), abbreviated '''Francisco Franco y Bahamonde''' and sometimes known as ''[[Generalissimo|Generalísimo]]'' '''Francisco Franco''', was the [[regent]] and [[Head of State]] of [[Spain]] (in parts of the country from [[1936]] and in its entirety from [[1939]]) until his death in [[1975]]. During his rule he was known officially as ''&quot;El [[Caudillo]] de la Ultima Cruzada y de la Hispanidad, El Caudillo de la Guerra de Liberacion contra el Comunismo y sus Complices&quot;{{citationneeded}}'' (The Leader of Last Crusade and Hispanidad, The Leader of Freedom War against comunism) and presided over the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] government of the [[Spanish State]] following victory in the [[Spanish Civil War]].

==Early life==
Franco was born in [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Spain]]. His father ''Nicolas Franco Salgado-Araujo'' was a [[Navy]] accounting officer. His mother ''Pilar Bahamonde Pardo de Andrade'' also came from a family with naval tradition. He was sibling to  [[Nicolás Franco Bahamonde]], navy officer and diplomat, a sister, [[Pilar Franco Bahamonde]], latter a well known socialite, and  [[Ramón Franco]] a pioneer aviator and political conspirator.

His hometown was officially known as '''El Ferrol del Caudillo''' from [[1938]] to [[1982]].

As the entry into the Naval Academy was closed from [[1906]] to [[1913]], he entered in [[1907]] the Infantry Academy in [[Toledo, Spain]], where he graduated as 2nd [[lieutenant]] in [[1910]]. 

Two years later, he obtained a commission to [[Morocco]]. Spanish efforts to physically occupy their new [[African]] [[protectorate]] provoked a long protracted war (from [[1909]] to [[1927]]) with native Moroccans. Tactics at the time resulted in heavy losses among Spanish [[officer (armed forces)|military officers]], but also gave the chance of earning promotion through [[merit]]. This explains the saying that officers would get either ''la caja o la faja'' (a coffin or a general's sash).

Franco soon gained a reputation as a good officer. He joined the newly formed ''[[regulares]]'' [[colonial]] native troops with Spanish officials, which acted as [[shock troops]].

In [[1916]], at the age of 23 and already a [[captain#military|captain]], he was badly wounded in a [[skirmish]] at [[El Biutz]]. This action marked him permanently in the eyes of the native troops as a man of ''[[baraka]]'' (good luck). He was also proposed unsuccessfully for Spain's highest honor for gallantry, the coveted [[Cruz Laureada de San Fernando]]. Instead, he was promoted to [[major]] (''comandante''), becoming the youngest [[staff officer]] in the Spanish Army. 

From [[1917]] to [[1920]] he was posted on the Spanish mainland. That last year, Lieutenant Colonel [[José Millán Astray]], a [[histrionic]] but [[charismatic]] officer, founded the ''[[Spanish Foreign Legion|Legión Extranjera]]'', along similar lines to the [[French Foreign Legion]]. Franco became the ''Legión''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s second-in-command and returned to Africa.

In summer [[1921]], the overextended Spanish army suffered ([[July 24]]) a [[Disaster of Annual|crushing defeat]] at [[Annual (Morocco)|Annual]] at the hands of the [[Rif]] tribes led by the [[Abd el-Krim]] brothers. The ''Legión'' symbolically, if not materially, saved the Spanish enclave of [[Melilla]] after a gruelling three-day forced march led by Franco. In [[1923]], already a [[lieutenant colonel]], he was made commander of the Legión.

The same year he married María del [[Carmen Polo|Carmen Polo y Martínez Valdés]] and they had one child, a daughter, [[María del Carmen]], born in [[1926]]. &lt;!--citation for birthdate: http://www.thepeerage.com/p11214.htm#i112139--&gt; As a special mark of honour, his [[best man]] (''padrino'') at the wedding was King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]], a fact which would mark him, during the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] as a monarchical officer.

Promoted to Colonel, Franco led the first wave of troops ashore at [[Alhucemas]] in 1925. This landing in the heartland of Abd el-Krim's tribe, combined with the French invasion from the south, spelled the beginning of the end for the shortlived [[Republic of the Rif]].

Becoming the youngest [[general]] in Spain in [[1926]], Franco was appointed in [[1928]] director of the newly created '''Joint Military Academy''' in [[Zaragoza]], a common college for all Army [[cadet|cadets]].

==During the Second Spanish Republic==
[[Image:Celebracion_de_la_victoria_electoral_del_Frente_Popular_en_Madrid.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Jubilant demonstration in Madrid after the Popular Front victory in the Spanish general elections of 16 February 1936]]

At the fall of the monarchy in [[1931]], in keeping with his prior apolitical record, he did not take any remarkable attitude. But the closing of the Academy in June by then War Minister [[Manuel Azaña]] provoked the first clash: Azaña found Franco's farewell speech to the cadets [http://www.generalisimofranco.com/discurso12.htm] insulting, resulting in Franco being without a post for six months, and under surveillance.

On  [[February 5]][[1932]] he was given a command in [[A Coruña]]. Franco avoided being involved in [[Jose Sanjurjo]]'s attempted ''coup'' that year. As a side result of Azaña's military reform, in January [[1933]] Franco was relegated from the first to the 24th in the list of Brigadiers; conversely, the same year ([[February 17]]), he was given the military command of the [[Balearic Islands]]&amp;mdash;a post above his grade.

===The Asturias Uprising===
On October [[1933]], new elections were held, which resulted in a center-right majority. In opposition to this government, a [[Anarchism in Spain#Prelude to Revolution|revolutionary movement]] broke out [[October 5]], [[1934]]. This attempt was rapidly quelled in most of the country, but gained a stronghold in [[Asturias]], with the support of the [[miner]]s' unions. Franco, already general of a Division and assessor to the war minister, was put in command of the operations directed to suppress the insurgency. The forces of the Army in Africa were to carry the brunt of the operations, with General [[Eduardo López Ochoa]] as commander in the field. After two weeks of heavy fighting (and a death toll estimated between 1,200 and 2,000), the rebellion was suppressed. 


The uprising and, in general, the events that led over the next two years to the civil war, are still under heavy debate (between, for example, [[Enrique Moradiellos]] and [[Pio Moa]]: see [http://es.wikipedia.org/Revolución_de_1934], [http://www.nodulo.org/ec/2005/n035p02.htm], or [http://www.nodulo.org/ec/polemica.htm#p15]). Nonetheless, it is universally agreed that the insurgency in Asturias sharpened the antagonism between left and right. Franco and Lopez Ochoa&amp;mdash;who up to that moment was seen as a left-leaning officer&amp;mdash;were marked by the left as enemies. Lopez Ochoa was persecuted, jailed, and finally killed at the start of the war.

Some time after these events, Franco was briefly commander-in-chief of the Army of Africa (from [[February 15]][[1935]] onwards), and from [[May 19]][[1935]] on, [[Chief of the General Staff]], the top military post in Spain.

===The government of the Popular Front===
After the centre parties of the ruling coalition collapsed amid corruption scandals (the [[estraperlo]] case), new elections were scheduled. Two wide coalitions formed: the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] on the left, from Republicans to the Communists, and the [[Frente Nacional]], on the right, from the centre [[radicalism|radicals]] to the conservative [[Carlism|Carlists]]). On [[February 16]] [[1936]], the left won by a narrow margin[http://www.guerracivil1936.galeon.com/fpopular.htm]. The days after were marked by near chaotic circumstances. Franco lobbied unsuccessfully to have a state of emergency declared, with the stated purpose to quell the disturbances and allow an orderly vote recount. Instead, Franco was sent ([[February 23]]) as military commander of the [[Canary Islands]], a distant place with few troops under his command.

Meanwhile, the conspiracy led by [[Emilio Mola]] was taking shape, Franco was contacted, although he did not endorse the coup but maintained an ambiguous attitude almost up to July. Yet on [[June 23]] [[1936]], he wrote to the head of the government [[Casares Quiroga]] offering to quell the discontent in the army, but the government answer was never satisfactory to him. In July, after the middle classes and the centre-right joined the rebellion, the situation reached a point of no return and, as presented to Franco by Mola, the coup was unavoidable and he had to choose a side. Once decided to join, he was given the task of commanding the African Army. A private airplane (the Dragon Rapide) was chartered in England [[July 11]] to bring him to Africa. 

The assassination of the political opposition leader [[José Calvo Sotelo]] by government police troops triggered the uprising. On [[July 17]] the African Army rebelled, detaining their commanders. On [[July 18]] Franco published a manifesto [http://www.generalisimofranco.com/discurso11.htm] and left for Africa, where he arrived the next day to take command.

A week later, the rebels, who soon came to be known as the Nacionales (literally Nationals, but almost always referred to in English as Nationalists), controlled only a third of Spain, and most [[navy]] units remained under control of the opposition Republican forces, which left Franco isolated. The coup had failed, but the [[Spanish Civil War]] had begun.

===The first months===
The first days of the rebellion were marked with the need of securing the control over the [[Protectorate]]. On one side, Franco managed to win the support of the natives and their (nominal) authorities. On the other to insure his control over the army. This led to the execution of some senior officers loyal to the republic (one of them his own first cousin) [http://www.memoriahistorica.org/alojados/periquete/paginas/noticias1.html].
Franco had to face the problem of how to move his troops to the [[Iberian Peninsula]], because most units of the Navy had remained in control of the republic and were blocking the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. From the [[July 20]] onward he was able, with a small group of aeroplanes, to initiate an air bridge to [[Seville]], where his troops helped to insure the rebel control of the city. Through representatives, he started to negotiate with the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]] and [[Italy]] for military support, and above all for more aeroplanes. Negotiations were successful with the last two on [[July 25]], and aeroplanes began to arrive in [[Tetouan]] on [[August 2]]. [[August 5]], with this fresh air support, he was able to break the blockade and send a ship convoy with some 2,000 soldiers.

In early August, the situation in western [[Andalusia]] was stable enough to allow him to organize a column (some 15,000 men at its height), under the command of then Lieutenant-Colonel [[Juan Yagüe]], which would march through [[Extremadura]] towards [[Madrid]]. [[August 11]], [[Mérida]] was taken, and [[August 15]] [[Badajoz]], thus joining both nationalist-controlled areas.
On [[September 21]], with the head of the column at the town of [[Maqueda]] (some 80 km away from Madrid), Franco ordered a detour to free the besieged garrison at the [[Alcázar]] of [[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]], which was achieved [[September 27]]. This decision was controversial even then, but resulted in an important propaganda success, both for the nationalist party and for Franco himself.

===Rise to power===
The designated leader of the uprising, Gen. [[José Sanjurjo]] had died on [[July 20]] in an air crash. The nationalist leaders managed to overcome this through regional commands: ([[Emilio Mola|Mola]] in the North, [[Gonzalo Queipo de Llano|Queipo]] in [[Andalusia]], Franco with an independent command and [[Miguel Cabanellas|Cabanellas]] in [[Aragon]]), and a coordinating [[junta]] nominally led by the last, as the most senior general.
On [[September 21]], it was decided that Franco was to be commander-in-chief, and [[September 28]], after some discussion, also head of government. On [[October 1]], [[1936]] he was publicly proclaimed as ''Generalissimo'' of the Nationalist army and ''Jefe del Estado'' ([[Head of State]]).

===Military command===
From that time until the end of the war, Franco personally guided military operations. After the failure to take [[Madrid]] in November [[1936]], Franco settled to a piecemeal approach to winning the war, rather than bold maneuvering. As with his decision to relieve the garrison at Toledo, this approach has been subject of some debate; some of his decisions, such as in June [[1938]] when he preferred to head for [[Valencia]] instead of [[Catalonia]], remain particularly controversial.

His army was supported by troops from [[Nazi Germany]] (the [[Condor Legion]]) and, above all, [[Fascist]] [[Italy]] (''[[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]]''), but the degree of influence of both powers on Franco's direction of war seems to have been very limited. [[António de Oliveira Salazar]]'s [[Portugal]] also openly assisted the Nationalists from the start.

===Political command===
He managed to fuse the [[ideologically]] incompatible national-syndicalists [[Falange]] (&quot;[[phalanx]]&quot;, a [[far-right]] Spanish [[political party]] with ideology similar to that of [[Mussolini]]'s movement) and the [[Carlism|Carlist]] monarchist parties under his rule. 

From early [[1937]] every death sentence had to be signed (or acknowledged) by Franco.

===The end of the war===
On [[March 4]][[1939]] an upraising broke out within the Republican camp, claiming to forestall an intended Communist coup by prime minister Juan Negrín. Led by Colonel [[Segismundo Casado]] and [[Julián Besteiro]], the rebels gained control over [[Madrid]]. They tried to negotiate a settlement with Franco, who refused anything but [[unconditional surrender]]. They gave way; Madrid was occupied on [[March 27]], and the republic fell. The war officially ended on [[April 1]], [[1939]].

During the 1940s, some [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] resistance to Franco was to be found in isolated rural areas such as the [[Val d'Aran]] in [[Catalonia]].

Spain was bitterly divided and economically ruined as a result of the civil war.
 
After the war a very harsh repression began, with hundreds of thousands of summary executions, an unknown number of political prisoners and thousands of people in exile, largely in France and Latin America. The 1940 shooting of the president of the [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Catalan government]], [[Lluís Companys]], was one of the most notable cases of this early repression, while the major groups targeted were real and suspected [[leftists]], ranging from the moderate, democratic left to [[Communists]] and [[Anarchists]], the Spanish [[intelligentsia]], [[atheists]] and military and government figures that had remained loyal to the Madrid government during the war. The bloodshed in Spain did not end with the cessation of hostilities, many political prisoners suffered execution by the fire squad, because of the accusation of treason.

In September 1939, [[World War II]] broke out in Europe, and although [[Adolf Hitler]] met Franco in [[Hendaye]], France ([[October 23]], [[1940]]), to discuss Spanish entry on the side of the [[Axis Powers|Axis]], Franco's demands (food, military equipment, [[Gibraltar]], [[French North Africa]], etc.) proved too much and no agreement was reached. Contributing to the disagreement was an ongoing dispute over German mining rights in Spain. Some historians argue that Franco made demands that he knew Hitler would not accede to in order to stay out of the war. Other historians argue that he simply had nothing to offer the Germans. After the collapse of France in June 1940, Spain adopted a pro-Axis non-belligerency stance (for example, he offered Spanish naval facilities to German ships) until returning to complete neutrality in 1943 when the tide of the war had turned decisively against Germany. Some volunteers spanish troops - not stately accepted by Franco -  (''[[División Azul]]'', or &quot;Blue Division&quot;) to fight on the [[Eastern Front (WWII)|Eastern Front]] against the [[comunism]]. During the war Franco's Spain also proved to be a safe haven for 350 000{{citationneeded}} European Jews fleeing from deportation to the concentration camps from occupied France.

With the end of World War II, Franco and Spain were forced to suffer the economic consequences of the isolation imposed on it by nations such as the United Kingdom and the United States. This situation  ended in part when, due to Spain's strategic location in light of [[Cold War]] tensions, the [[United States]] entered into a trade and military alliance with Spain.  This historic alliance commenced with U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]'s visit in [[1953]] which resulted in the [[Pact of Madrid]]. This launched the so-called &quot;[[Spanish Miracle]],&quot; which developed Spain from [[autarky]] into [[capitalism]]. Spain was admitted in the [[United Nations]] in [[1955]]. In spite of this opening, Franco almost never left Spain once in power.

Lacking any strong ideology, Franco initially sought support from [[National syndicalism]] (''nacionalsindicalismo'') and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (''nacionalcatolicismo''). His coalition-ruling single party, the [[Movimiento Nacional]], was so heterogeneous as to barely qualify as a party at all, and certainly not an ideological monolith like the Fascio di Combattimento ([[Fascist Party]]) or the ruling block of [[Antonio Salazar]]. His Spanish State was chiefly a conservative&amp;mdash;even traditionalist&amp;mdash;rightist regime, with emphasis on order and stability, rather than a definite political vision.

In [[1947]] Franco proclaimed Spain a [[monarchy]], but did not designate a monarch. This gesture was largely done to appease monarchist factions within the Movimiento. Although a self-proclaimed monarchist himself, Franco had no particular desire for a king. As such, he left the throne vacant, with himself as ''de facto'' [[regent]]. He wore the uniform of a captain general (a rank traditionally reserved for the King), resided in the Pardo Palace, appropriated the kingly privilege of walking beneath a [[baldachin|canopy]], and his portrait appeared on most Spanish coins. Indeed, although his formal titles were ''Jefe del Estado'' (Chief of State) and ''Generalísimo de los Ejércitos Españoles'' (Highest General of the Spanish Armed Forces), he was referred to as ''por la gracia de Dios, Caudillo de España y de la Cruzada'', or &quot;by the grace of God, the Leader of Spain and of the Crusade&quot; (&quot;[[by the grace of God]]&quot; is a technical, legal phrase which indicates sovereign dignity in [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]], and is only used by monarchs).

During his rule non-government [[trade union]]s and all political opponents across the [[political spectrum]], from [[communism|communist]] and [[anarchism|anarchist]] organizations to [[liberal democracy|liberal democrats]] and [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan]] or [[Basque nationalism|Basque]] nationalists, were suppressed. The only legal &quot;trade union&quot; was the government-run [[Sindicato Vertical]].

In order to build a uniform Spanish nation, the public usage of languages other than [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (especially [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Basque language]]s) was strongly repressed. [[Language politics in Francoist Spain]] stated that all government, notarial, legal and commercial documents were drawn up exclusively in Spanish and any written in other languages were deemed null and void. The usage of other than Spanish languages was banned on road and shop signs, advertising and in general all exterior images of the country. 

All cultural activities were subject to [[censorship]], and many were plainly forbidden on various, many times spurious, grounds (political or moral). This cultural policy relaxed with time, most notably after 1960. 

The enforcement by public authorities of strict [[Catholic]] social [[mores]] was a stated intent of the regime, mainly by using a law (the ''Ley de Vagos y Maleantes'', Vagancy Act) enacted by [[Manuel Azaña|Azaña]] [http://search.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/tifs.php?coleccion=gazeta&amp;anyo=1933&amp;nbo=217&amp;lim=A&amp;pub=BOE&amp;pco=874&amp;pfi=877].
The remaining nomads of Spain ([[Gitano]]s and [[Merchero]]s like [[El Lute]]) were especially affected.

In [[1954]], [[homosexuality]] and [[prostitution]] were, through this law, made criminal offenses.
[http://search.boe.es/datos/imagenes/BOE/1954/198/A04862.tif]. Its application was inconsistent.

In every town there was a constant presence of ''[[Guardia Civil (Spain)|Guardia Civil]]'', a military police force, who patrolled in pairs with [[submachine gun]]s, and functioned as his chief means of control. He was constantly obsessed with a [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] conspiracy. In popular imagination, he is often remembered as in the black and white images of ''[[No-Do]]'' [[newsreel]]s, inaugurating a [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]], hence his nickname ''Paco Ranas'' (Paco&amp;mdash;a familiar form of Francisco&amp;mdash;&quot;the Frog&quot;), or catching huge fish from the '''Azor''' yacht during his holidays.

[[Image:Tomb_of_francisco_franco.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Franco's tomb is incidentally located at his monumental [[Monumento Nacional de Santa Cruz del Valle de los Caidos|Santa Cruz del Valle de los Caídos]], a memorial to all casualties of Spanish Civil War, from 1940 onwards]]
Famous quote: &quot;Our regime is based on bayonets and blood, not on hypocritical elections.&quot; 

In [[1968]], due to the United Nations' pressure on Spain, Franco granted [[Equatorial Guinea]] its independence.

In [[1969]] he designated Prince [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos de Borbón]] with the new title of Prince of Spain as his successor. This came as a surprise for the [[Carlism|Carlist]] pretender to the throne, as well as for Juan Carlos's father, [[Juan de Borbón|Don Juan, the Count of Barcelona]], who technically had a superior right to the throne. By [[1973]] Franco had given up the function of [[prime minister]] (''Presidente del Gobierno''), remaining only as head of the country and as commander in chief of the military forces. As his final years progressed tension within the various factions of the Movimiento would consume Spanish political life, as varying groups jockeyed for position  to control the country's future.

&lt;div id=&quot;Deathdate&quot;&gt;{{note_label|Deathdate|›|none}}
Franco died on [[November 20]], [[1975]], at the age of 82&amp;mdash;the same date as [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]], founder of the [[Falange]]. It is suspected that the doctors were ordered to keep him barely alive by artificial means until that symbolic date. The historian, Ricardo de la Cierva, says that on the 19th around 6 pm he was told that Franco had already died. Franco is buried at [[Santa Cruz del Valle de los Caídos]], a site built by forced prisoners of the Spanish Civil War as the tomb for anonymous soldiers dead during war. &lt;/div&gt;

==Spain after Franco==
{{main|Spanish transition to democracy}}
Franco's successor as head of state was the current Spanish monarch, [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos]]. Though much beloved by Franco, the King held liberal political views which earned him suspicion among conservatives who hoped he would continue Franco's policies. Instead, Juan Carlos would proceed to restore democracy in the nation, and help crush an [[23-F|attempted military coup]] in 1981.

Since Franco's death, almost all the placenames [[personality cult|named after him]] (most Spanish towns had a '''calle del Generalísimo''') have been changed. This holds particularly true in the regions ruled by parties heir to the Republican side, while in other regions of central Spain rulers have preferred not to change such placenames, arguing they would rather ''not stir the past''. Most statues or monuments of him have also been removed, and the last one standing in the capital, Madrid, was removed in March 2005.

He was [[canonization|declared a saint]] by Pope Gregory XVII ([[Clemente Domínguez y Gómez]]) of the [[Palmarian Catholic Church]], a right-wing Catholic mysticalist [[sect]] largely based in Spain.  Franco's canonization is not recognized by the mainstream [[Roman Catholic Church]].

== Franco in Culture ==

The famous [[Saturday Night Live]] Skit Weekend Report when it began in 1975 had [[Chevy Chase]] saying &quot;[[Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still dead]]&quot;!

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&quot;Flash Crowd&quot;''' was a [[1973]] short story by [[science fiction author]] [[Larry Niven]], one of a series about the social consequence of inventing an instantaneous, practically free [[transfer booth]]s that could take one anywhere on [[Earth]] in milliseconds.

One consequence not predicted by the builders of the system, was that with the almost instantaneous reporting of newsworthy events, tens of thousands of people worldwide would flock to the scene of anything interesting &amp;mdash; along with criminals, hoping to experience or exploit the instant disorder and confusion so created.

Larry Niven anticipated the phenomenon known as a [[Flash mob]] thirty years before it became reality. The only change of the idea in real life was: instead of instant teleportation the crowds organized themselves by [[instant messaging]] and the [[Internet]].

In various other books, for example ''[[Ringworld]]'', Larry Niven suggests that easy transportation might be disruptive to traditional behaviour and open the way for new forms of parties, spontaneous congregations or shopping trips around the world.

On the [[World Wide Web]], a similar phenomenon can occur, when a web site catches the attention of a large number of people, and gets an unexpected and overloading surge of traffic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Fem isa 2.gif|right|thumb|300px|Female internal reproductive anatomy]]

The '''Fallopian tubes''', also known as '''oviducts''' and '''uterine tubes''', are two very fine tubes leading from the [[ovaries]] of female [[mammal|mammals]] into the [[uterus]]. They are named after their discoverer, the [[16th century]] [[Italy|Italian]] anatomist, [[Gabriele Falloppio]].

There are two Fallopian tubes, attached to either side of the [[cranial]] end of the uterus, and each terminating at or near one ovary forming a structure called the [[fimbria]].

When an [[ovum]] is developing in an ovary, it is encapsulated in a sac known as an [[ovarian follicle]]. On maturity of the ovum, the follicle and the ovary's wall rupture, allowing the ovum to escape and enter the Fallopian tube. There it travels toward the uterus, pushed along by movements of [[cilia]] on the inner lining of the tubes. This trip takes hours or days.  If the ovum is [[fertilisation|fertilized]] while in the Fallopian tube, then it normally implants in the [[endometrium]] when it reaches the uterus, which signals the beginning of [[pregnancy]]. Occasionally the embryo implants into the Fallopian tube instead of the uterus, creating an [[ectopic pregnancy]].

[[Image:Female anatomy frontal.png|right|Schematic frontal view of female anatomy]]
The Fallopian tubes are ''not'' [[homologous]] to the [[vas deferens]] or any other structure in males. [[Embryo]]s have ''two'' pairs of ducts to let [[gamete]]s out of the body; one pair develops in females into the Fallopian tubes, uterus and [[vagina]], while the other pair develops in males into the [[epididymis]] and vas deferens. Normally, only one of the pair of tubes will develop while the other regresses and disappears ''in utero''.

The Fallopian tubes are not directly attached to the ovaries, but open into the [[peritoneum|peritonial cavity]] (essentially the inside of the abdomen); they thus form a direct communication between the peritoneal cavity and the outside via the vagina.

The surgical removal of a Fallopian tube is called a [[salpingecing company [[Lockheed Martin Aircraft Argentina SA|FMA]] (Fábrica Militar de Aviones) is now owned by Lockheed-Martin.

Since the end of the war, Latin America has consistently purchased more American and Russian aircraft than French.  The last major French combat aircraft sale in Latin America was [[Mirage 2000]]s for [[Peru]] in the late 1980s.

===Latin American support===
In spite of receiving the comprension and affection of all the [[Latin America]]n countries (with the exception of [[Chile]]), [[Peru]] (Peruvian president Belaunde announced that his country was &quot;ready to support Argentina with all the resources it needed.&quot;) and [[Venezuela]] were the only countries that provided military assistance in the form of critical aircraft supplies like long range air fuel tanks. Countries like [[Cuba]] and [[Bolivia]] also offered ground troops but their offers were seen as political [[propaganda]] and not accepted. When the war was over, Argentina received  [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage 5P]] fighter planes from the [[Peruvian Air Force]] and [[Aermacchi MB-326]] and [[Embraer Bandeirante]]s from the [[Brazilian Air Force]]. 

Neighboring [[Chile]], under [[Pinochet]]'s regime, became the only [[Latin America|Latin American]] country to aid Britain by providing important logistical support during the war.

==War==
By mid-April the [[Royal Air Force]] had set up an airbase at Wideawake on the mid-Atlantic island of Ascension, including a sizable force of [[Avro Vulcan|Vulcan]] bombers, [[Handley Page Victor|Victor]] refuelling aircraft, and [[F-4 Phantom]] fighters to protect them. Meanwhile the main British naval task force arrived at Ascension to prepare for war. However a small force had already been sent south to re-capture South Georgia.

===Recapture of South Georgia===
The South Georgia force, ''[[Operation Paraquet]]'', under the command of Major [[Guy Sheridan]] RM, consisted of marines from 42 Commando, a troop of [[Special Air Service]] (''SAS'') and [[Special Boat Service]] (''SBS'') troops who were intended to land [[reconnaissance]] forces for an invasion by the [[Royal Marines]] embarked on [[RFA Tidespring|RFA ''Tidespring'']]. First to arrive was the [[Churchill class submarine|''Churchill'' class submarine]] [[HMS Conqueror (S48)|HMS ''Conqueror'']] on the 19th, and the island was over-flown by a radar-mapping [[Handley Page Victor]] on the 20th. The first landings of SAS troops took place on the 21st, but the weather was so bad that their landings and others made the next day were all withdrawn after several helicopters crashed in fog on [[Fortuna Glacier]].

On the 23rd a submarine alert was sounded and operations were halted, with the ''Tidespring'' being withdrawn to deeper water to avoid interception. On the 24th the British forces regrouped and headed in to attack the submarine, the [[ARA Santa Fe|ARA ''Santa Fe'']], locating it on the 25th and damaging it enough that the crew decided to abandon it. With the ''Tidespring'' now far out to sea and an additional defending force of the submarine's crew now landed, Major Sheridan decided to gather the 75 men he had and make a direct assault that day. After a short forced march the Argentine forces surrendered, making it official the next day. The British Prime Minister, [[Margaret Thatcher]], broke the news to the media telling them to &quot;Just rejoice at that news!&quot;{{fn|1}}.

===The Black Buck Raids===
[[Image:Vulcan.planview.640pix.jpg|thumb|250px|An Avro Vulcan, as used for the Black Buck raids]]
On [[May 1]], operations against the Falklands opened with the ''[[Operation Black Buck|Black Buck 1]]'' attack by RAF [[Avro Vulcan]] [[V bomber]]s on the [[airfield]] at Stanley. The Vulcan had originally been designed for medium-range stand-off nuclear missions in Europe and did not have the range to fly to the Falklands, requiring several in-flight refuelling missions. The RAF's tanker planes were mostly converted Victors with similar range, so they too had to be refuelled in the air. Thus, a total force of 11 tankers were required for only two Vulcans, a massive [[logistics|logistical]] effort. In the end only a single bomb hit the runway at Stanley, but the [[Argentine Air Force]] ('''FAA''') realized that the British were likewise capable of hitting targets on the mainland, and immediately moved back all jet fighters in order to protect against this possibility. The attack was therefore a strategic success, hampering Argentine efforts at close air support, reducing the effective loiter time of incoming Argentine aircraft, and compelling them to overfly British forces in any attempt to attack the islands.

Nonetheless, whilst Argentine fighters were no longer stationed at the airfield, it was never down and remained strongly used by continuous [[Hercules C-130]] flights until the end of the conflict. The transports continued to fly into [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] by night, bringing supplies, weapons, vehicles, and fuel into the Falklands and airlifting out the wounded. Argentine air transports continued to slip past the British through the last night of the war.

Only minutes after Black Buck, nine [[BAE Sea Harrier|Sea Harriers]] from the ''Hermes'' followed up the raid by dropping [[cluster bomb]]s on Stanley and the smaller grass airstrip at Goose Green. Both missions scored aircraft kills on the ground, as well as causing some damage to the airfield infrastructure. The aircraft had taken off from the deck of HMS ''Invincible'', and although attached BBC reporter [[Brian Hanrahan]] was forbidden to divulge the number of planes involved, he came up with the memorable phrase &quot;I counted them all out and I counted them all back&quot;.

Meanwhile the FAA had already launched an attack of their own with Grupo 6 (flying [[IAI Dagger]] Aircraft), on information that landings had already taken place. Four of these planes were lost to Sea Harriers operating from ''Invincible'', while combat broke out between other Harriers and [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage]] fighters of Grupo 8. Both sides refused to fight at the other's best altitude, until the Mirages finally descended to engage. One was shot down, and another was damaged and made for Stanley, where it fell victim to friendly fire from the Argentine defenders.

===Sinking of the Belgrano===
[[Image:The Sun Gotcha.jpg|left|thumb|'''Gotcha''' headline]]
[[Image:ARA Belgrano sinking.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The ARA ''General Belgrano'' sinks]]
On [[May 2]] the [[World War II]]-vintage Argentine light cruiser [[ARA General Belgrano|ARA ''General Belgrano'']] &amp;mdash; formerly the [[USS Phoenix (CL-46)]], a survivor of the 1941 [[Pearl Harbor]] attacks &amp;mdash; was sunk by [[HMS Conqueror (S48)|HMS ''Conqueror'']], using WWII vintage design [[List of torpedoes|Mk 8 mod 4]] [[torpedo]]es. 321 lives were lost, although initial casualty reports were confused. The British newspaper ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' famously greeted the initial reports of the attack (and the sinking of a small torpedo boat) with the headline '''GOTCHA'''. The edition was first published before news that the ship has actually sunk was known and carried no reports of actual Argentine deaths, it was followed by the more temperate &quot;Did 1,200 Argies drown?&quot;. The nuclear-powered ''Conqueror'' was captained by Commander Christopher Wreford-Brown. The loss of ''General Belgrano'' hardened the stance of the Argentine government and also became a [[cause celebre]] for anti-war campaigners (such as Labour MP [[Tam Dalyell]]), who declared that the ship had been sailing away from the Falklands at the time. The vessel was inarguably outside the exclusion zone, and sailing away from the area of conflict. However, during war, under international law, the heading of a [[belligerent]] naval vessel has no bearing on its status. In later years it has been revealed that the information on the position of the ''ARA General Belgrano'' came from a Soviet spy satellite which was tapped by the Norwegian intelligence service station at Fauske in Norway, and then handed over to the British.  

The sinking occurred 14 hours after [[List of Presidents of Peru|Constitutional President of the Republic of Peru]] [[Fernando Belaúnde Terry]], had proposed a comprehensive peace plan. At the time, and in response to [[Chile]]'s support of Britain, Belaúnde called for regional unity.

Regardless of controversies over the sinking, it had an important strategic effect. After the loss of ''General Belgrano'', the entire Argentine fleet returned to port and did not leave again for the duration of hostilities. The two destroyers supporting ''General Belgrano'' and the task force built around the aircraft carrier ARA ''Veinticinco de Mayo'' both withdrew from the area, ending the direct threat to the British fleet that their pincer movement had represented. The attack on ''General Belgrano'' was the second time since the end of [[World War II]] that a submarine had fired [[torpedo]]es in wartime and the only time that a nuclear powered submarine has done so.

In [[2005]], [[the Times]] newspaper reported that the British [[historian]] [[Sir Lawrence Freedman]] stated in the second volume of his ''Official History of the Falklands'', his latest work on the Falklands, that intelligence about the Belgrano did not reach senior British commanders and politicians until it was too late. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,170-1670775,00.html] Commander Christopher Wreford-Brown, commanding officer of HMS Conqueror, informed the [[Admiralty]] that the Argentine cruiser had changed course four hours before he attacked the cruiser, but this information was not passed to the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MoD]] or [[Sandy Woodward|Rear-Admiral John &quot;Sandy&quot; Woodward]] (commander of the RN task force). Thus it appears that neither Margaret Thatcher nor the Cabinet were aware of the Belgrano's change of course before the cruiser was sunk.

===Sinking of HMS ''Sheffield''===
[[Image:Super-Etendard 1.jpg|200px|thumb|right|An Argentine [[Dassault Super Étendard]] that attacked the ''Sheffield'']]&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:sheffield_onfire.jpg|right|framed|HMS Sheffield on fire]]  --&gt;
Two days after the ''General Belgrano'' sinking, on [[May 4]], the British lost the [[Type 42]] destroyer [[HMS Sheffield (D80)|HMS ''Sheffield'']] to fire following an [[Exocet missile]] strike. ''Sheffield'' had been ordered forward with two other Type 42s in order to provide a radar and missile &quot;picket&quot; far from the British carriers.  After the ships were detected by an Argentine Navy ('''ARA''') [[P-2 Neptune]] patrol aircraft, two ARA [[Dassault Super Étendard]]s were launched, each armed with a single Exocet. Refuelled by a [[C-130 Hercules]] shortly after launch, they went in at low altitude, popped up for a radar check and released the missiles from 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 km) away. One missed [[HMS Yarmouth (F101)|HMS ''Yarmouth'']], due to her deployment of [[chaff]], but the other hit the ''Sheffield''. The weapon struck with devastating effect, hitting the centre of the ship and starting raging fires which quickly spread, killing 22 sailors and severely injuring 24 others. While fighting the fire, ''Yarmouth'' fired anti-submarine weaponry in response to a possible Argentine submarine attack.

''Sheffield'' was abandoned several hours later, gutted and deformed by her still-burning fires which lingered on for six more days. She finally sank outside the Exclusion Zone on [[May 10]], whilst under tow from the ''Yarmouth'', becoming an official [[war grave]]. Meanwhile the other Type 42s were withdrawn from their precarious position, leaving the British task force open to attack.

The tempo of operations increased throughout the second half of May. UN attempts to mediate a peace were rejected by the British, who felt that any delay would make a campaign impractical in the South Atlantic storms. The destruction of ''Sheffield'' had a profound impact on the British public, bringing home the fact that the &quot;Falklands Crisis&quot;, as the BBC News put it, was now an actual shooting war.

===Landing at Port San Carlos===
[[Image:Falkland island san carlos landing.png|thumb|right|250px|San Carlos landing sites]]
[[Image:Falklandsmap san carlos landings.png|thumb|left|150px|Context of landings in the Falklands]]

During the night of [[May 21]] the British made an amphibious landing on beaches near San Carlos Water, on the northern coast of East Falkland, putting the 4000 men of 3 Commando Brigade, including 2nd and 3rd battalions of the Parachute Regiment (2 and 3 Para), ashore from the amphibious ships and the liner Canberra: 2 Para and 40 Commando landing at San Carlos beach; 45 Commando at Ajax bay; 3 Para at [[Port San Carlos]]. By dawn the next day they had established a secure bridgehead from which to conduct offensive operations. From there Brigadier Thompson's plan was to capture Darwin and [[Goose Green]] before turning towards Stanley.

At sea the paucity of British ships' anti-aircraft defences was demonstrated in the sinking of [[HMS Ardent (F184)|HMS ''Ardent'']] on the 21st, [[HMS Antelope (F170)|HMS ''Antelope'']] on the 23rd, and [[MV Atlantic Conveyor|MV ''Atlantic Conveyor'']], with a vital cargo of [[helicopter]]s, runway building equipment and tents on the 25th. The loss of all but one of the Chinook Helicopters being carried by the Atlantic Conveyor was a severe blow from a logistics perspective; the sole surviving [[Chinook]] was called Bravo November. Also lost on this day was [[HMS Coventry (D118)|HMS ''Coventry'']], a sister to [[HMS Sheffield (D80)|HMS ''Sheffield'']], whilst in company with [[HMS Broadsword (F88)|HMS ''Broadsword'']]. [[HMS Argonaut (F56)|HMS ''Argonaut'']] and [[HMS Brilliant (F90)|HMS ''Brilliant'']] were badly damaged. However many British ships escaped terminal damage due to the Argentine pilots' bombing tactics. The topography of San Carlos Water dictated that the pilots were forced to swoop in and launch their bombs from a low altitude at the very last moment. While undoubtedly brave, the late releasing of bombs meant that many never exploded, as there was insufficient time in the air for them to arm themselves. The Argentines lost near twenty aircraft in these attacks, including several [[FMA IA 58 Pucará|Pucarás]]. 

===Goose Green===
{{main|Battle of Goose Green}}
Starting early on [[May 27]] and through [[May 28]], 2 Para approached and attacked Darwin and Goose Green, which was held by the Argentine 12th Inf Regt. After a tough struggle, which lasted all night and into the next day, seventeen British and 55 Argentine soldiers had been killed, and 1,050 Argentine troops taken prisoner. Due to a gaffe by the [[BBC]], the taking of Goose Green was announced on the [[BBC World Service]] before it had actually happened. It was during this attack that Lt Col [[H. Jones]], the commanding officer of 2 Para was killed. He was posthumously awarded the [[Victoria Cross]].

[[Image:Falkland island after goose green.png|thumb|250px|right|East Falkland showing San Carlos bridgehead, Teal Inlet, Mt. Kent and Mt Challenger]]

With the sizeable Argentine force at Goose Green out of the way, British forces were now able to break out of the San Carlos bridgehead. From [[27 May]] men of 45 Cdo and 3 Para started walking across East Falkland towards the coastal settlement of Teal Inlet.  Meanwhile 42 Cdo prepared to move by helicopter to Mount Kent.  For the next week the SAS and Mountain &amp; Arctic Warfare Cadre (the Special Forces unit of 3 Commando Brigade) waged intense patrol battles with reconnaissance patrols of the 602nd Commando Company.  An example was a patrol battle of nineteen men of the Cadre, commanded by Captain Rod Boswell, on the lower slopes of Mount Simon.  Late in the afternoon of [[30 May]] a four-man patrol spotted thirteen Commandos approach a remote farm building, Top Malo House.  The Cadre's commander, Captain Boswell, was ordered to muster his patrols and mount an assault on the farmhouse.  He initially intended to fly in at night and then strike at dawn.  Luck was not with the Cadre and its Sea King helicopter failed to arrive on time.  An hour late, the nineteen Marines began their 45 kilometere low level flight to the drop off point in a gully, only some 1,000 metres from the farmhouse.  At 9:00 AM the assault team comprising 12 Marines approached the house and were engaged with a Magnum sniper rifle from the top floor.  A firefight which lasted for 45 minutes ensued between the Cadre and the Commandos.  With ammunitions running low and two-thirds of the patrol killed or wounded the Argentines elected to surrender. It is estimated that 40 Argentine Commandos were involved in the battle with the SAS and the Cadre.  A body count revealed five Argentine dead.  Seven members of the British Special Forces were wounded during the actions.  One SBS sergeant was killed as the Mount Kent ranges were secured for the arrival of the British battalions.

By [[June 1]], with the arrival of a further 5,000 British troops of 5 Inf Brigade landed at [[San Carlos]] from [[RMS Canberra|''Canberra'']], ''[[Norland]]'' and ''Stromness'' having transferred from the liner [[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|''QE2'']] at [[South Georgia]], new British divisional commander, Major General [[JJ Moore]] RM, had sufficient force to start planning an offensive against [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]].

During this build-up the Argentine air assaults on the British naval forces continued, killing 48, including 32 [[Welsh Guards]]men on the [[RFA Sir Galahad (1966)|RFA ''Sir Galahad'']] and the [[RFA Sir Tristram|RFA ''Sir Tristram'']] on [[June 8]]. Many others suffered serious burns (including, famously, [[Simon Weston]]). These troops were still on the ships because of the loss of the helicopters on the ''Atlantic Conveyor''. This meant that they had had to be transferred around the islands by ship. Unfortunately, the commanders of the [[landing force]] ignored the advice of naval commanders to disembark at the earliest opportunity.

===Battle for Stanley===
On the night of [[11 June]], after several days of painstaking reconnaissance and logistic build-up, British forces launched a brigade-sized night attack against the heavily defended ring of high ground surrounding Stanley. Units of 3 Commando Brigade, supported by naval gunfire from several Royal Navy ships, simultaneously assaulted [[Battle of Mount Harriet|Mount Harriet]], [[Battle of Two Sisters|Two Sisters]], and [[Battle of Mount Longdon|Mount Longdon]]. During this battle thirteen were killed when [[HMS Glamorgan|HMS ''Glamorgan'']], which was providing naval gunfire support, was struck by an Exocet fired from the back of a truck, further displaying the vulnerability of ships to anti-ship missiles. On this day Sgt [[Ian McKay]] of 4 Platoon, B Company, 3 Para died in a grenade attack on an Argentine bunker which was to earn him a posthumous [[Victoria Cross]]. After a night of fierce fighting all objectives were secured.

The night of [[June 13]], saw the start of the second phase of attacks, in which the momentum of the initial assault was maintained. 2 Para captured [[Battle of Wireless Ridge|Wireless Ridge]], and the 2nd battalion, [[Scots Guards (1946)|Scots Guards]] captured [[Battle of Mount Tumbledown|Mount Tumbledown]]. As the fighting was coming to a close the Falklands Islanders on the eastern edge of Stanley were in imminent danger of being shot at by a platoon of a 3rd Infantry Regiment company as the conscripts and regulars steeled themselves for the final house-to-house battle near Government House. This is revealed in the book ''The Battle For The Falklands'' by [[Max Hastings]] and [[Simon Jenkins]]. Brigadier-General Oscar Jofre, Commander of the elite 10th Argentine Mechanized Infantry Brigade, has admitted that the abrupt end of the ground fighting was hastened by fear of war crimes against the civilians.

On [[June 14]] the commander of the Argentine garrison in Stanley, Mario Menendez, surrendered to Major General [[JJ Moore]] [[Royal Marines]]. 9800 Argentine troops were made [[POW]]s and were repatriated to Argentina on the liner Canberra. On [[June 20]] the British retook the [[Southern Thule|South Sandwich Islands]], (which involved accepting the surrender of the [[Southern Thule]] Garrison at the ''[[Corbeta Uruguay]]'' base) and declared the hostilities were at an end.

The war lasted 74 days, with 255 British and 655 Argentine soldiers, sailors, and airmen, killed.

==Analysis==
===Military===
Militarily, the Falklands War was important for a number of reasons.
[[Image:1982FI00201.jpg|right|thumb|200px|British propaganda leaflet intended for Argentine soldiers dropped during the Falkland Islands War. Titled &quot;Islands of the Condemned&quot;, it warns Argentine naval ships and aircraft not to enter the [[Falkland Islands]] exclusion zone.]]

It was one of the few major naval battles so far to have occurred after the end of [[World War II]]. As such this conflict illustrated the vulnerability of surface ships to anti-ship missiles and reaffirmed the effectiveness of aircraft in naval warfare. The viability of stealth (in the form of submarines) again proved its usefulness, much as it did during World War II and the Cold War.

Neither side achieved total air supremacy, but the power of air forces during a conflict like this proved invaluable, due to the isolated, rough landscape of the Falklands. Air strikes were staged against ground, sea and air targets on both sides and often with clear results. All of the UK losses at sea were achieved by aircraft or missile strikes (by both the [[Argentine Air Force]] and [[Argentine Navy|Naval Aviation]]). The French [[Exocet missile]] proved its lethality in [[air-to-surface missile|air-to-surface]] operations.

''See also main article [[Air forces in the Falklands War]]''.

It vindicated the UK decision to develop the [[VTOL]] Harrier aircraft, that showed its capability of operating from forward bases with no runways. At sea it demonstrated the domination of airpower in major engagements and the usefulness of carriers.

The logistic capability of the UK armed forces was stretched to the absolute limit in order to mount an amphibious operation so far from a home-base, onto mountainous islands which have few roads. After the war much work was done to improve both the logistic and amphibious capability of the Royal Navy.

The role of special forces units, which destroyed many Argentine aircraft, and carried out intelligence gathering operations, was reaffirmed.

The usefulness of helicopters in combat, logistic, and [[casevac]] operations was reaffirmed.

At sea, some shortcomings of warship design were made apparent, particularly the danger of using [[aluminium]] in ships (although it did not catch fire, it melted in the heat). [[Nylon]] was shown to be a poor choice of fabric in uniforms, as it is more flammable than cotton and also melts with heat, sticking the incendiary fabric to the skin and causing avoidable casualties.

===Political===
The Falklands War illustrates the role of political miscalculation and miscommunication in creating war. Both sides seriously underestimated the importance of the Falklands to the other. The Falklands War illustrates the role of chance in determining what happens in a war. Some commentators believe that the war could have ended in an Argentine victory if one of the Exocets had hit an aircraft carrier, or if the frequent unexploded bombs had detonated on striking some of the ships (75% of the British task force was damaged or sunk), or if Argentina had attacked the British artillery, using the three paratroop regiments already deployed at [[Comodoro Rivadavia]]. Equally, if the Argentines had made better preparations to hold theto chaperone an archaeological expedition into hostile Arab territory. The film also stars [[Max Von Sydow]], [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[Terence Hill]] and [[Ian Holm]].

In science fiction writer ''[[Jerry Pournelle]]'''s &quot;Future History&quot;, http://www.chronology.org/pournelle/, whose main character is a future soldier of fortune named John Christian Falkenberg, there is a central role to the [[CoDominium Navy]], which fights on all kinds of planets far away in space, and which had been created out of the French Foreign Legion and still keeps many of its traditions such as the aforementioned &quot;Camerone Day&quot;.

The movie, [[Savior (film)|Savior]], with [[Dennis Quaid]], is about an American who joins the legion after he shoots a group of Muslims (following a Muslim bombing of the restaurant where his wife and son were--both die). In the legion, Quaid is a sniper and is involved in the Bosnia/Serb/Croatian ethnic wars.

[[Snoopy]], from the [[Peanuts]] comic strip, often imagines himself as a member of the Foreign Legion, usually defending or reclaiming Fort Zinderneuf.

In a French sci-fi comic [[Aquablue]], the hero, Neo, must defend himself and his people against the Légion, an [[Earth Special Force]] which has exactly the same uniform as the Légion Étrangère.

The indie-rock band [[The Decemberists]] wrote a song called The Legionnaire's Lament about a homesick legionnaire during the first world war.

[[Frank Sinatra]] performed a song called &quot;[[French Foreign Legion (song)|French Foreign Legion]]&quot; about joining up if a girl doesn't marry him.

In the [[manga]] and [[anime]], [[Area 88]] the protagonist, Shin Kazama, was tricked while intoxicated into joining the French Foreign Legion to serve in a mercenary airforce in the fictional Asran Kingdom of North Africa. The office that handled his contracts was located in Paris, France.

David Drake, the author of the Hammer's Slammers series, bases his mercenary unit off of the French Foreign Legion. More specifically, the Legion after the Second World War, when most of its members had fled from persecution from the Allied War Crimes Commission.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For other uses, including [[audio feedback]], see [[Feedback (disambiguation)]]''

Feedback is (generally) information about actions.

In [[cybernetics]] and [[control theory]], '''feedback''' is a process whereby some proportion or in general, function, of the output signal of a system is passed (fed back) to the input. Often this is done intentionally, in order to control the dynamic behaviour of the system. Feedback is observed or used in various areas dealing with complex systems, such as [[engineering]], [[architecture]], [[economics]], and [[biology]].

Lines are usually drawn, directed from input through the system and to output. The feedback is shown by another arrowed line, directed from output outside the system to an input, resulting in a loop on the diagram, called '''feedback loop'''. This notion is important; for example, the feedback loop is a convenient place for a control device.

The following is an example of a feedback loop used in web-based workflows.  Feedback Loops are established by ISPs for permission e-mail marketers to manage subscribers who click the &quot;This is Spam&quot; button in their web mail clients. The Feedback Loop sends a message back to the marketer letting them know to unsubscribe the subscriber.

==Types of feedback==

''Main articles:'' [[Negative feedback]], [[Positive feedback]]

Feedback may be [[negative feedback|negative]], which tends to reduce output (but in amplifiers, stabilises and linearises operation), or [[positive feedback|positive]], which tends to increase output. 
Systems which include feedback are prone to ''hunting'', which is [[oscillation]] of output resulting from improperly tuned inputs of first positive then negative feedback. Audio feedback typifies this form of oscillation.

===In electronic engineering===

The processing and control of feedback is engineered into many [[electronics|electronic]] devices and may also be embedded in other [[technology|technologies]].

The most common general-purpose controller is a [[PID controller|proportional-integral-derivative]] (PID) controller.  Each term of the PID controller copes with time.  The proportional term handles the present state of the system, the integral term handles its past, and the derivative or slope term tries to predict and handle the future.

If the signal is inverted on its way round the control loop, the system is said to have ''negative feedback''; otherwise, the feedback is said to be ''positive''.   Negative feedback is often deliberately introduced to increase the [[stability]] and accuracy of a system, as in the [[feedback amplifier]] invented by [[Harold Stephen Black]].  This scheme can fail if the input changes faster than the system can respond to it.  When this happens, the negative feedback signal begins to act as positive feedback, causing the output to [[oscillation|oscillate]] or ''hunt''.   Positive feedback is usually an unwanted consequence of system behaviour.

With mechanical devices, hunting can be severe enough to destroy the device.

[[Harry Nyquist]] was an electrical engineer who contributed the [[Nyquist plot]] for determining the stability of feedback systems.

===In mechanical engineering===

In ancient times, the [[float valve]] was used to regulate the flow of water in Greek and Roman [[water clock]]s; similar float valves are used to regulate fuel in a [[carburettor]] and also used to regulate tank water level in the [[flush toilet]].

The [[windmill]] was enhanced in [[1745]] by blacksmith [[Edmund Lee]] who added a fantail to keep the face of the windmill pointing into the wind. In [[1787]] [[Thomas Mead]] regulated the speed of rotation of a windmill by using a centrifugal pendulum to adjust the distance between the bedstone and the runner stone (i.e. to adjust the load).

The use of the [[centrifugal governor]] by [[James Watt]] in [[1788]] to regulate the speed of his [[steam engine]] was one factor leading to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Steam engines also use float valves and pressure release valves as mechanical regulation devices. A [[mathematical analysis]] of Watt's governor was done by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in [[1868]].

The [[SS Great Eastern|Great Eastern]] was one of the largest steamships of its time and employed a steam powered rudder with feedback mechanism designed in [[1866]] by [[J.McFarlane Gray]]. [[Joseph Farcot]] coined the word [[servo]] in [[1873]] to describe steam powered steering systems. Hydraulic servos were later used to position guns. [[Elmer Ambrose Sperry]] of the [[Sperry Corporation]] designed the first [[autopilot]] in [[1912]]. [[Nicolas Minorsky]] published a theoretical analysis of automatic ship steering in [[1922]] and described the [[PID controller]].

Internal combustion engines of the late [[20th century]] employed mechanical feedback mechanisms such as [[vacuum advance]] but mechanical feedback was replaced by electronic [[engine management systems]] once small, robust and powerful single-chip microcontrollers became affordable.

===In economics and finance===

A system prone to hunting (oscillating) is the [[stock market]], which has both positive and negative feedback mechanisms. This is due to cognitive and emotional factors belonging to the field of [[behavioral finance]]. For example, 
* When stocks are rising (a [[bull market]]), the belief that further rises are probable gives investors an incentive to buy (positive feedback); but the increased price of the [[stock|shares]], and the [[knowledge]] that there must be a peak after which the market will fall, ends up deterring buyers (negative feedback).  
* Once the market begins to fall regularly (a [[bear market]]), some investors may expect further losing days and refrain from buying (positive feedback), but others may buy because stocks become more and more of a bargain (negative feedback).

[[George Soros]] used the word reflexism to describe feedback in the financial markets and developed an investment theory based on this principle.

The conventional [[economic equilibrium]] model of supply and demand supports only ideal linear negative feedback and was heavily criticized by [[Paul Ormerod]] in his book &quot;The Death of Economics&quot; which in turn was criticized by traditional economists. This book was part of a change of perspective as economists started to recognise that [[Chaos Theory]] applied to nonlinear feedback systems including financial markets.

===In nature===

In [[biology|biological]] systems such as [[organism]]s, [[ecosystem]]s, or the [[biosphere]], most parameters must stay under control within a narrow range around a certain optimal level under certain environmental conditions. The deviation of the optimal value of the controlled parameter can result from the changes in internal and external environments. A change of some of the environmental conditions may also require change of that range to change for the system to function. The value of the parameter to maintain is recorded by a reception system and conveyed to a regulation module via an information channel. 

Biological systems contain many types of regulatory circuits, among which positive and negative feedbacks. ''Positive'' and ''negative'' don't imply consequences of the feedback have positive or negative final effect. The negative feedback loop tends to slow down a process, while the positive feedback loop tends to accelerate it.

Feedback and regulation are self related. The negative feedback helps to maintain stability in a system in spite of external changes. It is related to [[homeostasis]]. Positive feedback amplifies possibilities of divergences (evolution, change of goals); it is the condition to change, evolution, growth; it gives the system the ability to access new points of [[equilibrium]].

For example, in an organism, most positive feedbacks provide for fast autoexcitation of elements of endocrine and nervous systems (in particular, in stress responses conditions) and play a key role in regulation of morphogenesis, growth, and development of organs, all processes which are in essence a rapid escape from the initial state.
Homeostasis is especially visible in the [[nervous system|nervous]] and [[endocrine system|endocrine systems]] when considered at organism level.

Feedback is also central to the operations of [[gene]]s and [[gene regulatory network]]s.  [[Repressor protein|repressor]] (see [[Lac repressor]]) and [[activator protein|activator]] [[protein]]s are used to create genetic [[operon|operons]], which were identified by [[Francois Jacob]] and [[Jacques Monod]] in [[1961]] as ''feedback loops''.

Any self-regulating natural process involves feedback and is prone to hunting. A well known example in [[ecology]] is the oscillation of the population of [[snowshoe hare]]s due to predation from [[lynx]]es.

In [[zymology]], feedback serves as regulation of activity of an enzyme by its direct product(s) or downstream metabolite(s) in the metabolic pathway.

There is an ice-albedo positive feedback loop whereby melting snow exposes more dark ground (of lower [[albedo]]), which in turn absorbs heat and causes more snow to melt. This is part of the evidence of the danger of [[global warming]].

Compare with: [[feed-forward]]

===In organizations===

As an [[organization]] seeks to improve its performance, feedback helps it to make required adjustments.

Examples of feedback in organizations:
* [[Financial audit]]
* [[performance appraisal]]
* [[shareholder]] meetings
* customer surveys
* [[360-degree feedback]]

===In gaming===

In [[computer game]]s, feedback is an important and heavily exploited mechanism for controlling resources. Both positive and negative feedback loops can be used to alter the pacing, challenge, and sense of accomplishment in a game. For example, ''[[Unreal Tournament]]'''s practice mode offers an ''auto-adjust'' setting that causes the bots to attempt to match the player's skill level, keeping a more consistent level of challenge for different players; this is [[negative feedback]]. On the other hand, in ''[[Starcraft]]'', a player who has a small advantage in resources will be able to build more units, enabling them to seize more resource-rich territory and so gain a much larger advantage in resources; this is [[positive feedback]].

'''Furigana''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: ふりがな), are a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] reading aid. They consist of smaller [[kana]] printed next to a [[kanji]] or other character to indicate its [[pronunciation]]. In horizontal text, ''[[Yokogaki and tategaki|yokogaki]]'', they are placed above the line of text, while in vertical text, ''[[Yokogaki and tategaki|tategaki]]'', they are placed to the right of the line of text, as illustrated below. They are one type of [[ruby character|ruby]] text. ''Furigana'' are also known as '''yomigana''' or '''rubi''' in Japanese.

&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=+2&gt;字&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==Appearance==

Furigana may be added by character, in which case the part of a word which corresponds to a kanji is centered over that kanji; or by word or phrase, in which case the entire ''furigana'' word is centered over several characters, even if the kanji do not represent equal shares of the kana needed to write them. The latter method is more common, especially since some words in Japanese have [[ateji|unique pronunciations]] that are not related to any of the characters the word is written with.

When it is necessary to distinguish between native Japanese ''[[kanji|kun'yomi]]'' and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]-derived ''[[Kanji|on'yomi]]'' pronunciations, for example in [[Kanji dictionary|kanji dictionaries]], the Japanese pronunciations are written in [[hiragana]], and the Chinese ones are written in [[katakana]]. However, this distinction is really only important in dictionaries and other reference works. In ordinary prose, the script chosen will usually be [[hiragana]].  (The one general exception to this is Chinese place names, personal names, and (occasionally) food names -- these will often be written with kanji, and katakana used for the furigana.)

The distinction between regular kana and the smaller character forms, which are used in regular orthography to mark such things as [[gemination]] and [[palatalization]], is often not made in ''furigana'': for example, the usual [[hiragana]] spelling of the word 却下 (''kyakka'') is きゃっか, but in ''furigana'' it might be written きやつか. This was especially common in old-fashioned [[printing press|movable type]] printing when smaller fonts were not available. Nowadays, with computer-based printing systems, this occurs less frequently.

==Usage==
[[Image:JR_Namba_entrance.jpg|thumb|300px|On this sign, furigana indicate the pronunciation of the Latin letters &quot;JR&quot; and the [[kanji]] for &quot;Namba Station.&quot;]]
''Furigana'' are most commonly used in works for children, who may not have sufficiently advanced reading skills to recognise the kanji, but can understand the word when written phonetically in ''[[hiragana]]''. Because children learn ''hiragana'' before ''[[katakana]]'', in books for very young children, there are ''hiragana'' ''furigana'' next to the ''katakana'' characters.     It is common to use ''furigana'' on all kanji characters in works for young children. This is called ''sōrubi'' (総ルビ) in Japanese.

In works aimed at adult Japanese speakers, furigana may be used on a word written in uncommon kanji; in the mass media, they are generally used on words containing non-[[Jōyō kanji|Jōyō]] kanji.

Furigana commonly appear alongside kanji names and their romanizations on signs for railway stations, even if the pronunciation of the kanji is commonly known. Furigana also appear often on maps to show the pronunciation of unusual place names.

===For names===

Japanese names are usually written in [[kanji]]. Because there are many possible readings for kanji names, including special name-only readings called [[nanori]], furigana are often used to give the readings of names. On Japanese official forms, where the name is to be written, there is  always an adjacent column for the name to be written in ''furigana''. Usually ''katakana'' is preferred.

Furigana may also be used for foreign names written in kanji. Chinese and Korean names are the most common examples: Chinese names are usually pronounced with Japanese readings and the pronunciation written in hiragana, while Korean names are usually pronounced with Korean readings and the pronunciation written in katakana. Furigana may also be necessary in the rare case where names are transliterated into kanji from other languages (e.g., soccer star [[Ruy Ramos]] and activist [[Arudou Debito]]).

===In language learning===

Kanji and kanji compounds are often presented with ''furigana'' in Japanese language textbooks for non-native speakers.

''Furigana'' are also often used in foreign language textbooks for Japanese learners to indicate pronunciation. The words are written in the original foreign script, such as [[Hangul]] for [[Korean language|Korean]], and furigana is used to indicate the pronunciation. 



===Punning and double meaning===

Some writers use furigana to represent slang pronunciations, particularly those which would become hard to understand without the kanji to provide their meaning. 

Another use is to write the kanji for something which had been previously referenced, but write furigana for &quot;''sore''&quot; or &quot;''are''&quot;, meaning &quot;that&quot;, indicating that the characters simply refer to it with a pronoun, but clarifying for the reader what thing was meant.

In ''[[karaoke]]'' it is extremely common for ''furigana'' to be placed on the song lyrics. The song lyrics are often written in kanji pronounced quite differently from the ''furigana''. The ''furigana'' version is used for pronunciation.

Also, because the kanji represent meaning while the ''furigana'' represent sound, one can combine the two to create [[pun]]s or indicate meanings of foreign words. One might write the kanji for &quot;blue&quot;, but use katakana to write the pronunciation of the English word &quot;blue&quot;; this may be done, for example, in Japanese subtitles on foreign films, where it can help associate the written Japanese with the sounds actually being spoken by the actors, or it may be used in a translation of a work of fiction to enable the translator to preserve the original sound of a proper name (such as &quot;Firebolt&quot; in the Harry Potter series) in furigana, while simultaneously indicating its meaning with kanji. A similar practice is used in native fiction to produce double meanings: for example, the word &quot;Earth&quot; (chikyuu) might be written with &quot;homeland&quot; (furusato) as the reading in a work of science fiction.

==Other Japanese reading aids==

===Kunten===

In the written style known as ''[[kanbun]]'', which is the Japanese approximation of [[Classical Chinese]], small marks called ''[[kunten]]'' are sometimes added as reading aids. Unlike furigana, which indicate pronunciation, ''kunten'' indicate Japanese grammatical structures absent from the ''kanbun'', as well as showing how words should be reordered to fit Japanese sentence structure.

===Furikanji===

Furigana are sometimes also used to indicate meaning, rather than pronunciation. Over the foreign text smaller sized Japanese words, in kana or kanji, corresponding to the ''meaning'' of t]

'''Fred Reed''' is a columnist for ''[[The Washington Times]].''  A former [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]], Reed is a [[wiktionary:streetwise|streety]] [[police]] writer, an occasional [[war correspondent]], and an aficionado of [[wiktionary:raffish|raffish]] bars.  His often satirical and opinionated columns are released weekly.

Reed notes that his columns are often provocative, and calls himself &quot;an equal-opportunity irritant.&quot;

Fred's output defies characterization as his articles include those attacking [[feminism]] (generally the proviso of the [[Right-wing politics|right]]), [[George W. Bush]] (generally the proviso of the [[Left-wing politics|left]]) and [[evolution]] (generally the proviso of [[religious fundamentalist]]s).  Many of Reed's articles speak of a yearning for a simpler time, and urge the reader to forgo the pursuit of money and comforts in favor of a cultured life of the mind.  Reed is currently living in [[Mexico]] as an American [[expatriate]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Frederick Phillips Brooks, Jr.''' (born [[April 19]], [[1931]]) is a [[software engineer]] and [[computer scientist]], best-known for managing the development of [[OS/360]], then later writing candidly about the process in his seminal book ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]''. &quot;It is a very humbling experience to make a multi-million-dollar mistake, but it is also very memorable.&quot;  Brooks received a [[Turing Award]] in [[1999]].

Born in [[Durham, North Carolina]], he attended [[Duke University]], graduating in [[1953]], and he received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Applied Mathematics (Computer Science) from [[Harvard University]] in [[1956]].  [[Howard Aiken]] was his advisor.

Brooks joined [[International Business Machines|IBM]] in 1956, working in [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]] and [[Yorktown, New York]]. He worked on the architecture of the [[IBM 7030|Stretch]] (a $10m scientific supercomputer for the [[Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory]]) and [[Harvest (computer)|Harvest]] computers and then was manager for the development of the [[System/360]] family of computers and the [[OS/360]] software they ran. 

It was in ''The Mythical Man-Month'' that Brooks made the now-famous statement: &quot;Adding people to a late software project makes it later.&quot; This has since come to be known as &quot;[[Brooks' law]].&quot;
In addition to ''The Mythical Man-Month'', Brooks is known for ''[[No Silver Bullet]]'', an essay on software engineering.

In 1965, Brooks left IBM to found the Department of Computer Science at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and chaired it for 20 years. [[As of 2004]] he was still engaged in active research there, primarily in [[virtual reality|virtual world]]s and [[molecular graphics]].
In January 2005 he gave the [[IEE]]/[[British Computer Society|BCS]] annual [[Alan Turing|Turing]] Lecture in [[London]] on the subject of &quot;Collaboration and Telecollaboration in Design&quot;. 

He is also a confessional Christian who is active with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship and the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students  (source: [http://www.cs.unc.edu/People/Faculty/Bios/brooks.html])

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Factoid''''' can refer to a spurious (unverified, incorrect, or invented) &quot;fact&quot; intended to create or prolong public exposure or to manipulate public opinion.  The term was [[neologism|coined]] by [[Norman Mailer]] in his [[1973]] biography of [[Marilyn Monroe]].  Mailer himself described a factoid as &quot;facts which have no existence before appearing in a magazine or newspaper&quot;. Mailer created the word by combining the word &quot;[[fact]]&quot; and the ending &quot;[[-oid]]&quot; to mean &quot;like a fact&quot;. 

''Examples:'' 
*It is commonly believed in the Australian city of [[Mount Isa, Queensland|Mount Isa]] that their city, in terms of its area, is the world's largest or second largest city.  In reality [[Mount Isa, Queensland|Mount Isa]] isn't even the largest city in Australia and there are many larger cities around the world.  Their own Local council web site incorrectly suggests it is the second largest city on earth.
*The media in [[Canada]] have often reported that the city of [[Toronto]] was named by [[UNESCO]] as the most multicultural city in the world.  Although there have been some reports suggesting that Toronto may be ''one of'' the world's most diverse cities (see [[Demographics of Toronto]]), the United Nations agency has never designated any city as being ''the most'' multicultural or diverse.  Nonetheless, the belief in this status persisted for years, even finding its way onto UNESCO's own web site ([http://www.unesco.org/most/usa9.htm]) and into international media reports in respect of Toronto's two [[Olympics|Olympic]] bids.

'''''Factoid''''' is sometimes now also used to mean a small piece of true but often valueless or insignificant information. This definition was popularized by the [[CNN Headline News]] TV channel which during the [[1980s]] and [[1990s]] used to frequently include such a fact under the heading of the word &quot;factoid&quot; during newscasts.  This version of the definition can also be referred to as a '''''Factlet'''''. In the United Kingdon, [[BBC Radio 2]] presenter [[Steve Wright]] uses factoids extensively on his show.

''Example:'' 
*If the entire history of the earth lasted a period of only two days, human history would take up only the last two seconds.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Figured bass''', or '''thoroughbass''', is a kind of integer [[musical notation]] used to indicate intervals, [[chord (music)|chord]]s, and [[nonchord tone]]s, in relation to a bass note. Figured bass is closely associated with '''basso continuo''', an [[accompaniment]] used in almost all genres of music in the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]].

==Basso continuo==
Basso continuo parts, almost universal in the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] era (1600-1750), were, as the name implies, played continuously throughout a piece, providing the [[harmony (music)|harmonic]] structure of the music. The word is often shortened to ''continuo'', and the instrumentalists playing the continuo part, if more than one, are called the ''continuo group''.

The makeup of the continuo group is often left to the discretion of the performers, and practice varied enormously within the Baroque period. At least one instrument capable of playing chords must be included, such as a [[harpsichord]], [[organ (music)|organ]], [[lute]], [[theorbo]], [[guitar]], or [[harp]]. In addition, any number of instruments which play in the [[bass (music)|bass]] register may be included, such as [[cello]], [[double bass]], [[viol|bass viol]], [[viola da gamba]], or [[bassoon]]. The most common combination, at least in modern performances, is harpsichord and cello for instrumental works and secular vocal works, such as [[opera]]s, and organ for [[sacred music]].

The keyboard (or other chording instrument) player ''realizes'' a continuo part by playing, in addition to the indicated bass notes, upper notes to complete chords, either determined ahead of time or [[improvisation|improvised]] in performance. The figured bass notation, described below, is a guide, but performers are expected to use their musical judgment and the other instruments or voices as a guide. Modern editions of music usually supply a realized keyboard part, fully written out for the player, eliminating the need for improvisation. With the rise in [[authentic performance|historically informed performance]], however, the number of performers who improvise their parts, as Baroque players would have done, has increased.

Basso continuo, though an essential structural and identifying element of the Baroque period, continued to be used in many works, especially sacred choral works, of the [[Classical music era|classical]] period (up to around 1800). Examples of its use in the [[19th century]] are rarer, but they do exist: [[mass (music)|mass]]es by [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Franz Schubert]], for example, have a basso continuo part for an organist to play.

==Figured bass notation==

A part notated with figured bass consists of a bass-line notated with [[note]]s on a [[musical staff]] plus added numbers and [[Accidental (music)|accidental]]s beneath the staff to indicate at what [[interval (music)|interval]]s above the bass notes should be played, and therefore which inversions of which chords are to be played. The phrase ''tasto solo'' indicates that only the bass line (without any upper chords) is to be played for a short period, usually until the next figure is encountered.

Composers were inconsistent in the usages described below. Especially in the 17th century, the numbers were omitted whenever the composer thought the chord was obvious. Early composers such as [[Claudio Monteverdi]] often specified the octave by the use of [[interval (music)|compound intervals]] such as 10, 11, and 15.

===Numbers===
The numbers indicate the number of [[scale]] steps above the given bass-line that a note should be played. For example:

[[Image:C with 64 figured bass.png]]

Here, the bass note is a C, and the numbers 4 and 6 indicate that notes a fourth and a sixth above it should be played, that is an F and an A. In other words, the second inversion of an F major chord is to be played.

In cases where the numbers 3 or 5 would normally be indicated, these are usually (though not always) left out, owing to the frequency these intervals occur. For example:

[[Image:CBG with - 6 7 figured bass.png]]

In this sequence, the first note has no numbers accompanying it - both the 3 and the 5 have been omitted. This means that notes a third above and a fifth above should be played - in other words, a root position chord. The next note has a 6, indicating a note a sixth above it should be played; the 3 has been omitted - in other words, this chord is a first inversion. The note has only a 7 accompanying it; here, as in the first note, both the 3 and the 5 have been omitted - the seven indicates the chord is a seventh chord. The whole sequence is equivalent to:

[[Image:Chords C-B63-G7.png]]

although the performer may choose himself which octave to play the notes in and will often elaborate them in some way rather than play only chords, depending on the [[tempo]] and [[texture (music)|texture]] of the music.

Sometimes, other numbers are omitted:  a 2 on its own or 42 indicate 642, for example.

Sometimes the figured bass number changes but the bass note itself does not. In these cases the new figures are written wherever in the bar they are meant to occur. In the following example, the top line is supposed to be a melody instrument and is given merely to indicate the rhythm (it is not part of the figured bass itself):

[[Image:C with 6-5 in figured bass.png]]

When the bass note changes but the notes in the chord above it are to be held, a line is drawn next to the figure or figures to indicate this:

[[Image:C-B with 6-line in figured bas.png]]

The line extends for as long as the chord is to be held.

===Accidentals===

When an accidental is shown on its own without a number, it applies to the third of the chord; otherwise it applies to whichever note it is shown next to. For example, this:

[[Image:E with sharp and C with b6b figured bass.png]]

is equivalent to this:

[[Image:Emaj and Abmaj chords.png]]

Sometimes the accidental is placed after the number rather than before it.

Alternatively, a cross placed next to a number indicates that the pitch of that note should be raised by a [[semitone]] (so that if it is normally a flat it becomes a natural, and if it is normally a natural it becomes a sharp). A different way to indicate this is to draw a bar though the number itself. The following three notations, therefore, all indicate the same thing:

[[Image:Cs with natural6, 6 and barred6.png]]

When sharps or flats are used with [[key signature]]s they may have a slightly different meaning, especially in 17th-century music. A sharp might be used to cancel a flat in the key signature, or vice versa, instead of a natural sign.

==History==
The origins of basso continuo practice are somewhat murky.  Improvised organ accompaniments for choral works were common by the late 16th century, and separate organ parts, showing only a bass line, date back to at least 1587.  In the mid-16th century, some Italian church composers began to write [[polychoral]] works.  These pieces, for two or more choirs, were created in recognition of particularly festal occasions, or else to take advantage of certain architectural properties of the buildings in which they were performed.  With eight or more parts to keep track of in performance, works in polychoral style (also known as &lt;em&gt;cori spezzati&lt;/em&gt;, since the choirs were structured in sometimes musically independent, sometimes musically interlocking parts, and may sometimes also have been placed in physically different locations) required some sort of instrumental accompaniment.  It is important to note that the concept of allowing two or more concurrently performing choirs to be independent structurally would or could almost certainly not have arisen had there not been an already-existing practice of choral accompaniment in church.  Financial and administrative records indicate the presence of organs in churches dating back to the 15th century, and though their precise use is not known, it stands to reason that it was to some degree in conjunction with singers.  Indeed, there exist many first-person accounts of church services from the 15th and 16th centuries that imply organ accompaniment in some portions of the liturgy, as well as indicating that the &lt;em&gt;a cappella&lt;/em&gt;-only practice of the [[Vatican City|Vatican's]] &lt;em&gt;Capella Sistina&lt;/em&gt; was somewhat unusual.  By early in the 16th century, it seems that accompaniment by organ at least in smaller churches was commonplace, and commentators of the time lamented on occasion the declining quality of church choirs.  Even more tellingly, many manuscripts, especially from the middle of the century and later, feature written-out organ accompaniments.  It is this last observation which leads directly into the foundations of continuo practice, in a somewhat similar one called &lt;em&gt;basso seguente&lt;/em&gt;, &quot;following bass.&quot;   Written-out accompaniments are found most often in early polychoral works (those composed, obviously, before the onset of [[concertato|concerted]] style and its explicit instrumental lines), and generally consist of a complete reduction (to what would later be called the &quot;grand staff&quot;) of one choir’s parts.  In addition to this, however, for those parts of the music during which that choir rested was presented a single line consisting of the lowest note being sung at any given time, which could be in any vocal part.  Even in early concerted works by the [[Gabrieli]]s, [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]], and others, the lowest part, that which modern performers colloquially call &quot;continuo,&quot; is actually a basso seguente, though slightly different, since with separate instrumental parts the lowest note of the moment is often lower than any being sung.  

The first known instance of a basso seguente in publication was a book of [[Introit]]s and [[Alleluia]]s by the Venetian [[Placido Falconio]] dating from [[1575]].  What is known as the &quot;figured&quot; continuo, which also features a bass line that because of its structural nature may differ from the lowest note in the upper parts, developed over the next quarter-century.  The composer [[Lodovico Grossi da Viadana|Lodovico Viadana]] is often credited with the first publication of such a continuo, in a [[1602]] collection of motets that according to his own account had been originally written in [[1594]].  Viadana’s continuo, though, did not actually include figures. The earliest extant part with sharp and flat signs above the staff is a [[motet]] by [[Giovanni Croce]], also from 1594. Following and figured basses developed concurrently in secular music; such madrigal composers as [[Emilio de' Cavalieri|Emilio de'Cavalieri]] and [[Luzzasco Luzzaschi]] began in the late 16th century to write works explicitly for a soloist with accompaniment, following an already standing practice of performing multi-voice madrigals this way, and also responding to the rising influence at certain courts of particularly popular individual singers.  This tendency toward solo-with-accompaniment texture in secular vocal music culminated in the genre of [[monody]], just as in sacred vocal music it resulted in the [[sacred concerto]] for various forces including few voices and even solo voices. The use of numerals to indicate accompanying sonorities began with the earliest [[opera]]s, composed by Cavalieri and [[Giulio Caccini|Giulio Caccini]].  These new genres, just as the polychoral one probably was, were indeed made possible by the existence of a semi- or fully independent bass line.  In turn, the separate bass line, with figures added above to indicate other chordal notes, shortly became &quot;functional,&quot; as the sonorites became &quot;harmonies,&quot; (see [[harmony]] and [[tonality]]), and music came to be seen in terms of a melody supported by chord progressions, rather than interlocking, equally important lines as in [[polyphony]].  The figured bass, therefore, was integral to the development of the [[Baroque]], by extension the [[Classical music era|”classical”]], and by further extension most subsequent musical styles. 

Many composers and theorists of the 16th and 17th century wrote how-to guides to realizing figured bass, including [[Gregor Aichinger]], [[Telemann|Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[C.P.E. Bach]], and [[Michael Praetorius]].

==Contemporary uses==
It is also sometimes used by classical musicians as a shorthand way of indicating chords (though it is not generally used in modern musical co F-15 was the subject of the [[IMAX]] movie Fighter Pilot: Operation Red Flag, about the [[RED FLAG exercise]]s.

The [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation|Grumman]] '''F-14 Tomcat'''  is a [[United States Navy]] [[supersonic]], twin-engine, [[Swing-wing|variable sweep wing]], two-seat strike [[fighter jet|fighter]]. The Tomcat's primary missions are [[air superiority]], fleet air defense, and precision strike against ground [[target]]s. The first F-14 flight was in 1970.

The sole foreign customer for the Tomcat was the [[Imperial Iranian Air Force]] (IIAF) during the reign of the [[Shah of Iran]]. A total of 80 [[aircraft]] were ordered, but only 79 were delivered, as the last unit was [[embargo]]ed and turned over to the United States Navy. It has been rumoured that some of the surviving Iranian F-14's are reportedly still operational today, but a lack of spare parts is likely taking a toll on their combat readiness. Also, it should be noted that the amount of real flight time required to maintain any proficiency in the tactical operation of this aircraft is well beyond their ability to retain any real operational effectiveness. 

==Development==
The F-14 was developed to take the place of the aborted [[General Dynamics]] [[General Dynamics F-111|F-111B]] (also called the TFX), a navalized version of the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] tactical strike aircraft. Intended to provide fleet air defense, the F-111B proved unmaneuverable, overweight, and, in general, poorly suited to [[aircraft carrier]] operations.  This led to its cancellation in [[1968 in aviation|1968]].

Early in development, the Tomcat was already shown to have advantages over the failing F-111B. It was smaller, lighter, and more fuel-efficient than the TFX. Ironically, much of the F-14's equipment was re-used from the TFX, including the [[AN/AWG-9]] [[radar]], [[AIM-54 Phoenix]] missile, and the [[Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30]] engines.

To facilitate early introduction of the F-14 into service the first version of the aircraft was planned using the engine and weapons system technology from the F-111B, and then progressively introduce new engines and a new weapons system into the new F-14 [[airframe]]. Thus, the designation '''F-14A''' was assigned to the new aircraft equipped with updated TF-30 engines and the AN/AWG-9 weapons system from the [[F-111B]]. The original plan was to only build a few F-14As, as the TF30 was known to be a troublesome engine.  In addition, the engine was not designed for fighter-type operations and only put out 74% of the thrust for which the F-14 was designed. An '''F-14B''' would follow using the engine from the advanced technology engine competition. The 'B' would then be followed by the '''F-14C''', with a new weapons system replacing the AN/AWG-9.  However, the AN/AWG-9 replacement was delayed.  When it finally arrived as the AN/APG-71, the designation assigned to the new aircraft was '''F-14D''': the F-14C was never produced.

The Tomcat was intended as an uncompromising air superiority fighter and interceptor, charged with defending [[carrier battle group]]s against [[Soviet Navy]] aircraft armed with [[cruise missiles]]. It carried the [[Hughes Aircraft|Hughes]] [[AN/AWG-9]] long-range radar originally developed for the F-111B, capable of detecting bomber-sized targets at ranges exceeding 160 km (100 miles), tracking 24 targets and engaging six simultaneously. In a now famous test, an F-14 simultaneously shot down five of six target drones. However it has recently been mentioned that the six drones never attempted to employ defensive maneuvers or jamming and thus didn't simulate realistic targets. Originally, the F-14's primary weapon was the [[AIM-54 Phoenix]] missile, capable of engaging a target at up to 200 km (120 statute miles), but this was removed from service on [[30 September]] [[2004 in aviation|2004]]. The F-14 was the only aircraft to carry this weapon, which was designed as an integral part of the Tomcat weapons system. Although it could carry up to six of these large weapons, its heavy weight only enabled the F-14 to land on a carrier with a maximum load of two. Medium-range armament is provided by the [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] [[semi-active radar homing]] missile, backed by [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] [[infrared homing|infrared]] missiles and a single [[M61 Vulcan]] 20 mm [[cannon]] for close-in use. The F-14 was designed with some air-to-ground capability, but this was not explored until late in its career; Tomcats have now been equipped to carry the LANTIRN targeting system for use by [[laser-guided bomb]]s and other precision-guided weapons. Some F-14's are also equipped to carry the [[Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System]] (TARPS) pod, giving the Navy what was then its only manned tactical reconnaissance platform. 

The F-14 was one of the most maneuverable and agile airplanes of its generation. The flat, pancake-like section between the engines acts as an airfoil to provide additional lift, giving the Tomcat an effective wing area about 40% greater than its actual wing dimensions. This results in relatively low effective [[wing loading]]. The Tomcat also has a Mach Sweep Programmer (MSP) that automatically adjusts the wing angle for optimum flight performance (the only VG aircraft so equipped — a similar system was tested but not used for the [[Panavia]] [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado ADV]]), and movable glove vanes that offset the migration of the center of lift rearwards as airspeed increased.  Pilots could also manually deploy them for extra assist in turns. However, the benefits were not considered worth the maintenace workload caused by the vanes and they were subsequently removed on later variants. Most variable-geometry aircraft are optimized for fast, low-altitude attack, emphasizing good gust response rather than maneuverability. Despite the Tomcat's considerable size, its agility compares well to many other fighters, although that created problems for the troublesome and unreliable TF30 turbofans, which were subject to compressor stalls in violent maneuvers or high [[angle of attack|alpha]].  Once the reliable F110 engines arrived, which also provided the F-14 with the full thrust for which it was designed, the full capability of the aircraft became apparent.  The plane accelerates and decelerates very rapidly, and while it can't match it in roll, is said to be able to consistently fight F-16Cs to a draw close in while retaining its speed, endurance and avionics advantages.  Although the F-14 is capable of Mach 2.4+, experience has shown that very little time is spent above Mach 2. Despite its agility in the air, the F-14 is notoriously difficult to land on a carrier deck and its service has been marred by numerous landing accidents.  

The F-14 entered the fleet in [[1972 in aviation|1972]], replacing the [[F-4 Phantom II]] which was phased out in 1986, and entered operational service with Navy fighter squadrons [[VF-1]] Wolfpack and [[VF-2]] Bounty Hunters aboard the [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|USS Enterprise (CVN 65)]] in September 1974. The F-14B, introduced in November 1987, incorporated the new General Electric F110 engines. In [[1995 in aviation|1995]], an upgrade program was initiated to incorporate new digital avionics and weapon system improvements to strengthen its multi-mission competitive edge. The F-14D, delivered in [[1990 in aviation|1990]] in reduced numbers, was a major upgrade with F-110 engines, new AN/APG-71 radar system, Airborne Self Protection Jammer (ASPJ), Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) and [[Infra-red search and track|Infrared Search and Track (IRST)]]. Additionally, all F-14 variants were given precision strike capability using the LANTIRN targeting system, night vision compatibility, new defensive countermeasures systems and a new digital flight control system.
[[Image:F-14-vf-84.jpg|thumb|left|300px|An F-14A of [[VF-84 Jolly Rogers]], in the old color scheme from the beginning of its service.]]

The Tomcat is said to be named for the late [[Vice Admiral]] Thomas Connolly, whose testimony before the Senate was critical in the cancellation of the deeply-flawed [[General Dynamics F-111|TFX]] project. Connolly's [[Aviator call sign|call sign]] was &quot;Tomcat,&quot; hence the popular name which also conformed with the Navy's tradition of giving feline names to [[Grumman]] fighters. In addition, &quot;Tomcat&quot; was first used for the [[F7F Tigercat]] in 1943, but was rejected by the navy as being inappropriately suggestive. 

The Tomcat had only one foreign export sale due to its cost, initial lack of ground attack capacity, and the fact that the US government generally would not allow the export of the aircraft, preferring to champion the F-15.  Its one sale made for one of the more colorful events in its history. The United States in the late 1970s supplied F-14s to [[Iran]], only to have them fall into the hands of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] after the [[1979 in aviation|1979]] revolution. The US subsequently cut off tech support for the Iranian Tomcats. For many years it was thought that from that point forward Iran used the fighter primarily as an airborne radar controller, escorted and protected by other fighters, but later information indicates this was incorrect. Given apparent asistance from the Soviet Union, [[Iran-Contra Affair|Iran-Contra]] supplies, cannibalization, back channel acquisition of certain parts, reverse engineering and virtually unlimited supplies of labor, the Iranians were able to keep a number of the aircraft operational.  

There are reports that the aircraft was used extensively in the Iran-Iraq War and some claim it achieved over 100 kills.  Although information received about that war is notably sketchy and some sources may be suspect, a phenomenon from the early part of the [[Gulf War]] tends to lend some credibility to these claims.  In the Gulf War, F-14s were used primarily for strike package escort and reconnaissance due to the way the Air Tasking Orders were set up. The emissions from the AWG-9 are instantly recognizable, due to its very powerful transmitter (retained for the APG-71).  When Iraqi fighters were detected inbound, as soon as the Tomcats &quot;lighted up&quot;, the Iraqis would immediately abandon the attack while well out of range, perhaps indicating their familiarity with both the Tomcat and the AIM-54.  

Some rumors suggest that a few of the [[AIM-54 Phoenix]] missiles supplied to Iran before the revolution were sold to the [[Soviet Union]], where they may have strongly influenced the development of the similar [[Vympel]] [[Vympel R-33|AA-9 'Amos']] long-range missile. In return, the Soviets may have assisted in returning the Phoenix to service in Iran. Furthermore, an attempt was made to adapt the [[MIM-23 HAWK]] [[surface-to-air defence missile]]s that were also a carryover from the pre-revolution period to be used as [[air-to-air missile]]s for the F-14, but this proved unsuccessful.

=== The future of the F-14 ===
[[Image:Tomcat.f14.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|285px|Sailors prepare an F-14 Tomcat for flight on the aircraft carrier [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|USS Abraham Lincoln]], in support of [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Operation Iraqi Freedom]] ([[2003 in aviation|2003]]).]]
The original F-14 was intended to be a multi-role aircraft with a potent strike capability from the outset.  However, budget constraints, and the assigning of the strike role to the [[F/A-18]] meant that this capability was dropped before the F-14 was brought into service.  It was resurrected later in its life, however, with the ability for later model F-14s to carry the [[LANTIRN]] pod. With this accessory the F-14 could deliver [[Laser-guided bomb]]s or many other Navy air-to-ground munitions with a fair amount of accuracy over intermediate ranges. After the retirement of the A-6 [[attack aircraft]], the F-14 was the longest range strike platform on U.S. [[supercarrier]]s. It is debatable, and to many doubtful, whether the [[Super Hornet]] will be able to deliver the quantity of munitions that the F-14 can over similar ranges. Unfortunately, without the ability to re-manufacture or replace the F-14 fleet, the tired and high-maintenance airframes and engines fitted mostly with technology from the 1970s are on their way out, though by many standards it is still superior to the fighters of many airforces.  Regardless, the decision to incorporate the [[Super Hornet]] and decommission the F-14 is mainly due to the high amount of maintenance required to keep the Tomcats operational. On average, an F-14 requires nearly 50 maintenance hours for every flight hour, while the [[Super Hornet]] requires five to 10 maintenance hours for every flight hour.

Grumman had submitted several proposals to the Navy to upgrade the Tomcat beyond the D model (such as the '''Super Tomcat 21''', the cheaper '''QuickStrike''' version, and the more advanced '''Attack Super Tomcat 21''') but the [[Super Hornet]] was chosen as the future Navy [[attack aircraft]] instead. Grumman was acquired by [[Northrop]] in [[1994 in aviation|1994]] (the F-14 was probably the only program keeping them in business), sealing the fate of the F-14.

The F-14 is rapidly disappearing from U.S. Navy service. It originally was slated to remain in service through at least 2008, but all F-14A and F-14B airframes have already been retired, and only two squadrons, the [[VF-31]] Tomcatters and the [[VF-213]] Black Lions, which both fly the &quot;D&quot; models, remain, and will be disestablished or converted by September 2006, to be replaced by the Boeing [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]]. 

The last F-14 combat mission was completed on February 8, 2006, when a pair of Tomcats landed aboard the [[USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71)|USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71)]] after one dropped a bomb in Iraq. The plane was part of [[VF-31]] and the last pilot credited with a bomb drop in combat was Lt. Bill Frank. An F-14D from VF-213 was the last F-14 to land on an aircraft carrier after a combat mission, it was piloted by Capt. William G. Sizemore. During their final deployment with the [[USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71)|USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71)]], VFs[[VF-31|-31]] and [[VF-213|-213]] collectively completed 1,163 combat sorties totaling 6,876 flight hours, and dropped 9,500 pounds of ordnance during reconnaissance, surveillance, and close air support missions in support of OIF.  [[VF-213]] pilots who are making the transition to the Super Hornet will begin [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|F/A-18F]] (double seat) training in April, and the squadron will be operational, or “safe for flight,” in September. [[VF-31]] pilots who are making the transition will begin [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|F/A-18E]] (single seat) training in October, and the squadron will be safe for flight in April 2007. This will make [[VF-31]] the last official Tomcat squadron in the Navy.

== F-14 in combat ==
[[Image:gw-tomphoenix.jpg|thumb|300px|An F-14 launches an [[AIM-54 Phoenix]] during training]]
F-14s of the U. S. Navy have shot down five enemy aircraft for no losses. One has been lost to a [[surface-to-air missile]].
* F-14s from VF-1 and VF-2 flew top cover for [[Operation Frequent Wind]]; evacuation of [[Saigon]], [[Vietnam]] in the month of [[April]], [[1975]]  
* On [[August 19]], [[1981 in aviation|1981]] two F-14As from [[VF-41 Black Aces]] shot down two [[Libya]]n ([[Soviet]]-built) [[Sukhoi]] [[Sukhoi Su-22|Su-22 &quot;Fitters&quot;]] using [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|AIM-9 &quot;Sidewinders&quot;]] after the lead Fitter pilot fired a [[Vympel]] [[Vympel K-13|AA-2 &quot;Atoll&quot;]] at one of the F-14s, which missed. One of the Su-22 pilots was seen to have ejected. 
* F-14s from [[VF-11]] and [[VF-31]] [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/usmnf.htm flew cover for] multi-national peacekeeping forces in [[Lebanon]] in the early [[1980]]’s, they were fired at by [[Syrian]] [[AAA]] and [[SAM]] which resulted in retaliatory strikes by the US Navy where F-14s flew escort for the strikers. VF-11 even [http://www.anft.net/f-14/f14-history-combat.htm#lebanon engaged eight MiGs] over Lebanon. The section flew cover for a TARPS F-14 and was ready to open fire at four MiGs but the MiGs did a split S and ran for Syria. Four more MiGs emerged and blew through without engaging. 
* F-14s also provided air cover for US ground forces in the [[invasion of Grenada]] in [[1983]].
* On [[October 10]] [[1985]], F-14s from [[VF-74]] and [[VF-103]] intercepted the [[Egyptian]] commercial air liner which [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/achille_lauro.htm transported terrorists] from the [[Achille Lauro]] hijackings. The airliner was forced down at the [[Sigonella Naval Air Station]] in [[Sicily]]. 
* F-14s from [[VF-33]] and [[VF-102]] provided air cover for offensive strikes against [[Libya]] during [[Operation Attain Document]] in the spring of [[1986]]. 
* F-14s also provided air cover for [[US Navy]] and [[US Air Force]] bombers during [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]].
* On [[January 4]], [[1989 in aviation|1989]], two F-14As from [[VF-32 Swordsmen]] assigned to [[USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67)|''John F. Kennedy'']] shot down two [[Libya]]n (Soviet-built) [[Mikoyan-Gurevich]] [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23 &quot;Floggers&quot;]] with two [[AIM-7 Sparrow|AIM-7 &quot;Sparrows&quot;]] (one failed) and one AIM-9 &quot;Sidewinder.&quot; The MiG-23s were pursuing the F-14s in an attempt to get into a missile firing position for several minutes before the F-14s concluded that they were under attack and outmanoeuvred the Floggers. Both of the Flogger pilots were seen to have ejected. An [http://www.ka8vit.com/sd/shootdown.htm audio recording of the engagement] is available. The AIM-7 which failed was probably either a failure to track the target or a failure for the rocket motor to ignite since the failure was noted almost immediately after launch and the second AIM-7 was launched about seven seconds later. A missile was launched at the F-14s just before the AIM-7 hit its target but they managed to avoid it.
* On [[February 6]], [[1991 in aviation|1991]] during [[Operation Desert Storm]], an F-14A from [[VF-1 Wolfpack]] shot down a [[Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant|Mil]] [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8 &quot;Hip&quot;]] [[helicopter]] with an AIM-9 &quot;Sidewinder.&quot;
* On [[January 21]], [[1991]] during Operation Desert Storm, an F-14B from [[VF-103|VF-103 Sluggers]] was shot down, possibly by an [[Iraq]]i [[SA-2 Guideline|SA-2 &quot;Guideline&quot;]] [[surface-to-air missile]]. Both crewmembers ejected, and one was captured until the end of the war. The other managed to escape and was picked up after eight hours.
* The Tomcat first deployed air-to-ground (bombs) weapons during [[September]] of [[1995]] over [[Bosnia]] during [[Operation Deliberate Force]]. This was done by the [[VF-41 Black Aces]], who also was the first squadron to deploy air-to-air weapons in combat.
* F-14s from [[VF-32]] and [[VF-213]] participated in [[Operation Desert Fox]] in [[December]] [[1998]].
* F-14Ds from [[VF-213]] engaged [[Iraqi]] [[MiG-25]]’s with [[AIM-54 Phoenix]] missiles on [[January 5]] [[1999]], no hits were registered.
* Between [[April 9]], [[1999 in aviation|1999]] and [[June 9]], [[1999]] during [[Operation Allied Force]] over [[Yugoslavia]], F-14s of [[VF-14 Tophatters]] dropped 350 laser-guided 1000 pound (454 kg) [[bomb]]s in addition to other air-to-ground ordnance. They also performed [[reconnaissance]] missions. F-14s from VF-41 also participated in Operation Allied Force
* An [[VF-2]] F-14D engaged an Iraqi [[MiG-23]] with an AIM-54 Phoenix missile in [[September]] [[1999]], not hits registered.
* On [[October 9]], [[2001 in aviation|2001]] during [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], F-14s from VF-14 Tophatters struck [[Taliban]] aircraft on the ground at [[Mazar-e-Sharif]], about 850 miles &lt;!-- nautical or statute? --&gt; (1370 km) from their aircraft carrier. This was followed by more air-to-ground strikes from VF-14 and other Tomcat-equipped squadrons during the operation.
* F-14s from five different squadrons participated in [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] with great success. 
* The Iranian Air Force used their F-14As in combat several times against Iraq during the [[Iran-Iraq War]], but the exact results are difficult to determine.

== F-14 in fiction and popular culture ==
The Tomcat was immortalized in the 1986 film ''[[Top Gun]]'', about naval aviators that fly the F-14. The success of that film entrenched the Tomcat as [[wiktionary:synonymous|synonymous]] with fighter jet, and spurred a rash of games (not to mention a surge in Navy recruiting). Additional appearances:
*The 1980 time-travel film ''[[The Final Countdown]]'' featured the VF-84 &quot;Jolly Rogers&quot; F-14 fighter squadron aboard [[USS Nimitz (CVN-68)|''Nimitz'']]. 
* James W. Huston's novel &quot;Flash Point&quot; is about a group of [[US Navy|US naval]] aviators flying Tomcats. 
* The F-14 is the plane featured in the computer game [[Afterburner (video game)|Afterburner]].
* The F-14 appears in numerous episodes of the TV series [[JAG]]. The lead character Captain [[Harmon Rabb]] (played by [[David James Elliott]]) is a qualified F-14 pilot.
* Tomcats are featured in [[Stephen Coonts]]' novel Final Flight.
* The F-14 was the inspiration for the [[VF-1 Valkyrie]] in the [[anime|Japanese animated]] TV series ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' (1982-1983). In the prequel ''[[Macross Zero]]'', the lead character Lieutenant [[Shin Kudo]] (played by [[Kenichi Suzumura]]) is a qualified F-14 pilot.
* A modified single-seater F-14 is Mickey Simon's aircraft in the popular [[manga]]/[[anime]] series [[Area 88]].

The [[Lockheed]] '''F-117 Nighthawk''' is the world's first operational [[aircraft]] designed to use [[stealth technology]]. Flown only by the [[United States Air Force]], it is a direct descendant of the [[Have Blue]] stealth prototype program.

==Nicknames==
Before it was given an official name, the engineers and test pilots referred to the ungainly aircraft, which went into hiding during daylight to avoid detection by Soviet satellites, as &quot;Cockroaches&quot;, a name that is still sometimes used. A short-lived hourglass on the bottom of one hinted at a nickname of &quot;Black Widow&quot;, as in the [[black widow spider]]. Another sometimes used nickname is &quot;Wobblin' Goblin,&quot; due to the aircraft's instability at low speeds, especially during [[in-flight refueling]] operations.

==Inconsistent designation==
The Nighthawk's designation of F-117 marks it as a [[fighter aircraft|fighter]], but this is a misnomer; the aircraft is a [[ground attack aircraft]], incapable of air-to-air warfare. 

The &quot;F-&quot; designation has never been officially explained. There are several theories. The USAF has always been more proud of its fighters than its ground-attack aircraft, which are sometimes denigrated as &quot;mud movers.&quot; Officials may have felt that they could more easily generate political and military support for the radical new aircraft if it were called a &quot;fighter&quot; rather than a bomber or attack plane. The &quot;F-&quot; designation may also have been part of the attempt to keep the Nighthawk secret (the program was classified until the late 1980s). During development the term 'LT,' for Logistics Trainer, was often used. 

Also a recent televised documentary quoted a senior member of the F-117 development team as saying that the top-notch fighter pilots required to fly the new aircraft were more easily attracted to an F- plane, as opposed to a B- or A- aircraft. There has been something of a class distinction between fighter and bomber crews, particularly in the days of the [[Strategic Air Command]] (1945-1991), and flying one type often limited a pilot's prospects for flying the other.

The USAF maintains that F-117 can carry every weapon in the inventory, including [[air-to-air missile]]s. That may be technically true, but the aircraft is unsuited to air combat. It cannot turn at greater than 5 gs, lacks the radar to guide longer-range missiles, and does not carry shorter-range ones for self-defense because that would cut its already-small bombload in half. [[USAF]] officials once considered putting [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] air-to-air missiles on the F-117 &amp;mdash; pilots were even trained to fire them &amp;mdash; but there is no evidence that AIM-9s have ever been loaded aboard.

==Design and operation==
[[Image:F-117 Nighthawk flight.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An F-117A Nighthawk in the skies above New Mexico]]About the size of an [[F-15 Eagle|F-15C Eagle]], the single-seat, twin-engine F-117 is powered by two non-afterburning [[General Electric Aircraft Engines|General Electric]] [[General Electric F404|F404]] turbofan engines, and has quadruple-redundant [[Fly-by-wire|fly-by-wire flight controls]]. It is [[Aerial refueling|air refuelable]]. In order to lower development costs, the avionics, fly-by-wire systems, and other parts are derived from the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] and [[F/A-18 Hornet]]. 

Among the penalties for stealth are 30 percent lower engine power and a very low wing [[Aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]], thanks to the high sweep angle needed to deflect incoming radar waves to the sides.

The black color of the fuselage results from a construction of radar-absorbing composites and radar-absorbing ferrite based paints. . 

The F-117A is equipped with sophisticated navigation and attack systems integrated into a digital avionics suite. It carries no radar, which lowers emissions and cross-section. It navigates primarily by [[GPS]] and high-accuracy [[inertial navigation]]. Missions are coordinated by an automated planning system that can automatically perform all aspects of a strike mission, including weapons release. Targets are acquired by a [[thermal imaging]] [[infrared]] system, slaved to a [[laser]] that finds the range and designates targets for [[laser-guided bomb]]s. 

The F-117A's split internal bay can carry 5,000 lb (2,300 kg) of ordnance. Typical weapons are a pair of [[GBU-10]], [[GBU-12]], or [[GBU-27]] laser-guided bombs, two [[BLU-109]] penetration bombs, two Wind-Corrected Munition Dispensers (WCMD), or two Joint Direct Attack Munitions ([[JDAM]]s), a GPS/INS-guided stand-off bomb. It can theoretically carry two examples of any weapon in the USAF inventory, including the [[B61]] nuclear bomb.

==History==
The F-117A production decision was made in 1973 with a contract awarded to ''Lockheed Advanced Development Projects'', the &quot;[[Skunk works|Skunk Works]],&quot; in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], [[California]] led by [[Ben Rich]]. The first flight was in 1977, only 31 months after the full-scale development decision.  The first F-117A was delivered in 1982, operational capability was achieved in October 1983, and the last delivery was in the summer of 1990. The Air Force denied the existence of the aircraft until 1988, then in April 1990 an example was put on public display at [[Nellis Air Force Base]], Nevada, attracting tens of thousands of spectators.

Current inventory is 55 airplanes.

During the program's early years, the F-117A fleet was based at [[Tonopah Test Range]], [[Nevada]] from 1984 to mid-1992, where it served under the 4450th Tactical Group, absorbed by the [[37th Tactical Fighter Wing]] in 1989.  In 1992, the entire fleet was transferred to [[Holloman Air Force Base]], [[New Mexico]], where it was placed under the command of the [[49th Fighter Wing]].

[[Image:F-117 lands.jpg|thumb|300px|F-117 landing]]

As the Air Force has stated [http://www.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?fsID=104], &quot;Streamlined management by Aeronautical Systems Center, [[Wright-Patterson AFB]], [[Ohio]], combined breakthrough stealth technology with concurrent development and production to rapidly field the aircraft....  The F-117A program demonstrates that a stealth aircraft can be designed for reliability and maintainability.&quot; The aircraft maintenance statistics are comparable to other tactical fighters of similar complexity. Logistically supported by Sacramento Air Logistics Center, [[McClellan AFB]], California, the F-117A is kept at the forefront of technology through a planned weapon system improvement program located at USAF Plant 42 at [[Palmdale, California]].

== Combat ==
The F-117 has been used several times in modern wars. Its first mission was during [[Operation Just Cause]] in [[Panama]] in 1989. During that invasion an F-117 dropped two bombs on [[Rio Hato]] airfield. Later, during the [[Gulf War]], it performed well by dropping [[smart bomb]]s on [[Iraqi]] military targets. It has since been used in the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999, [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Operation Iraqi Freedom]].

== Combat losses ==
One F-117 has been lost in combat, to Serbian/Yugoslav forces. On [[March 27]], [[1999]], during the [[Kosovo War]], the 3rd Battalion of the 250th Missile Brigade, equipped with the [[SA-3 Goa|Isayev S-125 'Neva-M']] (NATO designation [[SA-3 Goa|SA-3 'Goa']]), downed F-117A serial number 82-806 with a liquid-fuelled Neva missile. According to [[Wesley Clark]] and other NATO generals, Yugoslav air defences tracked F-117s with old Russian radars operating on long wavelengths. This, combined with the loss of stealth when the jets got wet or opened their bomb bays, made them highly visible on radar screens. The pilot survived and was later rescued by [[NATO]] forces.
Reports indicate [[Russia]] is using the wreckage to test new anti-stealth technology [http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/12/12/140853.shtml].

A second F-117A was also damaged during a raid in the Kosovo War, and although it made it back to its base, it never flew again. [http://www.pogo.org/m/dp/dp-fa22-Riccioni-03082005.pdf]

== Future ==
With its successes in the [[Kosovo War]] and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and its extraordinarily high mission capable rate, the F-117 has secured its place as the aerospace &quot;tip of the spear&quot; during the first few nights of military operations when the goal is to blind the enemy by destroying command, control and radar. Yet despite this, the F-117 is still very much an aircraft designed with technologies that were state of the art in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and as such, there has been a preliminary decision to retire the fleet in 2008. Most notably its stealth technology and faceting, while still more advanced than that of any other aircraft but the B-2 and F-22A, is maintenance heavy. Furthermore, the faceting technology (which limits its aerodynamics) represents an old counter-radar technique that has since been greatly refined.

The increase of production of the F-22A by four planes and its entry as an operational aircraft into the US Air Force has created debate about retiring the fleet. A draft version of the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review and the 2007 Defense Budget that were leaked proposed retiring the entire fleet to make room for buying more [[F-22A]]s.[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/2006/01/us-plans-to-retire-b52s-c21s-f117-u2-for-more-f22s/index.php]  This plan was removed from both the final 2007 Budget and the final QDR.[http://www.airforcetimes.com/story.php?f=1-292925-1509462.php]

Critics say that removing the F-117, an attack plane by nature, from service is another sign of the machinations of the largely former-fighter pilots that populate the highest ranks of the Air Force, who, by reputation, have been willing to sacrifice nearly any program in order to preserve the F-22A, the &quot;ultimate fighter&quot;. Furthermore, they contend that the F-117 can carry 2 2000 lb bombs in its internal bays (and thus remain stealthy) whereas the F-22A can only carry such bombs on external pylons, breaking its vaunted stealth and manuverability.

Supporters of the proposal argue however that the high maintenance cost and older stealth technology that is vulnerable to long-wavelength radar, combined with a subsonic limit, makes the F-117 more dangerous to fly. They contend that the F-22A is the logical successor considering that:
* Its stealth is nearly as advanced as the B-2, reportedly vastly more efficient than the F-117.
* It can fly at supersonic speeds without using afterburners and thus should have better range.
* Its radar absorbing material requires far less maintenance than that of the F-117.
* The new 250lb small-diameter bombs entering service and designed specifically to fit in the F-22A's internal munitions bays have a variable yield, from 250lbs up to 2000lbs, meaning that there is no loss in explosive capability despite the smaller physical size of the munition.

With the removal of the proposal of the retirement of the F-117 fleet, it is likely that the aircraft will remain in service for some years to come until their previously scheduled retirement between 2017 and 2025. In fact, 2004 and 2005 saw several mid-life improvement programs being implemented on the F-117, including an [[avionics]] upgrade.

Most interestingly, several of the F-117s were [http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/f-117-camo.jpg painted in a desert tarmac camouflage pattern] in an experiment to determine the effectiveness of the F-117's stealth during daylight conditions. If the experiment is successful, it might lead to part or all of the fleet changing from their trademark black to this new color scheme, enabling, for the first time, daylight operations in warzones. As of early 2006 the outcome of this experiment is unknown.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:f4u.corsair.750pix.jpg|300px|thumb|Chance Vought '''F4U Corsair'''.]]
The '''[[Chance Vought]] F4U Corsair''' was a [[fighter aircraft]] that saw service in [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]]. [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]]-built Corsairs were designated '''FG''' and [[Brewster Aeronautical Corporation|Brewster]]-built aircraft '''F3A'''.

When flown in [[1940 in aviation|1940]], the XF4U-1 became the first U.S. single-engine production aircraft capable of 400 mph in level flight.  It was a remarkable achievement for Vought, as [[aircraft carrier|carrier aircraft]] are, compared to land-based counterparts, overbuilt to withstand the extreme stress of deck landings.

The most striking feature of the aircraft is the inverted [[gull wing]].  The design concept for the Corsair incorporated the largest available fighter engine &amp;mdash; the 2,000 hp, 18-cylinder [[Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp]] [[radial engine|radial]] , turning an enormous 13'4&quot; (4.06 m) Hamilton Standard [[propeller]]. The dimensions required the bent wing in order to keep the [[landing gear]] reasonably short, as well as sturdy enough for carrier landings, and to provide ground clearance for the propeller. 

However, numerous technical problems had to be solved before the Corsair entered service.  Carrier suitability was especially troublesome, leading to changes of the [[landing gear]], tailwheel, and [[tailhook]]. Additionally, a small [[spoiler (aeronautics)|spoiler]] was added to the leading edge of the starboard wing to reduce adverse stall characteristics. A noticeable problem with the Corsair design was its difficulty to recover from a developed spin, as its wing shape interfered with elevator control.
[[Image:Corsair_close.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A French Navy Corsair.]]
Due to visibility problems on landing caused by a combination of the pilot's position and the length of the nose, which made landing tricky for poorly trained pilots, Corsairs were largely barred from U.S. carrier service until the end of [[1944 in aviation|1944]].  When the aircraft finally saw combat it was nonetheless a superb fighter compared to its contemporaries, achieving a 10 to 1 victory ratio.  However, nearly as many Corsairs were lost to landing accidents as the type downed enemy aircraft. Growing pains aside, [[US Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] squadrons readily took to the radical new fighter.

From February [[1943 in aviation|1943]] onward, the &quot;U-Bird&quot; flew from [[Guadalcanal (Pacific Ocean island)|Guadalcanal]] and ultimately other bases in the [[Solomon Islands]]. Corsairs were flown by the famous Black Sheep Squadron VMF-214 led by Marine Fighter Ace Maj. [[Pappy Boyington|Gregory &quot;Pappy&quot; Boyington]] in an area of the Solomon Islands called The Slot. (The real men of the sqaudron called Boyington &quot;Gramps&quot;. They never referred to him as &quot;Pappy&quot;. Somehow the name &quot;Pappy&quot; was introduced by the media. The moniker stuck and was made famous by Hollywood with the making of the TV series &quot;[[Baa Baa Black Sheep]]&quot;.) Corsairs also served well as fighter-bombers in the Central Pacific and the [[Philippines]].  [[Night-fighter]] versions were produced, equipping Navy and Marine units ashore and afloat.  British units flying from aircraft carriers solved the landing visibility problem by approaching the carrier in a medium left-hand turn, which allowed the pilot to keep the carrier's deck in view over the dip in the port wing, allowing safe carrier operations.  At war's end, Corsairs were ashore on [[Okinawa]] combating the [[Kamikaze]] suicide pilots and flying from fleet and escort carriers.

During the war, Corsair production expanded beyond Vought to include [[Brewster Aeronautical Corporation|Brewster]] (F3A) and [[Goodyear]] (FG) models. Allied forces flying the aircraft included the British [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Fleet Air Arm]] and the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]].

==Royal Navy==
The Fleet Air Arm introduced the Corsair into service before the USN.  In the early days of the war RN fighter requirements had been based on cumbersome two-seat designs, such as the [[Blackburn Skua]], [[Fairey Fulmar]] and [[Fairey Firefly]], on the assumption they would only be fighting long range bombers or flying boats.  The RN hurriedly adopted higher performance but less robust types derived from land based aircraft, such as the [[Supermarine Seafire]].  The Corsair was welcomed as a much more robust alternative to naval adaptations of these.  In RN service, most Corsairs had their outer wings clipped to assist with storage and low-altitude performance.  Despite the clipped wings and the shorter decks of British carriers, the pilots of the RN found landing accidents less of a problem than they had been to USN aviators due to the curved approaches mentioned above.

There were four versions used by the British as the end, and were named as such: '''Corsair I''' for F4U-1s, '''Corsair II''' for F4U-1As, '''Corsair III''' for F3A-1Ds, and '''Corsair IV''' for FG-1Ds.

==Royal New Zealand Air Force==
Equipped with obsolescent [[Curtiss P-40]]s, the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] Squadrons in the [[Pacific War|South Pacific]] performed impressively compared to the [[United States|America]]n units they operated alongside, in particular in the air to air role.  The American government accordingly decided to give [[New Zealand]] early access to the Corsair, especially as it was not initially being used from carriers.  Some 424 Corsairs equipped 13 RNZAF squadrons, including [[No. 14 Squadron RNZAF]] and [[No. 15 Squadron RNZAF]], replacing [[SBD Dauntless]] as well as P40s. 

However by the time the Corsairs arrived, there were virtually no [[Japan]]ese aircraft left in New Zealand's allocated sectors of the Southern Pacific, and despite the RNZAF Squadrons extending their operations to more northern islands, the Corsairs were primarily used for close support of [[United States|America]]n, [[Australia]]n and [[New Zealand]] soldiers fighting the [[Japan]]ese. New Zealand pilots noted the Corsair's poor forward view and tendency to ground loop, but found this could be solved by pilot training in curved approaches before use from rough forward airbases. 14 Squadron took its Corsairs to [[Japan]] as part of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]].  Two privately owned Corsairs remain airworthy in RNZAF colours.

==Korea, Suez and the Football War==
The F4U-4 and -5 logged combat in Korea between [[1950 in aviation|1950]] and [[1953 in aviation|1953]] while the &quot;dash seven&quot; model flew with the [[French Navy]] until the early sixties.  Corsairs flew their final combat missions during the [[1969 in aviation|1969]] &quot;[[Football War]]&quot; between [[Honduras]] and [[El Salvador]]. 

The AU Corsair was a ground-attack version produced for the Korean War.  The Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 engine, while it was supercharged, was not as highly &quot;blown&quot; as on the F4U.

==The F4U in fiction==
The exploits of a Marine Corps squadron which flew the Corsair in the Pacific during the war were depicted in the popular [[1970s]] [[television series]], ''Baa Baa Black Sheep'' {1976-1983}. The TV series actually featured about six genuine flying Corsairs. Most of the storylines were fictional. See also [[Pappy Boyington]].

'''Alfred H. (Freddy) Heineken''' ([[November 4]], [[1923]] - [[January 3]] [[2002]]) was a major stock holder and president of [[Heineken]], the [[beer]] brewery bought in [[1864]] by his grandfather [[Gerard Adriaan Heineken]] in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. Heineken was born in [[Amsterdam]]. 

He entered the service of the company (which by then was no longer owned by the family) on [[June 1|1 June]] [[1941]] and bought back stock several years later, to ensure the family controlled the company again.

By the time of his resignation as chairman of the board in [[1989]] he had turned Heineken from a [[brand]] that was famous in the Netherlands to a brand that was famous [[world]] wide.

==Kidnapping==
Freddy Heineken and his chauffeur Ab Doderer were [[kidnap]]ped in [[1983]] and released on a ransom of 35 million guilders (about 16 million [[Euro]]s). The kidnappers [[Cor van Hout]], [[Willem Holleeder]], [[Jan Boelaard]], [[Martin Erkamps]] and [[Frans Meijer]] were eventually caught. The first four served their [[prison]] term in the Netherlands, but Meijer escaped and lived in [[Paraguay]] for years, until he was discovered and imprisoned there. 

Freddy Heineken married Lucille Cummins, an [[United States|American]] from a [[Kentucky]] family of [[bourbon whiskey]] distillers. They had one child, [[Charlene Heineken]] who inherited his fortune on his passing in 2002.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:F3000.gif|right|122]]'''Formula 3000''' is a type of [[formula racing]].

In [[1985]], the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) created the Formula 3000 championship to become the final preparatory step for drivers hoping to enter the [[Formula One]] championship.  [[Formula Two]] had become too expensive, and was dominated by works-run cars with factory engines; the hope was that Formula 3000 would offer quicker, cheaper, more open racing.

=== Engines ===

Formula 3000 replaced [[Formula Two]], and was so named because the engines used initially were 3.0&amp;nbsp;L (3000 cc) [[Cosworth]] DFV engines made obsolete by the change of Formula One from the 3.0&amp;nbsp;L normally aspirated engines around this time. The rules permitted any 90-degree V8 engine. As well as the Cosworth, a Honda engine based on an Indy V8 by [[Judd (engine)|John Judd]] also appeared; a rumoured [[Lamborghini]] V8 never raced. In later years, a [[Mugen Motorsports|Mugen]]-[[Honda]] V8 became the thing to have, eclipsing the [[Cosworth]] DFV; [[Cosworth]] later responded with the brand new AC engine. Costs, not unlike the senior series, were getting out of control.

=== Chassis ===

The first chassis from [[March Engineering|March]] and [[Ralt]] were largely based upon existing [[Formula Two]] designs, although [[Lola]]'s entry was based on and looked very much like an [[Indycar]]. A few smaller teams tried obsolete three-litre [[Formula One]] cars (from [[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]], [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]], [[Minardi]] and RAM), with little success. The first few years of the championship saw March drivers establishing a superiority over Ralt. The form book was rewritten in 1988 with the entry of the ambitious [[Reynard Motorsport|Reynard]] marque with a brand new chassis; Reynard had won their first race in every formula they'd entered. This would continue in F3000. The next couple of years saw Lola improve slightly and March slip, but both were crushed by Reynard teams and by the mid-90s, F3000 was a virtual Reynard [[spec series]], although [[Lola]] did return with a promising car and the Japanese [[Footwork]] and [[Dome Engineering|Dome]] chassis were seen in Europe. [[Dallara]] briefly tried the series before moving up to [[Formula One]], and [[AGS]] dabbled in the series for the first few years. At least one unraced F3000 chassis existed - the Wagner fitted with a straight-six short-stroke BMW. This was converted into a sports car, however.

=== Politics ===

The series was not without controversy. In 1989 the eligibility of the [[Reynard Motorsport|Reynard]] chassis was challenged - it was raced with a different (but safer) nose to the one that had been crash tested. This season also saw problems with driver changes - the cost of F3000 was escalating to the point that teams were finding it difficult to run drivers for a whole season. A &quot;two driver changes per car per season&quot; rule meant that some cars had to sit idle while drivers with budgets couldn't race them. In 1991 the performance of some Italian teams attracted attention - they had started using &quot;jungle juice&quot; [[Formula One]] fuel, worth an estimated 15&amp;nbsp;bhp -- giving their drivers a significant advantage. In the early years of the formula there was much concern about safety, with a high number of accidents resulting in injuries to drivers. Fortunately, only one driver was killed in the European championship - [[Marco Campos]] in the very last round of the 1995 series.

=== Races ===

Formula 3000 races during the &quot;open chassis&quot; era tended to be of about 100-120 miles in distance, held at major circuits, either headlining meetings or paired with other international meetings. The &quot;jewel in the crown&quot; of the F3000 season was traditionally the [[Pau Grand Prix]] street race, rivalled for a few years by the [[Birmingham]] round. Most major circuits in [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]] saw the series visit at least once.

=== Other F3000 series ===

A small British Formula 3000 series ran for several years in the late 1980s and early 1990s, usually using year-old cars. An Italian series has now evolved into a second-level European one, running the previous generation of spec Lolas. The [[American Racing Series]], a predecessor of [[Indy Lights]], ran with March F3000 chassis (called [[Wildcat (car)|Wildcat]]s) and [[Buick]] V6 engines, before turning to Lolas some years later.

Japan persisted with [[Formula Two]] rules for a couple of years after the demise of F2 in Europe, but then adopted basically F3000 rules as [[Formula Nippon]]. The [[Formula Nippon]] series, unlike European F3000, featured a lot of competition between tyre companies, and tended to feature highly-paid drivers (both local and European) in cars that tended to be more developed and tested than those in the European series. The Mugen engine dominated this series, and was also extremely competitive in European F3000.

The European series remained unchanged for about a decade, but increasing costs meant the popularity of the series was waning by the mid [[1990s]].

=== The spec-chassis years ===

In [[1996]], new rules were introduced. These introduced a single engine (a detuned Judd V8 engine, re-engineered by and badged as a [[Zytek]]) and chassis ([[Lola]]), to go along with tyre standardization ([[Avon Tyres|Avon]]) introduced a number of years earlier. The following year the calendar was combined with that of Formula One, so the series became support races for the Grand Prix. These measures decreased costs and popularity grew. In [[2000]], the series was restricted to 15 teams of two cars each.

However, by [[2002]] expenses were once more very high and the number of entries rapidly dwindled.  Formula 3000 was experiencing tough competition with cheaper formulae, such as [[European F3000]] (using ex-FIA 1999 and 2002 Lola chassis) and [[Formula Nissan]] (also known as Telefonica World Series or Superfund World Series), as well as the North American [[CART]] series.  While drivers from these series such as [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] (CART), [[Cristiano da Matta]] (CART), and [[Felipe Massa]] (EF3000) found top rides in Formula One, the F3000 drivers seemed to have inordinate difficulty in moving onwards.  By the end of [[2003]], car counts had fallen to new lows.

The [[2004]] season was the last F3000 campaign, due in part to dwindling field sizes. For [[2005]] it has been replaced with a new series known as [[GP2 Series|GP2]], with [[Renault]] backing.

=== Champions ===

|align=&quot;left&quot;|[[Petrobras]]&ltn Lana''' - to celebrate 50th anniversary of Naval aviation, on [[24 May]] [[1961 in aviation|1961]], Phantoms flew across continental United States in under three hours in spite of several tanker refuelings. The fastest of the aircraft averaged 869.74 mph (1,400.28 km/h) and completed the trip in 2 hours 47 minutes winning pilot Lt. Richard Gordon and navigator Lt. Bobbie Long the 1961 [[Bendix trophy]]. 
* '''Operation Sageburner''' - on [[28 August]] [[1961]], a Phantom averaged 902.769 mph (1,452.826 km/h) over a 3 mi (1.86 km) course flying below 125 ft (40 m) at all times. Navy Commander J.L. Felsman was killed during the first attempt at this record on [[18 May]] [[1961]] when his aircraft disintegrated in the air after pitch dampener failure.
* '''Operation Skyburner''' - on [[22 December]] [[1961]], a modified Phantom with water-methanol injection set an absolute world record speed of 1,606.342 mph (2,585.086 km/h).
* On [[5 December]] [[1961]], another Phantom set a sustained altitude record of 66,443.8 ft (20,252.1 m).
* '''Operation High Jump''' - a series of time-to-altitude records set in early [[1962 in aviation|1962]]; 34.523 s to 3,000 m (9,840 ft), 48.787 s to 6,000 m (19,680 ft), 61.629 s to 9,000 m (29,530 ft), 77.156 s to 12,000 m (39,370 ft), 114.548 s to 15,000 m (49,210 ft), 178.5 s to 20,000 m (65,600 ft), 230.44 s to 25,000 m (82,000 ft), and 371.43 s to 30,000 m (98,400 ft). Although not officially recognized, the Phantom zoom-climbed to over 100,000 ft (30,480 m) during the last attempt.

All in all, the Phantom set 16 world records. With the exception of Skyburner, all records were achieved in unmodified production aircraft (Donald 2002).

==Operational history==
===US Navy===
On [[30 December]] 1960, the [[VF-121]] Pacemakers became the first Phantom operator with its F4H-1Fs (F-4As). The [[VF-74]] Be-devilers at [[NAS Oceana]] became the first deployable Phantom squadron when it received its F4H-1s (F-4Bs) on [[8 July]] 1961. The squadron completed carried qualifications in October 1961, and Phantom's first full carrier deployment between August 1962 and March 1963 aboard [[USS Forrestal (CVA-59)]]. The second deployable [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet]] squadron to receive F-4Bs was the [[VF-102]] Diamondbacks who promptly took their new aircraft on the [[shakedown (testing)|shakedown cruise]] of the [[USS Enterprise (CVAN-65)]]. The first deployable [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]] squadron to receive the F-4B was the [[VF-114]] Aardvarks which participated in the September 1962 cruise aboard [[USS Kitty Hawk (CVA-63)]]. By [[Tonkin Gulf incident]], 13 of 31 deployable Navy squadrons were armed with the type. F-4Bs from [[USS Constellation (CV-64)]] made the first Phantom combat sortie of the [[Vietnam War]] on [[5 August]] [[1964]], flying bomber escort in [[Operation Pierce Arrow]]. The first Phantom air-to-air victory of the war took place on [[9 April]] [[1965]] when F-4B from [[VF-96]] Fighting Falcons piloted by Lt JG Terence M. Murphy shot down a Chinese [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17]]. The Phantom was then shot down, apparently by an AIM-7 Sparrow from one of its wingmen. On [[17 June]] [[1965]], F-4B from [[VF-21]] Freelancers piloted by Cdr Thomas C. Page and Lt John C. Smith shot down the first North Vietnamese MiG of the war. On [[10 May]] 1972, [[Randy &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham]] and [[William P. Driscoll]] flying an F-4J Showtime 100 shot down three MiGs to become the first [[flying ace]]s of the war. Their fifth victory was over the mysterious North Vietnamese ace [[Nguyen Toon|Colonel Tomb]]. On the returning flight, the Phantom was damaged by an enemy SAM. To avoid being captured, Cunningham and Driscoll flew upside-down (the damage made the aircraft uncontrollable in a conventional attitude) and on fire until they could eject over water. During the war, Navy Phantom squadrons participated in 84 combat tours with F-4Bs, F-4Gs, and F-4Js. The Navy claimed 41 air-to-air victories at the cost of 71 aircraft lost to enemy fire (5 to aircraft, 13 to [[surface-to-air missile|SAMs]], and 53 to [[anti-aircraft warfare|AAA]]). An additional 54 aircraft were lost in accidents. By 1983, the F-4Ns have been completely replaced with [[F-14 Tomcat]]s, and by 1986 the last F-4Ss were exchanged for [[F/A-18 Hornet]]s. On [[25 March]] 1986, an F-4S belonging to [[VF-161]] Chargers became the last Navy Phantom to launch from an aircraft carrier ([[USS Midway (CV-41)]]). On [[18 October]] 1986, F-4S from [[VF-202]] Superheats made the last-ever Phantom carrier landing aboard [[USS America (CV-66)]]. In 1987, the last of the Naval Reserve-operated F-4Ss were replaced by F-14s. The only Phantoms still in service with the Navy are the QF-4 target drones operated by the [[Pacific Missile Test Center|Naval Air Warfare Center]]s (Donald 2002).

===US Marines===
The Marines received their first F-4Bs in June 1962, with the [[VMFA-314]] Black Knights becoming the first operational squadron. In addition to attack variants, the Marines also operated several tactical reconnaissance RF-4Bs. Marine Phantoms from [[VMFA-531]] Gray Ghosts arrived in Vietnam on [[10 April]] 1965, flying close air support missions from land bases as well as from [[USS America (CVA-66)]]. The Marines claimed 3 enemy MiGs at the cost of 75 aircraft lost in combat and 4 in accidents. On [[18 January]] 1992, the last Marine Phantom, an F-4S, was retired by [[VMFA-112]] Cowboys. The squadron was re-equipped with F/A-18 Hornets. 

===US Air Force===
At first reluctant to adopt a Navy fighter, the USAF quickly embraced the design and became the largest Phantom user. The first USAF Phantoms in Vietnam were F-4Cs from [[555th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] Triple Nickel which arrived in December 1964. Unlike the Navy, the Air Force initially flew its Phantoms with a pilot rather than a radar intercept officer (RIO) in the back seat. USAF F-4Cs scored their first victory against a Vietnamese MiG-17 on [[10 July]] [[1965]]. On [[24 July]] 1965, an Air Force F-4C from the [[47th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] became the first US plane to be downed by an enemy [[surface-to-air missile|SAM]]. Reconnaissance RF-4Cs made their debut in Vietnam on [[30 October]] 1965, flying the hazardous post-strike recce missions. Although the F-4C, being essentially identical to the Navy F-4B, carried the Navy-designed [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] missiles, the USAF-tailored F-4Ds initially arrived with USAF-designed [[AIM-4 Falcon]]s. However, the Falcon was designed to shoot down slow bombers and proved worthless in combat, and F-4Ds quickly reverted to using Sidewinders. The attrition of the war resulted in a shortage of [[F-105 Thunderchief]] fighter-bombers and USAF pressed the Phantoms into the ground attack role. Nonetheless, on [[28 August]] 1972, [[Richard S. Ritchie|Steve Ritchie]] became the first USAF ace of the war. On [[9 September]] 1972, RIO [[Charles B. DeBellevue]] became the highest-scoring American ace of the war with six victories. RIO Jerry Feinstein became the last USAF ace of the war on [[13 October]] 1972. On [[31 January]] 1972, 170th TFS/183rd TFG of [[Illinois Air National Guard]] became the first [[United States National Guard|Air National Guard]] unit to transition to Phantoms. The ANG service lasted until [[31 March]] 1990, when the Phantom was replaced by the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]. Then, on [[15 August]] 1990, 24 F-4G [[Wild Weasel]] Vs and 6 RF-4Cs were mobilized to the Middle East for [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]]. The reason for this revival was that the F-4G was the only [[SEAD]] aircraft in the USAF inventory with no [[F-15 Eagle|F-15]], F-16, or F/A-18 equipped for that role and the [[General Dynamics F-111|EF-111 Raven]] lacking the offensive capability of [[AGM-88 HARM]] missiles. The RF-4C was the only aircraft equipped with the ultra-long-range KS-127 LOROP (long-range oblique photography) camera. In spite of flying almost daily missions, only one RF-4C was lost in a fatal accident before the start of hostilities. One F-4G was lost when enemy fire  damaged the fuel tanks and the aircraft ran out of fuel near a friendly airbase. The last USAF Phantoms, F-4G Wild Weasel Vs from [[561st Fighter Squadron]], were retired on [[26 March]] 1996. Like the Navy, the Air Force continues to operate QF-4 target drones. The Collings Foundation operates a restored F-4D [[warbird]] which performs at airshows (Donald 2002).

In air combat, Phantom's greatest advantage was its excellent thrust which permitted a skilled pilot to engage and disengage from the fight at will. Not surprisingly, the massive aircraft lacked the agility of its Soviet opponents. Although the F-4 proved somewhat liable to enter spins during high-G and high angle of attack maneuvers, pilots reported the aircraft to be very communicative and easy fly on the edge of its performance envelope (Higham 1978). The J79 engines produced copious amounts of black smoke at military power which made the Phantoms easy to detect and visually track from a distance. By far, the biggest weakness of the F-4 was its lack of cannon armament. The US military doctrine at the time dictated that turning combat would be impossible at supersonic speeds and no effort was made to teach pilots [[air combat maneuvering]]. In reality, engagements quickly reduced the speed below the sound barrier and the early missiles were inaccurate and unreliable. [[Rules of engagement]] precluded long-range missile attacks and many pilots found themselves on the tail of enemy aircraft but too close to fire missiles. It did not take long for USAF F-4Cs to begin carrying [[SUU-16]] and [[SUU-23]] external gunpods containing a 20 mm [[M61 Vulcan]] gatling cannon. Combat trials demonstrated that while the externally mounted cannon was inaccurate, the cost of ammunition expended per shot down enemy aircraft was a small fraction of the missiles. The aircraft also gained the ability to strafe ground targets. The lack of cannon was definitively addressed with F-4E.

The Phantom was used by both [[Thunderbirds (squadron)|Thunderbirds]] (F-4E) and [[Blue Angels]] (F-4J) demonstration teams.

===Phantom in foreign service===
The F-4E and other variants have served with the air forces of many countries, including [[Australia]], [[Egypt]], [[Greece]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], [[Spain]], [[South Korea]], [[Turkey]], and [[West Germany]]. 

[[Israel Air Force]] Phantoms saw extensive combat during [[Arab-Israeli conflict]]s with 116 claimed victories to 55 losses, including ground fire. Nicknamed '''Kurnass''' (Sledgehammer), Israeli Phantoms undewent an extensive modification program to adapt them for local weapons and avionics. In 1980s, Israel began the '''Kurnass 2000''' modernization program which significantly updated avionics and added capability for [[AGM-142 Popeye]] missiles. Kurnass 2000 aircraft can be recognized by small strakes above air intakes and a &quot;probe-and-drogue&quot; boom plumbed into the boom receptacle on the spine of the aircraft. Israel also created a [[Pratt &amp; Whitney PW1120]]-engined version which first flew on [[30 July]] [[1986]]. The aircraft was capable of [[supercruise]], had 17% better thrust-to-weight ratio, 15% better sustained turn rate, 36% greater climb rate, and 27% better acceleration, all with improved fuel efficiency. The aircraft was demonstrated at the 1987 [[Paris Air Show]] but the project was deemed too expensive for the aging airframes.

A similar upgrade called '''Terminator 2020''' which is optimised for ground attack and unable to fire the AIM-120 AMRAAM, has also been implemented by IAI on Turkish Air Force Phantoms. It includes an advanced ELTA SPS-100 [[fire-control system]]/[[radar]], adopted from the abortive [[IAI Lavi]] technology demonstrator of the early 1990s.

The German [[Luftwaffe]] originally received the lightened and simplified F-4F with a smaller radar and no mid-air refueling or AIM-7 Sparrow capability. In [[1983 in aviation|1983]], Germany initiated the '''ICE''' (Improved Combat Efficiency) program which outfitted F-4Fs with the same [[AN/APG-65]] radar as in F/A-18, the ability to carry [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]] missiles, and smokeless engines.

The [[Hellenic Air Force]] upgraded its F-4 following the steps of the &quot;ICE&quot; program. The upgrade program includes an [[AN/APG-65]]GY radar, [[Honeywell]] H-764G navigation system which is a combination of laser [[inertial navigation system]] (LINS), [[global positioning system]] (GPS), and [[Elbit Systems]] Modular Multi-Role Computer (MMRC), the [[LITENING targeting pod]], and the ability to carry [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]] missiles and the [[AGM-130]] stand-off weapon.

The [[United Kingdom]] bought the F-4 for use with the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[Fleet Air Arm]] in the wake of the cancellation of home-grown projects such as the [[BAC TSR-2]]. British versions were based on the USN F-4J and were given the designation F-4K and F-4M respectively. They would enter service as the FG.1 and FGR.2. replacing the [[Hawker Hunter]] and [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]. They were fitted with the larger and more powerful [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] [[turbofan]] engines for improved take-off performance. The larger engine required much more air than on other F-4 variants, which improved performance at low-level but compromised it in thinner air at high altitudes, and the airframe development needed to accomodate these changes was plagued by problems. The Fleet Air Arm Phantoms were fitted with a double-telescoping front landing gear strut which could extend 40 in (102 cm), the increased [[angle of attack]] being necessary for catapult launches from the smaller British carrier [[HMS Ark Royal (R09)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']]. Some elements of the airframe and equipment were built in the UK. The Fleet Air Arm order was cut down with the cutting back of the [[Royal Navy]] carrier force, the majority of the 160 UK Phantoms that would be built operating with the RAF in ground attack and long range interception. In the late [[1970s]] RAF Phantoms were replaced by the [[SEPECAT Jaguar]] for ground attack roles and the FAA Phantoms disbanded and given over to the RAF. In addition to these, in [[1984]], the RAF purchased a total of 15 F-4J aircraft second-hand from the [[US Navy]] to increase its interceptor force following the [[Falklands War]] (a Phantom squadron was posted to the islands after the hostilities). The Phantom was replaced in British service by the [[Panavia Tornado]] [[RAF Tornado F3|F3]] air defence variant. The [[United Kingdom|UK]] retired its last Phantoms in [[1993 in aviation|1993]] as a result of the [[Options for Change]] spending cuts (Donald 2002).

===Phantom nicknames===
[[image:F-4 parts distribution.jpg|thumb|A German F-4F at an airshow labeled &quot;World's Largest Distributor of MiG Parts.&quot;]]
Either devoutly loved or passionately hated by those who flew it and worked on it, the Phantom gathered a number of nicknames during its illustrious career. It was the &quot;Rhino&quot; because of the long nose and tough [[titanium]] construction, the &quot;Double Ugly&quot; and &quot;DUFF&quot; in reference to its [[dihedral]] wings and [[anhedral]] tail as well as its two crew members, the &quot;World's Leading Distributor of MiG Parts&quot; in tribute to its record of downing 277 [[MiG]] aircraft in US service and additional 116 with Israel, the &quot;Flying Anvil&quot;, the &quot;Big Iron Sled&quot;, and the &quot;Louisville Slugger.&quot; German Luftwaffe crews called their F-4s the &quot;Eisensau&quot; (Iron sow), &quot;Fliegender Ziegelstein&quot; (Flying brick), and &quot;Luftverteidigungsdiesel&quot; (Air defence diesel). Imitating the spelling of the aircraft's name, fans of the F-4 (&quot;Phantom Phanatics&quot;) call it the &quot;Phabulous Phantom.&quot; Ground crews who worked on the aircraft are known as &quot;Phantom Phixers.&quot;

===The Spook===
[[image:Spook_1000.jpg|frame|A patch depicting the Spook]]
As famous as the aircraft itself is its emblem, a whimsical cartoon ghost called '''The Spook'''. It was created by a McDonnell Douglas technical artist Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Wong for shoulder patches. The name was coined by the crews of either [[12th Tactical Fighter Wing]] or [[4453rd Combat Crew Training Wing]] at [[MacDill AFB]]. The figure is ubiquitous, appearing on every imaginable item associated with the F-4. Spook has followed the Phantom around the world adopting local fashions. For example, the British Spook sometimes wears a bowler hat and carries a pipe.

==F-4s in fiction==
In the comic strip ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'', there is a Sunday strip where Calvin experiences technical problems (for example a [[undercarriage|landing gear]] malfunction) while piloting an F-4 Phantom. In reality, he is trying to assemble a [[model airplane|model]] of an F-4 and not doing very well at it. The technical difficulties in his [[daydream]] reflected difficulties in assembling the model, such as being unable to see through the canopy due to smeared [[glue]].

The F-4 made movie appearances in ''[[The Great Santini]]'', ''[[Red Flag]]'', ''[[Iron Eagle II]]'', ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', and ''[[Hamburger Hill]]'' (where F-4E's from [[Clark Air Base]] in the Philippines were used during the shooting of the napalm scene from the movie in 1987).

The F-4E was also seen as the [[Aerialbot]] Fireflight in the cartoon ''[[The Transformers]]''. In the anime series [[Area 88]], The Royal Asranian Air Force employs several F-4Js in service with its mercenary corps. The F-4 is also featured in the [[Namco]] games [[Ace Combat 4: Shattered Skies]] and [[Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War]], and it was also featured in the game [[Flight of the Intruder]] along with the [[A-6 Intruder]]. The aircraft is a player flyable option in the [[flight simulator]]s [[Jane's USAF]] and [[Jane's IAF]], and was seen in [[Magnum P.I.]] as a [[Russia]]n fighter.

The [[McDonnell Aircraft Corporation|McDonnell]] '''FH-1 Phantom''' was a twin-engine jet [[fighter aircraft]] designed during [[World War II]] for the [[United States Navy]].  On [[July 21]], [[1946]], a Phantom became the first combat jet aircraft to operate from an American [[aircraft carrier]], the [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']].

In early [[1943]], the McDonnell was invited by the U.S. Navy to co-operate in the development of a shipboard jet fighter, using an engine from the set turbojets under development by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Three prototypes were ordered on August 30, 1943 and the designation '''XFD-1''' was assigned. Then, after evaluating a number of engine combinations, from using eight 9.5 inch (241 mm) diameter engines down to two engines of 19 inch (483 mm) diameter, a selection using the two 19 inch (483 mm) engines was found to be the lightest and simplest configuration. 

An aircraft design with the engines buried in the wing root was selected to keep intake and exhaust ducts short, an arrangement that offered greater aerodynamic efficiency than underwing nacelles. Provisions for four 0.5 in (12.7 mm) machine guns were made in the nose. 

When the first XFD-1 was completed in January 1945 only one Westinghouse 19XB-2B engine was available for installation. Ground runs and taxi test were conducted with the single engine, and such was the confidence in the aircraft that the first flight on January 26, 1945 was made with only the one turbojet engine. With successful completion of tests, a production contract was awarded on March 7, [[1945]] for one hundred '''FD-1''' aircraft. Later the designation was changed to '''FH-1''' as the manufacturer’s letter “D” had already been assigned to the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]]. (22 years later, long after the last FH had been delivered, McDonnell and Douglas would merge to form McDonnell Douglas).

With the end of the war the number under contract was reduced to 60 aircraft and the first production aircraft was delivered in January 1947.

'''Fricatives''' (or '''spirants''') are [[consonant]]s produced by forcing air through a narrow channel made by placing two articulators close together. These are the lower lip against the upper teeth in the case of {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;f&amp;nbsp;]}}, or the back of the tongue against the soft palate in the case of German {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;]}}, the final consonant of ''Bach''.  This turbulent airflow is called '''frication'''.  A particular subset of fricatives are the '''[[sibilant]]s''' (sometimes referred to as '''stridents'''). When forming a sibilant, one still is forcing air through a narrow channel, but in addition the tongue is curled lengthwise to direct the air over the edge of the teeth.  English {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;s&amp;nbsp;]}}, {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;z&amp;nbsp;]}}, {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;ʃ&amp;nbsp;]}}, and {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;ʒ&amp;nbsp;]}} are examples of this.  

===Sibilant fricatives===

* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;s&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiceless alveolar fricative|voiceless coronal sibilant]] 
* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;z&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiced alveolar fricative|voiced coronal sibilant]] 
* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;s’&amp;nbsp;]}} [[alveolar ejective fricative|ejective coronal sibilant]] 
* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;s̪&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiceless dental sibilant]] 
* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;z̪&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiced dental sibilant]] 
* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;s̠&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiceless postalveolar fricative|voiceless postalveolar sibilant]] (laminal)
* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;z̠&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiced postalveolar fricative|voiced postalveolar sibilant]] (laminal)
* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;ʃ&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiceless postalveolar fricative|voiceless palato-alveolar sibilant]] (domed, partially palatalized)
* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;ʒ&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiced postalveolar fricative|voiced palato-alveolar sibilant]] (domed, partially palatalized)
* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;ɕ&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiceless alveolo-palatal fricative|voiceless alveolo-palatal sibilant]] (laminal, palatalized)
* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;ʑ&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiced alveolo-palatal fricative|voiced alveolo-palatal sibilant]] (laminal, palatalized)
* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;ʂ&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiceless retroflex fricative|voiceless retroflex sibilant]] (apical or sub-apical)
* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;ʐ&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiced retroflex fricative|voiced retroflex sibilant]] (apical or sub-apical)

All sibilants are [[coronal consonant|coronal]], but may be [[dental consonant|dental]], [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]], [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]], or [[palatal consonant|palatal]] ([[retroflex consonant|retroflex]]) within that range. However, at the postalveolar place of articulation the tongue may take several shapes: domed, [[laminal consonant|laminal]], or [[apical consonant|apical]], and each of these is given a separate symbol and a separate name. Prototypical retroflexes are [[sub-apical consonant|sub-apical]] and palatal, but they are usually written with the same symbol as the apical postalveolars. The alveolars and dentals may also be either apical or laminal, but this difference is indicated with diacritics rather than with separate symbols.

===Central non-sibilant fricatives===

* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;ħ&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]]
* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;ʜ&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiceless epiglottal fricative]]

===Lateral fricatives===
* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;ɬ&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiceless alveolar lateral fricative|voiceless coronal lateral fricative]]
* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;ɮ&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiced alveolar lateral fricative|voiced coronal lateral fricative]]
* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;ɬ̢&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiceless retroflex lateral fricative]]  
* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;ʎ̥&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiceless palatal lateral fricative]] (needs a raising diacritic)
* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;ʟ̝̊&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiceless velar lateral fricative]]

===Symbols used for both fricatives and approximants===

* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;ʁ&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiced uvular fricative]] 
* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;ʕ&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiced pharyngeal fricative]]
* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;ʢ&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiced epiglottal fricative]]

No language distinguishes voiced fricatives from approximants at these places, so the same symbol is used for both. For the pharyngeals and epiglottals, approximants are more numerous than fricatives. A fricative realization may be specified by adding the [[raised (phonetics)|uptack]] to the letters, {{IPA|[ʁ̝, ʕ̝, ʢ̝]}}. Likewise, the [[lowered (phonetics)|downtack]] may be added to specify an approximant realization, {{IPA|[ʁ̞, ʕ̞, ʢ̞]}}.

===Pseudo-fricatives===

* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;h&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiceless glottal fricative|voiceless glottal transition]]
* {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;ɦ&amp;nbsp;]}} [[voiced glottal fricative|breathy-voiced glottal transition]] 

The glottal &quot;fricatives&quot; are actually unaccompanied [[phonation]] states of the glottis, without any accompanying manner, fricative or otherwise. However, they are called fricatives for historical reasons. 

In addition, {{IPA|[&amp;#653;]}} is usually called a &quot;[[voiceless labial-velar fricative]]&quot;, but it is actually an approximant. True doubly-articulated fricatives do not appear to occur in any language.

==Languages==
See [[table of consonants]] for a table of fricatives in English.

[[Ubykh language|Ubykh]] may be the language with the most fricatives, with 27, some of which do not have symbols or diacritics in the IPA. This number actually outstrips the number of all consonants in English (which has 24 consonants). By contrast, many languages have no phonemic fricatives at all, and this is a common feature of many [[Australian Aboriginal languages]].

[[Image:Frost on window.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Frost on window]]
'''Frost''', like [[snow]], is the result of [[deposition (meteorology)|deposition]] of [[water vapor]] in [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] air. If solid surfaces in contact with the air are chilled below the deposition point (see [[dew point|frost point]]), then [[spicule]]s of [[ice]] grow out from the solid surface. The size of the [[crystal]]s depends on time and the amount of [[water vapor]] available.

Frost is often observed around cracks in wooden sidewalks due to the moist air escaping from the ground below. Other objects on which frost develops are those with low [[specific heat]] and high [[thermal emissivity]], such as blackened metals; hence the accumulation of frost on the heads of rusty nails. The apparently erratic occurrence of frost in adjacent localities is due partly to differences of elevation, the lower areas becoming colder on calm nights. It is also affected by differences in [[absorbtivity]] and specific heat of the ground which in the absence of wind greatly influences the temperature attained by the [[superincumbent]] air. The formation of white frost on the indoor surface of window panes indicates low [[relative humidity]] of the indoor air, otherwise water would first [[condensation|condense]] in small droplets and then freeze into clear ice.

Because cold air is more dense than warm air, and forms close to the ground, in calm weather cold air pools at ground level. This is known as surface temperature inversion.  It explains why frost is more common and extensive in low-lying areas such as valleys and hollows.  Areas where frost forms due to cold air trapped against the ground or against a solid barrier such as a wall are known as &quot;frost pockets&quot;.  Frost can form in these areas even when the reported temperature is above the freezing point of water.  

Vegetation will not necessarily be damaged on a night where the air cools the leaves of plants below their freezing point.  In the absence of a site nucleating the formation of ice crystals, the leaves remain in a [[supercooled]] liquid state, safely reaching temperatures of -4 &amp;deg;C to -12 &amp;deg;C.  However, once frost forms, the leaf [[cell (biology)|cell]]s may be damaged by sharp ice crystals.  Certain [[bacterium|bacteria]] are particularly effective at triggering frost formation, raising the nucleation temperature to about -1 &amp;deg;C.  In the absence of these &quot;ice-nucleating&quot; bacteria, frost damage can be greatly reduced.

'''Ferdinand Magellan''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Fernão de Magalhães'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA pronunciation]]: /{{IPA|fɨɾ.'nɐ̃w̃ dɨ mɐ.ɣɐ.'ʎɐ̃j̃ʃ}}/; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Fernando'' or ''Hernando de Magallanes''; Spring [[1480]]&amp;ndash;[[April 27]], [[1521]]) was a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[List of maritime explorers|maritime explorer]] who led the first successful attempt to [[Circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] the Earth. Magellan himself did not complete his final voyage; he was killed during the [[Battle of Mactan]] in the [[Philippines]]. He did, however, die further west than the [[Spice Islands]], which he had visited on earlier voyages, making him one of the first individuals to cross all the [[Longitude|longitudes]] of the globe. He became the first person to lead an expedition sailing westward from [[Europe]] to [[Asia]] and to cross the [[Pacific Ocean]].

Of the 250 or so crew members who set out with Magellan to circumnavigate the globe, only 18 managed to return to Spain and thereby complete the circumnavigation. They were led by Spaniard [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], who took over command of the expedition after Magellan's death.

==Early life==
Magellan was born in [[Sabrosa]], near [[Vila Real]] in the province of [[Trás-os-Montes]], [[Portugal]]. He was the son of Alda de Mesquita and Pedro Rui de Magalhães, the mayor of the town. He had two siblings, an elder brother Diogo de Sousa (named after his grandmother) and a sister Isabel.

Magellan's parents died when he was ten. At 12, he followed his brother to become a page at the [[Noble court|court]] of [[John II of Portugal]] and Queen Eleonora in [[Lisbon]]. Here, alongside his cousin Francisco Serrano, Magellan continued his education and became interested in geography and astronomy. He may have been taught by [[Martin Behaim]]. In 1496, at age 16, Magellan became a [[squire]].

==First voyages==
Magellan's first voyage to sea came at age 25 in 1505 when he was sent to [[India]] to install [[Francisco de Almeida]] as the Portuguese [[viceroy]]. The voyage gave Magellan his first experience of battle, when a local king, who had paid tribute to da Gama three years earlier, refused to pay tribute to Almeida. Almedia's party attacked and conquered the capital of [[Kilwa]] in present-day [[Tanzania]].

In 1506, Magellan travelled to the [[East Indies]] and joined expeditions to the Spice Islands. In February [[1509]], he took part in the naval [[Battle of Diu]]&amp;ndash;which marked the decline of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] influence in the area &amp;ndash; and in 1510 he was made a [[captain]]. Within a year, however, he had lost his commission after sailing a ship eastward without permission. He was forced to return to Portugal.

In 1511, Magellan was sent to [[Morocco]], where he fought in the [[Battle of Azamor]] and received a severe knee wound. After taking leave without permission, he fell out of favor with Almeida, and was also accused of trading illegally with the [[Moors]]. Several of the accusations were subsequently dropped, but Magellan fell into disfavor at the court of the new king, [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]]. He refused to increase Magellan's pension and told him that there would be no further offers of employment after [[May 15]], [[1514]]. Magellan therefore decided to offer his services to the court of [[Spain]].

==Move to Spain==
Magellan arrived in [[Seville]], Spain's major port, on[October 20, 1517. From there he traveled to [[Valladolid]] to see the teenage Spanish king, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]] (later Charles V, [[Holy Roman Emperor]]). With the endorsement of friends such as [[Diogo Barbosa]] (the Portuguese father of [[Duarte Barbosa]]) and Juan de Aranda, one of the three chief officials of Seville's [[Casa de Contratación|India House]], Magellan became a naturalized Spaniard. He soon acquired great influence, gaining the ear of Charles I and [[Juan Rodriguez de Fonseca]], bishop of [[Burgos]] and enemy of [[Christopher Columbus]].

Having revealed the Portuguese cartographical knowledge to the Spanish court, Magellan pointed out that there would exist some passage (that he thought would be the [[Río de la Plata]]) from [[South America]] to the Pacific Ocean, forming a large bay-like [[river delta]]. He decided to pioneer this route and reach the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]] (Spice Islands), the key to the strategic and tremendously lucrative spice trade. He allegedly declared himself ready to sail southward as far as 75° to realize his project.

Ruy Faleiro, an [[astronomer]] and Portuguese [[exile]], aided him in his planning, and he found an invaluable financial ally in Christopher de Haro, a member of a great [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]] firm who held a grudge against the king of Portugal. On March 22, 1518, Charles approved Magellan's plan and granted him generous funds. Under the contract, Magellan and Faleiro, as joint [[captain]]s-general, would receive one-twentieth of all profits, and they and their heirs would also gain the government of any lands discovered, with the title of ''[[Adelantado]]s''. Magellan also took an oath of allegiance in the church of Santa María de la Victoria de Triana, giving money to the monks of the monastery so they would pray for his success.

With the money that Magellan and Faleiro had received from the king, the pair obtained five ships: ''Trinidad'' (tonnage 110, crew 55), ''San Antonio'' (tonnage 120, crew 60), ''Concepción'' (tonnage 90, crew 45), [[Victoria (ship)|''Victoria'']] (tonnage 85, crew 42), and ''Santiago'' (tonnage 75, crew 32). The ''Trinidad'' was Magellan's [[flagship]], and besides Faleiro, the captains for the other four were Juan de Cartegena, Gomez, Gaspar de Quesada and Luis de Mendoza, respectively.

==The journey==
[[Image:AndalusAndMorocco.jpg|100px|thumb|left|The arrow points to the city of [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]] on the delta of the [[Guadalquivir River]], in [[Andalusia]]]] 
 
On August 10, 1519, five ships under Magellan's command left Seville and traveled from the [[Guadalquivir|Guadalquivir River]] to San Lucar de Barrameda at the mouth of the rivers, where they remained more than five weeks. Spanish authorities were wary of the Portuguese [[admiral]] and almost prevented Magellan from sailing, but on September 20, Magellan set sail from Sanlúcar de Barrameda with about 270 men.

===The voyage===
King Manuel ordered a naval detachment to pursue Ferdinand Magellan, but Magellan avoided the Portuguese. After stopping at the [[Canary Islands]], Ferdinand Magellan arrived at the [[Cape Verde]] Islands, where they set course for Cape St. Augustine in [[Brazil]]. On November 20, they crossed the [[equator]]; on December 6, the crew sighted Brazil.

Since Brazil was Portuguese territory, Magellan avoided it, and on December 13 anchored near present-day [[Rio de Janeiro]]. There the crew was resupplied, but these good conditions caused them to delay. Afterwards, they continued to sail south along [[South America]]'s east coast, looking for the strait that Magellan believed would lead to the Spice Islands. The fleet reached Río de la Plata on January 10, 1520.

On March 31, the crew established a settlement that they called Puerto San Julian. A mutiny involving two of the five ship captains broke out. It was unsuccessful because the crew remained loyal. Quesada was executed; Cartagena and a [[priest]] were [[Marooning|marooned]] on the coast.

The latter can only take short-range air-to-air missiles, while the [[Storm Shadow]] and Joint Air to Surface Stand-off Missile (JASSM) cruise missiles can be carried in addition to the stores already integrated.

The '''F-16 Fighting Falcon''' is a modern multi-role [[jet]] [[fighter aircraft]] built in the [[United States]]. Designed as a lightweight fighter, it evolved into a successful multi-role aircraft. The F-16 was developed by [[General Dynamics]]. In 1993 General Dynamics sold its aircraft manufacturing business to the [[Lockheed Corporation]], now [[Lockheed Martin]]. The Falcon's versatility is a paramount reason it was a success on the export market, and is serving 24 countries. It is the largest and probably most significant Western fighter program, with over 4000 aircraft built. Though no longer produced for the [[United States Air Force]], it is still produced for export.  The F-16 is one of the most famous fighters in the world, with a rakish silhouette and a fearsome reputation.

The Fighting Falcon is regarded as a superb dogfighter, with innovations such as the bubble canopy, side-mounted control stick, and reclined seat. It was also the first US fighter aircraft to match the [[English Electric Lightning]]'s ability to execute 9 [[Gee|g]] turns. Although the F-16's official popular name is &quot;Fighting Falcon&quot;, it is known to its pilots as the &quot;Viper&quot;, the General Dynamics codename for the project during its early development.

==History==
===Development===
The F-16 originated in a set of specifications by the [[United States Department of Defense]]. The deficiencies of the [[F-4 Phantom II]] in aerial combat in the [[Vietnam War]], particularly at close ranges, shaped the specifications for the [[F-15 Eagle]]. An informal and influential group nicknamed the &quot;Fighter Mafia&quot;, among them systems analyst [[Pierre Sprey]], test pilot [[Charles E. Meyers]], and former instructor pilot [[John Boyd (military strategist)|John Boyd]], believed the F-15 was a move in the wrong direction. They argued that the F-15 was too large and expensive. Designed as a fast interceptor, it had a wide turn radius and was not well suited to close range dogfighting. The Fighter Mafia argued for a lighter fighter with superb maneuverability, that was cheap enough to deploy in numbers. These specifications became the [[Lightweight Fighter]] (LWF) program, begun in 1971.

The LWF specified a plane weighing 20,000 pounds (9,000 kg), half the weight of the F-15, stressing low cost, small size, range, and emphasising maneuverability &amp;mdash; turn rate and acceleration &amp;mdash; at the expense of top speed. Its ideal operating environment was intended to be under Mach 1.6 and 40,000 feet (12,000 m). Two companies were chosen during the concept stage: [[General Dynamics]] with the '''YF-16''' design and [[Northrop]] with a design which bore the name [[YF-17 Cobra]]. 

The LWF faced significant opposition in the Air Force because it was seen as competition to the F-15, the Air Force's premier fighter program. To head off opposition the project was redesignated Air Combat Fighter (ACF). At this time, [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Norway]] were seeking a replacement for their [[F-104 Starfighter]]s, and formed the [[Multinational Fighter Program Group]] to choose a replacement. Both ACF aircraft were in consideration, as well as the [[Dassault Mirage F1]] and the [[Saab Viggen]]. Also during this time, the Navy was looking for a low-cost alternative to the [[F-14 Tomcat]], a similarly expensive, costly interceptor as the F-15, in a program called [[VFAX]]. Congress directed the Navy to use the same aircraft as the ACF programme. As the VFAX was envisioned to be a multi-role aircraft, this requirement made it into the ACF specifications as well, staving off direct competition with the F-15 as it was pitched to be a counterpart.

The first flight of the YF-16 prototype was in 1974. The first prototype was powered by the Pratt &amp; Whitney F100-PW-100 turbofan engine also used on early versions of the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle. On January 13, 1975, the Air Force chose the YF-16 as the winner of the ACF competition as it gave superior performances across the board and promised to be cheaper to procure and maintain. It used the same engine as the F-15, which F-15 supporters believed would help their program. There were also political concerns with keeping General Dynamics in business after the end of the [[General Dynamics F-111|F-111]] program. The [[US Navy]] chose to have the YF-17 design developed into the [[F/A-18]] because it offered twin-engined reliability, then viewed as essential for over-water operations.

The plane was offered to NATO members, and made an appearance at the 1975 [[Paris Air Show]]. The MFPG nations agreed to purchase 348 planes, with final assembly to take place in Belgium (SABCA), The Netherlands (FOKKER) and various parts subcontracted among them.

==Production==
Initially, the F-16 was manufactured in two models: &quot;A&quot; (single-seat combat version) and &quot;B&quot; (combat-capable two-seat trainer). The F-16A first took flight in December [[1976 in aviation|1976]] and was first delivered to the [[388th Tactical Fighter Wing]] in January 1979. In the same month, they were delivered to the Belgian Air Force. The F-16 is the first American fighter to be concurrently deployed domestically and abroad. The B model is a trainer version with an extended canopy to accommodate a second pilot, also reducing fuel and avionics growth space. Typically the student pilot sits in the front cockpit with the instructor pilot behind.

In the 1980s, the F-16A/B was superseded by the F-16C/D with improved avionics and engine. The F-16 has been continually upgraded throughout its production history; block designations reflect significant upgrades and are outlined below. The empty weight of F-16 grew from 15,600 pounds (Block 10 F-16A) to 19,200 (Block 50 F-16C). 

=== Combat service ===
[[Image:F-16C01.jpg|thumb|350px|F-16 with a full weapons load. 
]]
Due to their ubiquity, the F-16s have participated in numerous conflicts, most of them in the [[Middle East]]. In [[1981 in aviation|1981]], 4 [[Israel]]i F-16s participated in a raid that destroyed [[Osiraq]], an [[Iraq|Iraqi]] [[nuclear reactor]] near [[Baghdad]]. During the same year, the [[Israeli Air Force]] obtained the first shot downs for the entire F-16 series, shooting down a [[Syrian]] [[Mi-8]] [[helicopter]] and a [[MiG-21]] jet. The following year, during [[Operation Peace for Galilee]] ([[1982 Lebanon War|Lebanon War]]) Israeli F-16s engaged on numerous occasions with [[Syrian]] aircraft, ending up victorious at all times but one. F-16s were also used afterwards in their ground-attack role for strikes against targets in [[Lebanon]]. In the [[Gulf War]] of [[1991 in aviation|1991]], F-16 from the air forces of the [[Coalition]] participated in the strikes against Iraq.

The Air Force primarily operates Block 40/42 and 50/52 F-16C's on active duty, while most Block 25 and 30/32 airframes have been moved to the [[Air National Guard]] and the Air Force Reserve.

The [[F-35_Joint_Strike_Fighter|F-35]] &quot;Joint Strike Fighter&quot; is the F-16's intended replacement, possessing slightly improved performance and most importantly, stealth technology, which will enhance its survivability in the modern battlespace.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

==Design characteristics==
The F-16 is a single engine, multi-mission tactical aircraft. It is equipped with an [[M61 Vulcan]] cannon in the left wing root, and can be equipped with air-to-air missiles. However, the F-16 can also perform ground-support tasks if necessary. For that task, it can be equipped with a large variety of missiles or bombs.

From the very beginning, the F-16 was intended to be a cost-effective &quot;workhorse,&quot; that could perform various kinds of missions and maintain around-the-clock readiness. It is much simpler and lighter than its predecessors, but uses advanced [[aerodynamics]] and [[avionics]] (including the first use of [[Aircraft_flight_control_systems#Fly-by-wire|fly-by-wire]], earning it the nickname of &quot;the electric jet&quot;) to maintain good performance.

[[Image:F-16 CJ Fighting Falcon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|F-16C Fighting Falcon]]

===Ergonomics and visibility===
The pilot sits high in the [[fuselage]] with the canopy support-bow behind him, out of his line of view. This and the bubble canopy give the pilot an unobstructed field of view, a feature vital during air-to-air combat. The seat is reclined 30 degrees instead of the usual 13, the myth being to improve pilot G tolerance. In fact, the seat is reclined further back to fit the seat into such a low, narrow (originally radar-less) nose. If the seat was not reclined the front fuselage would have to be much higher. The control stick is mounted on the right armrest rather than between the legs as is traditional, to aid in maneuvering during high-g turns. In addition, a holographic [[Head-Up Display]] displays vital information in the pilot's field of view.

===Fly by wire===
The F-16 uses computerized [[Aircraft_flight_control_systems#Fly-by-wire|fly-by-wire]] and has no physical linkages between the control stick and the flight surfaces.  Computer control is necessary for flight as a result of the inherent negative stability of the aircraft, a trait which trades stable flight for increased maneuverability.

This lack of physical linkages between the control stick and the flight surfaces led to an unusual characteristic in the design of the control stick: originally, it did not move.  The control stick instead detected pressure applied by the pilot and translated that pressure into control of the aircraft.  This arrangement proved uncomfortable and difficult for pilots to adjust to, so the control stick was given a small amount (less than a quarter of an inch in any direction) of play.

The onboard computer makes thousands of calculations and corrections each second to keep the plane flying, freeing pilots to concentrate on tasks necessary to fulfill their intended role.  The enhanced computer oversight also provides automatic flight coordination, utilizing all control surfaces (including the rudder) to keep the aircraft from entering performance hurting or even potentially dangerous situations such as unintentional [[Slip (aerodynamic)|slip]]s or [[Skid (aerodynamic)|skid]]s.

Early critics of the F-16 felt that the completely electronic control system would dramatically decrease safety, but a predicted rash of fly-by-wire based accidents has not materialized.

===Negative static stability===
An aircraft with negative static stability will, in the absence of control input, depart from level and controlled flight. Most aircraft are designed with positive static stability, where a plane tends to return to its original attitude following a disturbance. However, positive static stability hampers maneuverability, as the tendency to remain in its current attitude opposes the pilot's effort to maneuver, and so a plane with negative static stability will be more maneuverable. With a fly-by-wire system, such a plane can be kept in stable flight, its instability kept in check by the flight computers.

The YF-16 was the world's first aircraft to be slightly aerodynamically unstable by design. This feature is officially called &quot;relaxed static stability&quot;. Subsonic, the aeroplane is constantly on the verge of going out of control. This tendency is constantly caught and corrected by the DFLCC (Digital Flight Control Computer), allowing for stable flight. When supersonic, the airplane exhibits positive static stability due to aerodynamic forces acting on the strake section of the wing.

==Versions==
F-16 models are denoted by sequential block numbers to denote significant upgrades. The blocks cover both single and two-seater versions. An intricate [[Multinational Staged Improvement Program]] was instituted to gradually upgrade the F-16 and retroactively implement the upgrades in delivered aircraft.

===F-16 A/B===
The F-16 A/B was initially equipped with the [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] [[AN/APG-66]] [[Pulse-doppler radar]], [[Pratt &amp; Whitney F100|Pratt &amp; Whitney F100-PW-200]] turbofan, rated at 14,670 lbf (64.9 kN), 23,830 lbf (106.0 kN) with afterburner. The USAF bought 674 F-16A's and 121 F-16B's, with delivery completed in March 1985.

*'''Blocks 1''' &lt;br&gt; Early blocks (Block 1/5/10) with relatively minor differences between each. Most were later upgraded to the Block 10 configuration in the early 80's. There were 94 Block 1, 197 Block 5, and 312 Block 10 aircraft produced.  Block 1 is the early production model with the nose cone painted black.

*'''Block 5''' &lt;br&gt; It was discovered that the black nose cone became an obvious visual identification at long range for the Block 1 aircraft, so the color of the nose cone is consequently changed to the low visibility grey for Block 5 aircraft.  During the operation of F-16 Block 1, it was discovered that the rain water had accumulated in certain spots within the fuselage, so drainage holes were drilled in the forward fuselage and tail fin area for Block 5 aircraft.

*'''Block 10''' &lt;br&gt; The Soviet Union significantly reduced the export of titanium during the late 1970's, so manufacturers of the F-16 used aluminium instead.  New methods were also used:  the corrugated aluminium is bolted to the epoxy surface for Block 10 aircraft, replacing the old method of aluminium honeycomb being glued to the epoxy surface used in earlier aircraft.

*'''Block 15''' &lt;br&gt; The first major change in the F-16, the Block 15 aircraft featured larger horizontal stabilizers, the addition of two hardpoints to the chin inlet, improved [[AN/APG-66]] radar, increased capacity of underwing hardpoints. The F-16 gained the [[Have Quick II]] secure [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] radio. To counter the additional weight of the new hardpoints, the horizontal stabilizers were enlarged by 30%. Block 15 is the most numerous variant of the F-16, with 983 produced. The last one was delivered in 1996 to Thailand.

*'''Block 15 OCU''' &lt;br&gt; From 1987 Block 15 aircraft were delivered to the Operational Capability Upgrade (OCU) standard, which featured improved F100-PW-220 turbofans with digital control interface, the ability to fire the [[AGM-65]], [[AMRAAM]], and [[AGM-119 Penguin]] missiles, countermeasures and cockpit upgrades, improved computers and data bus. Its maximum takeoff weight increased to 37,500 lb (17,000 kg). 214 aircraft received this upgrade, as well as some Block 10 aircraft, retroactively.

* '''Block 20''' &lt;br&gt; 150 Block 15 OCU's for Taiwan with the addition of most of the F-16 C/D capability:  carriage of [[AGM-45 Shrike]], [[AGM-84 Harpoon]], [[AGM-88 HARM]], and the[[LANTIRN]] pod.  The computers onboard Block 20 is siginificantly improved in comparison to the earlier versions, with the overall processing speed increased 740 times and the overall memory storage increased 180 times in comparison to that of Block 15 OCU.

===F-16 C/D===
* '''Block 25'''&lt;br&gt;The Block 25 F-16C first flew in June 1984 and entered USAF service in September. The aircraft are fitted with the Westinghouse [[AN/APG-68]] radar, have a precision night attack capability and are fitted with the [[Pratt &amp; Whitney F100|Pratt &amp; Whitney F100-PW-220E]] turbofan, with digital control interface. The USAF is the sole user of this variant, with 209 models delivered.

* '''Block 30/32''' &lt;br&gt;The first aircraft subject to the Alternative Fighter Engine project under which aircraft could be fitted with the traditional Pratt &amp; Whitney engines or for the first time the [[General Electric F110]]. Blocks ending in 0 are powered by GE, blocks ending in 2 are fitted with [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]] engines. &lt;br&gt; The first Block 30 F-16 entered service in 1987. Major differences include the carriage of the [[AGM-45 Shrike]] and [[AGM-88 HARM]] missiles. From Block 30D aircraft were fitted with enlarged inlets for the increased thrust GE engine, Block 32s were not modified in this way. 733 were produced and delivered to six countries.

* '''Block 40/42 (F-16 CG/DG) ''' &lt;br&gt;Entering service in 1988, the Block 40/42 is the improved all-day/all-weather strike variant with [[LANTIRN]] pod, the night capability gives rise to the name &quot;Night Falcons&quot;. The block features strengthened and lengthened undercarriage for [[LANTIRN]] pods, improved radar, and a GPS receiver. From 2002 the Block 40/42 increases the weapon range available to the aircraft including [[JDAM]], [[JSOW]], [[WCMD]] and the (Enhanced) EGBU-27. Also incorporated in this block was the addition of ANVIS compatible lighting systems. The TCTO (Time Compliance Technical Order) that added the NVIS compatible systems was completed in 2004. 615 aircraft were delivered to 5 countries.

* '''Block 50/52 (F-16 CJ/DJ)''' &lt;br&gt;Block 50/52 was first delivered in late 1991, the aircraft are equipped with improved [[GPS]]/[[INS]]. All aircraft feature helmet-mounted-cueing allowing off-boresight air-to-air missile firing. The aircraft can carry a further batch of advanced missiles; the [[AGM-84 Harpoon]] missile, JDAM, JSOW and WCMD. Block 50 aircraft are powered by the F110-GE-129 while the Block 52 jets use the F100-PW-229.

* '''Block 50D/52D Wild Weasel''' An advanced [[SEAD|Suppression of Enemy Air Defences]] &quot;[[Wild Weasel]]&quot; capability is provided by the AN/ASQ-213 HARM Targeting System (HTS), allowing greater range and more precision by utilizing the known range mode of the HARM. It can carry the ALQ-119 Electronic Jamming Pod for self protection. With the retirement of the F-4G Wild Weasel, the 50/52D is now the sole provider of SEAD missions.

* '''Block 50/52 Plus''' &lt;br&gt; These aircraft are fitted with the latest avionics (including the [[ALE-50 Towed Decoy System]]) and provisions for [[Conformal Fuel Tanks]] (CFTs). The Greek Air Force ordered this version with the CFTs.  All two-seat &quot;Plus&quot; airframes include the enlarged Avionics Dorsal Spine which adds 30 cubic feet (850 L) to the airframe for more avionics with only small increases in weight and drag.  This version is sometimes called F-16U and is the fundation of F-16 E/F Block 60.

*'''F-16I''' &lt;br&gt; Block 50/52 Plus for Israeli Defense Force - Air Force, with significant Israeli avionics replacing that of American firms (Such as Israeli Aerial Towed Decoy replacing the ALE-50).  The addition of Israeli built autonomous aerial combat maneuvering instrumentation systems enables the training exercises to be conducted without the dependence on the ground instrumentation systems, and the helmet mounted sight is also a standard equipmnet.  The F-16I also has the Israeli built removable conformal fuel tanks added. 

*'''F-16 CCIP''' &lt;br&gt;The Common Configuration Implementation Program seeks to standardise all Block 40/42/50/52 F-16s to 50/52 configuration for simplified training and maintenance.

===F-16 E/F===
* '''Block 60''' &lt;br&gt;Based on the F-16C/D, it features conformal fuel tanks and improved radar and avionics; it has only been sold to the [[United Arab Emirates]]. The General Electric F110-132 is a development of the -129 model and is rated at 32,500 lbf (144 kN). A major difference from previous Blocks is the [[Northrop Grumman]] [[APG-80]] Active Electronically Scanned Array ([[AESA]]) radar. Block 60 allows the carriage of all Block 50/52 aircraft-compatible weaponry as well as [[ASRAAM]] and the [[AGM-84E]] Standoff Land Attack Missile (SLAM). The CFTs provide an additional 450 US gallons (2,045 litres) of fuel allowing increased range or time on station. This has the added benefit of freeing up hardpoints for weapons, i.e. hardpoints that would have been occupied by underwing fuel tanks.  Theoretically, the aircraft could be purchased by the United States Air Force, but in practice the USAF has shown little interest in acquiring new F-16s given that it has an extensive &quot;boneyard&quot; fleet of the planes at the [[Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center]] and is planning to take delivery of the new [[F-35 Joint Strike Fighter]] by the end of the decade.&lt;br /&gt;
** A single-seat version of the [[F-16XL]] was to be designated F-16E, with the twin-seat variant designated F-16F.  This was sidelined by the Air Force's selection of the [[F-15E Strike Eagle]] in the 1980s Enhanced Tactical Fighter flyoff.

==Other variants==
* '''F-16/79''' - Modified export-version F-16A designed for use with the outdated [[J79]] turbojet engine in answer to President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s directive to curtail arms proliferation by selling only reduced capability weapons. However, numerous exceptions were made, and with the later relaxation of the policy under President Carter and cancellation under President [[Reagan]], no copies were ultimately sold.

* '''F-16/101''' - Modified F-16A designed for use with the [[General Electric F101]] turbofan engine from the [[B-1 Lancer|B-1A]] program. GE attempted to rework the engine for fighter usage, but it was never adopted for the F-16.  Data from the F-16/101 assisted in the development of the F110 turbofan.

* '''F-16ADF''' - upgraded Block 15 for United States [[Air National Guard]]'s fighter interception mission (hence the name Air Defense Fighter). Begun in 1989, 270 airframes were upgraded. Avionics were upgraded (including the addition of an IFF interrogator and bird slicing IFF antennas), and a spotlight fitted forward and below the cockpit, for night time identification. This was the only US version equipped with the AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile.  Beginning in 1994 these aircraft began to be replaced by newer F-16C variants.  By 2005 only the North Dakota ANG was flying this example.

* '''[http://www.israeli-weapons.com/weapons/aircraft/f-16i/F-16I.html F-16I]''' - a version with improved avionics, manufactured for [[Israel]]. Its avionics were significantly modified with Israeli components, and conformal fuel tanks fitted to increase its range. Initial orders were made in 1997 with the first deliveries in December 2003.

* '''[[Mitsubishi F-2|F-2A/B]](FS-X)''' - Indigenous F-16 inspired design produced in [[Japan]] by [[Mitsubishi|Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]], with cooperation from Lockheed Martin. It is larger and utilizes mainly Japanese avionics.

* '''[[F-16XL]]''' - a delta-wing version used by [[NASA]] for aeronautical research, once conceived of as a possible competitor for the [[Enhanced Tactical Fighter]] program, later won by the [[F-15E]].  If the F-16XL had gone into production, it would have been designated F-16E/F (single/twin seat).  Two examples were built, one single seat and one two-seat version.

* '''RF-16C/F-16R''' - [[reconnaissance]] version that carries the [[ATARS]] package.

* '''F-16 MLU''' - (Mid Life Update) An update of the F-16 A/B to the Block 20 standard for the Royal Netherlands Air Force, the Belgian Air Force, the Royal Danish Air Force, the Royal Norwegian Air Force and the Portuguese Air Force.

* '''F-16N''' - 22 Block 30 aircraft delivered to the U.S. Navy for use as aggressor trainers.  These aircraft were delivered in 1987-1988.  VF-126 and The Navy Fighter Weapons School operated them at NAS Miramar.  East coast squadrons were VF-43 at NAS Oceana and VF-45 at NAS Key West.  Each squadron had one TF-16N and 5 F-16N, with the exception of NFWS which had 7.  Due to the high stress of constant combat training the wings of these aircraft began to crack and the Navy announced their retirement in 1994 and they were sent to AMARC by 1995.  As adversary aircraft they were notable for their colorful appearance.  Most F-16Ns were painted in a three-tone blue and gray &quot;ghost&quot; scheme. Top Gun had some of the more colorful ones: a three-color desert scheme, a light blue one and a green splinter camo version with Marine markings. VF-126 also had a unique blue example.  In 2002 the Navy began to receive 14 F-16 A and B models from AMARC, once again for adversary training and painted in exotic schemes.

* '''TF-16N''' - Four two-seaters delivered to the U.S. Navy for use as aggressor trainers. Each of the four Navy F-16 adversary squadrons had one example of this version.

* '''KF-16''' - 180 licensed by Lockheed Martin in 1990's. Almost 2,500 parts changed from the original F-16E/F. Also in the late 1990's, Lockheed and KAI produced the first Korean Indigenous plane, the T-50/A-50. Modeled from the original F-16. About $22 million in cost and the South Korean government has ordered 94 planes in 2004. About 1200 expected to be sold.

==Current sale proposal by the USA==
Recently Lockheed Martin has entered in discussion with the [[India]]n ministry of defence which is looking out for replacing its aging fleet of MiG-21. But the signals coming out from the chambers of [[Indian Air Force]] do not depict a rosy picture for this aircraft. 

Following the recent earthquake, Pakistan recently reported that it is going to delay purchase of 50 late-model F-16s (F-16C/D, Block 50/52) along with some secondhand USAF F-16s. It will however immediately purchase 26 second hand F-16 As and Bs from European countries.

==Games==
Due to its widespread adoption, the F-16 has been a popular model for PC flight simulators, appearing in over 20 games. Most notable among them is [[Falcon (computer game)]], regarded as the most accurate F-16 simulation and arguably one of the most accurate military flight simulations. For example, it has the option of simulating the actual pre-flight checks, which consist of several minutes of button toggling before one can light the engine.

Other F-16 flight simulators include ''[[F-16 Fighting Falcon (computer game)|F-16 Fighting Falcon]]'' (1984), ''[[Falcon (computer game)|Falcon]]'' (1987), ''[[Jet (computer game)|Jet]]'' (1989), ''[[Falcon (computer game)|Falcon 3.0]]'' (1991), ''[[iF-16]]'' by Interactive Magic (1997), ''[[F-16 Multi-role Fighter]]'' by [[Novologic]] (1998), and ''[[F-16 Aggressor]]'' by [[General Simulation]] (1999).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Food additives''' are substances added to food to preserve flavour or improve its taste and appearance.
Some additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by [[pickling]] (with [[vinegar]]), [[edible salt|salt]]ing, as with [[bacon]], or using [[sulfur dioxide]] as in some [[wine]]s. With the advent of processed foods in the second half of the [[20th century]], many more additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin.

==Numbering==

To regulate these additives, and inform consumers, each additive is assigned a unique number. Initially these were the &quot;[[E number]]s&quot; used in [[Europe]] for all approved additives. This numbering scheme has now been adopted and extended by the [[Codex Alimentarius]] Committee to internationally identify all additives, regardless of whether they are approved for use.

E numbers are all prefixed by &quot;[[E]]&quot;, but countries outside Europe use only the number, whether the additive is approved in Europe or not.
For example, [[acetic acid]] is written as E260 on products sold in Europe, but is simply known as additive 260 in some countries. Additive 103, [[alkanet]], is not approved for use in Europe so does not have an E number, although it is approved for use in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

See [[list of food additives]] for a complete list of all of the numbers.

==Categories==

Food additives can be divided into several groups, although there is some overlap between them.

;Acids : Food [[acid]]s are added to make flavours &quot;sharper&quot;, and also act as preservatives and antioxidants. Common food acids include [[vinegar]], [[citric acid]], [[tartaric acid]], [[malic acid]], [[fumaric acid]], [[lactic acid]].
;Acidity regulators : [[Acidity regulator]]s are used to change or otherwise control the acidity and [[alkaline|alkalinity]] of foods.
;Anticaking agents : [[Anticaking agent]]s keep powders such as milk powder flowing freely.
;Antifoaming agents : [[Antifoaming agent]]s reduce or prevent foaming in foods.
;Antioxidants : [[Antioxidant]]s such as [[vitamin C]] act as preservatives by inhibiting the effects of [[oxygen]] on food, and are generally beneficial to health.
;Bulking agents : [[Bulking agent]]s such as [[starch]] are additives that increase to bulk of a food without affecting its nutritional value.
;Food coloring : [[Food coloring|Colorings]] are added to food to replace colours lost during preparation, or to make food look more attractive.
;Colour retention agents : In contrast to colourings, [[colour retention agent]]s are used to preserve a food's existing colour.
;Emulsifiers : [[Emulsifier]]s allow water and oils to remain mixed together in an [[emulsion]], as in [[mayonnaise]], [[ice cream]], and homogenised [[milk]].
;Flavours : [[Flavour]]s are additives that give food a particular taste or smell, and may be derived from natural ingredients or created articially.
;Flavour enhancers : [[Flavour enhancer]]s enhance a food's existing flavours.
;Flour treatment agents : [[Flour treatment agent]]s are added to [[flour]] to improve its colour or its use in [[baking]].
;Humectants : [[Humectant]]s prevent foods from drying out.
;Preservatives : [[Preservative]]s prevent or inhibit spoilage of food due to [[fungi]], [[bacterium|bacteria]] and other [[microorganism]]s.
;Propellants : [[Propellant]]s are pressurised gases used to expel food from its container.
;Stabilizers : [[Stabilizer]]s, thickeners and gelling agents, like [[agar]] or [[pectin]] (used in [[jam]] for example) give foods a firmer texture.  While they are not true [[emulsifier]]s, they help to stabilize [[emulsion]]s. 
;Sweeteners : [[Sweetener]]s are added to foods for flavoring. Sweeteners other than [[sugar]] are added to keep the [[food energy]] ([[calorie]]s) low, or because they have beneficial effects for [[diabetes mellitus]] and [[tooth decay]].
;Thickeners : [[Thickener]]s are substances which, when added to the mixture, increase its [[viscosity]] without substantially modifying its other properties

'''Foot-and-mouth disease''' (FMD, ''Aphtae epizooticae'' in [[Latin]]), sometimes called '''hoof-and-mouth disease''', is a [[infectious disease|highly contagious]] and sometimes fatal [[virus (biology)|viral]] [[disease]] of [[cattle]] and [[pig]]s.  It can also infect [[deer]], [[goat]]s, [[sheep]], and other animals with cloven hooves, as well as [[elephant]]s, [[rat]]s, and [[hedgehog]]s.  [[Horse]]s are not susceptible to FMD.  Humans are affected only very rarely.  The cause of FMD was first shown to be viral in [[1897]] by [[Friedrich Loeffler]].  He passed the [[blood]] of an infected animal through a fine porcelain-glass filter and found that the fluid that was collected could still cause the disease in healthy animals.

FMD occurs throughout much of the world, including parts of [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and [[South America]].  While currently (July 2001) some countries, including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]] have been free of FMD for some time, eradicated from the U.S. in 1929, its wide host range and rapid spread represent cause for international concern. There was an outbreak of FMD in [[Great Britain|Britain]] in [[2001]] which resulted in the slaughter of many animals. Many sporting events and leisure activities like [[Ten Tors]] were cancelled. (see [[2001 UK foot and mouth crisis]] for details).

Foot-and-mouth disease, after World War II, was widely distributed throughout the world. In 1996, endemic areas were Asia, Africa, and parts of South America. In South America, Chile is free, and Uruguay and Argentina have not had an outbreak since April 1994. Most European countries have been recognized as free. Countries belonging to the European Union have stopped FMD vaccination. North and Central America, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan have been free of FMD for many years. A serious breakout occurred in 2001 covering all of the United Kingdom and parts of Europe. Due to strict government policies on sale of livestock, disinfection of all persons leaving and entering farms and the cancellation of large events likely to be attended by farmers, a potentially economically disastrous epidemic was avoided in the [[Republic of Ireland]], with just 1 case recorded in Proleek, [[Co. Louth]].

There are seven different FMD serotypes - O, A, C, SAT-1, SAT-2, SAT-3 and Asia-1.  These serotypes show some regionality, and the O serotype is most common.

== Symptidely fielded until World War I, early machine guns were being used by the military in the late 19th century (e.g., the [[Gatling gun]]). They are primarily defensive weapons, mainly because of the difficulties involved in moving and placing them, and their inherent lack of accuracy. In contrast, light machine guns (such as the U.S. military's [[M249 Squad Automatic Weapon]] (SAW) and the [[M60 machine gun]], both of which are small-caliber weapons) are often wielded by a single infantryman; they provide a high rate of fire typically used as either suppressing fire or covering fire during infantry movement.  Machine guns are also often mounted on vehicles or helicopters, and have often been used since World War II as offensive weapons in fighter aircraft and tanks (e.g., for air combat or suppressing fire for ground troop support).

[[Image:Maschinenpistolen_Thompson_A1.jpg|thumb|A replica of the 1928 [[Thompson submachine gun]].]]

A [[submachine gun]] is a machine gun that fires cartridges that would otherwise be used in a [[handgun]]. Probably the most well-known example of a submachine gun is the [[Thompson submachine gun]] (the &quot;Tommy Gun&quot; of gangster movies), which fires [[.45 ACP]] cartridges.  Other well-known examples are the Israeli Uzi, the British Sten, and the German MP5, all of which implement the [[9 mm Luger Parabellum]], and the U.S.'s [[M3 Grease Gun]] which fires .45 ACP.

In United States law, a Machine Gun is defined (in part) by The [[National Firearms Act]] of 1934, [[United States]] code '''Title 26, Subtitle E, Chapter 53, Subchapter B, Part 1, § 5845''' as:

''&quot;... any weapon which shoots ... automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.&quot;''

In the United States, purchases of machine guns manufactured after 1986 by civilians were banned by the [[Firearm Owners Protection Act]] (FOPA), passed in that year.  Importation of machine guns for civilian sale in the U.S. was banned by the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]].  Machine guns manufactured prior to 1986 or imported prior to 1968 can still be legally transferred to civilians who pay a substantial tax to the [[BATFE]] and pass a background investigation.  In addition, &quot;transferable&quot; machine guns must have been registered with the [[BATFE]] prior to 1986.  Machine Gun parts kits (which do not include a functional [[receiver (firearms)|receiver]]) can be transferred without restriction.  Permission must be received from [[BATFE]] to move a machine gun between states.

[[Image:AK47.jpg|thumb|[[Mikhail Kalashnikov|Kalashnikov]]'s [[AK-47]] assault rifle.]]

One of the most popular, most produced and most used machine guns in the world is the [[Soviet]] [[AK-47]]. It served in the Soviet army as standard infantry weapon issue, as well as in many other east-block states. It is still used as standard military equipment in some former Warsaw Pact countries, as well as being used by many criminal or terrorist organizations worldwide. A semi-automatic version of this firearm is available in many locales where fully-automatic weaponry is not available.

==Loading and firing mechanisms==

[[Image:Cannon_pic.jpg|thumb|A small, cast-iron field cannon.]]

===Cannon===
The [[cannon]] is loaded with gunpowder and the cannonball through the muzzle, while a fuse is placed at the rear. This fuse is lighted, causing the gunpowder to ignite and propel the cannonball. Most cannons were land- or ship-based guns, although hand cannons also existed. In military use, the standard cannon was tremendously powerful, while hand cannon was somewhat useless.  In the 19th century, the muzzle-loaded cannon was made obsolete by the breech-loaded artillery piece with a rifled barrel.

===Muzzleloader===
[[Muzzle-loading]] muskets (smooth-bored long guns) were among the first small arms developed. The firearm was loaded through the muzzle with gunpowder, optionally some wadding and then a bullet (usually a solid lead ball, but musketeers could shoot stones when they ran out of bullets). Greatly improved muzzleloaders (usually rifled instead of smooth-bored) are manufactured today and have many enthusiasts, many of whom hunt large and small game with their guns. Muzzleloaders have to be manually reloaded after each shot; a skilled archer could fire multiple arrows faster than most early muskets could be reloaded and fired, although by the mid-18th century, when muzzleloaders became the standard small armament of the military, a well-drilled soldier could fire six rounds in a minute using prepared cartridges in his musket. Before then, effectiveness of muzzleloaders was hindered by both the low reloading speed and, before the firing mechanism was perfected, the very high risk posed by the weapon to the person attempting to fire it.

One interesting solution to the reloading problem was the &quot;Roman Candle Gun&quot;.  This was a muzzleloader in which multiple charges and balls were loaded one on top of the other, with a small hole in each ball to allow the subsequent charge to be ignited after the one ahead of it was ignited.  It was neither a very reliable nor popular firearm, but it enabled a form of &quot;automatic&quot; fire long before the advent of the machine gun.

====Matchlock====
[[Matchlock]]s were the first and simplest small arms firing  mechanisms developed. Using the matchlock mechanism, the powder in the gun barrel was ignited by a piece of burning cord called a &quot;match&quot;.  The match was wedged into one end of an S-shaped piece of steel. As the trigger (often actually a lever) was pulled, the match was brought into the open end of a &quot;touch hole&quot; at the base of the gun barrel, which contained a very small quantity of gunpowder, igniting the main charge of gunpowder in the gun barrel.  The match usually had to be relit after each firing.

====Wheellock====
The [[wheellock]] action, a successor to the matchlock, predated the flintlock.  Despite its many faults, the wheellock was a significant improvement over the matchlock in terms of both convenience and safety, since it eliminated the need to keep a smoldering match in close proximity to loose gunpowder. It operated using a small wheel much like that on [[cigarette lighters]] which was wound up with a key before use and which, when the trigger was pulled, spun against a flint, creating the shower of sparks that ignited the powder in the touch hole. Supposedly invented by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance man]], the wheel lock action was an innovation that was not widely adopted.

====Flintlock====
The [[flintlock]] action was a major innovation in small arms design. The spark used to ignite the gunpowder in the touch hole was supplied by a sharpened piece of flint clamped in the jaws of a &quot;cock&quot; which, when released by the trigger, struck a piece of steel called the &quot;frizzen&quot; to create the necessary sparks.  (The spring loaded arm that holds a piece of flint or pyrite is refered to as a cock because of its resemblance to a rooster.)  The cock had to be manually reset after each firing, and the flint had to be replaced periodically due to wear from striking the frizzen.  (See also [[flintlock mechanism]], [[snaphance]], [[miquelet]])  The flintlock was widely used during the 18th and 19th centuries in both muskets and rifles.

====Percussion cap====
[[Percussion cap]]s ([[caplock mechanism]]s), coming into wide service in the 19th century, were a dramatic improvement over flintlocks. With the percussion cap mechanism, the small primer charge of gunpowder used in all preceding small arms was replaced by a completely self-contained explosive charge contained in a small brass &quot;cap&quot;.  The cap was fastened to the touch hole of the gun (extended to form a &quot;nipple&quot;) and ignited by the impact of the gun's &quot;hammer&quot;.  (The hammer is roughly the same as the cock found on flintlocks except that it doesn't clamp onto anything.)  In the case of percussion caps the hammer was hollow on the end to fit around the cap in order to keep the cap from fragmenting and injuring the shooter. Once struck, the flame from the cap in turn ignited the main charge of gunpowder, as with the flintlock, but there was no longer any need to charge the touch hole with gunpowder, and even better, the touch hole was no longer exposed to the elements.  As a result, the percussion cap mechanism was considerably safer, far more weatherproof, and vastly more reliable (cloth-bound cartridges containing a premeasured charge of gunpowder and a ball had been in regular military service for many years, but the exposed gunpowder in the entry to the touch hole had long been a source of misfires). All muzzleloaders manufactured since the second half of the 19th century use percussion caps except those built as replicas of the flintlock or earlier small arms.

===Cartridges===
A major innovation in small arms (and light artillery) came in the second half of the 19th century when ammunition, previously delivered as separate bullets and powder, was combined in a single metallic (almost always brass) cartridge containing a percussion cap, powder, and a bullet in one weatherproof package. Before this, a &quot;cartridge&quot; was simply a premeasured quantity of gunpowder together with a ball in a small cloth bag, which also acted as wadding for the charge and ball. This early form of cartridge had to be rammed into the muzzleloader's barrel, and either a small charge of gunpowder in the touch hole or an external percussion cap mounted on the touch hole ignited the gunpowder in the cartridge. [[Cartridge (weaponry)|Cartridges]] with built-in percussion caps (called &quot;primers&quot;) continue to this day to be the standard in firearms. In cartridge-firing firearms, a hammer (or a firing pin struck by the hammer) strikes the cartridge primer, which then ignites the gunpowder within.  The primer charge is at the base of the cartridge, either within the rim (a &quot;rimfire&quot; cartridge) or in a small percussion cap embedded in the center of the base (a &quot;centerfire&quot; cartridge). As a rule, centerfire cartridges are more powerful than rimfire cartridges, containing more gunpowder and (usually) larger diameter bullets.

Caseless cartridges are now being explored: instead of using brass as the cartridge case, these would hold the cartridge together with paper or some other substance that is destroyed when the gun is fired, eliminating the problem of brass casings ejecting and littering the ground. Caseless cartridges and the guns that would use them are still prototypes, although the idea of caseless cartridges can be traced to the musket &quot;cartridges&quot; widely used by the 18th-century military.

Nearly all contemporary firearms load cartridges directly into their breech. Some additionally or exclusively load from a [[magazine (firearm)|magazine]] that holds multiple cartridges. A magazine is a box or cylinder that is designed to be reusable and is detachable from the gun.  Some magazines, such as those of the [[M1 Garand|Garand]] are loaded by using a [[clip]], which is a device that looks like a rail holding the ammunition by the case base. In most cases, a [[magazine (firearm)|magazine]] and a [[clip]] are different in that the former's function is to feed ammunition into the firearm's [[breech]], while the latter's is only to &quot;charge&quot; a [[magazine (firearm)|magazine]] with fresh ammunition.

==Repeating, semiautomatic, and automatic weapons==
Many small arms are &quot;single shot&quot; firearms: i.e., each time a cartridge is fired, the operator must manually re-cock the firearm and load another cartridge.  The classic double-barreled shotgun is a good example.  A firearm that can load multiple cartridges as the weapon is re-cocked is considered a '''repeating weapon''' or simply a &quot;repeater&quot;. The lever-action rifle of Old West fame, a pheasant-hunter's pump shotgun, and a police sniper's bolt-action rifle are good examples of repeating firearms.  A firearm that automatically re-cocks and reloads the next round with each trigger pull is considered a '''semiautomatic''' weapon.  An automatic (or &quot;fully automatic&quot;) weapon is one that automatically re-cocks, reloads, and fires as long as the trigger is depressed. Many modern military firearms have a &quot;selective-fire&quot; option, which is a mechanical switch that allows the weapon be fired either in the semiautomatic or fully automatic mode. In the current M16A2 and M16A4 variants of the U.S.-made [[M16 (rifle)|M16]], continuous full-automatic fire is not possible, having been replaced by an automatic burst of three cartridges that makes full-automatic fire considerably more accurate. It is sometimes debated which is the &quot;best&quot; military small arm, the former Soviet Union's 7.62x39mm- Kalashnikov [[AK-47]] or the [[U.S.]]-manufactured .223-caliber [[M16 (rifle)|M16]]: the highly reliable and inexpensive but heavy and bulky AK-47 has been widely adopted by many small countries, including many current and former [[Communist]] nations. The much lighter and far more accurate M16 (and its .223 cartridge in particular) has found wide adoption among NATO members and military allies of the United States (see also [[AK-47 vs. M16]]). 

The first &quot;rapid firing&quot; weapons were usually similar to the 19th-century [[Gatling gun]], which would fire cartridges from a magazine as fast as and as long as the operator turned a crank. Eventually, the &quot;rapid&quot; firing mechanism was perfected and miniaturized to the extent that either the recoil of the firearm or the gas pressure from firing could be used to operate it (which made the firing mechanisms truly &quot;automatic&quot;). Automatic rifles such as the [[Browning Automatic Rifle]] (the &quot;BAR&quot;) were in common use by the military during the early part of the 20th century, and automatic rifles that fired [[handgun]] rounds, known as [[submachine gun]]s, also appeared in this time.

Submachine guns (such as the well-known Thompson gun) were originally about the size of carbines. Because they fire pistol ammunition, they have limited long-range use, but in close combat can spray bullets in a deadly and controllable manner due to the light recoil of the pistol ammunition.  They are also extremely inexpensive and simple to build in time of war, enabling a nation to quickly arm its military.  In the latter half of the 20th century, submachine guns were being miniaturized to the point of being only slightly larger than some large handguns. The most widely used submachine gun at the end of the 20th century was the [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]]. The MP5 is actually designated as a &quot;machine pistol&quot; by Heckler &amp; Koch (MP5 stands for Machine Pistol 5), although some reserve this designation for even smaller submachine guns such as the [[MAC-10]], which are about the size and shape of pistols.

Nazi Germany brought the world's attention to what eventually became the class of firearm most widely adopted by the military: the so-called [[assault rifle]] (see [[Sturmgewehr_44]]). An assault rifle is usually slightly smaller than a military rifle such as the [[M1 Garand]], the [[M14 (rifle)|M14]] or the [[K98k]].  Generally, assault rifles have mechanisms that allow the user to select between single shots, bursts of shots, or automatic fire.  Moreover, assault rifles tend to incorporate military characteristics that make them look menacing: bayonet lugs, flash suppressors, and large capacity ammunition magazines.  Generally, these design features are trivial in nature, and the modern military assault rifle differs very little in function from a civilian hunting rifle.  Universally, civilian assault rifle variants are strictly semiautomatic. The cartridge fired by these rifles is midway in power between a pistol cartridge and a high-power rifle round, which gives the soldier the close-in spray ability of a submachine gun with the more precision long-range shooting of a high-power rifle round.  Soviet engineer [[Mikhail Kalashnikov]] quickly adapted the concept to the [[AK-47]], which has become the world's most widely used assault rifle. In United States, John Garand, the inventor of the [[M1 Garand]] rifle used by the U.S. military during World War II, adapted the assault rifle design to produce the [[M14 (rifle)|M14]], which was used by the U.S. military until the 1960s. The significant recoil (hence inaccuracy) of the M14 when fired in full automatic mode was seen as a problem, however, and in the 1960s it was replaced by [[Eugene Stoner]]'s [[AR-15]], which also marked a switch from the high-powered but heavy .30-caliber rifle used by the U.S. military since before World War I to the much smaller but far lighter and light recoiling (and arguably more accurate) .223-caliber rifle.  The military later designated the AR-15 to the &quot;M16&quot;.  The civilian version of the M16 continues to be known as the AR-15 and looks exactly like the military version, although it lacks the mechanism that permits fully automatic fire.

A '''geek''' (pronunciation /gi:k/ ) is a person who is fascinated, perhaps obsessively, by obscure or very specific areas of [[knowledge]] and [[imagination]]. ''Geek'' may not always have the same meaning as the term ''nerd'' (see [[nerd]] for a discussion of the disputed relation between the terms).

==Various definitions==
The definition of ''geek'' has changed considerably over time, but the use is colloquial and there is no definite official meaning. The social and rather derogatory connotations of the word makes it particularly difficult to define. Below are some definitions of the word; all are still in use to varying degrees.

*A person who is interested in [[technology]], especially [[computing]] and [[new media]]. Comparable with the classic definition of [[hacker]]. ''(Late 20th century and early 21st century.)''

*A person who has chosen concentration rather than conformity; one who pursues skill (especially technical skill) and imagination, not mainstream social acceptance. Geeks usually have a strong case of [[neophilia]]. Most geeks are adept with computers and treat [[hacker]] as a term of respect, but not all are hackers themselves - and some who are in fact hackers normally call themselves geeks anyway, because they (quite properly) regard 'hacker' as a label that should be bestowed by others rather than self-assumed.

*A person with a devotion to something in a way that places him or her outside the mainstream. This could be due to the intensity, depth, or subject of their interest.  This definition is very broad, and allows for [[mathematics]] geeks, [[aviation]] geeks, [[band geeks]], [[computer]] geeks, [[politics]] geeks, [[modelmaking]] geeks, [[music]] geeks, [[theatre]] geeks, history]] geeks, [[linguistics]] geeks, [[sports]] geeks,[[Society_for_Creative_Anachronism|SCA]] geeks (SCAdians), [[gaming]] geeks, [[comic Book|Comics]] geeks, [[ham radio]] geeks, [[public transit]] geeks ([[metrophile]]s), [[anime]] and [[manga]] geeks ([[otaku]]), [[Star Wars]] geeks, [[Star Trek]] geeks ([[Trekkie]]s and [[Trekkers]], the latter noted for costuming), [[Tolkien]] or [[fantasy]] geeks, and even [[Wikipedia]] geeks. ''(Late 20th century and early 21st century.)''

*G.E.E.K., as an acronym, reputedly came from the [[Military of the United States|United States Military]]; it stands for General Electrical Engineering Knowledge. It is unclear if this was the origin of the current meaning for geek, or if the acronym was used as a humorous reference toward the pre-established meaning for geek (i.e., a [[backronym]]).

*A ''incorrect'' derogatory term for one with low [[social skills]], regardless of intelligence. The correct term would be a [[dork]]. ''(Late 20th century.)''

*A performer at a carnival who swallows various live animals and bugs. Sometimes this extends to biting off the heads of chickens.  The Geek would usually perform in a &quot;geek pit&quot;. This sense of the word dates back to the [[1920s]], and possibly comes from the 16th century word ''geck'', originally of [[Middle Low German|Low German]] origin. In English the precursor word &quot;geck&quot; or &quot;gecke&quot; was used by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]: ''&quot;Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd, kept in a dark house, visited by the priest, and made the most notorious geck and gull That e'er invention play'd on?&quot;'' ([[Twelfth Night]], V.i).  The word also thought to appear in [[Cymbeline]] ([http://www.wordorigins.org/wordorg.htm wordorigins.org]).
material. Aiming upwards eliminates this risk but replaces it with the risk that the bullet may cause damage when it comes down to the ground again. Indeed, several accidents have been caused by discharging firearms into the air. It is also possible that the muzzle will inadvertently be pointed at a non-target such as someone's head or an [[aircraft]]. [http://aviation-safety.net/news/newsitem.php?id=1361]

When passing a firearm to another person, it should be passed such that the muzzle of the weapon does not point at, or &quot;flag&quot;, the recipient or any bystander. If the situation permits it is often concidered good practice to show the firearm with the magazine removed, the breech unloaded and locked open before handing it over to the recipient. It is known as &quot;show clear&quot;.

=== Keep fingers off the trigger ===

This rule is intended to prevent an undesired discharge. Normally a firearm is discharged by pressing its [[trigger]]. A handler's finger may involuntary move for any of several reasons: being startled, not keeping full attention on body movements, or physiological reasons beyond conscious control such as [[spasm]]s. Handlers are therefore taught to minimize the harmful effects of such a motion, by keeping the finger off the trigger.

The trigger guard and area above the trigger of a firearm presents a natural point for a handler to keep their finger out straight alongside the weapon, so as not to violate this rule (see picture above).  A properly indexed trigger finger also helps remind the person holding the gun of the direction of the muzzle.

In [[popular culture]], such as [[Film|movies]] and [[Television|TV shows]], this rule is often violated, even by characters who would be trained in gun safety such as [[Soldier|military personnel]] or [[Police|law enforcement officers]].

=== Be sure of your target ===
 
This rule is intended to eliminate or minimize damage to non-targets when a firearm is intentionally discharged. Unintended damage may occur if a non-target is misidentified as a target, or if the bullet hits something or someone other than the intended target.

Handlers are taught that they must positively identify their target as valid. If the situation allows it, all of the above gun safety rules are to be observed until the target is identified.

Even when firing at a valid target, unintended targets may still be hit. A bullet may miss the intended target and hit something else. Alternatively, the bullet may go through the target and hit a non-target behind it. (Ammunition can be chosen to reduce this risk; see [[Terminal ballistics]], [[Stopping power]], [[Hollow point bullet]].) Thus, the handler must observe what is close to and behind the target. If non-targets are at risk of being hit by the bullet, the handler may have to refrain from firing. 

This rule may create situations that present dilemmas for a handler. Such situations may include for instance a police officer in a [[riot]] or a soldier in a situation where [[civilians]] are near the [[enemy]]. Indecision or misjudgment of the handler's abilities in such a situation may cause undesired outcomes, such as injury to the handler or the handler violating [[rules of engagement]] and causing unintended damage. To prevent such outcomes the handler must be properly trained. This makes it easier for the handler to make appropriate decisions, even if given little time and/or put under severe [[Stress (medicine)|stress]].

== Gun safety for firearms not in use ==

Gun safety for situations where firearms are not in use are intended to prevent access to and subsequent discharge of a firearm. Preventing access to firearms serves a double purpose in that it also protects the firearm from theft.

An effective method of preventing access to a functioning firearm is to store it disassembled and to keep the parts separated. If a certain part of a firearm is required for it to fire, the handler may remove that part from the firearm and keep it in a separate location. [[Ammunition]] may also be stored away from the firearm.  

Sometimes this rule is codified in law. For example, [[Sweden|Swedish]] law requires owners of firearms to store the firearms with the main body, the &quot;vital piece&quot;, and the ammunition in separate locations.

A [[Lock (device)|lock]] that prevents motion of the trigger, blocks the chamber or in any other way prevents the firearm from being discharged may be used for additional safety. This also makes the firearm less useful to thieves as the firearm cannot be used unless the lock is removed. Such locks are commonly designed so that they cannot be forcibly removed without permanently disabling the firearm. This method is considered less effective than keeping firearms locked in a safe or a gun cabinet since locks are more easily defeated than approved safes.

Most firearm experts do not promote the use of trigger locks. In most cases, the firearm can still be loaded and a round chambered with the lock in place.  In some cases, the firearm can even be fired with a trigger lock secured around the trigger guard.

If a firearm is intended to be used for self defence at home, special-purpose locking devices exist that allow the owner to store the fully-loaded firearm in a safe manner while still providing quick access to it. However, keeping a firearm in a continuous state of readiness to be fired presents certain operational problems as previously described, especially if children can gain access to the firearm. Therefore the owner should always consider taking further precautions from an early age in addition to the use of locking storage containers, such as teaching children gun safety as described herein from an early age.

== Protective gear and health issues ==

When discharged a firearm emits a very loud [[noise (industrial)|noise]], typically close to the handler's [[ear]]s. Over time this can cause hearing damage such as [[tinnitus]]. Hearing protection is recommended to prevent this.

Firearms emit hot gases, powder, and other debris when fired. Some weapons, such as [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] and [[Automatic firearm|fully automatic]] firearms, typically eject spent [[cartridge (weaponry)|cartridge]] casings at high speed. Ejected casings are also commonly very hot from the discharge. Any of these may hurt the handler through burning or impact damage. [[Eye]]s are particularly vulnerable to this type of damage. Therefore eye protection is recommended.

Hearing and eye protection can also be used to protect observers, bystanders, team members or others that may be close to the handler.

Another problem, highlighted in more recent years, is that of toxic effects from ammunition or cleaning agents. [[Lead (element)|Lead]] bullets can release lead vapour when fired, and older ammunition may have [[mercury (element)|mercury]]-based [[primer]]s. Lead accumulates in range backstops, often as fine powder which is easily inhaled, and ranges must be carefully decontaminated. Indoor ranges require good [[ventilation]] to remove pollutants. Ranges always require extensive decontamination if they are to be decommissioned.

Lead, copper and other metals will also be released when a firearm is handled and cleaned. Highly aggressive solvents and other agents used to remove lead and powder fouling may present a hazard to health. Good ventilation, washing oneself and cleaning the space where the gun was handled lessens the risk of unnecessary exporure.

== Impairment ==

A firearm should never be used while under the influence of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] or [[Psychoactive drug|drug]]s, even legal [[medical prescription|prescription]] or [[over the counter]] drugs. 

An exception can be made for drugs that are definitely known not to impair judgment or to cause drowsiness or involuntary motions.  If unsure if your medicine could be a problem, find out before handling firearms.

Note that [[alcoholic beverage|Alcohol]] may affect one's judgment of risk (a [[complex task]]), even after drinking relatively small amounts.  This also applies to regular drinkers who may not feel physically affected by alcohol.  The complex split-second decision whether or not to quickly fire at a moving target requires a clear mind.  

Unfortunately, alcohol begins to affect judgement well before it begins to slow down one's reflex time.

== Correct ammunition ==

The handler must be certain the firearm is loaded only with ammunition that is approved for use with that particular firearm. Using ammunition of wrong [[caliber]], or using an ammunition type for which the firearm is not intended to be used with, may result in the firearm malfunctioning or becoming damaged. This may cause the firearm to explode, resulting in severe or even fatal damage to the handler. 

Ammunition may be manufactured manually, so called &quot;hand-loading&quot;. It may be very difficult for an unexperienced or unskilled handler to discern what is the equivalent ammunition type for hand-loaded ammunition. As such, using hand-loaded ammunition without being experienced in that field presents an elevated risk of a firearm-ammunition mismatch, with possible consequences as mentioned above.

== Construction, modification and general condition of firearms ==

Modifying firearms to better fit their intended purpose is a fairly common practice, but not without its pitfalls. Firearms of any sort operate briefly at enormous pressure during firing, and enormous loads are placed on the pressure-bearing parts. If these parts are weakened by modifications or adaptions (such as drilling to fit telescope mounts, slings etc) there is a real risk of explosion. Similarly, if safety devices or mechanism parts such as sear engagement points, safety catches, de-cockers or trigger interrupters are modified or poorly adapted, great risks become apparent. Semi-automatic rifles may fire from an unlocked breech, allowing a case explosion next to the face of the firer; a handgun may fire unexpectedly or even &quot;burst-fire&quot; like a machinegun. The potential for harm is obvious, along with the legal implications for those who modify firearms without a great deal of training and expertise.

Even without &quot;metalwork&quot; modifications a gun can still be rendered unsafe. A great deal of design effort goes into making sure a firearm can only be assembled one way, as it was intended to be, but occasionaly it is found to be possible to assemble a firearm in such a manner as to render it unsafe. This knowledge is often only bought to light following a tragedy resulting from it. Therefore, anything more than routine field-stripping requires great care and preferably instruction from somebody competent in such practices.

The overall condition of a firearm is equally important. Rusted, heavily fouled or blocked barrels may bulge or explode (especially [[shotgun]]s), and mechanisms may fail due to contamination or corrosion. Any firearm should be kept clean and thoroughly checked for proper funtionality before live-firing. If there is any doubt as to its condition, it should not be used until it has been properly repaired.

In the United Kingdom, firearms must be '''proofed''' before sale or use. This takes place at the [[Birmingham Proof House|Birmingham Gun Barrel Proof House]], where each individual firearm is held in a test mount and fired with a severely overcharged round of [[ammunition]]. If it survives, it is inspected for distortion or other damage and if found to be free of such, stamped with the appropriate [[proof mark]]. Re-proofing will be required after modification to pressure-bearing parts to ensure continued safety.

== Gun safety for children ==

Children who are generally considered too young to be allowed to handle firearms at all have a different set of rules which can be taught to them:

*Stop.
*Don't touch.
*Leave the area.
*Tell an adult. 

The purpose of these rules is to prevent children from inadvertently handling firearms. These rules are part of the [[Eddie Eagle]] program developed by the [[National Rifle Association]] for preschoolers through 6th graders.  If a child discovers a firearm, they should seek an adult to remove access to it as soon as possible.  This may include turning it over to an appropriate law enforcement agency.  

Older youth (age may vary per program) may take part in a program for safe rifle handling, such as promoted by the various organizations:

* [[Boy Scouts of America]]
* [[Americans for Gun Safety Foundation]]
* [[National Rifle Association]] 
* [[Civilian Marksmanship Program]]

== History and teachers of gun safety ==

While gun safety in different forms has existed since the creation of firearms, modern gun safety is often credited to [[Jeff Cooper (colonel)|Jeff Cooper]]. Being influential in the modern handling of firearms, he formalised the above mentioned rules of gun safety. 

Other teachers of gun safety include [[Massad Ayoob]], Clint Smith, Chuck Taylor, Jim Crews and [[Ignatius Piazza]].

One widely-known firearms safety program in the [[United States]] is the [[Eddie Eagle]] program developed by the [[National Rifle Association]].

'''Gemini''' ([[Latin]] for ''[[twin]]s'', symbol [[Image:Gemini_symbol.png|18px]], [[Unicode]] ♊) is one of the [[constellation]]s of the [[zodiac]].  It is part of the winter sky, lying between [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] to the west and the dim [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]] to the east, with [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]] and the near-invisible [[Lynx (constellation)|Lynx]] to the north and [[Monoceros]] and [[Canis Minor]] to the south. The [[Gemini program]] is named for it.

==Notable features==
Gemini includes two bright stars, named after the two twins, who correspond to the [[Dioscuri]] in [[Greek mythology]] - [[Castor (star)|Castor]] (&amp;alpha;), a pretty telescopic [[binary star|binary]] (actually sextuple), and [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]] (&amp;beta;), which is brighter and more southwesterly.  The other stars are relatively dim - only one, [[Gamma Geminorum|&amp;gamma; Gem]] (Alhena) is ever seen from a large city - and trace out a rectangle to the southeast.

The planet [[Pluto (planet)|Pluto]] was discovered in this constellation in 1930, near the star [[Delta Geminorum|&amp;delta; Gem]] (Wasat).

==Notable deep sky objects==
The brightest deep sky object of Gemini is [[Open Cluster M35|M35]], an open cluster of 5th magnitude, 2 800 light-years from earth. It is northwest of &amp;eta; Geminorum, near the western edge of the constellation.

==Mythology==
Since this constellation is easily viewable as two parallel stick figures [http://www.coldwater.k12.mi.us/lms/planetarium/myth/Gem.gif], considering faint stars visible to the naked eye, it was associated with the myth of [[Castor and Polydeuces]] (also known as the [[Dioscuri]]). A myth of these twins heavily concerns [[cattle]] theft, and may be connected to early views of the [[Milky Way]], as a herd of [[dairy]] [[cow]]s or cattle, by which they are situated.

The orientation of the constellation can vary (since they readily form stick figures whether leaning right or left), though the twins are usually viewed as left leaning. However, when right leaning, one of the twins resides in the Milky Way, and the other outside it, a situation making it appear that one of the twins is ''stealing the cattle'', and the other is observing. In this situation, together with the area of the sky that is deserted (now considered as the new and extremely faint constellations [[Camelopardalis]] and [[Lynx (constellation)|Lynx]]), and the other features of the area in the [[Zodiac]] sign of Gemini (i.e. [[Orion constellation|Orion]], [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]], and [[Canis Major]]), this may be the origin of the myth of the cattle of [[Geryon]], which forms one of [[The Twelve Labours]] of [[Herakles]].

===Astrology===
The Western [[astrological sign]] Gemini of the [[tropical zodiac]] ([[May 21]] - [[June 20]]) differs from the astronomical constellation and the Hindu astrological sign of the [[Sidereal astrology|sidereal zodiac]] ([[June 20]] - [[July 20]]).

In some cosmologies, Gemini is associated with the [[classical element]] [[Air (classical element)|Air]], and thus called an Air Sign (with [[Libra]] and [[Aquarius]]). It is also one of the four mutable signs (along with [[Virgo]], [[Sagittarius]], and [[Pisces]]). Its polar opposite is [[Sagittarius]]. It is the [[domicile (astrology)|domicile]] of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]. Each astrological sign is assigned a part of the body, viewed as the seat of its power. Gemini rules the nervous system, the lungs, the hands and arms. The symbol for Gemini is the [[twin (mythology)|twins]].

[[pl:Bliźnięta (gwiazdory of Ghana''' - consists of the Army, Navy, [[Ghana Air Force|Air Force]], National Police Force, Palace Guard, and Civil Defense.

==General==
Like any [[army]], [[Ghana]]'s exists to ward off foreign aggression and
ensure some form of security for the citizens of Ghana. The Ghanaian
military is primarily composed of the army, which controls both the air
and naval units. In terms of command, the minister of defense
commands [[general]]s and other commanders on the field. Military units
exist in the capital, [[Accra]] and in Ghana's border regions. The
Ghanaian army, which has a northern and a southern command, is
organized into two [[brigade]]s, with six [[infantry]] battalions; one
reconnaissance regiment, with two reconnaissance squadrons; one
airborne force, with one paratroop company; one artillery regiment; and
one field engineer regiment.

==Weapons==
The ordnance is mostly older weapons of [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Brazil|Brazilian]], [[Switzerland|Swiss]], [[Sweden|Swedish]], [[Israel|Israeli]], and [[Finland|Finnish]] origin. All Ghanaian equipment suffers from extremely poor servicing due to substandard maintenance capabilities. As a result, foreign military advisers or [[technicians]] perform all major maintenance tasks.

==Army==
The Ministry of Defence is located in [[Accra]] as is Defence Headquarters. The army numbers some 5,000 personnel and is structured as follows:
*Two BDE HQ in [[Accra]] and [[Kumasi]]
*6 Infantry [[Battalions]] of the [[Ghana Regiment]]
*2 Airborne [[company (military unit)|companies]] attached to DHQ 
*1 Battalion of the [[President's Own Guard Regiment]] 
*1 Training Battalion 
*1 Staff College 
*2 armoured reconnaissance squadrons of the [[Reconnaissance Regiment]] 
*1 Signals Regiment 
*1 Engineer Regiment 
*1 Logistic Group.

==Air Force==
[[Image:Skyvan.jpg|thumb|250px|SC-7 Skyvan 3M]]
The Ghanaian Air Force operates from bases in Accra (headquarters and main transport base) it numbers about a 1000 personnel, [[Tamale, Ghana|Tamale]] (combat and training base), [[Takoradi]] (training base), and [[Kumasi]] (support base). The air force's mission is to perform counterinsurgency operations and to provide [[logistics|logistical]] support to the army. Performance however has been hindered by a lack of spare parts and by poor maintenance capabilities.

==Navy==
Ghana's navy provides coastal defense, protection of fisheries, and
security on [[Lake Volta]]. In [[1994]] the navy was organized into an eastern
command, with headquarters at Tema, and a western command, with
headquarters at [[Sekondi]]. Still, the Ghanaian navy continues to
experience low readiness rates because of spare parts shortages.

In the late [[1980s]] and early [[1990s]], due to financial constraints and a
lack of serviceable equipment, the navy to shrank from about 1,200
personnel to about 850. The navy currently numbers about 1000 personnel as of [[2003]].

==Other==
[[Paramilitary]] forces deal with preventing and controlling civil
disturbances and insurrection. A small, elite Presidential Guard
provides security for the [[President_of_Ghana|president]]. The [[Government_of_Ghana|Ghanaian government]] also has
created a National Civil Defense Force (also known as the Committees
for the Defense of the Revolution), which includes all citizens able to
perform military service. According to the country's defense plans, the
National Civil Defense Force would be required to guard important
installations in times of crisis to relieve pressure on the regular armed
forces.
==Peacekeeping==
Ghana commits a large proportion of its armed forces to [[peacekeeping]] operations, mainly in Africa. Its largest contingents are:
*[[MONUC]] ([[Democratic Republic of Congo]]) - 464
*[[UNMIL]] ([[Liberia]]) - 852
*[[UNAMSIL]] ([[Sierra Leone]]) - 782
*[[UNIFIL]] ([[Lebanon]]) - 651

Ghana is active in the [[United Nations]] and many of its specialized agencies, the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Nonaligned Movement]], the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU), what is now is the [[African Union]] (AU) and the [[Economic Community of West African States]]. Generally, it follows the consensus of the Nonaligned Movement and the OAU on economic and political issues not directly affecting its own interests. Ghana has been extremely active in international [[peacekeeping]] activities under UN auspices in [[Lebanon]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Rwanda]], the [[Balkans]], and [[Pakistan]], in addition to an eight-year sub-regional initiative with its ECOWAS partners to develop and then enforce a cease-fire in [[Liberia]]. Ghana maintains friendly relations with all states, regardless of ideology.

'''Gibraltar''' is an [[British overseas territory|Overseas Territory]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. It is located on the southern part of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] at the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] that links the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Mediterranean Sea]] and placing it between [[Europe]] and [[Africa]]. The territory shares a land border with [[Spain]], to the north. Gibraltar has historically been important base for the [[British Armed Forces]], and is the site of a large naval base.

The name of the rock comes from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name of ''Jebel al Tariq'' (جبل طارق) meaning rock of Tariq. It refers to the [[Ummayad]] general [[Tariq ibn-Ziyad]] who led the [[Islamic conquest of Iberia|Muslim conquest of Spain]] in [[711]]. Earlier it was known as [[Calpe]], one of the [[Pillars of Hercules]]. Today, Gibraltar is also known colloquially as &quot;Gib&quot; or &quot;the Rock&quot;.

The [[Disputed status of Gibraltar|sovereignty of Gibraltar]] is a major issue of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations.  [[Spain]] requests the return of sovereignty, ceeded in perpetuity in 1713. Any transfer has been consistently and totally rejected by the people of Gibraltar.

==History==
{{main|History of Gibraltar}}

Human settlement in Gibraltar can be traced back to the [[Phoenicians]] around [[950 BC]], although there is earlier evidence of habitation by the [[Neanderthal]]s, a prehistoric subspecies of man. Semi-permanent settlements were later established by the [[Carthaginians]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Gibraltar was named at that time as one of the [[Pillars of Hercules]], after the legend of the creation of the [[Straits of Gibraltar]].

The first permanent settlement was built by the [[Almohad]] Sultan [[Abd al-Mu'min]]. Gibraltar then passed to a successive line of empires, becoming a part of [[Castile]] and then [[Spain]]. Admiral Sir George Rooke, commander of the confederate fleet captured the territory in [[1704]] during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. 

In the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] which ended the war, Spain ceded Gibraltar and [[Minorca]] to the United Kingdom, which has retained sovereignty over the former ever since, despite early attempts by Spain to recapture the territory. 

Gibraltar then became an important naval base for the [[Royal Navy]], playing an important part in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. Its strategic value increased with the opening of the [[Suez Canal]], as it controlled the important sea route between the UK and its colonies in [[India]] and [[Australia]]. During [[World War II]], the civilian residents of Gibraltar were evacuated, and the Rock was turned into a fortress. An [[Gibraltar Airport|airfield]] was built over the civilian racecourse. Plans by [[Nazi Germany]] to capture the Rock were frustrated by Spain's reluctance to allow the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] onto Spanish soil. 
[[Image:Battle of Gibraltar 1607.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[Battle of Gibraltar]].]]

In the [[1950s]], Spain – then under &quot;Generalísimo&quot; [[Francisco Franco]] – renewed its claim to sovereignty over Gibraltar, sparked in part by the visit of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in [[1954]] to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Rock's capture. For the next thirty years, Spain restricted movement between Gibraltar and Spain. A referendum was held on September 10, [[1967]] in which Gibraltar's voters were asked whether they wished to either pass under Spanish sovereignty, or remain under British sovereignty, with institutions of self-government. The vote was overwhelmingly in favour of continuance of British sovereignty, with 12,138 to 44 voting to reject Spanish sovereignty. In response Spain completely closed the border with Gibraltar and severed all communication links. 

In [[1981]] it was announced that [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess of Wales]] would fly to Gibraltar to board the [[HMY Britannia|''Britannia'']] as part of their honeymoon. In response the Spanish King, [[Juan Carlos of Spain|Juan Carlos I]] refused to attend their wedding in [[London]]. 

In [[1988]], [[Special Air Service|SAS troops]] foiled an attempted terrorist attack on the British Army Garrison by members of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]].

The border with Spain was partially reopened in [[1982]], and fully reopened in [[1985]] after Spain's accession into the [[European Community]]. Joint talks on the future of the Rock held between Spain and the United Kingdom have occurred since the late [[1980s]], with various proposals for joint sovereignty discussed. However, another referendum organised in Gibraltar rejected the idea of joint sovereignty by 17,900 votes to 187. The question of Gibraltar continues to dominate Anglo-Spanish relations.

==Politics==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Francis Richards.jpg|thumb|150px|The [[Governor of Gibraltar]], [[Francis Richards|Sir Francis Richards]].]] --&gt;
{{main|Politics of Gibraltar}}
As an [[British overseas territory|overseas territory]] of the UK, the head of state is [[Queen Elizabeth II]], who is represented by the [[Governor of Gibraltar]]. The UK retains responsibility for [[Defense (military)|defence]], [[International relations|foreign relations]], internal security and financial stability. The Governor is not involved in the day-to-day administration of Gibraltar, and his role is largely as a ceremonial head of state. The Governor officially appoints the Chief Minister and government ministers after an election. He is responsible for matters of defence, security and the [[Royal Gibraltar Police]].

The Government of Gibraltar is elected for a term of four years. The [[unicameral]] [[Gibraltar House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] consists of fifteen elected members, eight Government members, seven opposition members and two ex-officio members appointed by the Governor, the Financial Development Secretary and the Attorney-General. The speaker is nominated by the Government.

The head of Government is the [[Chief Minister of Gibraltar|Chief Minister]], currently [[Peter Caruana]]. There are three political parties currently represented in the House of Assembly: [[Gibraltar Social Democrats]]; [[Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party]]; and [[Gibraltar Liberal Party]]. [[New Gibraltar Democracy]] has has been formed since the 2003 election.

The [[Reform Party (Gibraltar)|Reform Party]] and [[Gibraltar Labour Party]] having failed to achieve any popular support, ceased operating in [[2005]].

Gibraltar is a part of the [[European Union]], having joined under the British Treaty of Accession, with exemption from some areas such as the [[Customs Union]] and [[Common Agricultural Policy]]. Since [[2004]], the people of Gibraltar have been entitled to vote in elections to the [[European Parliament]] as part of the [[South West England]] region. 

As a result of the continued Spanish claim, the issue of [[sovereignty]] features strongly in Gibraltar politics. All local political parties are opposed to any transfer of sovereignty to Spain, instead supporting [[self-determination]] for the Rock. This policy is supported by the main UK opposition parties. In view of the UK Government's repeated commitment to respect the wishes of the people of Gibraltar, as laid out in the Constitution, the proposal for joint sovereignty is now considered dead.

==Geography==
[[Image:Gib_bay.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rock of Gibraltar, West Side town area, 2006]]
The territory covers 6.543&amp;nbsp;km² (2.53 square miles). It shares a 1.2 km land border with [[Spain]] and has 12&amp;nbsp;km of shoreline. There are two coasts (''sides'') of Gibraltar &amp;ndash; the [[Gibraltar east|East Side]] which contains the settlements of [[Sandy Bay]] and [[Catalan Bay]], and the [[Gibraltar west|West Side]] where the vast majority of the population lives.

The climate is [[Mediterranean]] with mild winters and warm summers. Its terrain is a narrow coastal lowland bordering the 426-metre (1.397.6-foot) high [[Rock of Gibraltar]]. 

It has negligible natural resources and limited natural freshwater resources, until recently using large concrete or natural rock water catchments to collect rain water. It now has a [[desalination]] plant using [[reverse osmosis]] which is built into the rock itself. 

Gibraltar is one of the most densely populated territories in the world, with approximately 4,245 people per km² (10,979 per sq mile). The growing demand for space is being increasingly met by [[land reclamation]], which comprises approximately one tenth of the territory's total area.

The Rock itself is made of [[limestone]] and is 426 m (1,396 feet) high. It contains many miles of roads, most of which are closed to the public. Most of its area is covered by a [[nature reserve]], which is home to around 250 [[Barbary Macaque|Barbary Apes]], the only wild [[monkey]]s in Europe. Superstition holds that if ever the Apes leave, so will the British; so they are well looked after by the government (a situation rather analogous to the [[raven]]s of the [[Tower of London]]).

==Subdivisions==
[[Image:Gibraltar sm05.gif|thumb|250px|Map of Gibraltar]]
Gibraltar has no administrative divisions. It is divided into seven Major Residential Areas, which are further divided into Enumeration Areas, which serve statistical purposes. The Major Residential Areas are listed below, with population figures from the Census of 2001:

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Gibraltar}}
[[Image:10 pounds of Gibraltar.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Gibraltar pound|Gibraltar £10 notes]].]]
The British military traditionally dominated the economy of Gibraltar, with the naval dockyard providing the bulk of economic activity. This has however diminished in the last twenty years, and it is estimated to account for only 7% of the local economy, compared with over 60% in [[1984]].

Nowadays Gibraltar has an extensive service-sector-based economy, dominated by [[financial services]] and [[tourism]]. A number of British banks and international banks have operations in Gibraltar. Gibraltar has become an International Finance Centre. There is no tax on capital income and other advantages. Recently many bookmakers and online gaming operators have relocated to Gibraltar, to benefit from operating in a regulated jurisdiction with a favourable corporate tax regime.

Tourism is also a significant industry. Gibraltar is a popular stop for cruise ships; and attracts day visitors from resorts in Spain. The [[Rock of Gibraltar]] is a popular tourist attraction, particularly among British tourists and residents in the southern coast of Spain. It is also a popular shopping destination, and all goods and services are [[value added tax|VAT]] free. Many of the large British high street chains have branches in Gibraltar including [[Marks and Spencer]] [[BHS]] [[Dorothy Perkins]] and
the supermarket [[Morrisons]].

Figures from the [[CIA World Factbook]] show that Gibraltar has a [[GDP]] of over £432 million ($769 million); with a per capita figure of £15,700 ($28,000). The main export markets in 2004 were [[France]] (19.4%), Spain (14.1%), [[Turkmenistan]] (12.1%), [[Switzerland]] (11.7%), [[Germany]] (10.1%), the United Kingdom (9.1%) and [[Greece]] (6.8%).

The unit of currency is the [[Pound Sterling]].

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Gibraltar}}
Gibraltar has a population of approximately 27,884 as of July 2005. The Gibraltarians' origins are Andalusian Spaniards, British, and settlers from elsewhere in the Mediterranean (mainly [[Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Malta|Maltese]]). The main religion is Christianity, the majority group being the [[Roman Catholic Church]], then the [[Church of England]]. There is a long established [[Jewish]] community, a number of [[Hindu]] Indians and a Moroccan [[Muslim]] population.

The official language is [[English language|English]], which is the main language used for government and business purposes. Many locals also use [[Llanito]], a mixture of English and [[Andalusia]]n Spanish, with some words not native to either.

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Gibraltar}}
[[Image:Gibraltar-flags-national-pride.jpg|thumb|200px|Tercentenary celebrations in Gibraltar, the Union Flag is used a symbol of Gibraltar's British connections, and is flown throughout the Rock]] 
The culture of Gibraltar reflects Gibraltarians' diverse origins. While there are [[Andalusia|Andalusian]] and British influences, the ethnic origins of most Gibraltarians are not confined to British or Andalusian ethnicities. Most ethnicities include Genoese, Maltese, Portuguese, and Germans. A handful of other Gibraltar residents are Jewish of [[Sephardi|Sephardic]] or of [[North Africa]]n origin or even Hindu. 

British influence remains strong. Although Gibraltarians often speak to each other in an English-influenced Andalusian dialect called Yanito or [[Llanito]], English is the language of government, commerce, education and the media. Gibraltarians going on to higher education attend university in the UK. Patients requiring medical treatment not available on the Rock receive it there as private patients, paid for by the Gibraltar Government.

Gibraltar celebrates its National Day annually on 10th September, the date chosen to commemorate the 1967 Referendum which was the first act of self-determination of the people of Gibraltar. Despite the political undertones of the day, it is very much a festive occasion, with everyone dressing in red and white and congregating in the main square (Casemates) to celebrate. 30,000 red and white balloons are released followed by music, dancing and other events around Gibraltar.

==Transport==
[[Image:Gib_cc.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Cable Car]]
{{main|Transport in Gibraltar}}
Within Gibraltar, the main form of transport is the car. Motorbikes are popular and there is a good modern bus service. Unlike other British territories, traffic drives on the right, as it shares a land border with Spain. 

There is a [[cable car]] which runs from a lower level in the centre of Gibraltar to one of the highest points on the Rock, with a stop halfway at the apes' den.

The only transport link with Spain is by land, as Spain bans all air and ferry links with Gibraltar. Despite this, [[Gibraltar Airport]], maintains regular flight connections to [[London]] and [[Manchester]]. There were flights to [[Morocco]] but there was insufficient demand to sustain the service. 

Motorists, and on occasion, pedestrians crossing the border with Spain are randomly subjected to long delays and searches by the Spanish authorities. Spain has closed the border during disputes with the Gibraltar authorities, for example when the [[MV_Aurora|Aurora]] cruise ship called at Gibraltar.

==Military==

The army garrison is provided by the [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment]], originally a part-time reserve force which was placed on the permanent establishment of the [[British Army]] in [[1990]]. The regiment includes full-time and part-time soldiers recruited from Gibraltar, as well as [[British Army]] regulars posted from other regiments.

[[Image:Gibraltar_navy.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A Royal Navy base in Gibraltar.]]

The [[Royal Navy]] maintains its [http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/static/pages/5375.html|Gibraltar Squadron] at the Rock. The squadron is responsible for the security and integrity of British Gibraltar Territorial Waters (BGTW). The shore establishment at Gibraltar is named [[Rooke]] after [[Sir George Rooke]] who captured the Rock for [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles]] (pretender to the Spanish throne) in 1704. Gibraltar's naval docks are an important base for [[NATO]]. Ships from the Spanish navy do not dock at Gibraltar.

British and US nuclear submarines frequently visit the ''Z berths'' at Gibraltar (source: [http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo981109/text/81109w21.htm Hansard]). A Z berth provides the facility for nuclear submarines to visit for operational or recreational purposes, and for non-nuclear repairs.

The [[Royal Air Force]] station at Gibraltar forms part of Headquarters British Forces Gibraltar. Although aircraft are no longer permanently stationed at [[RAF Gibraltar]], a variety of RAF aircraft make regular visits to the Rock.

The Rock is believed to be a [[SIGINT]] listening post for [[telecommunications]] throughout North Africa, and because of its strategic location it still remains a key base for [[NSA]] and [[GCHQ]] coverage of the [[Mediterranean]].

==Death on the Rock==   
In [[1988]] the British [[Special Air Service|SAS]] killed three unarmed [[Provisional IRA]] volunteers, Mairead Farrell, Sean Savage and Daniel McCann in Gibraltar as part of [[Operation Flavius]]. They were in Gibraltar on a PIRA operation. A car hired by the three was subsequently discovered laden with [[Semtex]] explosive. This incident was the subject of a contentious [[Thames Television]] documentary, ''[[Death on the Rock]]'', which many credit with being the main factor in Thames losing its [[ITV]] licence in 1992.   
    
The families of the deceased took the case to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] which by ten votes to nine held that the British Government had violated Article 2 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention]]. It also ruled that the three had been engaged in an act of terrorism, and consequently dismissed unanimously the applicants’ claims for damages, for costs and expenses incurred in the Gibraltar Inquest and the remainder of the claims for just satisfaction.

==Prehistoric==
Evidence of [[hominid]] inhabitation of the Rock dates back to the [[Neanderthal]]s. A Neanderthal skull was discovered in [[Forbes' Quarry]] in 1848, indeed prior to the &quot;original&quot; discovery in the [[Neanderthal, Germany|Neander Valley]]. In 1926, the skull of a Neanderthal child was found in [[Devil's Tower]].

==Ancient==
The [[Phoenicians]] are known to have visited the Rock circa 950 BC and named the Rock ''[[Calpe]]''. The [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] also visited, however neither group appears to have settled permanently. [[Plato]] refers to Gibraltar as one of the [[Pillars of Hercules]] along with [[Jebel Musa]] or [[Monte Hacho]] on the other side of the Strait.

Gibraltar was next visited by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]s. Again, no permanent settlement was established. Following the [[fall of the Roman Empire]], Gibraltar was visited by the [[Vandals]] and later the [[Goths]]. The Vandals' stay was temporary; however, the [[Visigoth]]s were to remain on the [[Iberian peninsula]] from 414 to 711. The Gibraltar area and the rest of the South Iberian Peninsula was part of the [[Byzantine Empire]] during the second part of the 6th century, later reverting to the Visigoth Kingdom.

==Muslim==
*[[711]] [[April 30]] - The [[Umayyad]] general [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]], leading a [[Berber]]-dominated army, sailed across the Strait from Ceuta. He first attempted to land on Algeciras but failed. Upon his failure, he landed undetected at the southern point of the Rock from present-day [[Morocco]] in his quest for Spain. Little was built during the first four centuries of [[Moorish]] control. (See [[Reconquista]].)
*1160 - The [[Almohad]] Sultan [[Abd al-Mu'min]] ordered that a permanent settlement, including a [[castle]], be built. It received the name of ''Medinat al-Fath'' (City of the Victory). On completion of the works in the town, the Sultan crossed the Strait to inspect the works and stayed in Gibraltar for two months. The Tower of Homage of the castle remains standing today (Moorish Castle).
*1231 - After the collapse of the Almohad Empire, Gibraltar was taken by [[Ibn Hud]], [[Taifa]] emir of Murcia.
*1237 - Following the death of [[Ibn Hud]], his domains were handed over to [[Muhammed ibn Nasr]], the founder of the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]] [[kingdom of Granada]]. Therefore, Gibraltar changed hands again.
*1274 - The second Nasrid king, [[Muhammed II al-Faqih]], gave Gibraltar over to the [[Marinid]]s, as payment for their help against the Christian kingdoms.
*1309 - While the King [[Ferdinand IV of Castile]] laid siege on Algeciras, [[Alonso Pérez de Guzmán]] (known to the Spanish records as ''Guzmán el Bueno'') was sent to capture the town. This was the First Siege of Gibraltar. The Castilians took the Upper Rock from where the town was bombarded. The garrison surrendered after one month. Gibraltar then had about 1,500 inhabitants.
*[[1310]] [[31 January]] - Gibraltar was granted its first Charter by the king Ferdinand IV of Castile. Being considered a high risk town, the charter included incentives to settle there such as the offering of freedom from justice to anyone who lived in Gibraltar for one year and one day.
:This fact marked the establishment of the Gibraltar council.
*1316 - Gibraltar was unsuccessfully besieged by the Nasrid [[caid]] Yahya (Second Siege of Gibraltar).
*1333 June - A [[Marinid]]s army, lead by [[Abd al-Malik]], the son of [[Abul Hassan]], the Marinid sultan, recovered Gibraltar, after a five-month siege (Third Siege of Gibraltar).
:King [[Alfonso XI of Castile]] attempted to retake Gibraltar aided by the fleet of the Castilian Admiral [[Alonso Jofre Tenorio]]. Even a ditch was dug across the isthmus. While laying the siege, the king was attacked by a Nasrid army from Granada. Therefore, the siege ended in a truce, allowing the Marinids to keep Gibraltar (Fourth Siege of Gibraltar)
*1344 March - After a two-year siege, [[Algeciras]] was taken over by the Castilian forces. Therefore, Gibraltar became the main Marinid port in the Iberian Peninsula. During the siege, Gibraltar played a key role as the supply base of the besieged.
*1349 - Gibraltar was unsuccessfully besieged by the Castilian forces led by the king [[Alfonso XI of Castile|Alfonso XI]].
*1350 - The siege was resumed by Alfonso XI. It was again unsuccessful, mainly due to the arrival of the [[Black Death]], which decimated the besiegers, causing the death of the king (Fifth Siege of Gibraltar).
*1369 - Algeciras was taken over by the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrids]], destroyed and its harbour made unusable. This fact increased again the importance of Gibraltar in the strait trade.
*1374 - Gibraltar was recovered by the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrids]] (Sixth Siege of Gibraltar).
*1436 - [[Enrique de Guzmán]], Count of Niebla, with large estates in South Andalusia assaulted Gibraltar. However, his attack was repelled and Castilian forces suffer heavy losses (Seventh Siege of Gibraltar).

==Castilian / Spanish==
*[[1462]] [[August 20]] - Castilian forces captured Gibraltar (Eighth Siege of Gibraltar). (See [[Reconquista]]). An immediate dispute broke out between the [[House of Medina Sidonia]] (the Guzmán family) and the [[House of Arcos]] (the Ponce de León family) about the possession of the town. Finally, the initiative of Juan Alonso de Guzmán, 1st [[Duke of Medina Sidonia]] succeeded and he took possession of the town as personal property. However, the King of Castile, [[Henry IV of Castile|Henry IV]] declared Gibraltar to be Crown property and not the personal property of the Guzman family. Henry IV restored the charter granted to Gibraltar in 1310 and took two additional measures: the lands previously belonging to [[Algeciras]] (destroyed in 1369) were granted to Gibraltar; and the status of [[collegiate church]] was solicited from the pope [[Pius II]] and granted to the Santa María Church (the old Moorish Mosque). [[St. Bernard]], whose feast falls on the [[20 August]], became the Patron Saint of Gibraltar.
*1463 - In a tour through Andalusia, Henry IV was the first Christian monarch to visit Gibraltar.
*1467 July - In the midst of a nobility revolt against the King, the forces of the Duke of Medina Sidonia, after a 16-month siege, took Gibraltar. [[Alfonso of Castile]], half-brother of Henry IV, and puppet pretender handled by the nobility, granted him the Lordship of Gibraltar (Ninth Siege of Gibraltar).
*[[1469]] [[June 3]] - After the death of Alfonso de Castilla and the 1st Duke of Medina Sidonia, his son and heir [[Enrique de Guzman El Bueno, 2nd Duke of Medina Sidonia|Enrique de Guzman, 2nd Duke of Medina Sidonia]] changed side and in reward, saw the status of Gibraltar, as part of the domains of the Duke, confirmed by the Queen [[Isabella of Castile]].
*[[1470]] [[December 20]] - A new charter was granted to the town of Gibraltar, now a nobiliary town, based in the Antequera charter.
*[[1478]] [[September 30]] - The [[Catholic Monarchs]] granted the title of Marquis of Gibraltar to the Duke of Medina Sidonia.
*1492 - After conquering Granada, the Catholic Monarchs expelled the [[Jew]]s from Spain. Many passed through Gibraltar on their way into exile in North Africa.
*1492 Summer - After the death of the former Duke, his son and heir, [[Juan Alfonso Perez de Guzman El Bueno, 3rd Duke of Medina Sidonia|Juan Alfonso Perez de Guzman, 3rd Duke of Medina Sidonia]] saw his lordship over Gibraltar reluctantly renewed by the Catholic Monarchs.
*1497 - Gibraltar became the main base in the conquest of [[Melilla]] by the troops of the Duke of Medina Sidonia.
*[[1501]] [[December 2]] - Acknowledging the importance of the town, the Catholic Monarchs asked the Duke of Medina Sidonia for the return of Gibraltar to the domains of the crown. The Duke accepted the Royal request and ceded the town to the monarchs.
*[[1502]] [[January 2]] - [[Garcilaso de la Vega]] took possession of the town on behalf of the Queen Isabella of Castile.
[[Image:Gib original crest.jpg|left|thumb|The Coat of Arms of Gibraltar, granted by the Catholic Monarchs]]
*[[1502]] [[July 10]] - By a Royal Warrant passed in Toledo, the Catholic Monarchs granted to Gibraltar its [[Coat of arms of Gibraltar|coat of arms]]: &quot;An escutcheon on which the upper two thirds shall be a white field and on the said field set a red castle, and below the said castle, on the other third of the escutcheon, which must be a red field in which there must be a white line between the castle and the said red field, there shall be a golden key which hangs by a chain from the said castle, as are here figured&quot;. The Castle and Key remain the Arms of Gibraltar to this day.
*1506 - Alleging a false donation by the king [[Philip I of Castile]], the Duke of Medina Sidonia attempted to recover Gibraltar by besieging the town. The siege was unsuccessful and the Duke was admonished by the Regency and forced to pay a fee to the town. The town received the title of &quot;Most Loyal City&quot; (Tenth Siege of Gibraltar).
*[[1540]] [[September 8]] - Corsairs from the [[Barbary Coast]] (ruled by [[Khair ad Din|Barbarossa]]) raided Gibraltar and took away many captives.
*1552 - After the requests from the inhabitants of the town, [[Charles I of Spain]] (the Emperor Charles V) sent the Italian engineer [[Giovanni Battista Calvi]] to strengthen the defences of the town. A wall was built (nowadays known as [[Charles V Wall]]); also a ditch by the wall of the town and a drawbridge at the Landport (''Puerta de Tierra'').
[[Image:Battle of Gibraltar 1607.jpg|thumb|right|280px|The Battle of Gibraltar, by Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom. Oil on canvas. Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam]]
*1606 - The [[Morisco]]s (the descendants of the Muslim inhabitants in Spain) were expelled from Spain by King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]]. Many many passed through Gibraltar on their way into exile in North Africa.
*[[1607]] [[April 25]] - During the [[Eighty Years' War]] between the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] and the King of Spain, a Dutch fleet surprised and engaged a Spanish fleet anchored at the [[Bay of Gibraltar]] ([[Battle of Gibraltar]]).
*1649 - Typhoid epidemic in the town.
*1656 - In a letter {{ref|radio4}} to [[Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich|Councillor General Montagu]] (afterwards Earl of Sandwich), General-at-sea and one of the Protector's personal friends, [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] mentioned the necessity of securing a permanent base at the entry of the Mediterranean, preferably Gibraltar (the first suggestion for the occupation of Gibraltar as a naval base had been made at an English Council of War held at sea on [[October 20]] [[1625]]).
*[[1700]] [[November 1]] - King Charles II of Spain died leaving no descendents. In the autumn he had made a will bequeathing the whole of the Spanish possessions to Prince [[Philip V of Spain|Philip of Bourbon]], a grandson of Louis XIV backed by France. The other pretender, an Austrian Hapsburg, [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles]], supported by Austria, England, Holland and the Holy Roman Empire, did not accept Charles II's testament. The result was the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

==The War of the Spanish Succession==
*[[1701]] [[September]] - [[England]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Austria]] signed the [[Treaty of the Hague, 1701|Treaty of the Hague]]. By this treaty, they accepted Philippe of Anjou as King of Spain, but allotted Austria the Spanish territories in Italy and the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. England and the Netherlands, meanwhile, were to retain their commercial rights in Spain. Later (in 1703), [[Portugal]], [[Savoy]] and some German states joined the alliance.
*[[1702]] May - Full-scale war broke out. It was the formal beginning of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].
*[[1703]] [[February 12]] - The Archduke Charles was proclaimed king of Castile and Aragon in [[Vienna]]. He took the name of Charles III {{ref|charlesiii}}

==Habsburg Gibraltar (under the rule of the Archduke Charles, pretender to the Spanish Throne)==
===The Gibraltar capture===
(''There is usually a discrepancy on the chronology between Spanish and British sources. The reason is that England still used the [[Julian calendar#From Julian to Gregorian|Julian calendar]]. By 1704, the Julian calendar was eleven days behind the Gregorian. Therefore, the siege began on [[21 July]] according to the Julian calendar'')
[[Image:George Rooke.jpg|thumb|left|200px|George Rooke, the commander of the Anglo-Dutch fleet that conquered Gibraltar on behalf of the Archduke Charles]]
*[[1704]] [[August 1]] - During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], and when returning from a failed expedition to Barcelona, an Anglo-Dutch fleet, under the command of sir [[George Rooke]], chief commander of the Alliance Navy, began a new siege (the eleventh siege of the town). They demanded its unconditional surrender and an oath of loyalty to the [[Habsburg]] pretender to the Spanish throne, the [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles]]. The Governor of Gibraltar, [[Diego de Salinas]], refused the ultimatum. A brigade of [[Dutch Royal Marines|Dutch]] and [[Royal Marines|British Marines]], 1,800 strong, under the command of [[Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt]], chief commander of the Alliance Army in Spain, began to besiege Gibraltar, in the name of the Archduke Charles. A small group of Spaniards, mainly Catalans, was integrated in the troops of the Prince of Hesse.
*1704 night of 3-[[4 August]] - Heavy shelling targeted the castle and the town.
*[[1704]] [[August 4]] - The Governor Diego de Salinas surrendered the town to Prince George of Hesse, who took it in the name of Archduke, as Charles III, king of Castile and Aragon. This was the end of the Eleventh Siege of Gibraltar (a map on the situation of attacking forces can be seen in {{ref|map}})
: The exact beginning of the English/British occupation of Gibraltar has been over the time imprecise. From the 18th century, Spanish sources reported that immediately after the takeover of the city, Sir [[George Rooke]], the British admiral, on his own initiative caused the British flag to be hoisted, and took possession of the Rock in name of [[Anne I of the United Kingdom|Queen Anne]], whose government ratified the occupation. On the other hand, even the British or the Gibraltarians sometimes date the beginning of British sovereignty in 1704 (for instance, in its speech at the United Nations in 1994, the Gibraltar Chief Minister at the time, [[Joe Bossano]], stated that ''Gibraltar has been a British colony ever since it was taken by Britain in 1704'' {{ref|bossano}}). Also, some British sources have accounted the flag story (''He [Rooke] had the Spanish flag hauled down and the English flag hoisted in its stead'' {{ref|tercentenary}}; ''Rooke's men quickly raised the British flag ... and Rooke claimed the Rock in the name of Queen Anne'' {{ref_label|radio4|1|a}}; or ''Sir George Rooke, the British admiral, on his own responsibility caused the British flag to be hoisted, and took possession in name of Queen Anne, whose government ratified the occupation'' {{ref|britannica}}).

: However, it is proved by present-day historians, both Spanish and British, that this version is apocryphal since no contemporary source accounts it. Isidro Sepúlveda {{ref|Sepulveda1}}, William Jackson {{ref|Jackson1}} and George Hills {{ref|Hills1}} explicitly refute it (Sepúlveda points out that if such a fact had actually happened, it would have caused a big crisis in the Alliance supporting the Archduke Charles; George Hills explains that the story was first accounted by the Marquis of San Felipe, who wrote his book &quot;Comentarios de la guerra de España e historia de su rey Phelipe V el animoso&quot; in 1725, more than twenty years after the fact; the marquis was not an eye-witness and cannot be considered as a reliable source for the facts that took place in Gibraltar in 1704. As Hills concludes: &quot;''The flag myth ... may perhaps be allowed now to disappear from Anglo-Spanish polemics. On the one side it has been used to support a claim to the Rock 'by right of conquest'; on the other to ... pour on Britain obloquy for perfidy''&quot; {{ref_label|Hills1|9|a}}).
: What does seem nowadays proved is that the British troops who had landed on the South Mole area raised their flag to signal their presence to the ships, and avoid being fired upon by their own side.
*[[1704]] [[August 7]]. A large column of inhabitants of the city (4,000 according to most of the sources, such as Hills {{ref|Hills2}} or Jackson {{ref|Jackson2}}), with Queen Isabella's banner at their head, and led by the Spanish Governor, Diego de Salinas, the Spanish garrison and the members of the city council, abandoned the city. Most of them took refuge in the proximity of the Chapel of [[Saint Roch|San Roque]], possibly hoping for a rapid reconquest of the town, where the Gibraltar council was re-established two years later, founding a new town named [[San Roque (Cádiz)|San Roque]] (therefore San Roque official [[motto]] is &quot;The town of San Roque, where that of Gibraltar lives on&quot;, in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: 'La Ciudad de San Roque, donde reside la de Gibraltar' {{ref|sanroquemotto}}. The refugees took with them the symbols and objects of Gibraltar's history: the council and ecclesiastical records, including the historical documents signed by the Spanish [[Catholic Monarchs]] in 1502, granting Gibraltar's coat of arms, and the statue of the Holy Crowned [[Virgin Mary]]{{ref_label|Hills2|10|a}}{{ref_label|Jackson2|11|a}}. These objects remain nowadays in San Roque {{ref|sanroquesymbols}}. Others settled down in what today is [[Los Barrios]] or even further away, in the ruins of the abandoned city of [[Algeciras]]. Only about seventy people remained in the town, most of them religious, people without family or belonging to the [[Genoa|Genovese]] trader colony {{ref|Sepulveda2}}{{ref|Hills3}} (see list in {{ref|oldinhabitants}}). The traditions of the villages that received those refugees still talk of this departure as the ''Exodus of Gibraltar'' (''Éxodo de Gibraltar'').
*[[1704]] [[August 24]] - The Alliance fleet, under the command of Rooke, set sail from Gibraltar and intercepted a joint Spanish-French fleet that attempted to recover Gibraltar by the coast of [[Málaga]] ([[battle of Málaga]]). The result was uncertain, with heavy losses on both sides, but anyway the Spanish-French fleet was stopped and prevented from arriving at Gibraltar.

===The first Spanish siege (Twelfth Siege of Gibraltar)===
*[[1704]] [[September 5]] - Troops of [[France]] and [[Spain]] under the [[Francisco Castillo Fajardo, marquis of Villadarias|marquis of Villadarias]], General Captain of Andalusia, started to besiege Gibraltar to try to recover it (this one would be the Twelfth Siege of Gibraltar). In the town, the Marine brigade, still under the command of the British admiral Sir [[John Leake]], and the governor, Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt (who had commanded the land forces in August), and reinforced shortly before by a further 400 [[Royal Marines]], held the fortress against repeated attacks. 
*[[1704]] [[November 11]] - A notable incident during the siege: 500 French and Spanish volunteer [[grenadier]]s tried to surprise the garrison. Captain Fisher of the Marines with 17 of his men successfully defended the Round Tower against their assault. A contemporary report of this noted defence says, &quot;Encouraged by the Prince of Hesse, the garrison did more than could humanly be expected, and the English Marines gained an immortal glory&quot;.
*1705 January - Philip V replaced Villadarias with by the [[Marshal of France]] [[René de Froulay, Count de Tessé|de Tessé]].
*[[1705]] [[February 7]] - The last assault before the arrival of de Tessé was executed. The Gibraltar wall was damaged, but French troops refused to go on until the arrival of de Tessé (who arrived the day after). The assault becomes unsuccessful.
*[[1705]] [[March 31]] - The Count de Tessé gave up the siege and retired.

===During the rest of the war===
Although nominally in the hands of the Archduke Charles, Britain began to monopolize the rule of the town. Even if the formal transfer of sovereignty would not take place until the signature of the Treaty of Utrecht, the British Governor and garrison become the ''de facto'' rulers of the town.

*[[1705]] [[August 2]] - The Archduke Charles stopped over in Gibraltar in his way to the territories of the [[Crown of Aragon]]. The Prince of Hesse joined him, thus leaving the town (he would die one month later in the siege of [[Barcelona]]). The English Major General [[John Shrimpton]] was left as governor (appointed by the Archduke Charles on the recommendation of [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]).
*[[1706]] [[February 17]] - [[Anne I of the United Kingdom|Queen Anne]], though she has no powers to do so, declared Gibraltar a free port (upon request of the Sultan of Morocco, who wanted Gibraltar being given this status in return for supplying the town){{ref|Jackson3}}.
*[[1707]] [[24 December]] - The first British Governor directly appointed by the Queen Anne, [[Roger Elliott]], took up residence in the Convent of the Franciscan Friars.
*1711 - The British government, then in the hands of the [[tory|tories]], covertly ordered the British Gibraltar governor, [[Thomas Stanwix]], to expel any foreign (not British) troops (to foster the Great Britain's sole right to Gibraltar in the negotiations running up between Britain and France). Although he answered positively, he allowed a Dutch regiment to stay. It remained there until March 1713. {{ref_label|Jackson3|17|a}}

==British rule==
===Treaty of Utrecht===
[[Image:Allegory of the Peace of 1714.jpg|right|thumb|Allegory of the Peace of 1714]]
*1713 - The territory was subsequently ceded to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in perpetuity by [[Spain]] in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaties of Utrecht]]. Despite some military attempts by the Spanish to retake it in the 18th century, most notably in the Great Siege of 1779-1783, the Rock has remained under British control ever since.
:In that treaty, Spain ceded Great Britain &quot;''the full and entire propriety of the town and castle of Gibraltar, together with the port, fortifications, and forts thereunto belonging ... for ever, without any exception or impediment whatsoever.''&quot;
:The Treaty stipulated that no overland trade between Gibraltar and Spain was to take place, except for emergency provisions in the case that Gibraltar is unable to be supplied by sea. Another condition of the cession was that &quot;''no leave shall be given under any pretence whatsoever, either to Jews or Moors, to reside or have their dwellings in the said town of Gibraltar.''&quot; This was never enforced and Gibraltar has had for many years an established Jewish community, along with Muslims from North Africa.
:Finally, under the Treaty, should the British crown wish to dispose of Gibraltar, that of Spain should be offered the territory first.

===Until the Peninsular Wars===
*1721 March - Philip V of Spain requested the restitution of Gibraltar to proceed to the renewal of the trade licenses of Great Britain with the Spanish possessions in America.
*1721 [[June 1]] - [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] sent a letter to Philip V promising &quot;''to make use of the first favourable Opportunity to regulate this Article (the Demand touching the Restitution of Gibraltar), with the Consent of my Parliament''&quot; {{ref|lettergeorgei}}. However, the British Parliament never endorsed such promise.
*1727 February-June - Second of the sieges by Spain tried to recapture Gibraltar (Thirteenth Siege of Gibraltar). Depending on the sources, Spanish troops were between 12,000 and 25,000. British defenders were 1,500 at the beginning of the siege, increasing up to about 5,000. After a five-month siege with several unsuccessful and costly attempts, Spanish troops give up and retire.
*1729 - At the end of the Anglo-Spanish War of 1727-1729, the Treaty of Seville confirming all previous treaties (including the Treaty of Utrecht) allowed Great Britain to keep [[Menorca]] and Gibraltar.
*1730 - A Belgian Engineer, the Marquis of Verboom, Chief Engineer of the Spanish Royal Engineer Corps, who has taken part in the 1727 siege, arrived in San Roque commissioned by the Spanish government to design a line of fortifications across the isthmus. Fort San Felipe and Fort Santa Barbara are built. The fortifications, known to the British as the Spanish Lines, and to Spain as ''La Línea de Contravalación'' were the origin of modern-day town of [[La Línea de la Concepción]].
* [[1776]] [[February 23]] - One of the heaviest storms ever recorded in Gibraltar. The lower part of the town was flooded. Linewall was breached along 100 m.
*1779 June - In the midst of the [[American Revolutionary War]], Spain declared war against Great Britain (France had done it the year before)
[[Image:The Siege and Relief of Gibraltar.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The Siege and Relief of Gibraltar, [[13 September]] [[1782]]. By John Singleton Copley (1738-1815)]]
*1779 July - Start of the '''Great Siege of Gibraltar''' (fourteenth and last military siege). This was an action by French and Spanish forces to wrest control of Gibraltar from the established British Garrison. The garrison, led by [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield of Gibraltar|George Augustus Eliott, later 1st Baron Heathfield of Gibraltar]], survived all attacks and a blockade of supplies.
*1782 [[September 13]] - Start of an assault involving 100,000 men, 48 ships and 450 cannon. The British garrison survived.
*1783 February. By now the siege was over, and George Augustus Eliott was awarded the [[Knight of the Bath]] and was created 1st Baron Heathfield of Gibraltar. The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaties of Versailles]] reaffirmed previous treaties.
:In 1782, work on the [[Great Siege Tunnels]] started. The tunnels became a great and complex system of underground fortifications which nowadays criss-crosses the inside of the Rock. Once the Siege was over, the fortifications were rebuilt and, in the following century, the walls were lined with [[Portland limestone]]. Such stone gives the walls their present white appearance.
* 1802 - Several mutinies among some regiments garrisoned in Gibraltar.
* 1803 June - [[Horatio Nelson|Admiral Nelson]] arrived in Gibraltar as Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean.
* 1804 - Great epidemic of &quot;Malignant Fever&quot; broke out. Although traditionally labelled as &quot;Yellow Fever&quot; now it is thought to have been [[typhus]].
* 1805 January - The great epidemic ended. Over a third of the civilian population (5,946 people) died.
* [[1805]] [[October 21]] - [[Battle of Trafalgar]].
* [[1805]] [[October 28]] - [[HMS Victory]] was towed into Gibraltar bringing Nelson's body aboard. The Trafalgar Cemetery still exists today in Gibraltar.
*1806 - Gibraltar was made a Catholic [[Apostolic Vicariate]] (until then Gibraltar belonged to the [[Episcopal see|See]] of [[Cadiz]]). Since 1840 the vicar is always a titular [[bishop]]. {{ref|catholic}}
*1810 - Britain and Spain became allies against Napoleon.
*1810 February - The Governor of Gibraltar removed the Spanish forts of San Felipe and Santa Barbara, located on the northern boundary of the neutral ground. Fearing that the forts might fall into French hands, [[Colin Campbell (Gibraltar Governor)|Lieutenant General Sir Colin Campbell]] instructed Royal Engineers to blow the forts up. Such a task was carried out on [[February 14]] together with the demolition of the rest of fortifications of the Spanish Lines.
: According to George Hills {{ref|Hills4}}, there are no primary sources that could explain whether such a demolition was requested or authorized by any Spanish or British authority. According to him, over the time, three different theories has been handled: (a) Campbell ordered the demolition on his own responsibility (b) under instructions from the British Government (c) upon request of Spanish [[Francisco Javier Castaños|General Castaños]], who was at the time in Cádiz. Spanish authors from 1840 have usually favoured theory (b) while British ones have supported (c). As long as there is no contemporary source or dispatch on the topic, Hills does not personally discard (a) considering it the most likely possibility.
* During the [[Peninsular War]], contingents from the Gibraltar Garrison were sent to aid Spanish resistance to the French at Cádiz and [[Tarifa]].

===Until the Second World War===
[[Image:Tipos de Gibraltar.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Characters of Gibraltar (R.P. Napper, 1863; private collection)]]
*1814 - Outbreak of malignant fever.
*1817 - The first civil judge was established.
*[[1822]] [[August 21]] - The [[Anglican]] Diocese of Gibraltar was founded by Letters Patent and took over the pastoral care of the chaplaincies and congregations from Portugal to the Caspian Sea.
*1830 - Gibraltar became a [[British Crown Colony]].
:[[Royal Gibraltar Police|Gibraltar Police Force]] was established.
*1869 - The [[Suez Canal]] was opened. It heavily increased the strategic value of the Rock in the route from the United Kingdom to India.
*1894 - The construction of the dockyards started. 
*[[1908]] [[August 5]] - The British Ambassador in Madrid informed the Spanish Minister of State 'as an act of courtesy', of the British Government's intention to build a fence along the line of British sentries on the isthmus to prevent smuggling and reduce sentry duty. According to the British government, the fence was erected inside British territory. Spain does not recognize the fence as the valid border, since it claims the fence was build on Spanish soil. Even though Spain, the [[United Kingdom]] and Gibraltar are all part of the [[European Union]], the border fence is still relevant today since Gibraltar is outside the [[customs union]]. The border crossing is open 24-hours a day as required by EU law.
*1921 - Gibraltar was granted a City Council status in recognition for its contribution to the British war efforts in the [[First World War]]. The council had a small minority of elected persons. First elections held in Gibraltar.

===Second World War and after===
The history of Gibraltar from the Second World War is characterized by two main elements: the increasing autonomy and self-governing achieved by Gibraltarians and the re-emergence of the Spanish claim, especially during the years of the [[Francisco Franco|Francoist]] dictatorship.
[[Image:Gibralter2.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of Gibraltar in 1939. Published by Illustrated London News]]
*1939-1945 - During the [[Second World War]] the civilian residents of Gibraltar were evacuated, and the Rock was again turned into a fortress. Control of Gibraltar gave the [[Allied Powers]] control of the entry to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] (the other side of the Strait being Spanish territory, and thus neutral). The Rock was a key part of the Allied supply lines to [[Malta]] and North Africa and base of the British Navy Force H, and the horse [[racecourse]] near the fence was converted into an [[airport]]. The repatriation of the civilians started in 1944 and proceeded for some six years. However most of the population had returned by 1946.
*:[[1940]] [[July 4]] - French bombers, based in French Morocco, carried out a retailatory air raid over Gibraltar as a reprisal for the [[Destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir|destruction of the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir, Algeria,]] by the Force H (about 1,300 French sailors were killed and about 350 were wounded in the action against the French fleet). No great effect took place.
*:1941 - Germany planned to occupy Gibraltar (and presumably hand it over to Spain) in &quot;Operation Felix&quot; which was due to start on [[10 January]] [[1941]] {{ref|felix}}. It was cancelled because the Spanish government were reluctant to let the [[Wehrmacht]] enter Spain and then attack against the Rock, its civilians or the British Army from Spanish soil, because [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] feared that it may have been impossible to remove the Wehrmacht afterwards. In any case, [[Hitler]] was too busy elsewhere in Europe to give this much priority.
*:1940-1943 - Gibraltar harbour was attacked many times by [[Italian commando frogmen#Earlier history : Decima Flottiglia MAS|Italian commando frogmen]].
*:1942 September - A small group of Gibraltarians, who remained in the town serving in the British Army, joined a mechanic official, [[Albert Risso]], to create 'The Gibraltarians Association', the starting point of what be named the [[Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights]] (officially established in December that year), the first political party in Gibraltar. [[Joshua Hassan]] (a young lawyer then, later Sir and Chief Minister) was among the leading members of such association. The AACR was the dominant party in the Gibraltar politics for the last third of the 20th Century.
*:[[1942]] [[8 November]] - [[Operation Torch]] launched with support from Gibraltar.
*1946 - The United Kingdom inscribed Gibraltar in the list of [[Non-Self-Governing Territories]] kept by the UN Special Committee on Decolonization .
*1950 - Gibraltar's first Legislative Council was opened.
*1954 - This was the 250th anniversary of its capture. [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] visited Gibraltar, which angered [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]], who renewed its [[Disputed status of Gibraltar|claim]] to sovereignty, which had not been actively pursued for over 150 years. This led to the closure of the Spanish [[consulate]] and to the imposition of restrictions on freedom of movement between Gibraltar and Spain. By the 1960s, motor vehicles were being restricted or banned from crossing the border, while only Spanish nationals employed on the Rock being allowed to enter Gibraltar. For about 30 years, the land border was closed (from the Spanish side), to try to isolate the territory.
*1955 - Spain joined [[United Nations]].
:At the United Nations, Spain reactivated its claim, arguing that the principle of [[Territorial integrity|territorial integrity]], not [[Self-determination|self-determination]], applied in the case of the decolonization of Gibraltar, and that the United Kingdom should cede sovereignty of the Rock to Spain (what the Spanish Government named &quot;retrocession&quot;). Madrid gained diplomatic support from countries in [[Latin America]], with the [[UN General Assembly]] passing resolutions (2231 (XXI), &quot;Question of Gibraltar&quot; {{ref|un2231}} and 2353 (XXII), &quot;Question of Gibraltar&quot; {{ref|un2353}}) urging United Kingdom and Spain to overcome their differences, respecting the &quot;interests&quot; of the people of Gibraltar. The latter resolution, which explicitly accepts the Spanish position on the territorial integrity, was supported by 73 countries (mainly Latin American, Arab, African and Easter European countries), rejected by 19 (United Kingdom and the countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]), while 27 countries abstained (Western Europe and the United States). For its part, United Kingdom stated that it would respect the &quot;wishes&quot; of the people of Gibraltar, and that there would be no change of sovereignty against their democratically expressed wishes. Resolution 2353 keeps on being the official position of the United Nations on the &quot;question of Gibraltar&quot;, since no new resolution has been issued on the question since then.
:A group of six Gibraltarian lawyers and businessmen, calling themselves ''palomos'' or 'doves', advocated a political settlement with Spain {{ref|incipe}} in a letter published in the ''Gibraltar Chronicle'', and met with Spanish Foreign Office officials (a meeting was even held with the very Spanish Foreign Office Minister) to try and bring this about {{ref|Jackson4}}. This provoked widespread public hostility in Gibraltar (with attacks to their homes and properties {{ref|doves}} and civil unrest). Even now, the 'doves' have not been &quot;forgiven&quot; and are still called traitors.
*1965 April - The British Government published a White Paper dealing with the question of Gibraltar and the Treaty of Utrecht.
*1966 - In response, the Spanish Foreign Office Minister [[Fernando Castiella]], published and presented to the Spanish Courts the &quot;Spanish Red Book&quot; (named so because of its cover; its reference is &quot;Negociaciones sobre Gibraltar. Documentos presentados a las Cortes Españolas por el Ministro de Asuntos Exteriores&quot;, Madrid, 1967)
*1967 - A [[referendum]] was held on [[10 September]], in which Gibraltar's voters were asked whether they wished to either pass under Spanish sovereignty, or remain under British sovereignty, with institutions of self-government.
: The Spanish claim had little chance of being accepted by Gibraltarians, even having promised that Gibraltarians could keep their British citizenship and the town would retain a special status within Spain. At that time, such a claim was being made by an extreme right-wing dictatorship which had arisen from a bloody civil war (neutral but aligned with the [[Axis Powers]] in the Second World War) which did not allow its own citizens the civil liberties that the British government guaranteed to the Gibraltarians. Furthermore, the Spanish economy, though beginning to grow, was still very backward (especially compared to the living standard the Gibraltarians had achieved), while at the same time working class people across the frontier were living in a state of great poverty. The idea of Spain participating in any way the sovereignty of the Rock was (and remains) unacceptable to Gibraltarian public opinion.
: Not surprisingly, Gibraltarians ignored Spanish pressure and voted overwhelmingly by 12,138 to 44 to remain under British sovereignty. Although the Spanish government got a diplomatic triumph in the United Nations (since the resolution 2353 states that ''the holding of the referendum [...] to be a contravention of the provisions of General Assembly resolution 2231 (XXI)''), it had no effect in the political evolution of Gibraltar.
: Another result of the Spanish campaign was the emergence of a movement for the integration of Gibraltar with the United Kingdom. In February, the [[Integration with Britain Party]], hitherto a “pressure group”, formed itself into a political party under the leadership of [[Bob Peliza]].
*1969 [[May 30]] - A new constitution for Gibraltar was introduced by the United Kingdom Parliament, under the initiative of the British Government (Gibraltar Constitutional Order, of [[30 May]] [[1969]]). Under it, Gibraltar attained full internal self-government, with an elected House of Assembly. The preamble to the Constitution stated that:
:''&quot;Her Majesty's Government will never enter into arrangements under which the people of Gibraltar would pass under the sovereignty of another state against their freely and democratically expressed wishes.&quot;''
*[[1969]] [[June 8]] - In response, Spain closed the border with Gibraltar, and severed all communication links. The closure affected both sides of the border. Gibraltarians with families in Spain had to go by ferry to [[Tangier]], [[Morocco]], and from there to the Spanish port of [[Algeciras]], while many Spanish workers (by then about 4,800; sixteen years before, about 12,500 Spanish workmen entered Gibraltar every day {{ref|spaniards}}{{ref|Jackson5}}) lost their jobs in Gibraltar.
: The closing of the border was a severe shock for the Gibraltarians, who became aware that across the frontier there was a hostile and threatening foreign power. The closure of the fence would last thirteen years and was considered the Gibraltarians as the last in a series of sieges held by Spain to attempt to secure the surrender of the town.
*1969 - Major [[Robert Peliza|Robert (later Sir Robert) Peliza]] of the [[Integration with Britain Party]] (IWBP) was elected Chief Minister.
*1972 - Joshua Hassan of the [[Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights]] (AACR) was returned to power. 
*1973 - Gibraltar joined the [[European Economic Community]] alongside the United Kingdom.
*1975 - The British [[Foreign Office]] Minister [[Roy Hattersley]] ruled out integration with the UK, and stated that any constitutional change would have to involve a 'Spanish dimension'. This position was reaffirmed the following year when the British government rejected the House of Assembly's proposals for constitutional reform. The IWBP broke up and was succeeded by the Democratic Party of British Gibraltar (DPBG), led first by Maurice Xiberras, formerly of the IWBP, and subsequently by Peter Isola.
*1975 - Spanish dictator General [[Francisco Franco]] died, but this situation with regard to Gibraltar remained unchanged, with the border not partially reopened until 1982 (fully in 1985).
*[[1980]] [[July]] - The new Anglican [[Diocese of Europe]] was formed, with the former Diocese of Gibraltar and the Jurisdiction of North and Central Europe. The new diocese became the 44th Diocese of the Church of England. Gibraltar's Holy Trinity Church was consecrated as diocese Cathedral.
*1981 - The [[British Nationality Act 1981]] effectively made Gibraltar a ''Dependent Territory'' and removed the right of entry inansport in Grenada| ]]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[United States]], [[Venezuela]], [[Cuba]], and the [[People's Republic of China]] have embassies in Grenada. The [[United Kingdom]] is represented by a resident commissioner (as opposed to the governor general who represents the British monarch). Grenada has been recognized by most members of the United Nations and maintains diplomatic missions in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Canada]].

Grenada announced the resumption of diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China on January 20, 2005.

Grenada is a member of the Caribbean Development Bank, [[CARICOM]], the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), and the Commonwealth of Nations. It joined the [[United Nations]] in 1974, and the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Organization of American States in 1975. Grenada also is a member of the Eastern Caribbean's Regional Security System (RSS).

As a member of [[CARICOM]] Grenada strongly backed efforts by the United States to implement UN Security Council Resolution 940, designed to facilitate the departure of Haiti's de facto authorities from power. Grenada subsequently contributed personnel to the multinational force which restored the democratically elected government of [[Haiti]] in October 1994.

Prime Minister Mitchell joined President Clinton, in May 1997, for a meeting with 14 other Caribbean leaders during the first-ever U.S.-regional summit in [[Bridgetown, Barbados]]. The summit strengthened the basis for regional cooperation on justice and counter-narcotics issues, finance and development, and trade.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''history of Guam''' involves phases including the early arrival of people known today as the ancient [[Chamorros]], the development of &quot;pre-contact&quot; society, [[Spain|Spanish]] [[colonization]], and the present [[United States|American]] rule of the island.  Guam's history of colonialism is the longest among the Pacific islands. 



==Guam prior to European contact==

===Migrations===
[[Image:Gadao_Guam.jpg|thumb|px300|Chief [[Gadao]] is featured in many legends about Guam before European colonization.]]
It is believed that [[Guam]] was first discovered by sea-faring people who migrated from [[Indonesia#Geography|southeastern Indonesia]] around 2000 BC.  Another theory points to the [[Philippines]] as a possible origin.  Most of what is known about Pre-Contact (&quot;Ancient&quot;) [[Chamorros]] comes from legends and myths, archaeological evidence, [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] accounts, and observations from visiting scientists like [[Otto von Kotzebue]] and [[Louis de Freycinet]].

===Chamorro society===
Chamorro society roughly fell into three classes: matua (upper class), achaot (middle class), and mana'chang (lower class).  The matua were located in the coastal [[Villages of Guam|villages]], which meant they had the best access to fishing grounds, while the mana'chang were located in the interior of the island.  Matua and mana'chang rarely communicated with each other, and matua often used achaot as a go-between.  There were also &quot;makana&quot; (shamans), skilled in healing and medicine.  When Europeans first arrived on Guam, the Chamorros were noted for their fast sailing vessels and [[trade|traded]] with other islands of [[Micronesia]]. 

===Latte===
The &quot;[[Latte Stones|latte stones]]&quot; familiar to Guam residents and visitors alike were in fact a recent development in Pre-Contact Chamorro society.  The latte stone consists of a head and a base shaped out of limestone.  Like the [[Easter Island]] statues, there is plenty of speculation over how this was done by a society without machines or metal, but the generally accepted view is that the head and base were etched out of the ground by sharp adzes and picks (possibly with the use of fire), and carried to the assembly area by an elaborate system of ropes and logs.  The latte stone was used as a part of the raised foundation for a magalahi (matua chief) house, although they may have also been used for canoe sheds.         

Archaeologists using carbon-dating have broken Pre-Contact Guam (i.e. Chamorro) history into three periods: &quot;Pre-Latte&quot; (BC 2000? to AD 1) &quot;Transitional Pre-Latte&quot; (AD 1 to AD 1000), and &quot;Latte&quot; (AD 1000 to AD 1521).  Archaeological evidence also suggests that Chamorro society was on the verge of another transition phase by 1521, as latte stones became bigger.  Assuming the stones were used for chiefly houses, it can be argued that Chamorro society was becoming more stratified, either from population growth or the arrival of new people.  The theory remains tenuous, however, due to lack of evidence, but if proven correct, will further support the idea that Pre-Contact Chamorros lived in a vibrant and dynamic environment.

==The Spanish Era==
===&quot;Discovery&quot;===
[[Image:Svitores Guam.jpg|thumb|px200|Engraving showing the death of Padre [[San Vitores]], the first missionary to Guam.]]
On [[March 6]], [[1521]] [[Ferdinand Magellan]] came across Guam on his [[expedition]] to [[circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] around the globe. He and his crewmen were greeted by the [[Chamorros]], in small fast vessels called &quot;flying [[proa|proas]]&quot;.  They welcomed the Europeans with [[food]] and drink. According to Chamorro folk history, the Chamorros expected to be paid in return while the Europeans saw the supplies given to them as gifts. When &amp;mdash; having not been recompensed for the food and hospitality &amp;mdash; the Chamorros stole upon Magellan's ships taking [[iron]] from the decks.  In response, the Spaniards killed several islanders and burned their homes. Magellan and his men left Guam and continued their journey to the spice islands. Angry at the 'larcenous' natives, he first dubbed Guam and the rest of the [[Mariana Islands]] &quot;Las Islas de los Ladrones&quot;, (The Islands of the Thieves), but in [[1668]] the first [[missionary]] to Guam, Padre [[San Vitores]], changed the name to &quot;Las Marianas&quot; after [[Mariana of Austria]], widow of Spain's [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]].

===Colonization===
Within decades, Guam was [[colony|colonized]] by [[Spain]].  It was an important stop along the Spanish route between the [[Philippines]] and [[Mexico]] for trade galleons and whaling ships.  The [[Indigenous peoples| original inhabitant population]] dwindled significantly as a result of [[disease]] and [[rebellion]] against the Spaniards. Much of the adult male population was killed.  Still, a population of those who identified themselves as Chamorros remained, though the [[culture]] and bloodlines began to incorporate Spanish and other European [[religion]], [[Convention (philosophy and social sciences)|custom]]s, and [[language]].

==The American Era==

===Capture of Guam===
[[Image:Piti 1900.jpg|thumb|350px|The [[Villages of Guam|village]] of [[Piti, Guam|Piti]] shortly after Guam's capture by the Americans.
]]
On [[June 21]], [[1898]], Guam was captured by the [[United States]] in the bloodless [[Battle of Guam (1898)|Battle of Guam]] during the [[Spanish-American War]]. By the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]], Spain officially ceded Guam to the United States.  Since then, Guam served as a way station for American ships traveling to and from the [[Philippines]].  

The 1910 [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] wrote, &quot;Guam is 32 miles long, from 3 to 10 miles broad, and about 200 sq. miles in area. Of its total population of 11,490 (11,159 natives), [[Agana]], the capital, contains about 7,000. Possessing a good harbour, the island serves as a United States [[Apra Harbor| naval station]], the naval commandant acting also as [[governor]]. The products of the island are [[maize]], [[copra]], [[rice]], [[sugar]], and valuable [[timber]].&quot;

===World War II===
During [[World War II]], Guam was attacked and invaded by the [[Japan]]ese [[Imperial Japanese Army|armed forces]] shortly after [[December 7]], [[1941]]. Most U.S. military personnel evacuated prior to the invasion.  The Japanese [[military occupation]] lasted from 1941 to 1944 and was a brutal experience for the Chamorro people, whose loyalty to the United States became a point of contention with the Japanese. Some American servicemen were still on the island and were hidden by the Chamorro people.  The [[Battle of Guam]] started on [[July 21]], [[1944]] with American troops landing on the island and Guam was recaptured from Japanese military rule on [[August 10]] in an [[Allies | Allied]] victory.

The immediate years after [[World War II]] saw the [[United States armed forces|U.S. Navy]] attempting to resume its predominance in Guam affairs.  This eventually led to resentment, and thus increased political pressure for greater [[autonomy]] from Chamorro leaders. The result was the [[Organic Act of 1950]] (signed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]]), which established Guam as an [[unincorporated]] [[organized territory]] of the [[United States]] and, for the first time in Guam History, provided for a civilian government. The [[Immigration and Nationality Act]] of 1952, section 307, granted [[U.S. citizenship]] to &quot;all persons born in the island of Guam on or after April 11, 1899 (whether before or after August 1, 1950)&quot;.  In the [[1960s]], under [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]], the island's required [[security clearance]] for visitors was lifted.  

Guam's [[U.S. military]] installations are among the most strategically vital in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. When the [[United States]] closed its [[United States Navy|Navy]] and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] bases in the [[Philippines]] after the expiration of their leases in the early 1990's, most of the forces stationed there were relocated to Guam.

===Self-Determination===
On September 11, 1968, eighteen years after passage of the Organic Act, Congress passed the &quot;Elective Governor Act&quot; (Public Law 90-497), which allowed the people of Guam to elect their own governor and lieutenant governor. Nearly four years later, Congress passed the &quot;Guam-[[Virgin Islands]] Delegate&quot; Act that allowed for one non-voting Guam delegate in the House of Representatives.  Although Public Law 94-584 established the formation of a &quot;locally drafted&quot; constitution (later known as the &quot;Guam Constitution&quot;), the proposed document was rejected by Guam residents in an [[August 4]], [[1979]] referendum.    

In the meantime, Guam's local government had formed several [[political status]] commissions to address possible options for [[self-determination]].  The following year after passage of the Guam Delegate Act saw the creation of the &quot;Status Commission&quot; by the Twelth Guam Legislature.  This was followed by the establishment of the &quot;Second Political Status Commission&quot; in 1975 and the Guam &quot;Commission on Self-Determination&quot; (CSD) in 1980.  The Twenty-Fourth Guam Legislature established the &quot;Commission on Decolonization&quot; in 1996 to enhance CSD's ongoing studies of various political status options and public education campaigns.   

These efforts enabled the CSD, barely two years after its creation, to organize Guam's first political status referendum on January 12, 1982.  Forty-nine percent, or almost half, of all Guam residents who voted, chose a closer relationship with the United States via [[Commonwealth]].  Twenty-six percent voted [[State|Statehood]], while ten percent voted for the Status Quo ([[Incorporated territory|Unincorporated territory]]).  Smaller groups voted for [[Incorporated territory]] status (5%), [[Associated State|Free Association]] (4%), [[Independence]] (4%), and &quot;other&quot; political status options (2%).  A subsequent run-off election held between Commonwealth and Statehood saw seventy-three percent, or nearly three-fourth's, of Guam voters choosing Commonwealth over Statehood (27%).  

Not until 1988, six years after Guam residents overwhelmingly approved Commonwealth status, was the first Guam Commonwealth Act introduced into Congress.  Delegates have subsequently reintroduced the bill with little success.  

A 2005 monograph by Guam historian Dirk A. Ballendorf and Washington D.C. legal expert Howard P. Willens (&quot;Secret Guam Study&quot;) examines a recently declassified U.S. Federal study of Guam's political status.  The report was commissioned by President [[Gerald Ford]] at the behest of Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]], but conducted by the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]].  Delays, however, meant that the study was not completed until the end of the Ford administration.  The documents were then shelved and classified, with few officials in the Carter administration, let alone Capitol Hill, even aware of their existence.  [[Antonio Borja Won Pat|Antonio Won Pat Borja]], Guam's Washington delegate, and other GovGuam officials involved in political status negotiations at that time were also not informed about the study.

===Contemporary Guam===
The removal of Guam's security clearance allowed for the development of a [[tourism]] industry.  The island's rapid economic development was fueled both by rapid growth in this industry as well as increased U.S. Federal Government spending during the [[1980s]] and [[1990s]].  The [[Asian financial crisis|Asian economic crisis]] of the late 1990's, which particularly hit Japan hard, severely affected Guam tourism, however.  Military cutbacks in the 1990s also disrupted the island's economy.  The island's economic recovery was further hampered by devestation from Supertyphoons Paka in 1997 and Ponsonga in 2002, as well as the economic effects of the [[September 11, 2001|September 11]] terrorist attacks.  

There are nevertheless indications that Guam is recovering from these setbacks.  Japan's gradual economic recovery is reflected in increased tourist arrivals.  U.S. military spending on the island has dramatically increased as part of [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush|George W. Bush's]] [[War on Terrorism]].  Recent proposals to further increase U.S. military presence on Guam, including plans to station 7,000 [[U.S. Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] on the island, have also contributed to hopes of a complete economic revival.

The full legacy of Guam's rapid economic development remains to be seen, however.  Along with economic expansion has come tremendous population growth that poses significant political, social, and cultural, as well as economic, ramifications.  Perhaps the clearest indicator of these changes is the declining proportion of [[Chamorros]] vis-a-vis the general population.  &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; Guam poses particular challenges for Chamorros struggling to preserve their culture and identity in the face of [[acculturation]].  The increasing numbers of Chamorros, especially Chamorro youth, relocating to the U.S. Mainland, has further complicated both definition and preservation of Chamorro identity.

In the [[United States territory]] of [[Guam]], Asians, mostly Filipinos, with smaller numbers of Koreans, Chineuerrilla warfare is one of the oldest forms of [[asymmetric warfare]]. Primary contributors to modern theories of guerrilla war include [[Mao Zedong]], [[Wendell Fertig]], [[Regis Debray]], [[Vo Nguyen Giap]], [[Josip Broz Tito]], and [[Che Guevara]]. Later students of guerrilla warfare included Swiss Major [[Hans von Dach]] who wrote the now widely available Swiss Army field manual &quot;Total Resistance&quot;. 

==Etymology==
Guerrilla, from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term ''guerra'', or ''War'', with the ''-illa'' ending diminutive, could be translated as ''small war''. The term was invented in [[Spain]] to describe the tactics used to resist the [[France|French]] [[regime]] instituted by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]]. The -illa term accepts the inequal fight between civilians against an organized State Army. Its meaning was soon broadened to refer to any similar resistance of any time or place. The Spanish word for guerrilla fighter is ''guerrillero''. The change of usage of ''guerrilla'' from the tactics employed to the person implementing them is a late [[19th century]] mistake: in most languages the word still denotes the specific style of warfare. However, this is changing under the influence of broad English usage.

==Tactics==
Guerrilla tactics are based on [[intelligence]], [[ambush]], [[deception]], [[sabotage]], and [[espionage]], and their ultimate objective is usually to destabilize an authority through long, low-intensity confrontation. It can be quite successful against an unpopular foreign regime: a guerrilla army may increase the cost of maintaining an occupation or a colonial presence above what the foreign [[power (international)|power]] may wish to bear.

Commando operations are not guerrilla warfare (Richard Taber, “The War of the Flea : Guerrilla Warfare, Theory and Practice”. Paladin, London, 1977) while they lack the political goal. Commando troops, as the British commando, were a branch of the armed forces. Guerrilla warfare is the expression of [[Sun Tzu|Sun Tzu's]] [[The Art of War|Art of War]], in contrast to [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz's]] [[Total war|unlimited use of brute force]].

However, guerrilla warfare has generally been unsuccessful against native regimes, which have nowhere to retreat to and are highly knowledgeable about their own people, society, and culture. The rare examples of successful guerrilla warfare against a native regime include the [[Cuban Revolution]] and the [[Chinese Civil War]], as well as the [[Sandinista]] overthrow of a military dictatorship in [[Nicaragua]]. More common are the unsuccessful examples of guerrilla warfare, which include [[Malaysia]] (then [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]]) during the [[Malayan Emergency]], [[Bolivia]], [[Argentina]], and the [[Philippines]]. The [[Tamil Tigers|Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE), fighting for an independent homeland in the north and east of [[Sri Lanka]], achieved significant military successes against the Sri Lankan military and the government itself for twenty years. It was even able to use these tactics effectively against the [[IPKF]] forces sent by India in the mid-1980s, which were later withdrawn for varied reasons, primarily political. The mutual attrition on both sides in the island led to a ceasefire following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].

Guerrillas in wars against foreign powers do not principally direct their attacks at civilians, as they desire to obtain as much support as possible from the population as part of their tactics. Civilians are primarily attacked or assassinated as punishment for [[collaboration]]. Often such an attack will be officially sanctioned by guerrilla command or tribunal. An exception is in [[civil war]]s, where both guerrilla groups and organized armies have been known to commit [[atrocity|atrocities]] against the civilian population.

[[Mao Zedong]], during the Chinese civil war, summarized the Red Army's principles of warfare in the following points for his troops: ''The enemy advances, we retreat. The enemy camps, we harass. The enemy tires, we attack. The enemy retreats, we pursue.''  Mao made a distinction between [[Mobile Warfare]] (''yundong zhan'') and Guerrilla Warfare (''youji zhan'').

[[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] of the [[Irish Republican Army]], who orchestrated the [[Anglo-Irish war]] of 1919-1921, had a more succinct principle behind his campaign of intelligence, assassination, and propaganda: create &quot;bloody mayhem&quot;.

Guerrillas are often characterized as [[terrorism|terrorists]] by their opponents, as part of psychological warfare. Guerrillas are in danger of not being recognized as lawful [[combatant|combatants]] because they may not wear a [[uniform]], (to mingle with the local population), or their uniform and distinctive emblems may not be recognised as such by their opponents. Article 44, sections 3 and 4 of the [[1977]] [[Protocol I|First Additional Protocol]] to the [[Geneva Conventions]], &quot;relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts&quot;, does recognise combatants who, due to the nature of the conflict, do not wear uniforms as long as they carry their weapons openly during military operations. This gives non-uniformed guerrillas lawful combatant status against countries that have ratified this convention. However the same protocol states in Article 37.1.c that &quot;''the feigning of civilian, non-combatant status''&quot; shall constitute [[perfidy]] and is prohibited by the Geneva Conventions.

Guerrilla warfare is classified into two main categories: urban guerrilla warfare and rural guerrilla warfare. In both cases, guerrillas rely on a friendly population to provide supplies and intelligence. Rural guerrillas prefer to operate in regions providing plenty of cover and concealment, especially heavily forested and mountainous areas. Urban guerrillas, rather than melting into the mountains and jungles, blend into the population and are also dependent on a support base among the people. 

Foreign support in the form of soldiers, weapons, sanctuary, or, at the very least, statements of sympathy for the guerrillas can greatly increase the chances of victory for an insurgency. However, it is not always necessary.

[[Mao Zedong|Maoist]] theory of people's war divides warfare into three phases. In the first phase, the guerrillas gain the support of the population through attacks on the machinery of government and the distribution of [[propaganda]]. In the second phase, escalating attacks are made on the government's [[military]] and vital institutions. In the third phase, conventional fighting is used to seize cities, overthrow the government, and take control of the country.

Guerrilla Tactics were summarized into the ''' Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla{{ref|refbot.779}}'' in [[1969]] by [[Carlos Marighella]]. This text was banned in several countries including the United States. This is probably the most comprehensive and informative book on guerrilla strategy ever published, and is available free online.  Texts by Che Guevara and Mao Zedong on guerrilla warfare are also available.

John Keats wrote about an American guerrilla leader in World War 2: Colonel [[Wendell Fertig]], who in [[1942]] organized a large force of guerrillas who harassed the Japanese occupation forces on the Philippine Island of Mindanao all the way up to the liberation of the Philippines in [[1945]]. His abilities were later utilized by the United States Army, when Fertig helped found the United States Army Special Warfare School at [[Fort Bragg, North Carolina]]. Others included Col. Aaron Bank and Col. Russell Volckmann. Volckmann, in particular, commanded a guerrilla force which operated out of the Cordillera of Northern Luzon, in the Philippines from the beginning of World War II to its conclusion. He remained in radio contact with US Forces, prior to the invasion of [[Lingayen Gulf]]. 

Guerrilla warfare sometimes involves surrounding nations, which are affected by a popular uprising against the neighbouring government. A case in point was the [[Mukti Bahini]] guerrillas who fought alongside the [[Indian Army]] in the 14-day [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in [[1971]] against [[Pakistan]] that resulted in the creation of the state of [[Bangladesh]].

[[T.E.Lawrence]], best known as &quot;Lawrence of Arabia,&quot; introduced a theory of guerrilla warfare tactics in an article he wrote for the Encyclopedia Britannica published in 1938. In that article, he compared guerrilla fighters to a gas. The fighters disperse in the area of operations more or less randomly. They or their cells occupy a very small intrinsic space in that area, just as gas molecules occupy a very small intrinsic space in a container. The fighters may coalesce into groups for tactical purposes, but their general state is dispersed. Such fighters cannot be &quot;rounded up.&quot; They cannot be contained. They are extremely difficult to &quot;defeat&quot; because they cannot be brought to battle in significant numbers. The cost in soldiers and material to destroy a significant number of them becomes prohibitive, in all senses, that is physically, economically, morally, etc. It should be noted that Lawrence describes a non-native occupying force as the enemy (e.g. the Turks).

==Examples==
Examples of successful guerrilla warfare:
* [[Algeria]]
* [[Angola]]
* [[Afghanistan]]
* portions of the [[American Revolution]]
* [[East Timor]]
* [[Indonesia]]
* [[Mozambique]]
* portions of the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]]; notably, actions led by [[Robert the Bruce]]
* [[Anglo-Irish War]] [[1919]]-[[1921]]
* [[Viet-Cong]] forces throughout the [[Vietnam War]] in the early 1960s.

In many cases, guerrilla tactics allow a small force to hold off a much larger and better equipped enemy for a long time, as in the [[Second Chechen War]] and the [[Second Seminole War]].

===Guerrillas in [[Europe]]===

Over centuries of history, many guerrilla movements appeared in Europe to fight foreign occupation forces. The tactics of [[Roman dictator]] [[Quintus Fabius Maximus]] against [[Hannibal]] could be considered a predecessor of guerrilla tactics. In expanding their own Empire, the Romans encountered numerous examples of guerrilla resistance to their legions. During [[The Deluge]] in [[Poland]] guerrilla tactics were applied. In the [[19th century]], peoples of the [[Balkans]] used guerrilla tactics to fight the [[Ottoman empire]]. In [[17th century]] [[Ireland]], Irish irregulars called [[tories]] and [[rapparees]] used guerrilla warfare in the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] and the [[Williamite war in Ireland]]. In India in the [[17th Century]], an Indian self-proclaimed leader and king &quot;[[Shivaji]] Bhonsle&quot; revolted against the ruling Mughal using guerrilla tactics.

====Europe 1800-1900====
=====Napoleonic Wars=====
In the [[Napoleonic Wars]] many of the armies lived off the land. This often led to some resistance by the local population if the army did not pay fair prices for produce they consumed. Usually this resistance was sporadic, and not very successful, so it is not classified as guerrilla action. There are three notable exceptions, though:

* The rebellion in the  [[Tyrol]] of [[1809]] led by  [[Andreas Hofer]].

* In [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia]] of [[1812]]  two actions were ordered by  [[Tsar]] [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander]] which could be seen as initiating guerrilla tactics. [[The Burning of Moscow]] after it had been occupied by the Napoleon's [[Grand Army]], so depriving the French of shelter in the city, is a classic guerrilla action. The second was his imperial command that the Russian serfs should attack the French. This did not so much spark a guerrilla war as encourage a revengeful slaughter.

* In the [[Peninsular War]] the British, encouraged by the spontaneous mass resistance in Spain against Napoleon, gave aid to the Spanish guerrillas who tied down tens of thousands of French troops. The continual losses of troops caused Napoleon to describe this conflict his &quot;Spanish ulcer&quot;. The  British gave this aid because it cost them much less than it would have done to equip British soldiers to face the French troops in conventional warfare. This was one of the  most successful partisan wars in history and was where the word ''guerrilla'' was first used in this context.  The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] lists [[Wellington]] as the oldest known source, speaking of &quot;Guerillas&quot; in 1809.

Poet [[William Wordsworth]], a former radical turned conservative, showed a surprising early insight into guerrilla methods in his pamphlet on the [[Convention of Cintra]].  
* &quot;It is manifest that, though a great army may easily defeat or disperse another army, less or greater, yet it is not in a like degree formidable to a determined people, nor efficient in a like degree to subdue them, or to keep them in subjugation–much less if this people, like those of Spain in the present instance, be numerous, and, like them, inhabit a territory extensive and strong by nature. For a great army, and even several great armies, cannot accomplish this by marching about the country, unbroken, but each must split itself into many portions, and the several detachments become weak accordingly, not merely as they are small in size, but because the soldiery, acting thus, necessarily relinquish much of that part of their superiority, which lies in what may be called the enginery of war; and far more, because they lose, in proportion as they are broken, the power of profiting by the military skill of the Commanders, or by their own military habits. The experienced soldier is thus brought down nearer to the plain ground of the inexperienced, man to the level of man: and it is then, that the truly brave man rises, the man of good hopes and purposes; and superiority in moral brings with it superiority in physical power.” (''William Wordsworth: Selected Prose'', [[Penguin Classics]] 1988, page 177-8.)

===== Anglo&amp;ndash;Irish War =====
The wars between '''Ireland''' and the '''United Kingdom''' have been long and over the centuries have covered the full spectrum of the types of warfare. The Irish  fought the first successful 20th century war of independence against the British Empire and the United Kingdom. After the military failure of the [[Easter Rising]] in [[1916]], the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) resorted to guerrilla tactics involving both [[urban warfare]] and [[flying column]]s in the countryside during the [[Anglo-Irish War]] (War of Independence) of [[1919]] to [[1921]]. The British security forces were fought to a standstill and the government of the UK agreed to meet representatives of the Irish uprising to negotiate a settlement. The settlement which resulted &amp;mdash; the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] &amp;mdash; satisfied few. It created the [[Irish Free State]] of 26 counties as a dominion within the British Empire; the other 6 counties remained part of the UK. The '''IRA''' fought an unsuccessful [[Irish Civil War|Civil War]] (1921-23) against the '''Irish free staters''' using tactics similar to those used against the British but lost. The partition of Ireland laid the seeds for the later [[the Troubles|troubles]].

===== World War II =====
[[Image:Soviet guerilla.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Soviet partisan fighters behind German lines in Belarus in 1943]]
In [[World War II]], several guerrilla organisations (often known as [[resistance movement|resistance movements]]) operated in the countries occupied by [[Nazi Germany]]. These included the Polish [[Home Army]], [[Soviet partisans]] (see also [[Russian Guerrilla Warfare of WWII]]), [[National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Partisans]], Bulgarian NOVA ,[[French resistance]] or [[Maquis (WW2)|Maquis]], Italian partisans, [[ELAS]] and royalist forces in [[Greece]]. Many of these organisations received help from the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) which along with the [[British Commando|commandos]] was initiated by [[Winston Churchill]]  to &quot;''&quot;set Europe ablaze&quot;''. The SOE was originally designated as 'Section D' of [[MI6]] but its aid to resistance movements to start fires clashed with MI6's primary  role as an intelligence-gathering agency. When Britain was under threat of invasion, SOE trained [[Auxiliary Units]] to conduct guerrilla warfare in the event of invasion. Not only did SOE help the resistance to tie down many German units as garrison troops, so directly aiding the conventional war effort, but also guerrilla incidents in occupied countries were useful in the propaganda war, helping to repudiate German claims that the occupied countries were pacified and broadly on the side of the Germans. When the [[USA]] entered the war, the US [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) co-operated and enhanced the work of SOE as well as working on its own initiatives in the Far East. Even the [[Home Guard]] were trained in guerilla warfare in the case of invasion of England. [[Osterly Park]] was the first of 3 such school established to train the Home Guard.

===== Post World War II =====
After World War II, during [[1940s]] and [[1950s]], thousands of fighters in [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] participated in unsuccessful guerrilla warfare against Soviet occupation.

In the late [[1960s]] [[the Troubles]] started in [[Northern Ireland]]. They had their seeds in the Anglo-Irish War, and came to an end with the signing of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in the [[1900s|mid-1990s]] (1998). The peace is fragile and it is too early to tell if a permanent end to the conflict has occurred and which group, if any, won. Although both loyalist and republican paramilitaries carried out terrorist atrocities against [[civilian]]s which were often tit-for-tat, a case can be made for saying that attacks such as the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] carried out on British soldiers at [[Warrenpoint]] in [[1979]] was a well planned guerrilla ambush {{ref|news.bbc.co.uk.780}}. The [[PIRA]], [[Loyalist]] [[paramilitary|paramilitaries]] and various anti-[[Good Friday Agreement]] splinter-groups could be called guerrillas but are usually called terrorists by both the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] governments. The news media such as the [[BBC]] and [[CNN]] will often use the term &quot;gunmen&quot; as in ''&quot;IRA gunmen&quot; {{ref|www.bbc.co.uk.781}} or &quot;Loyalist gunmen&quot; {{ref|www.cnn.com.782}} committed a &quot;terrorist&quot; act''. Since 1995 CNN also uses guerrilla as in ''&quot;IRA guerrilla&quot; and &quot;Protestant guerrilla&quot; {{ref|www.cnn.com.783}}''. [[Reuters]], in accordance with its principle of not using the word terrorist except in direct quotes, refers to &quot;''guerrilla groups''&quot;{{ref|www.reuters.co.uk.784}}.

==== Europe 2000 &amp;ndash; present ====
Currently, the [[Basque people|Basque]] [[ETA]] and [[Corsica]]n [[FLNC]] and other groups such as the [[History of Modern Greece|Greek]] [[Marxist]] [[Revolutionary Organization 17 November]] claim to be guerrillas, but are commonly recognized as terrorists since they have murdered civilians on some occasions (collateral damages according to them) and not always purely legitimate military targets. Furthermore, this is how the governments and media of their respective countries (foreign invader governments according to these groups) prefer to refer to them. 

The ongoing war between pro-independence groups in [[Chechnya]] and the Russian government is currently the most active guerrilla war in Europe. Most of the incidents reported by the Western news media are very gory terrorist acts against Russian civilians committed by Chechen separatists outside Chechnya. However, within Chechnya the war has many of the characteristics of a classic guerrilla war. See the article [[History of Chechnya]] for more details.

=== Guerrillas in the American Revolutionary War ===
While the [[American Revolutionary War]] is often thought of as a guerrilla war, guerrilla tactics were uncommon, and almost all of the battles involved conventional set-piece battles. Some of the confusion may be due to the fact that generals [[George Washington]] and [[Nathaniel Greene]] successfully used a strategy of harassment and progressively grinding down British forces instead of seeking a decisive battle, in a classic example of [[asymmetric warfare]]. Nevertheless the theater tactics used by most of the American forces were those of conventional warfare. One of the exceptions was in the south, where the brunt of the war was upon [[militia]] forces who fought the enemy [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops and their [[Loyalist]] supporters, but used concealment, surprise, and other guerrilla tactics to much advantage. General [[Francis Marion]] of [[South Carolina]], who often attacked the British at unexpected places and then would fade into the swamps by the time the British were able to get organized enough to return fire, was named by them ''The Swamp Fox''. However, even in the south, most of the major engagements were set-piece battles of conventional warfare. See also [[Ethan Allen]] and the [[Green Mountain Boys]], for another Revolutionary example.

===Guerrillas in the American Civil War===
Irregular warfare in the [[American Civil War]] followed the patterns of irregular warfare in 19th century Europe. Structually, irregular warfare can be divided into three different types conducted during the Civil War: 'People's War', 'partisan warfare', and 'raiding warfare'. The concept of 'People's war,' first described by Clausewitz in ''On War'', was the closest example of a mass guerrilla movement in the era. In general, this type of irregular warfare was conducted in the hinterland of the Border States (Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, and northwestern Virginia), and was marked by a vicious neighbor against neighbor quality. One such example was the opposing irregular forces operating in Missouri and northern Arkansas from [[1862]] to [[1865]], most of which were pro-[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] or pro-[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in name only and preyed on civilians and isolated military forces of both sides with little regard of politics. From these semi-organized guerrillas, several groups formed and were given some measure of legitimacy by their governments. [[Quantrill's Raiders]], who terrorized pro-Union civilians and fought Federal troops in large areas of Missouri and Kansas, was one such unit. Another notorious unit, with debatable ties to the Confederate military, was led by [[Champ Ferguson]] along the Kentucky-Tennessee border. Ferguson became one of the only figures of Confederate cause to be executed after the war. Dozens of other small, localized bands terrorized the countryside throughout the border region during the war, bringing total war to the area that lasted until the end of the Civil War and, in some areas, beyond.

Partisan warfare, in contrast, more closely resembles Commando operations of the 20th century. Partisans were small units of conventional forces, controlled and organized by a military force for operations behind enemy lines. The 1862 Partisan Ranger Act passed by the Confederate Congress authorized the formation of these units and gave them legitimacy, which placed them in a different category than the common 'bushwhacker' or 'guerrilla'. [[John Singleton Mosby]] formed a partisan unit during the [[American Civil War]] which was very effective in tying down Federal forces behind Union lines in northern Virginia in the last two years of the war.

Lastly, deep raids by conventional cavalry forces were often considered 'irregular' in nature. The &quot;Partisan Brigades&quot; of [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] and [[John Hunt Morgan]] operated as part of the cavalry forces of the [[Confederate Army of Tennessee]] in [[1862]] and [[1863]]. They were given specific missions to destroy logistical hubs, railroad bridges, and other strategic targets to support the greater mission of the Army of Tennessee. By mid-1863, with the destruction of Morgan's raiders during the [[Morgan's Raid|Great Raid of 1863]], the Confederacy conducted few deep cavalry raids in the latter years of the war, mostly due to the losses in experienced horsemen and the offensive operations of the Union army. Federal cavalry conducted several successful raids during the war but in general used their cavalry forces in a more conventional role. A good exception was the 1863 [[Grierson's Raid]], which did much to set the stage for General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s victory during the [[Vicksburg Campaign]].

Federal counter-guerrilla operations were very successful in preventing the success of Confederate guerrilla warfare. In [[Arkansas]], Federal forces used a wide variety of strategies to defeat irregulars. These included the use of Arkansas [[Unionist]] forces as anti-guerrilla troops, the use of riverine forces such as gunboats to control the waterways, and the [[provost marshal]] military law enforcement system to spy on suspected guerrillas and to imprison those captured. Against Confederate raiders, the Federal army developed an effective cavalry themselves and reinforced that system by a large number of blockhouses and fortification to defend strategic targets.  Federal attempts to defeat Mosby's Partisan Rangers fell short of success due to Mosby's use of very small units (10&amp;ndash;15 men) operating in areas considered friendly to the Rebel cause.

In the late [[20th century]] several historians have focused on the non-use of guerrilla warfare to prolong the war. Near the end of the war, there were those in the [[Confederate]] government, notably [[Jefferson Davis]] who advocated continuing the southern fight as a guerrilla conflict. He was opposed by generals such as [[Robert E. Lee]] who ultimately believed that surrender and reconciliation were better than guerrilla warfare.

===Guerrilla warfare during the Second Sino-Japanese War===
Despite a common misconception, both Nationalist and Communist forces were active underground resistance in Japanese-occupied areas during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Even before the outbreak of total war in [[1937]], partisans were already present in [[Manchuria]] hampering Japan's occupation of the region. After the initial phases of the war, when large swaths of the [[North China Plain]] rapidly fell to the Japanese, underground resistance, supported by either Communist sympathisers or composed of disguised Nationalist soldiers, would soon rise up to combat the garrison forces. They were quite successful, able to sabotage railorad routes and ambush reinforcements. Many major campaigns, such as the four failed invasions of [[Changsha]], were caused by overly-stretched supply lines, lack of reinforcements, and ambushes by irregulars. The Communist cells, many having decades of prior experience in guerrilla warfare against the Nationalists, usually fared much better, and many Nationalist underground groups were subsequently absorbed into Communist ones. Usually in Japanese-occupied areas, the IJA only controlled the cities and railroad routes, with most of them countryside either left alone or with active guerrilla presence. The [[People's Republic of China]] has emphasised their contribution to the Chinese war effort, going as far to say that in addition to a &quot;overt theatre&quot;, which in many cases they deny was effective, there was also a &quot;covert theatre&quot;, which they claim did much to stop the Japanese advance.

=== Guerrilla Warfare in the Chinese Civil War ===
Both before and after the Sino-Japanese War, there was continuous fighting between Nationalists and Communists.  The Communists used a mix of Guerrilla Warfare and [[Mobile Warfare]], with guerrillas harassing and regular armies striking unexpectedly.  On several different fronts, most notably Manchuria, this mix wore down the much larger Nationalist forces.

===Guerrilla Warfare in the Pacific and East Asian theatre of World War II===
There was guerrilla fighting in [[Pacific War|Pacific and East Asian theatre of World War II]]. Japan's invasion of China also prompted guerrilla activity in rural areas of occupied China. The Chinese became increasingly successful during the war, and tied down Japanese troops in China throughout the war. US troops working with Filipino guerrillas conducted guerrilla warfare against the Japanese in the Philippines, as did Allied forces in the [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|South-East Asian theatre]].

=== Guerrillas in Israel and the Palestinian Territories===
European Jews fleeing from [[anti-Semitic]] violence (especially Russian [[pogroms]]) immigrated in increasing numbers to [[Palestine]].  When the British restricted Jewish immigration to the region (see [[White Paper of 1939]]), Jewish Palestinians began to use a type of guerrilla warfare for two purposes: to bring in more Jewish refugees, and to turn the tide of British sentiment at home.  Jewish groups such as the [[Stern Gang]] and the [[Irgun]] - many of whom had experience in the Warsaw ghetto battles against the Nazis, fought British soldiers whenever they could, including the bombing of the [[King David Hotel]].  This act of violence, while certainly guerrilla warfare, cannot be considered terrorism because of the warning given hours beforehand for civilians to leave.  Terrorism, by definition, involves the deliberate targeting of civilians, which early Israelis did not consider justifiable.

The creation of the state of Israel might be considered one of the greatest achievements of guerrilla warfare.  The Jewish forces were a spontaneous group of civilians working without formal military structure, fighting the British Empire that had just emerged victorious from World War II.

(Read about the amalgamation of these guerrilla groups into the [[Israel Defence Force]] and subsequent victory over its Arab neighbors in the [[1948 War of Independence]])

Palestinians initiated their own guerrilla warfare against the new Jewish state, including [[Yasser Arafat]], whose PLO called for the destruction of Israel in 1964, 3 years before the [[Six-Day War]].  The use of terrorism has become the norm for the Palestinian cause, targeting women and children in addition to Israeli combatants.  This guerrilla warfare, unlike the type used by Jews pre-1948, is contrary to the rules of war and the [[Geneva Conventions]] because of its deliberate targeting of innocent civilians.

=== Guerrillas in Latin America ===
In the [[Mexican Revolution]] from 1913 to 1920, the populist revolutionary leader [[Emiliano Zapata]] employed the use of predominately guerrilla tactics. His forces, composed entirely of peasant farmers turned soldiers, wore no uniform and would easily blend into the general population after an operation's completion. They would have young soldiers, called &quot;dynamite boys&quot;, hurl cans filled with explosives into enemy barracks, and then a large number of lightly armed soldiers would emerge from the surrounding area to attack it. Although Zapata's forces met considerable success, his strategy backfired as government troops, unable to distinguish his soldiers from the normal population, waged a broad and brutal campaign against the latter.

In the [[1960s]], [[1970s]], and [[1980s]], [[Latin America]] had a number of [[urban guerrilla]] movements whose strategy was to destabilize regimes and provoke a counter-reaction by the military. The theory was that a harsh military regime would oppress the [[middle class]]es who would then support the guerrillas and create a popular uprising.

While these movements did destabilize governments, such as [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Peru]] to the point of military intervention, the military generally proceeded to completely wipe out the guerrilla movements, usually committing several [[atrocities]] among both civilians and armed insurgents in the process.

Several other [[left-wing]] guerrilla movements, often backed by [[Cuba]] and/or the [[Soviet Union]], attempted to overthrow US-backed governments or [[right-wing]] military [[dictatorship]]s. US-backed [[Contra]] guerrillas attempted to overthrow the left-wing elected [[Sandinista]] government of Nicaragua, though most of these groups should be considered mercenary juntas rather than rooted guerrillas.

===South African War===
Guerrilla tactics were used extensivley by the forces of the [[Afrikaner]] republics in the [[Second Boer War]] in [[South Africa]] 1899-1902. After the British defeated the Boer armies in conventional warfare and occupied their capitals of [[Pretoria]] and [[Bloemfontein]], Boer [[commandos]] reverted to mobile warfare. Units led by leaders such as [[Christian de Wet]] harassed slow-moving British columns and attacked railway lines and encampments. The Boers were almost all mounted and possessed long range magazine loaded rifles. This gave them the ability to attack quickly and cause many casualties before retreating rapidly when British reinforcements arrived. In the early period of the guerrilla war, Boer commandoes could be very large, containing several thousand men and even field artillery. However, as their supplies of food and ammunition gave out, the Boers increasingly broke up into smaller units and relied on captured British arms and ammunition.

To counter these tactics, the British under [[Kitchener]] interned Boer civilians into [[concentration camps]] and built hundreds of blockhouses all over the Transvaal and Orange Free State. Eventually, the Boer guerrillas surrendered in 1902, but the British granted them generous terms in order to bring the war to an end. This showed how effective guerrilla tactics could be in extracting concessions from a militarily more powerful  enemy.

===Disputed Territory of Kashmir===
Kashmiri guerrillas constantly cause destruction in the Disputed Territory of [[Kashmir]]. The territory has been disputed between both [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], India has accused Pakistan of training and aiding these guerrillas in the past. Guerrillas were known to aid Pakistan during the [[1999 Kargil Conflict]].

The territory has been disputed since the Indo-Pakistani Partition in 1947. Many guerrillas fight for an independent Kashmiri state, something which both governments fight against, other guerrillas wish to annex parts of Kashmir into Pakistani-Administered Kashmir. Known terrorists such as [[David Hicks]] have been accused of participating in guerrilla activities in Kashmir.

===Vietnam War===
Within the [[United States]], the [[Vietnam War]] is commonly thought of as a guerrilla war. However this is a simplification of a much more complex situation which followed the pattern outlined by Maoist theory.

The [[National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam|National Liberation Front]] (NLF), drawing its ranks from the South Vietnamese peasantry and working class, used guerrilla tactics in the early phases of the war. However, by [[1965]] when U.S. involvement escalated, the National Liberation Front was in the process of being supplanted by regular units of the [[North Vietnamese Army]].

The [[North Vietnamese Army|NVA]] regiments organized along traditional military lines, were supplied via the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] rather than living off the land, and had access to weapons such as [[tank]]s and [[artillery]] which are not normally used by guerrilla forces.

Over time, more of the fighting was conducted by the North Vietnamese Army and the character of the war become increasingly conventional. The final offensive into [[South Vietnam]] in [[1975]] was a mostly conventional military operation in which guerilla warfare played a minor, supporting role.

=== Guerrilla warfare in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Kurdish Northern [[Iraq]] ===
Guerrilla warfare formed an integral part of the US/NATO military campaigns in Kosovo in the late [[1990s]] and Afghanistan in [[2001]], which created a unique style of warfare combining low-technology guerrilla warfare with high-technology air power. In these campaigns, guerrilla fighters with coordination from [[special force]]s would engage the enemy, forcing them to move out into the open where they could be destroyed using air power supplied by the [[United States]]. In both cases, the guerrillas were able to take advantage of their local knowledge and willingness to take casualties to great effect when supplemented by outside air power. In Kosovo the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]], a separatist paramilitary force, was aided by the [[NATO]] air forces. In [[Afghanistan]] numerous anti-[[Taliban]] militias (consisting of regular soldiers and guerrillas), including the [[Afghan Northern Alliance]], were aided by US air power. This formula was used again, in [[2003 invasion of Iraq|War on Iraq]], against the Iraqi Army by Kurdish [[Peshmerga]] guerrillas with the aid of U.S. special forces and the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]].

=== Guerrilla in Iraq (2003-today) ===
Many guerrilla tactics are used by the [[Iraqi insurgency]] against the US-led coalition. Such tactics include exploding cars, donkeys and humans. They have injured more than 25,000 coalition troops and killed around 2,000 US soldiers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''geosynchronous satellite''' is a [[satellite]] whose orbital track on the Earth repeats regularly over points on the Earth over time.  If such a satellite's orbit lies over the [[equator]], it is called a '''geostationary satellite'''.  The orbits of the satellites are known as the [[geosynchronous orbit]] and [[geostationary orbit]]. Other well-known geosynchronous orbits include the well-known [[Molniya orbit|Molniya]] and [[Tundra elliptical orbits]].

==Definition==

According to [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's Third Law]], the orbital period of a satellite in a circular orbit increases with increasing altitude. Space stations and shuttles in [[Low Earth orbit]] (LEO), typically two or four hundred miles above the Earth's surface make between fifteen and sixteen revolutions per day. The Moon, at an altitude of about 240,000 miles (385,000 km), takes thirty days to make a complete rotation. Between those extremes lies the &quot;magic&quot; altitude of 22,300 miles (35,786 km) at which a satellite's orbital period matches, or is an integral part of, the period at which the Earth rotates: once every [[sidereal day]] (23 hours 56 minutes). In that case, the satellite is said to be ''geosynchronous''.

If a geosynchronous satellite's orbit is not exactly aligned with the equator, known as an [[inclined orbit]], it will appear (when viewed by someone on the ground) to oscillate daily around a fixed point in the sky. As the angle between the orbit and the equator decreases, the magnitude of this oscillation becomes smaller; when the orbit lies entirely over the equator, the satellite remains stationary relative to the Earth's surface &amp;ndash; it is said to be ''geostationary''.

==Application==

There are approximately 300 operational geosynchronous satellites. 

Geostationary satellites appear to be fixed over one spot above the equator. Receiving and transmitting antennae on the earth do not need to track such a satellite. These antennae can be fixed in place and are much less expensive than tracking antennae. These satellites have revolutionized global communications, television broadcasting and weather forecasting, and have a number of important defense and intelligence applications.

One disadvantage of geostationary satellites is a result of their high altitude: radio signals take approximately 1/4 of a second to reach and return from the satellite, resulting in a small but significant signal delay.  This delay increases the difficulty of telephone conversation and reduces the performance of common network protocols such as [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]], but does not present a problem with non-interactive systems such as television broadcasts. There are a number of proprietary satellite data protocols that are designed to proxy TCP/IP connections over long-delay satellite links -- these are marketed as being a partial solution to the poor performance of native TCP over satellite links. TCP presumes that all loss is due to congestion, not errors, and probes link capacity with its &quot;slow start&quot; algorithm, which only sends packets once it is known that earlier packets have been received. Slow start is very slow over a path using a geostationary satellite.

Another disadvantage of geostationary satellites is the incomplete geographical coverage, since ground stations at higher than roughly 60 degrees latitude have difficulty reliably receiving signals at low elevations. Satellite dishes in the Northern Hemisphere would need to be pointed almost directly towards the south, the general direction where the centre of our [[galaxy]] is also located, whose intense cosmic radiation bombards the receivers with strong radio noise and suppresses most signals. The signals would have to pass through the largest amount of atmosphere, and could even be blocked by land features. In the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], a practical solution has been developed for this problem with the creation of special [[Molniya]] / [[Orbita]] inclined path satellite networks with elliptical orbits. Similar elliptical orbits are used for the [[Sirius Radio]] satellites.

Furthermore, since geostationary satellites are always positioned above the equator, it is impossible for them to see the north or south poles.  They are able to cover the areas equal or less than 70 degrees latitude north or south; the Earth is not perfectly spherical, but flattened at the poles.

==History==

The concept was first proposed by the [[science fiction author]] [[Arthur C. Clarke]] in a paper in Wireless World in 1945, based on [[Herman Potočnik]]'s previous work. Working prior to the advent of solid-state electronics, Clarke envisioned a trio of large, manned space stations arranged in a triangle around the planet. Modern satellites are numerous, unmanned, and often no larger than an automobile.

The first geosynchronous satellite was [[Syncom 2]], launched on a [[Delta rocket]] B booster from [[Cape Canaveral]] [[26 July]], [[1963]].  It was used a few months later for the world's first satellite relayed [[telephone]] call, between [[United States|U.S.]] President [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Nigeria]]n Prime minister [[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa]].

The first [[geostationary]] communication satellite was [[Syncom 3]], launched on [[August 19]], [[1964]] with a Delta D launch vehicle from Cape Canaveral. The satellite, in orbit near the [[International Date Line]], was used to telecast the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]] to the [[United States]]. It was the first [[television]] program to cross the [[Pacific ocean]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''gardener''' is any personanhydrous caustic substance.  When moisture from the air is absorbed, the [[Potassium Oxide|potassium]] or [[Sodium Oxides|oxide]] turn into [[hydroxide|hydroxides]], which will corrode [[wrought iron]] or [[steel]] gun barrels.  Black powder arms must be well cleaned inside and out after firing to remove the residue. The size of the granules of powder and the confinement determine the burn rate of black powder.  Finer grains result in a closer mix of the ingredients, which results in a faster burn.  Tight confinement in the barrel causes a column of black powder to explode, which is the desired result.  Not seating the bullet firmly against the powder column can result in a harmonic shockwave, which can create a dangerous overpressure condition and damage the gun barrel.  One of the advantages of [[black powder]] is that precise loading of the charge is not as vital as with smokeless powder firearms and is carried out using volumetric measures rather than precise weight. However, overloading  causing  damage to a gun and its shooter is still possible.  The lack of pressure sensitivity means that the mass of the bullet makes little or no difference to the amount of powder used.  A full charge of black powder seated by just a small wad of paper, with no bullet, will still burn just as quickly as if it had a full weight bullet in front of it.  This makes black powder well suited for blank rounds, signal flares, and rescue line launches.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:GaryKildall.jpg|thumb|right|Gary Kildall]]
'''Gary Arlen Kildall''' ([[May 19]], [[1942]] &amp;ndash; [[July 11]], [[1994]]) was the creator of the [[CP/M]] [[operating system]] and [[GEM Desktop]] [[graphical user interface]], and founder of [[Digital Research|Digital Research, Inc.]] 

==Career==
Kildall received his PhD in computer science from the [[University of Washington]] in [[1972]]. While working as a professor at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] (NPS) [[US Navy]] in [[Monterey, California]], he created implementations of the [[PL/I programming language]] for the [[Intel 4004]] and [[Intel 8008|8008]] CPUs. He referred to these versions as [[PL/M programming language|PL/M]] (M for microcomputer). During this time Kildall introduced the theory of [[data-flow analysis]] that is widely used in [[optimizing compiler]]s. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;id=512945]

In [[1973]], Kildall began work on a disk operating system in order to create a host development environment for PL/M on microcomputers, and ended up with [[CP/M]]. He founded Digital Research after his resignation from NPS in [[1976]] and continued work on CP/M, which he originally sold in classified ads in the back pages of computer magazines. With the release of the [[Altair 8800]] in January 1975 there was a commercial system capable of running CP/M, and before the end of the year a number of clones had appeared with disk drives that required it. By [[1977]], it was the most popular microcomputer operating system in existence, running on nearly every [[Intel 8080]] or Zilog [[Z80]] based computer.

In [[1980]], [[International Business Machines|IBM]] approached Digital Research for a version of CP/M for its upcoming [[IBM PC]]. Legend has it that Kildall snubbed the IBM representatives by going flying in his [[Pitts Special]] (an aerobatic biplane) for several hours. Although widespread, the story is generally not accepted to be true because it was Kildall's wife, [[Dorothy McEwen|Dorothy]], who handled business negotiations, not Kildall himself. Another story has it that IBM representatives wanted Dorothy to sign their standard [[non-disclosure agreement]], which Dorothy considered overly burdensome. Kildall associate [[Gordon Eubanks]] has said that the non-disclosure ''was'' signed, but that Kildall was not enthusiastic about porting CP/M to the IBM PC's [[Intel 8088|8088]] processor{{ref|Eubanks_History1}}. IBM related the story to Bill Gates, who was already providing the [[ROM]] [[BASIC]] interpreter for the PC, and Gates offered to provide an operating system as well.  He obtained rights to a [[QDOS]], a CP/M compatible OS made by [[Tim Paterson]] of Seattle Computer products, licensed it to IBM, and [[MS-DOS]]/[[PC-DOS]] was born.

The possible infringement problems between PC-DOS and CP/M have been the source of much speculation, with secondhand accounts of threatened lawsuits and secret deals, but none of the parties involved ever spoke publicly. Kildall wrote a 226-page memoir shortly before his death in 1994 that contained his account, but the memoir to date has not been published, although it served as source material for a chapter about Kildall and CP/M in the [[2004]] book ''They Made America'' by [[Harold Evans]].

Kildall believed that PC-DOS infringed on CP/M's [[copyright]], but [[software copyright]] law was in its infancy&amp;mdash;the decision in the landmark [[Apple v. Franklin]] case was still two years away&amp;mdash;and by the accounts of Kildall's employees and friends, Kildall was wary of engaging IBM in a lengthy and costly [[lawsuit]].  Nevertheless, he confronted IBM in late 1980 with his allegation, and they agreed to offer CP/M as an OS option for the PC in return for Digital's release of liability{{ref|Eubanks_History2}}.  

When the IBM PC was introduced, IBM sold the operating system as an unbundled (but necessary) option. One of the operating system options was PC-DOS, priced at US$60. A new port of CP/M, called [[CP/M-86]], was offered a few months later and priced at $240. Largely due to its early availability and the substantial price difference, PC-DOS became the preferred operating system. IBM's decision to source its favored operating system from [[Microsoft]] marked the beginning of Digital Research's decline.

After CP/M, concerned by the proliferation of [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] on microcomputers, Kildall created PL/I-80, a ANSI standard subset of the full PL/I programming language, to run on CP/M based microcomputers. He also went on to create a variety of experimental projects, including an implementation of the [[Logo programming language|Logo]] educational programming language and interfaces between computers and [[CD-ROM]] drives and [[videodisc]] players. He created a CD-ROM version of [[Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia|Grolier's]] [[Encyclopedia]]. He left Digital Research in [[1991]] when the company was sold to [[Novell]], and moved to suburban [[Austin, Texas]], keeping a second home in California.

==Death==
Friends and acquaintances reported that Kildall remained bitter that MS-DOS and Microsoft thrived while he languished in obscurity. Most of the internal features of MS-DOS based on CP/M were superseded in later versions, but DOS retained many user-visible similarities. Kildall was particularly piqued when the University of Washington asked him, as a distinguished graduate, to attend their computer science program anniversary in 1992, but gave the keynote speech to college [[dropout]] Bill Gates.  Kildall died in 1994 of uncertain causes in [[Monterey, California]] at the age of 52. Some reports say he fell off of a bar stool at the Franklin Street Bar and Grill in Monterey on [[July 8]] and died of internal bleeding three days later. Gary Kildall was buried in Evergreen-Washelli Cemetery North Seattle, Washington

==Recognition==
In March [[1995]], Kildall was posthumously honored by the [[Software and Information Industry Association|Software Publishers Association]] (now the Software and Information Industry Association) for his contributions to the computer industry:

* Introduction of operating systems with preemptive multitasking and windowing capabilities and menu-driven user interfaces.
* Creation of the first diskette track buffering schemes, read-ahead algorithms, file directory caches, and RAM disk emulators.
* Introduction of a binary recompiler in the 1980s.
* The first programming language and first compiler specifically for microprocessors.
* The first microprocessor disk operating system, which eventually sold a quarter million copies.
* The first computer interface for video disks to allow automatic nonlinear playback, presaging today's interactive multimedia.
* The file system and data structures for the first consumer CD-ROM.
* The first successful open-system architecture by segregating system-specific hardware interfaces in a set of [[BIOS]] routines, making the whole third-party software industry possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Saxo horn version 001.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bishop Asgar, etching by the Danish-Norwegian illustrator Louis Moe (1857&amp;mdash;1945)]]
'''Gesta Danorum''' (&quot;Deeds of the Danes&quot;) is a work of [[Denmark|Danish]] history, by 12th century author [[Saxo Grammaticus]] (&quot;Saxo the Grammarian&quot;). It is the most ambitious literary undertaking of [[medieval]] Denmark.

==Gesta Danorum==

In sixteen books, written in [[Latin]] on the invitation of [[Archbishop]] [[Absalon]], it describes Danish history and to some degree [[Scandinavian]] history in general, from prehistory to the late [[12th century]]. It is the most ambitious literary undertaking of medieval Denmark, told in a sparkling and entertaining language, that reads as well today as it did back then.

The sixteen books can be categorized into two parts, book 1-9 being what is known as the [[Norse mythology|Old Norse]] part and Book 10-16 being medieval history. Book 9 ends with [[Gorm the Old]], the first factual documented [[King of Denmark]].

Since the work itself contains not a single date of any kind, neither for events nor to identify when it was written it can be problematic dating some persons and events of the Old Norse part. The only timeframe is the mention of Jesus' birth during [[Frode III]] reign, in book 5. This single fixed point established the dating of persons and events contained in the first 9 books. By counting back the number of generations told of by Saxo, one arrives roughly at 600 BC for the start of the work.

[[Image:Saxo original 001.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Angers Fragment]], page 1, front]]
===Chronology===

When the book was written, and in what order the books were written, is a matter of historical interpretation.

When exactly it was written is the subject of numerous books, however it is generally agreed that it was not finished before [[1208]]. 
The last event described in the last book (Book 16) is King [[Canute VI]] of Denmark subduing [[Wendland|Vendenland]] in [[Pomerania]] under Duke [[Bogislaw I]], in [[1186]]. However the preface of the work, dictated to Archbishop [[Anders Sunesen]], mentions the Danish conquest of the areas north of the [[Elbe]] in [[1208]].

Book 14, comprising nearly one-quarter of the text of the entire work, ends with [[Absalon]]'s appointment to Archbishop in [[1178]]. This comparably large book and the fact ''Absalon'' takes up a much more predominating position than King [[Valdemar I]] in this Book, makes it likely that this book is written first and comprised a work on its own. Saxo would then later enlarge it with Book 15 and 16, telling the story of King [[Valdemar I]] last years and King [[Canute VI]] first years.

It is then believed that Saxo wrote Book 11, 12 and 13. We know from [[Svend Aagesen]]'s history of Denmark, [[Brevis Historia Regum Dacie]], ca [[1186]], were it is stated that Saxo had decided to write about &quot;The king-father and his sons&quot; which would be King [[Sweyn Estridson]], which is book 11, 12, 13. He would then later add the 10 first books. This would also explain the 22 years between that last event described in the last book (Book 16) and the [[1208]] event described in the preface. 

[[Image:Saxo Chr P front version 001.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Front page of Christiern Pedersen's Saxo version, Paris 1514]]

===Manuscripts ===

The original manuscripts of the work are lost, except four fragments known as the [[Angers Fragment]], [[Lassen Fragment]], [[Kall-Rasmussen Fragment]] and [[Plesner Fragment]].
The [[Angers Fragment]], the biggest fragment and the only one attested to be on [[Saxo]]’ own handwriting. The other ones are copies from ca. [[1275]].
They now all reside in the [[Royal Library]] in [[Copenhagen]].

We do have the text, however. In [[1510]]-[[1512]], [[Christiern Pedersen]], a Danish translator working in Paris, searched Denmark high and low for an existing copy of Saxo’s works, which by that time was nearly all but lost. By that time most knowledge of Saxo’s work came from a summary located in [[Chronica Jutensis]], of ca. [[1342]], called [[Compendium Saxonis]]. It is also in this summary the name ''Gesta Danorum'' is found. We do not know the title Saxo himself used.

[[Christiern Pedersen]] finally found a copy with Archbishop [[Birger Gunnersen]] of [[Lund]], which he gladly lent him. With the help of [[Josse Bades]], they refined and printed it, so that the first printed press publication and the oldest known version of Saxo’s works, is Christiern Pedersen's [[Latin]] version, printed and published by [[Jodocus Badius Ascensius]], Paris,  March 15, [[1514]].  The colophon is: ...'' impressit in inclyta Parrhisorum academia Iodocus Badius Ascensius Idibus Martiis. MDXIIII. Supputatione Romana.'' [[Ides of March]].

==Influences==

Certain aspects of ''Gesta Danorum'' formed the basis for [[William Shakespeare]]'s play, ''[[Hamlet]]''. It is thought that Shakespeare never read ''Gesta Danorum'', and instead had access to an auxiliary version of the tale describing the downfall of the Prince of Denmark, whose real name - [[Amleth]] - was used in [[anagram]] by Shakespeare for Hamlet. Saxo’s version, told of in Book 3 and 4, is very similar to that of Shakespeare’s Hamlet. In Saxo's version, two brothers, Orvendil and Fengi are given the rule over [[Jutland]] by King [[Rorik]] of the Danes.  Soon after, Orvendil marries King Rorik’s daughter, Geruth (Gertrude in Hamlet). Amleth is their first and only child.  Fengi becomes resentful of his brother’s marriage, and also wants sole leadership of Jutland, so therefore murders Orvendil. After a very brief period of mourning, Fengi marries Geruth, and declares himself sole leader of Jutland.  Eventually, Amleth avenges his father’s murder and plans the murder of his uncle, making him the new and rightful king of Jutland.

A '''gate''' (Ворота) is a point of entry to a space enclosed by [[wall]]s, or an opening in a fence. Gates may prevent or control entry or exit, or they may be merely decorative.

Larger gates can be used for a whole building, such as a [[castle]] or [[fortified town]], or the actual [[door]]s that block entry through the gatehouse.

In ancient and [[medieval times]], gatehouses of cities and castles were heavily defended and [[fortified]] to prevent breaching of the gates. Often the gate would consist of several pairs of doors and [[iron]] [[grate]]s along a [[tunnel]] through the gatehouse. The top of the tunnel commonly had [[murder hole]]s to allow defenders to attack [[invader]]s trying to breach the inner doors. [[Drawbridge]]s were common in conjuction with gates to facilitate passing the [[moat]]; moats were often used to increase the effective height of the walls.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Greekfire-madridskylitzes1.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Depiction of Greek fire in the [[John Skylitzes|Madrid Skylitzes manuscript]].]]

'''Greek fire''' (also called '''Byzantine fire''', '''wildfire''' and '''[[liquid fire]]''',  [[Greek language|Greek]] '''Υγρό Πυρ''', ''igró pir'') was a weapon used by the [[Byzantine Empire]], said to have been invented by a [[Syriacs|Syrian]] [[Christianity|Christian]] [[refugee]] named Kallinikos (Callinicus) of [[Baalbek|Heliopolis]] (Syria), probably about [[673]]. Some people believe that he acquired this knowledge from the chemists of [[Alexandria]]. It was capable of discharging a stream of burning [[fluid]], and was very effective both on sea and land. However, it was used primarily at sea. It is rumored that the key to Greek fire's effectiveness was that it could continue burning under almost any conditions, even under water. It was known to the Byzantines' enemies as a &quot;wet, dark, sticky fire&quot; because it stuck to the unfortunate object it hit and was impossible to extinguish. Enemy ships were often afraid to come too near to the [[Byzantine navy|Byzantine fleet]], because, once within range, the [[fire]] gave the Byzantines a strong military advantage.  

Byzantine fire was largely responsible for many Byzantine military victories, and partly the reason for the Eastern Roman Empire surviving as long as it did. It was particularly helpful near the end of the empire's life when there were not enough inhabitants to effectively defend its territories. It was first used to repel the Arab siege of [[Constantinople]] in [[674]]-[[677]] ([[Battle of Syllaeum]]), and in [[717]]-[[718]]. The Byzantines also used this powerful weapon against the [[Varangian]]s (Vikings) in [[941]] and against the Venetians during the [[Fourth Crusade]]. It quickly became one of the most fearsome weapons of the medieval world. The mere sight of any sort of siphon, whether it was used for Greek fire or not, was often enough to defeat an enemy. However, Greek fire was very hard to control, and it would often accidentally set Byzantine ships ablaze.

Although similar substances have been invented in the modern age, the exact composition of the original Greek fire is currently assumed to be a lost art.

==Manufacture==

The ingredients, process of manufacture and usage were a very carefully guarded military secret, so secret it remains a source of speculation to this day. It may have been a mixture of [[sulfur]], [[quicklime]], and liquid [[petroleum]]. It is not clear if it was ignited by a flame as the mixture emerged from the syringe, or if it ignited spontaneously when it came into contact with water.  If the latter is the case, it is possible that the active ingredient was [[calcium phosphide]], made by heating lime, bones and charcoal. On contact with water, calcium phosphide releases [[phosphine]], which ignites spontaneously. 

These materials were apparently heated in a [[cauldron]], and then pumped out through a [[siphon]] or large [[syringe]], known as a ''siphonarios'' mounted on the bow of the ship. It could also be used in [[hand grenades]], made of earthenware vessels.

==Testimony==
 
The ''Memoirs'' of [[Jean de Joinville]], a thirteenth century French nobleman, include these observations[http://stronghold.heavengames.com/sc/history/greekfire] of Greek fire during the [[Seventh Crusade]]: 

:&quot;It happened one night, whilst we were keeping night-watch over the tortoise-towers, that they brought up against us an engine called a perronel, (which they had not done before) and filled the [[sling (weapon)|sling]] of the engine with Greek fire. When that good knight, Lord Walter of Cureil, who was with me, saw this, he spoke to us as follows: &quot;Sirs, we are in the greatest peril that we have ever yet been in. For, if they set fire to our turrets and shelters, we are lost and burnt; and if, again, we desert our defences which have been entrusted to us, we are disgraced; so none can deliver us from this peril save God alone. My opinion and advice therefore is: that every time they hurl the fire at us, we go down on our elbows and knees, and beseech Our Lord to save us from this danger.&quot;

:&quot;So soon as they flung the first shot, we went down on our elbows and knees, as he had instructed us; and their first shot passed between the two turrets, and lodged just in front of us, where they had been raising the dam. Our firemen were all ready to put out the fire; and the Saracens, not being able to aim straight at them, on account of the two pent-house wings which the King had made, shot straight up into the clouds, so that the fire-darts fell right on top of them.&quot;

:&quot;This was the fashion of the Greek fire: it came on as broad in front as a vinegar cask, and the tail of fire that trailed behind it was as big as a great spear; and it made such a noise as it came, that it sounded like the thunder of heaven. It looked like a dragon flying through the air. Such a bright light did it cast, that one could see all over the camp as though it were day, by reason of the great mass of fire, and the brilliance of the light that it shed.&quot;

:&quot;Thrice that night they hurled the Greek fire at us, and four times shot it from the tourniquet cross-bow.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Garbage In, Garbage Out''' (abbreviated to '''GIGO''') is an aphorism in the field of [[computer science]]. It refers to the fact that [[computer]]s, unlike humans, will unquestioningly process the most nonsensical of input [[data]] and produce nonsensical output. It was most popular in the early days of computing, but has fallen out of use as programs have become more sophisticated and now usually have checks built in to reject improper input.

GIGO is usually said in response to users who complain that a program did not &quot;do the right thing&quot; when given imperfect input. The first example of this was probably cited by [[Charles Babbage]], inventor of the first programmable device who said &quot;On two occasions I have been asked, 'Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?' I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.&quot; It is also commonly used to describe failures in human decision making due to faulty, incomplete, or imprecise data. For example, a badly written [[TeX]] document will look bad because the user did not correctly typeset the TeX source properly. This instance of GIGO could be described in a similar vein to [[WYSIWYG]] - ''what you see is what you get''.

Another, more recent, meaning of GIGO is '''Garbage In, Gospel Out'''. This phrase is a sardonic comment on the human tendency to accept the results from computer systems with unquestioning faith. An example of this blind-faith GIGO mentality is to believe that your work, stored in a computer, will be there whenever you need it even though you never perform data [[backup]] or [[anti-virus software|virus scan]].

It can also be used as an explanation for the poor quality of a digitized audio or video file. Although [[digitizing]] is the first step in cleaning up a signal, it does not, by itself, improve the quality. Defects in the original analog signal will be faithfully recorded, but may be identified and removed by a subsequent step. See [[Digital signal processing]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade''' (typically abbreviated '''GATT''') functioned as the precursor to the [[World Trade Organization]] trading system. GATT was created by the Bretton Woods meetings that took place in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in 1944, setting out a plan for economic recovery after World War II, by encouraging reduction in tariffs and other international trade barriers. Twenty-three nations signed the agreement. This first version of GATT is referred to as &quot;GATT 1947&quot;. In 1994, GATT was updated with new obligations upon its signatories. One of the most significant changes made in GATT (or &quot;GATT 1994&quot;) was the creation of the [[World Trade Organization]] ([[WTO]]). 75 of the GATT members and the [[European Communities]] are the founding members of WTO on 1.1.1995. Other 52 of the GATT members rejoined WTO in the next 2 years (the last is [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]] in 1997). After the WTO founding 21 new (non-GATT) members have joined and 28 are currently negotiating their membership. Of the former GATT members only [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] has not rejoined (and it's already impossible). Since [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|FR Yugoslavia]] (renamed to [[Serbia and Montenegro]] and with membership negotiations later split in two) is not recognised as direct SFRY sucessor state its application is considered a new one, non-GATT.

The GATT, as an international agreement, is very similar to a [[treaty]]. Under [[United States law]] it is classed as a [[congressional-executive agreement]]. It is based on the &quot;''unconditional most favored nation principle''.&quot;  This means that the conditions applied to the most favored trading nation (i.e. the one with the least restrictions) apply to all trading nations.

==&quot;Rounds&quot; of GATT trade negotiations==

The countries who signed GATT occasionally negotiated new trade agreements that all would enter into. Each such set of agreements was called a &quot;round&quot;.  In general, each of these agreements bound the members to reduce certain [[tariff]]s, with many special-case treatments of individual products, and in many cases with exceptions and modifications for each country.
# [[Geneva]] Round ([[1948]]):  23 countries.  GATT enters into force.
# [[Annecy]] Round ([[1949]]):  13 countries.
# [[Torquay]] Round ([[1951]]):  38 countries.
# Fourth Round - Geneva([[1956]]):  26 countries.  Tariff reductions.  Strategy set for future GATT policy toward developing countries, improving their positions as treaty participants.
# [[C. Douglas Dillon|Dillon]] Round ([[1962]]):  26 countries.  Tariff reductions. Named after [[C. Douglas Dillon]], then U.S. Undersecretary of State.
# [[Kennedy]] Round ([[1967]]): 62 countries.  Tariff reductions.  This was an across-the-board reduction rather than a product-by-product specification, for the first time.  Anti-[[dumping]] agreement (which, in the United States, was rejected by [[Congress of the United States|Congress]]).
# [[Tokyo]] Round ([[1979]]): 102 countries. Reduced non-tariff trade barriers. Also reduced tariffs on manufactured goods. Improvement and extension of GATT system.
# [[Uruguay Round]] ([[1993]]):  125 countries.  Created the [[World Trade Organization]] to replace the GATT treaty. Reduced tariffs and [[export subsidy|export subsidies]], reduced other [[import limit]]s and [[quota]]s over the next 20 years, agreement to enforce [[patent]]s, [[trademark]]s, and [[copyright]]s ([[TRIPS]]), extending international trade law to the service sector ([[GATS]]) and open up foreign investment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''G-protein-coupled receptors''' (GPCRs), also known as ''seven transmembrane receptors'', ''heptahelical receptors'', or ''7TM receptors''), are a protein family of [[transmembrane receptor]]s that [[Signal transduction|transduce]] an extracellular signal ([[Ligand_%28biochemistry%29|ligand]] binding) into an intracellular signal ([[G protein]] activation).  The GPCRs are the largest protein family known, members of which are involved in all types of stimulus-response pathways, from intercellular communication to physiological senses.  The diversity of functions is matched by the wide range of ligands recognized by members of the family, from photons (rhodopsin, the archetypal GPCR) to small molecules (in the case of the histamine receptors) to proteins (for example, chemokine receptors). This pervasive involvement in normal biological processes has the consequence of involving GPCRs in many pathological conditions, which has led to GPCRs being the target of 40 to 50% of modern medicinal drugs.{{ref|lotsofdrugs Filmore 2004}}

== Physiological roles ==
GPCRs are present in a wide variety of physiological processes. Some examples include:

# the visual sense: the [[opsin]]s use a photoisomerization reaction to translate electromagnetic radiation into cellular signals. [[Rhodopsin]], for example, uses the conversion of ''11-cis''-retinal to ''all-trans''-retinal for this purpose.
# the sense of smell: receptors of the [[olfactory epithelium]] bind odorants (olfactory receptors) and pheromones (vomeronasal receptors)
# behavioral and mood regulation: receptors in the [[mammal]]ian [[brain]] bind several different [[neurotransmitter]]s, including [[serotonin]] and [[dopamine]]
# regulation of [[immune system]] activity and [[inflammation]]: [[chemokine]] receptors bind ligands that mediate intercellular communication between cells of the immune system; receptors such as [[histamine]] receptors bind [[inflammatory mediators]] and engage target cell types in the [[Inflammation|inflammatory response]]
# autonomic nervous system transmission: both the [[sympathetic]] and [[parasympathetic]] nervous systems are regulated by GPCR pathways. These systems are responsible for control of many automatic functions of the body such as blood pressure, heart rate and digestive processes.
There are two types GPCRs viz chemosensory and endo GPCRs.

== Receptor structure ==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:OXTR_structure.png|thumb|right|300px|Schematic structure of the human OXTR with amino acid residues shown in one-letter code.&lt;br /&gt;[http://physrev.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/81/2/629 ''Physiol Rev. 2001 Apr;81(2): 629-83 Figure. 4'']] --&gt;

GPCRs are [[integral membrane protein]]s that possess seven membrane-spanning domains or [[transmembrane helix|transmembrane helices]]. The extracellular parts of the receptor can be [[Glycosylation|glycosylated]]. These extracellular loops also contain two highly conserved [[cysteine]] residues which build [[disulfide bond]]s to stabilize the receptor structure. 

Early structural models for GPCRs were based on their weak analogy to [[bacteriorhodopsin]] for which a structure had been determined by both electron and [[X-ray crystallography|X ray-based crystallography]]. In 2000, the first crystal structure of a mammalian GPCR, that of bovine [[rhodopsin]], was solved.  While the main feature, the seven transmembrane helices, is conserved, the structure differs significantly from that of bacteriorhodopsin. Some seven transmembrane helix proteins (such as [[channelrhodopsin]]) that resemble GPCRs may contain different functional groups, such as entire ion channels, within their protein.

== Ligand binding and signal transduction ==

While in other types of receptors that have been studied ligands bind externally to the membrane, the [[ligand]]s of GPCRs typically bind within the transmembrane domain.

The [[signal transduction|transduction of the signal]] through the membrane by the receptor is not completely understood. It is known that the inactive [[G protein]] is bound to the receptor in its inactive state. Once the ligand is recognized, the receptor shifts [[Chemical conformation|conformation]] and thus mechanically activates the G protein, which detaches from the receptor. The receptor can now either activate another G protein, or switch back to its inactive state. This is an overly simplistic explanation, but suffices to convey the overall set of events.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:GPCR_signaling.png|frame|center|650px|The activation of G-protein (blue-orange-green) by GPCR (pink).&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.pdb.org/pdb/static.do?p=education_discussion/molecule_of_the_month/pdb58_2.html ''PDB's Molecule of the Month, October 2004'']] --&gt;

It is believed that a receptor molecule exists in a conformational equilibrium between active and inactive states.{{ref|confequil Rubenstein 1998}} The binding of ligands to the receptor may shift the equilibrium (for example see [http://wusername>Michael Hardy</username>

'''Gallipoli''', called '''Gelibolu''' in modern [[Turkish language|Turkish]], ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Καλλίπολις), is a town in northwestern [[Turkey]]. The name derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Kallipolis'', meaning &quot;Beautiful City&quot;. It is located on the Gallipoli [[Peninsula]] (Gelıbolu Yarımadası), with the [[Aegean Sea]] to the west and the [[Dardanelles]] straits to the east.  

The Gallipoli Peninsula was known as [[Thracian Chersonese|&quot;Chersonesus Thracica&quot;]] in ancient times.  The peninsula which was inhabitated by populations of the Byzantine Empire was gradually conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] starting from [[13th century]] onwards until [[15th century|the 15th]]. The [[Greeks]] living there were allowed to continue their everyday life. The peninsula did not see any more wars up until [[World War I]] when the [[British Empire]] allies trying to find a way to reach their troubled ally in the east, [[Imperial Russia]], decided to try to obtain passage to the east. The Ottomans set up defensive fortifications along the peninsula with [[German Empire|German]] help.

== Battle of Gallipoli ==
{{main|Battle of Gallipoli}}
In [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Newfoundland]], Gallipoli is the name given to the Allied [[Battle of Gallipoli|Campaign]] on the peninsula during [[World War I]], usually known in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] as the Dardanelles Campaign and in Turkey as the Battle of Çanakkale. This was an attempt to push through the Dardanelles and capture [[İstanbul|Istanbul]]. On [[April 25]], [[1915]], as part of an allied force of British and [[France|French]] troops, the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (army corps)|Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZAC) landed at a small bay at the western end of the Peninsula (today officially called [[Anzac Cove]]). The campaign was relatively successful for the Turks and the Germans and a catastophe for Russia which eventually would lead to civil war partly due to this unsuccessful campaign. 
The Anzacs evacuated on [[December 19]], [[1915]] and the other elements of the invasion force a little later.  There were around 180,000 Allied casualties and 220,000 Turkish casualties. This campaign has become a &quot;[[founding myth]]&quot; for both [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], and [[Anzac Day]] is still commemorated as a holiday in both countries. Many mementos of the Gallipoli campaign can be seen in the museum at the [[Australian War Memorial]] in [[Canberra]], Australia and at the [[Auckland War Memorial Museum]] in [[Auckland]], New Zealand. This campaign also put a dent in the armour of Winston Churchill who then the war minister had commisioned the plans to invade the Dardanelles. He talks about this campaign vividly in his memoirs

The Gallipoli campaign also gave an important boost to the career of [[Mustafa Kemal]], who was at that time a little-known army commander. Kemal exceeded his authority and contravened orders in order to halt the Allied advance and eventually drive them back. He went on to found the modern Turkish state after the collapse of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

Gallipoli is the subject of a [[1981]] [[Gallipoli (film)|movie]] directed by [[Peter Weir]] and starring [[Mel Gibson]].

      <comment>/* The passive voice in topic-prominent languages */ on second thought, tables are less ugly than preformatted text</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[grammar]], '''voice''' is the relationship between the action or state expressed by a [[verb]], and its [[verb argument|argument]]s (subject, object, etc.). 
When the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] is the agent or actor of the verb, the verb is said to be in the '''active voice'''. When the subject is the patient, target or undergoer of the action, it is said to be in the '''passive voice'''. For example, ''The cat ate the mouse'' is active, but ''The mouse was eaten by the cat'' is passive.

In a passive voice sentence, the subject and the direct object switch places. The direct object is ''promoted'' to subject, and the subject is ''demoted'' to an optional complement, that may be left out.

==The passive voice in English==

In the [[English language]], the [[English passive voice]] is ''[[periphrasis|periphrastic]]''; that is, it is modelled using an ''ad hoc'' phrase structure with a different word order, an auxiliary verb and a participle of the main verb. In other languages, such as the [[Latin language]], the passive voice is simply marked on the verb by [[inflection]]: the passive voice uses different endings than the active voice.

==The middle voice==

Some languages (e. g. [[Sanskrit]] and Classical [[Greek language|Greek]]) have a '''[[middle voice]]'''. An intransitive verb that appears active but expresses a passive action characterizes the English middle voice. For example, in ''The casserole cooked in the oven'', ''cooked'' is [[syntax|syntactically]] active but [[semantics|semantically]] passive, putting it in the middle voice. In Classical [[Greek language|Greek]], the middle voice is often reflexive, denoting that the subject acts on or for itself, such as &quot;The boy washes himself.&quot; or &quot;The boy washes.&quot;  It can be transitive or intransitive.  It can occasionally be used in a causative sense, such as &quot;The father causes his son to be set free.&quot; or &quot;The father ransoms his son.&quot;

Many [[deponent verb]]s in [[Latin]] are also survivals of the [[Indo-European]] middle voice; many of these in turn survive as obligatory pseudo-[[reflexive verb]]s in the [[Romance language]]s such as [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

==Other grammatical voices==

Some languages have even more grammatical voices. For example, in Classic [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] there are five voices: active, passive, causative, reciprocal and cooperative.

[[Ergative language]]s usually do not have a passive voice, since their syntactic structure does not agree with it; instead some have an [[antipassive voice]] that deletes the object of transitive verbs.

==The passive voice in topic-prominent languages==

[[Topic-prominent language]]s like [[Mandarin (linguistics)|Mandarin]] tend not employ the passive voice as frequently. In Mandarin, the passive voice is constructed by prefixing the active noun phrase with ''bei-'' and rearranging the usual word order. For example, this sentence using active voice:

:{|cellspacing=&quot;10&quot;
|''Gou''||''yao-le''||''zheige''||''nanren.''
|-
|dog||bite-PAST||this||man
|-
|colspan=&quot;4&quot;|&quot;A dog bit this man.&quot;
|}

corresponds to this sentence using passive voice:

:{|cellspacing=&quot;10&quot;
|''Zheige''||''nanren''||''bei''||''gou''||''yao-le.''
|-
|This||man||by||dog||bite-PAST.
|-
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;|&quot;This man was bitten by a dog.&quot;
|}

In addition, through the addition of the auxiliary verb &quot;to be&quot; (''shi'') the passive voice is frequently used to emphasise the identity of the actor. In this example, the emphasis is on ''dog'', presumably as opposed to some other animal:

:{|cellspacing=&quot;10&quot;
|''Zheige''||''nanren''||''shi''||''bei''||''gou''||''yao-le.''
|-
|This||man||is||by||dog||bite-PAST.
|-
|colspan=&quot;6&quot;|&quot;This man was bitten by a ''dog''.&quot;
|}

Despite being a topic-prominent language, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] employs the passive voice quite frequently, and has two types of passive voice, one that corresponds to that in English and an indirect passive not found in English. This indirect passive is used when something undesirable happens to the speaker.

:{|cellspacing=&quot;10&quot;
|''Kare''||''wa''||''dorobō''||''ni''||''saifu''||''wo''||''nusumareta.''
|-
|He||TOPIC||thief||AGENT||wallet||OBJECT||steal-PASSIVE-PAST
|-
|colspan=&quot;7&quot;|&quot;His wallet was stolen by a thief.&quot;
|}

:{|cellspacing=&quot;10&quot;
|''Boku''||''wa''||''kanojo''||''ni''||''uso''||''wo''||''tsukareta.''
|-
|I||TOPIC||her||AGENT||lie||OBJECT||tell-PASSIVE-PAST.
|-
|colspan=&quot;7&quot;|&quot;I was lied to by her.&quot; (''or'' &quot;She lied to me.&quot;)
|}

==The fourth person in Baltic-Finnic languages==

Some languages do not contrast voices, but similar-looking persons. For example, [[Baltic-Finnic languages]] such as [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] have a &quot;passive&quot;, which is conceptually more of a never-mentioned &quot;fourth person&quot; than variation of subjectivity or objectivity. For example, translating the sentence &quot;The house was blown down&quot; as ''Talo puhallettiin maahan'' would give the idea that some unmentioned person is blowing the house down by the force of his breath. Also, [[transitive verb|transitivity]] may be used, such that the fourth-person ''Ongelma ratkaistiin'', which uses the transitive, means &quot;Someone solved the problem&quot;, while the fourth-person ''Ongelma ratkesi'' uses the intransitive anticausative, and means &quot;The problem was solved&quot;.

==Dynamic and static passive==

In some languages there is a distinction between static or stative passive voice, and dynamic or eventive passive voice. Examples include [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Static means that an action was done to the subject at a certain point in time, whereas dynamic means that an action is done.
&lt;!--
I, [[User:Gerbrant|Shinobu]], commented out this section because &quot;open&quot; is an adjective. Compare in Dutch:
*De winkel is open.       - adjective       - The store is open.
*De winkel is geopend.    - static passive  - The store is open. Someone must have done it, but now it's just open.
*De winkel wordt geopend. - dynamic passive - Someone is opening the store, unlocking the door, turning the &quot;open&quot; sign and thus in the process of opening it.

This distinction is available in English for some verbs, such as in the case of &quot;The store was open&quot; being distinguished from &quot;The store was opened&quot;), but not for others concerning a statement such ss &quot;The store was closed&quot; with either meaning.--&gt;
===In German===
Static passive auxiliary verb: '''sein'''

Dynamic passive auxiliary verb: '''werden'''

''Ich bin am 20. August geboren'' (&quot;I was born on August 20&quot;, static)

''Ich wurde am 20. August geboren'' (&quot;I became born on August 20&quot;, dynamic)
===In Spanish===
Static passive auxiliary verb: '''estar'''

Dynamic passive auxiliary verb: '''ser'''
===In Dutch===
Static passive auxiliary verb: '''zijn'''

Dynamic passive auxiliary verb: '''worden'''

''De muur is geverfd.'' (There is paint on the wall, static)

''De muur wordt geverfd.'' (Someone is painting the wall, dynamic)

==List of voices==
Here are some voices found in some languages:
*[[Active voice]]
*[[Passive voice]]
*[[Mediopassive voice]]
*[[Impersonal passive voice]]
*[[Middle voice]]
*[[Antipassive voice]]
*[[Reflexive voice]] (the subject and the object of the verb are the same, as in ''I cut myself'')
*[[Reciprocal voice]] (subject and object perform the verbal action to each other, e. g. ''I cut her and she cut me'')
*[[Causative voice]]
*[[Applicative voice]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Gram_Stain_Anthrax.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Gram-positive [[anthrax disease|anthrax]] bacteria (purple rods) in [[cerebrospinal fluid]] sample.  If present, a gram-negative bacterial species would appear pink. (The other cells are [[white blood cell]]s)]]
'''Gram staining''' (or the '''Gram's method''') is an [[empiricism|empirical]] method of differentiating [[bacterium|bacterial]] species into two large groups ([[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]]) based on the chemical and physical properties of their [[cell wall]]s.

The method is named after its inventor, the [[Denmark|Danish]] scientist [[Hans Christian Gram]] (1853-1938), who developed the technique in [[1884]] to discriminate between [[pneumococcus|pneumococci]] and ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'' bacteria.

==Uses==
===Research===
Gram staining is one of the most useful staining procedures in [[Bacteriology|bacteriological]] [[laboratory]]. The technique is widely used as a tool for differentiating Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as a first step to determine the identity of a particular bacterial sample.

===Medical===
Gram stains are performed on [[body fluid]] or [[biopsy]] when [[infection]] is suspected. It yields results much quicker than [[Microbiological culture|culture]], and is especially important when infection would make an important difference in the patient's treatment and prognosis; examples are [[cerebrospinal fluid]] for [[meningitis]] and [[synovial fluid]] for [[septic arthritis]]. It necessitates the 24 hour staffing of microbiological laboratories in hospitals.

==Procedure==
{{Wikibookspar|Transwiki|Gram staining}}

===Staining===
# First, an inoculum is taken from a culture using an [[inoculation loop]] and put on a [[Microscope slide|slide]] and then allowed to air dry. If the culture is solid, it is diluted by adding a drop of water or sterile saline on the slide and mixing with the loop. It is important here to take a very small inoculum so that the end result is a sparse single layer of bacteria. It is a common mistake for beginners to put far too much inoculum at this step. 
# The specimen is heat-fixed by passing the slide, inoculum side up, through a [[bunsen burner|bunsen]] flame 1-2 times, without allowing the slide to become hot to the touch.
# A [[alkali|basic]] dye, [[methyl violet|crystal violet]] or [[gentian violet]], is used to stain the slide. This dye is taken up by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Allow to stain for 1 minute. The slide should look purple to the unaided eye, and if examined microscopically at this point both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are purple. Lugol can also be used instead of crystal violet.
# Rinse off with water for a maximum of 5 seconds.
# Add [[iodine]] (Gram's iodine) [[solution]] (1[[how to make a % solution|%]] iodine, 2% potassium iodide in water) for 1 minute. This acts as a [[mordant]] and fixes the dye.
# Rinse with water.
# Apply 95% [[ethanol]] or a mixture of [[acetone]] and [[alcohol]]. This washes away all the unbound [[alkali|basic]] dye, (usually crystal violet) and leaves [[Gram-positive]] organisms stained purple and [[Gram-negative]] organisms unstained (colourless).
# Rinse with water immediately to prevent over-decolourisation (as prolonged exposure to the decolourising agent will remove all the stain from both types of bacteria).
# Apply a suitable [[counterstain]]. Suitable stains include [[safranin]] or [[fuchsin]]. This stain is taken up by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, but does not alter the colour of Gram-positive organism much, as they are already purple. It does, however, make the Gram-negative organisms pinkish-red.
#Blot gently and allow the slide to dry. Do not smear.

[[Image:Gram-stain-slide.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A Gram-stained slide containing both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria]]

===Interpretation===
When inspecting the slide under a [[microscope]]:
* ''[[Gram-positive]]'' organisms will appear ''blue-black'' or ''purple''.
* ''[[Gram-negative]]'' organisms will appear ''red'' or ''pink''.

Organisms that cannot reliably be differentiated by this staining technique are said to be '''Gram-variable'''. These are Gram-positive bacteria that lose the stain easily and therefore may appear as a mixture of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, [[mycobacteria]] - the causative agents of [[tuberculosis]] and [[leprosy]] - are said to be [[acid-fast]] and resistant to Gram staining entirely. [[Ziehl-Neelsen stain|Ziehl-Neelsen staining]] is particularly useful as a Gram stain alternative in these cases.

==One-step Gram staining==
If a [[Microscopy|fluorescent microscope]] is available, the Gram stain can be reduced to a one-step procedure where Gram-positive and Gram-negative cells fluoresce with different colours. This shortens the length of the procedure considerably, which is especially useful if staining a large amount of samples (which is often the case in a clinical laboratory).

==Mechanism==
Gram-positive bacteria have a thick mesh-like cell wall made of [[peptidoglycan]] which is capable of retaining the violet dye/iodine complex. Gram-negative bacteria have a thin cell wall made of a layer of peptidoglycan. In addition to an inner membrane, they also have an outer membrane which contains [[lipid]]s, and is separated from the cell wall by the periplasmic space.

The decolourising mixture causes dehydration of the multilayered peptidoglycan in the Gram-positive cell wall, thus decreasing the space between the molecules and causing the cell wall to trap the crystal violet-iodine complex within the cell. But in Gram-negative bacteria, the decolourising mixture acts as a lipid solvent and dissolves the outer membrane of the Gram-negative cell wall. The thin layer of peptidoglycan is unable to retain the crystal violet-iodine complex and the Gram-negative cell is decolorized. The decolourisation step is the crucial one, and requires some degree of skill, as being Gram-positive is not an all-or-none phenomenon.

As a rule of thumb (which has exceptions), Gram-negative bacteria are more dangerous as disease organisms, because their outer membrane is often hidden by a capsule or [[slime layer]] which hides the antigens of the cell and so acts as &quot;camouflage&quot; - the human body recognises a foreign body by its antigens; if they are hidden, it becomes harder for the body to detect the invader.  Often the presence of a [[capsule]] will increase the virulence of a [[pathogen]]. Additionally, Gram-negative bacteria have [[lipopolysaccharide]] in their outer membrane.  Lipopolysaccharide is an [[endotoxin]] which increases the severity of [[inflammation]]. This inflammation may be so severe that [[septic shock]] may occur.  Gram-positive infections are generally less severe because the human body does not contain peptidoglycan, and in fact the human body produces an [[enzyme]] called [[lysozyme]] which attacks the open peptidoglycan layer of Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria are also frequently much more susceptible to [[beta-lactam antibiotic]]s, such as [[penicillin]].

'''Gram-positive''' [[Bacteria|bacteria]] are those that are stained dark blue or violet by [[Gram staining]], in contrast to [[Gram-negative]] bacteria, which cannot retain the stain, instead taking up the [[counterstain]] and appearing red or pink. The stain is caused by a high amount of [[peptidoglycan]] in the [[cell wall]], which typically, but not always lacks the secondary membrane and [[lipopolysaccharide]] layer found in Gram-negative bacteria.

In the original bacterial phyla, the Gram-positive forms made up the [[phylum (biology)|phylum]] [[Firmicutes]], a name now used for the largest group. It includes many well-known genera such as ''[[Bacillus]]'', ''[[Listeria]]'', ''[[Staphylococcus]]'', ''[[Streptococcus]]'', ''[[Enterococcus]]'', and ''[[Clostridium]]''. It has also been expanded to include the Mollicutes, bacteria like ''[[Mycoplasma]]'' that lack cell walls and so cannot be stained by Gram, but are derived from such forms.

The [[actinobacteria]] are another major group of Gram-positive bacteria; they and the Firmicutes are referred to as the high 93988</id>

The '''German Navy''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Deutsche Marine'' {{Audio|De-Marine-pronunciation.ogg|&lt;small&gt;listen&lt;/small&gt;}}) is the [[navy]] of [[Germany]] and part of the [[Bundeswehr]]. 

The German Navy traces its roots back to the Imperial Fleet (Reichsflotte) of the [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary era of 1848-1852]] and more directly to the [[Prussian Navy]], which later evolved into the Northern German Federal Navy ([[Norddeutsche Bundesmarine]], [[1866]]-[[1871]]) and became the Imperial Navy ([[Kaiserliche Marine]], [[1872]]-[[1918]]). From [[1919]] to [[1921]] it was known as the Temporary Imperial Navy (Vorläufige Reichsmarine) and then became the [[Reichsmarine]]. It was known as the War Navy ([[Kriegsmarine]]) from [[1935]] to [[1945]].  

In [[1956]], with [[West Germany]]'s accession to [[NATO]], a new navy was established and was referred to as the Federal Navy (Bundesmarine). With the reunification of Germany in [[1990]], it was decided to simply use the name ''Deutsche Marine'' (&quot;German Navy&quot;).
[[Image:Fregatte Karlsruhe.jpg|thumb|left|250px|German frigate &quot;Karlsruhe&quot; rescuing shipwrecked people off the coast of [[Somalia]] while participating in the international anti-terror operation ENDURING FREEDOM, April 2005]]

== Missions ==

The German Navy is part of the German armed forces (''[[Bundeswehr]]''), and is deeply integrated into the [[NATO]] alliance. Its mission includes the participation in peace-keeping and peace enforcement operations as well as the protection of German and Allied territories. German war ships permanently participate in all ''NATO Maritime Groups''. The German Navy is also engaged in operations against international [[terrorism]] such as [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and NATO-Operation [[Active Endeavour]].

== Organization ==

The German Navy is commanded by the '''Chief of the Naval Staff''' in the Federal Ministry of Defense in [[Bonn]]. The major commands are the '''Fleet Command''' at Glücksburg near [[Flensburg]] and the '''Naval Office''' at [[Rostock]]. The Fleet is being commanded by the Commander-in-Chief German Fleet (CINCGERFLEET) and comprises all combat vessels, [[aircraft]], [[helicopter]]s and other combat forces, while schools, naval bases and test installations are under the purview of the Naval Office. The strength of the Navy is about 19,000 men and women with another 6,000 navy personnel serving in different elements of the central military organization of the Bundeswehr.

The navy as a part of the Bundeswehr is responsible for developing and providing the maritime capabilities of the German armed forces. Therefore it owns a number of development and testing installations that are part of an interservice and international network.

After reunification, the modern German navy concentrated all ships of a given type at one base. The ''type bases'' are:

*[[Wilhelmshaven]] ([[North Sea]]): Frigates
*[[Nordholz]] ([[North Sea]]) Naval Air Service
*[[Eckernförde]] ([[Baltic Sea]]): Submarines, Fleet Protection Group, Divers 
*[[Warnemünde]] ([[Baltic Sea]]): Fast Attack Craft, Corvettes
*[[Kiel]] ([[Baltic Sea]]): Mine Counter-Measure, Helicopter

The [[Laboe Naval Memorial]] near Kiel is the German memorial for sailors who lost their lives at sea during the World Wars and while on duty at sea.

'''GÉANT''' is the main [[Europe]]an multi-[[gigabit]] [[computer network]] for [[research]] and [[education]] purposes. GÉANT link speeds range from 155 Mbit/s on the slowest spur links to 10 Gbit/s in the core [[optical fiber]] network.

The GÉANT project began in November [[2000]], entered full production operation in December [[2001]] (fully replacing [[TEN-155]]). Originally due to finish in October [[2004]], it was subsequently extended until April [[2005]]. The project to plan, procure, build and operate the next generation of the network was named GÉANT2 and it began in September [[2004]].

It is intended that GÉANT interconnect with other regional research networks (such as [[Abilene Network]], [[CANARIE]], [[ESnet]], [[SINET]]) to create a single global research network. It currently has gigabit links to North America and Japan.

The GÉANT network is managed by [[DANTE]] (Delivery of Advanced Network Technology to Europe).

''' Gamma-hydroxybutyrate''' (4-hydroxybutanoic acid, C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is both a [[medication|drug]] and a naturally occurring compound found in the [[central nervous system]] as well as in other organs such as the liver, kidneys, heart and bones. GHB is structurally similar to the [[ketone body]] [[beta-hydroxybutyrate]].  As a drug it is used most commonly in the form of a chemical salt (Na-GHB or K-GHB). The sodium salt is commercially known as '''sodium oxybate'''. 

== Uses == 

=== Endogenous ===

The precise function of GHB in the body is not clear. It is an immediate precursor to [[GABA]], a neurotransmitter which regulates awakeness, physical activity and sleep. As GABA cannot cross the [[blood-brain barrier]], GHB obtained from food may be used for converting to GABA. GHB prevents cells from oxygen starvation, which might explain presence of the compound in vital organs. GHB was also found to have [[neuroprotective]] capabilities.

=== Medical ===

It has been used as a general [[anesthetic]], and a [[hypnotic]] in the treatment of [[insomnia]].  GHB has also been used to treat [[clinical depression]], and improve athletic performance.  In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] permits the use of GHB under the trade name Xyrem to reduce the number of [[cataplexy]] attacks in patients with [[narcolepsy]].
In Italy, under the trade name Alcover, GHB is used in the treatment of [[alcoholism]] (50 to 100 milligrams per kilogram per day, in 3 or more divided doses), both for acute alcohol withdrawal and medium to long term detoxification.

=== Recreational ===

[[Image:Gamma-hydroxybutyrate.jpg|thumb|Gamma-hydroxybutyrate powder]]

GHB is an [[intoxicant]]. It may be known as G, Liquid X, Liquid E. It is less commonly known as GHB, Gamma-oh, Georgia Homeboy,Georgia Detwiler, Georgia Hillbilly, Blue Verve, Gamma-G, Qi, scoop, or goop.  

Its potential for use as a [[date rape]] drug in the 1990s led to it being placed in the US on Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act in March, 2000. On March 20, 2001, the [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] placed GHB in Schedule IV of the 1971 [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]][http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/gamma/]. In the UK it was made a class C drug in June 2003. 

The sodium salt of GHB has a thin, very salty, chemical taste. At low doses, GHB can cause a state of [[euphoria]], increased sociality and [[intoxication]]. This kind of use is particularly common at [[rave party|rave parties]]. At higher doses, GHB may induce nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, visual disturbances, depressed breathing, [[amnesia]] and unconsciousness. The effects of GHB can last from 1.5 to 3 hours. 

Some chemicals convert to GHB in the stomach and blood. GBL, or [[gamma-butyrolactone]], is one such precursor. It is 1,6 times less potent than GHB, so 1ml of GBL is equivalent to 0,4g of GHB. GBL has also a shorter onset and is longer acting than GHB. GBL has an extremely bad taste and is also known to irritate innards and skin.

Other precursors include [[1,4-Butanediol|1,4-butanediol]]. There may be additional toxicity concerns with these precursors.

== Mode of action ==

The action of GHB has yet to be fully elucidated. GHB clearly has at least two sites of action, stimulating the newly characterized and aptly named &quot;GHB receptor&quot; as well as the [[GABA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;]]. GHB, if it is indeed a neurotransmitter, will only reach concentrations high enough to act at the GHB receptor, as it only has weak affinity fo the GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;. However, during recreational usage, GHB can reach very high concentrations in the brain, relative to basal levels, and can act at the GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16129424&amp;query_hl=21]. GHBs action at the GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is probably responsible for its sedative effects. GHB-mediated GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor stimulation inhibits dopamine release as well as causes the release of natural sedative [[neuroactive steroid|neurosteroids]] (like all other GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; agonists e.g. [[Baclofen]]). In animals GHBs sedative effects can be stopped by GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; antagonists (blockers).

The relevance of the GHB receptor in the behavioural effects induced by GHB is more controversial. It seems hard to believe that the GHB receptor is not important when it is densely expressed in many areas of the brain, including the cortex, as well as it being the high affinity site of GHB action. There is limited research into GHB receptor. However, evidence shows that it causes the release of [[glutamate]], which should be stimulatory. It does not seem, however, that the GHB receptor explains either GHB's sedative or rewarding/addictive properties. 

One can propose a scheme where high doses of GHB are sedative through its action at the GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor, while a lower dose is somehow stimulatory. This may explain the so-called &quot;rebound&quot; effect, experienced by individuals using GHB as a sleeping agent, where they awake after several hours of GHB-induced sleep. That is to say, that over time, the concentration of GHB in the system decreases (because of metabolism) below a threshold for stimulating GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor function, and simply stimulates the GHB receptor, leading to wakefulness.

== Dangers ==

The dose-response curve is very steep and as GHB often comes as a salt dissolved in water, actual amount of GHB per &quot;capful&quot; can vary, which makes proper dosing difficult. While small doses of GHB are considered to be safe, higher and ultra high doses can cause [[unconsciousness]], [[convulsions]], [[vomiting]], suppression of the [[gag reflex]] and [[breathing]], and [[death]]. These effects vary between persons and are dose dependent. Synergy of its sedative effects are seen when combined with other [[CNS depressants]] such as alcohol, [[benzodiazepine]]s (e.g. [[Valium]]), [[barbiturate]]s, and others. Deaths from GHB alone are either extremely rare or non-existent. Death while using GHB is most likely in combination with alcohol as a result of choking on vomit and asphyxiating. Death might also be possible from respiratory depression as high doses of GHB could eventually inhibit the breathing centers in the brainstem. However, it has been argued that it is extremely difficult to take a lethal dose of GHB, as a user would fall unconscious long before the lethal dose is reached. [[LD50]] of GHB is estimated to be between 1100mg/kg and 2000mg/kg [http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ghb/ghb_chemistry.shtml] in rodents, and is almost certainly lower in humans.

There have been no long-term studies into the effect of GHB if taken chronically, and hence whether prolonged use of GHB causes any bodily harm (aside from addiction) remains unanswered.

== Addiction ==

GHB is physically [[addictive]] and may also result in [[psychological addiction]]. Physical dependence develops when GHB is taken on a regular basis (i.e. every 2-4 hours for multiple consecutive days or weeks). [[Withdrawal]] effects may include hallucinations, [[insomnia]], [[anxiety]], [[tremor]]s, sweating, edginess, chest pain and tightness, muscle and bone aches, sensitivity to external stimuli (sound, light, touch), [[dysphoria]], and mental dullness. These side effects will subside after 2 - 21 days depending on usage. Although there have been reported fatalities due to GHB withdrawal, reports are inconclusive and further research is needed.  Unlike [[ethanol|alcohol]], it is unknown at this point if chronic use of GHB causes permanent damage to the body. However, clinical tests showed that there was no organ or brain damage in rats that were chronically administrated with GHB [http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/index.cfm?objectid=07097962-0CEC-4EFA-62E349AF22EB2E9D].

== History ==

GHB was first synthesized in the early [[1960s]] by Dr. [[Henri Laborit]] to use in studying the neurotransmitter [[GABA]]. It quickly found a wide range of uses due to its minimal side effects and controlled action, the only difficulties being the narrow safe dosage range and the dangers presented by its combination with [[alcohol]] and other CNS depressants.

Typically GHB has been synthesized from GBL ([[Gamma-butyrolactone]]) by adding [[sodium hydroxide]] (lye) in ethanol or water. As of late, GBL has become controlled and more circuitous routes have to be taken such as those starting with THF ([[tetrahydrofuran]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Giordano_Bruno.jpg|thumb|Giordano Bruno]]

'''Giordano Bruno''' ([[1548]]-[[1600]]), was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[philosopher]], [[priest]], [[astronomer]], and [[occultist]]. Bruno is perhaps best known for his system of mnemonics and as an early proponent of the idea of extrasolar planets and extraterrestrial life. [[burned at the stake|Burned at the stake]] as a [[heresy|heretic]] for his theological ideas, Bruno is seen by some as a [[martyr]] to the cause of [[freedom of thought|free thought]]. 

==Early life==

Born, Filippo at [[Nola]], in [[Campania]], in the [[Kingdom of Naples]], [[1548]].  He was the son of Giovanni Bruno, a soldier.  At the age of eleven he traveled to [[Naples]] to study the [[Trivium]].  At 15, Bruno entered the [[Dominican Order]], taking the name of Giordano. He continued his studies, completing his novitate, and becoming an ordained [[priest]] in [[1572]].

He was interested in [[philosophy]] and was an expert on the art of [[memory]]; he wrote books on [[mnemonic]] technique, which [[Frances Yates]] contends may have been disguised [[Hermes Trismegistus|Hermetic]] tracts. The writings attributed to [[Hermes Trismegistus]] were, in Bruno's time, recently rediscovered and at that time were thought to date uniformly to the earliest days of ancient [[Egypt]]. They are now believed to date mostly from about [[300]] A.D. and to be associated with [[Neoplatonism]]. Bruno embraced a sort of [[pantheism|pantheistic]] [[hylozoism]], rather than orthodox Christian [[Trinity|Trinitarian belief]]. 
[[Image:GiordanoBrunomnemonic.gif|thumb|left|200px|Woodcut illustration of one of Giordano Bruno's mnemonic devices: in the spandrels are the four [[classical element]]s: earth, air fire, water]]
Bruno was also heavily influenced by the ideas of [[Copernicus]] and by the newly rediscovered ideas of [[Plato]] as well as the [[Hermeticism|teachings]] ascribed to [[Hermes Trismegistus]][http://www.gnosis.org/hermes.htm]. Other influences included [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Averroes]], [[Duns Scotus]], [[Marsilio Ficino]], and [[Nicholas of Cusa]].

In [[1576]] he left Naples to avoid the attention of the [[Inquisition]]. He left [[Rome]] for the same reason and abandoned the Dominican order. He travelled to [[Geneva]] and briefly joined the [[Calvinism|Calvinists]], before he was [[excommunication|excommunicated]], ostensibily for his adherence to [[Copernih/1962/2/1962_2_18.shtml].  

During the [[Spanish-American War]] the U.S. fleet attacking Santiago needed shelter from the summer hurricane season. Thus Guantánamo with its excellent harbor was chosen for this purpose. The Marines landed successfully with naval support; however, as they went inland Spanish resistance increased to the point at which Cuban scouts were needed to save the leathernecks.  

'''U.S. Naval Station Guantánamo Bay''', which covers 116&amp;nbsp;km² (approx. 45 sq miles), is sometimes abbreviated as '''GTMO''' or &quot;'''Gitmo'''&quot;. It was established in [[1898]], when the United States obtained control of Cuba from [[Spain]] at the end of the [[Spanish-American War]], following the [[1898 invasion of Guantánamo Bay]].  The U.S. government obtained a perpetual [[lease]] that began on [[February 23]], [[1903]], from [[Tomás Estrada Palma]], an American citizen, who became the first President of Cuba.  The newly formed American [[protectorate]] incorporated the [[Platt Amendment]] in the Cuban Constitution.  The [[Cuban-American Treaty]] held, among other things, that the United States, for the purposes of operating coaling and naval stations, has &quot;complete jurisdiction and control&quot; of the Guantánamo Bay, while the Republic of Cuba is recognized to retain ultimate sovereignty.

In [[1905]], in part because of the [[Platt Amendment]], there was an uprising to which the United States responded by occupying Cuba for three years.  A [[1934]] treaty reaffirming the lease granted Cuba and her trading partners free access through the bay, modified the lease payment from $2,000 in U.S. gold coins per year, to the 1934 equivalent value of $4,085 in U.S. Treasury Dollars&lt;!-- Federal Reserve Notes, United States Notes, or is the treaty not that specific? --&gt;, and added a requirement that termination of the lease requires the consent of both governments, or the abandonment of the base property by the United States.

With over 9,500 U.S. troops, [http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0504/index.html]  Guantánamo Bay is the only U.S. base in operation on [[Communist state|Communist]] soil, as of 2006.

Until the Cuban Revolution, thousands of Cubans worked inside the base, commuting each day through several gates.  In mid-1958 when the Cuban territory was declared off limits, the flow of traffic was stopped and Cuban workers coming into the base were required to walk through the gate checkpoint.  Public Works Center busses were pressed into service almost overnight to carry the tremendous volume of Cuban workers to and from the gate. [http://www.nsgtmo.navy.mil/history/gtmohistorymurphyvol1ch18.htm]

Since coming to power, [[Fidel Castro]] has only cashed one rent check, while steadfastly refusing to cash any others, because he views the lease as illegitimate.  After the Cuban Revolution many Cubans sought refuge on the base, and Castro had the military plant 8 miles of cactus along the Northeastern section of the fenceline during the fall of 1961 to inhibit people from crossing onto the base — this lead to the moniker &quot;Cactus Curtain&quot;, as an allusion to the [[Iron Curtain]] in Europe. [http://www.nsgtmo.navy.mil/history/gtmohistorymurphyvol1ch18.htm]

Today, however, although diplomatic relations do not exist between the two countries, the United States has agreed to return fugitives from Cuban law to Cuban authorities, and Cuba agreed to return fugitives from U.S. law, for offenses committed in Guantánamo Bay, to U.S. authorities.

During the [[Cuban Missile|Cuban Missile Crisis]], the civilian families of military personnel were evacuated from the base.  Dependents were notified of the evacuation on October 22nd; evacuees were told to pack one suitcase for each member of the family, to bring evacuation and immunization cards, to tie pets in the yard, leave the keys to the house on the dining table, and stand by in front of the house ready to board busses. [http://www.nsgtmo.navy.mil/history/gtmohistorymurphyvol1ch19.htm] Dependents were then either bussed to ports, where they boarded evacuation ships, or were flown to the U.S. mainland.

Since 1939 the base's water had been supplied by pipelines from the Yateras River, approximately four and one-half miles northeast of the base, but in 1964 the Cuban government cut off water to the base.  At the time the U. S. Government paid a monthly rate of about $14,000, receiving about two and one-half million gallons per day. Average consumption was about two million gallons per day.  When the water cut-off occurred, about 14 million gallons of water was in storage, and strict water conservation was put into effect immediately.  First the United States imported water from [[Jamaica]] via barges, and later the United States built [[desalination]] plants.[http://www.nsgtmo.navy.mil/history/gtmohistorymurphyvol1ch21.htm]  When the Cuban government accused the United States of stealing water, the base commander ordered that the water pipelines coming into the base be cut and a section removed. A 38-inch section of the 14-inch pipe and a 20-inch section of the 10-inch pipe were cut and lifted from the ground and the openings sealed permanently. 

Today, the base is self-sufficient, producing its own water and electricity.  After the resolution of the water crisis, in December, [[1964]], military dependents were allowed to return to the base.  Only two Cubans, both elderly, still cross the base's North East Gate daily to work on the base; the Cuban government prohibits new recruitment.  Now only rarely do Cubans escape here, going by water around the mine fields, to reach the base. U.S. Troops scattered 75,000 land mines across the so-called &quot;no man's land&quot;, i.e. the land strip between the U.S. and Cuban border.  It was the largest mine field in the western hemisphere and 2nd largest in the world. On [[May 16]], [[1996]] a Presidential Order required the removal of the mines.  They have since been replaced with motion and sound sensors to detect intruders.  The Cuban government has not removed a corresponding minefield on its side of the border. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1731704.stm]

The U.S. control of this Cuban territory has never been popular with the Cuban government or the Cuban people.  The Cuban government strongly denounces the treaty on grounds that article 52 of the [[1969]] [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] declares a treaty void if its conclusion has been procured by the threat or use of force — in this case by the inclusion, in [[1903]], of the [[Platt Amendment]] in the Cuban Constitution. The United States warned the [[Cuban Constitutional Convention]] not to modify the Amendment, and was told U.S. troops would not leave Cuba until its terms had been adopted as a condition for the U.S. to grant independence, making the [[Geneva Conventions]] applicable to the [[1903]]/[[1934]] treaty upheld by that Amendment.

The United States holds that by cashing the first check received in accordance with said treaty, Castro's government effectively ratified the lease, and cannot unilaterally change its mind after the fact on account of political tensions or ideological differences. It further argues that all claims regarding an original violation of sovereignty under the Platt Amendment, and questions of an illegal military occupation, became moot once the new and independent revolutionary government freely reaffirmed the base's legitimacy.

===Gitmo's [[fast food]]===
In [[1986]], Guantánamo became host to Cuba's first and only [[McDonald's]] restaurant, as well as a [[Subway (restaurant)| Subway]][http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/military/july-dec03/gbay_10-14.html].  These fast food restaurants are on base, and not accessible to Cubans.  It has been reported that prisoners showing good behavior have been rewarded not only with dates, pita bread and even [[twinkies]], but also '[[Happy Meal|Happy Meals]]', [[hamburger|hamburgers]] or [[Filet-O-Fish]] sandwiches from the McDonalds's located at Camp America.[http://nation.ittefaq.com/artman/publish/article_24715.shtml]

==Detention of prisoners==
{{current}}
[[Image:Camp x-ray detainees.jpg|right|thumb|251px|Detainees upon arrival at Camp X-Ray, January 2002]]
{{main|Camp Delta}}
The use of Guantánamo Bay as a military prison has been controversial among [[human rights]] organizations concerned about reports of the treatment of detainees. Critics of U.S. detainment policies also question the propriety of using an offshore prison, and the unclear legal status of its detainees (neither prisoners of war, nor tried as common criminals). Critics of protesting organizations argue that constitutional rights have never been afforded for prisoners of war or non-U.S. citizens, however they omit the protections guaranteed by international treaties, among other things, against [[torture]]. These treaties are the &quot;Supreme Law of the Land&quot; through the U.S. constitution and also cover the treatment of prisoners in [[black sites]] and exported and outsourced torture.

On [[June 16]], [[2005]], the U.S. Department of Defense announced a unit of [[defense contractor]] [[Halliburton]] will build a new $30 million detention facility and security perimeter around the base. 

In the last quarter of the [[20th century]], prior to the decision by President [[George W. Bush]] to lead the United States into the &quot;[[War on Terror]]&quot;, the base was used to house Cuban and [[Haiti]]an refugees intercepted on the high seas.  Most controversially, the base was used during the early [[1990s]] to hold often [[HIV]]-positive refugees fleeing Haiti after the overthrow of democratically-elected President [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]] by a military [[coup d'etat]].  These refugees were held in a detainment area called [[Camp Bulkeley]] until [[U.S. District Court]] Judge [[Sterling Johnson Jr.]] declared the camp unconstitutional on [[June 8]], [[1993]].  The last Haitian migrants departed from Guantánamo on [[1 November]] [[1995]].

Beginning in 2002, however, a small portion of the base was used to imprison suspected [[al-Qaeda]] and [[Taliban]] prisoners captured in [[Afghanistan]] and elsewhere at [[Camp Delta]], Echo, [[Camp Iguana]], and the now closed Camp X-Ray.

The names of more than 317 of the about 500 alleged enemy combatants being held in Guantánamo Bay were released by the [[Department of Defense]] on [[March 3]], [[2006]], after a [[court order]] to reveal them. [[Jed_S._Rakoff#Associated_Press_v._Dep.27t_of_Defense|The court order]] required the DoD to release the names of all the detainees.  Although justice [[Jed Rakoff]] had already dismissed this argument, Pentagon spokesmen Bryan Whitman justified withholding the names out of a concern for the detainees' privacy.

===Statistics===
As of June 2005, the United States was holding about 520 foreign terrorism suspects at the facility, some of whom were captured in [[Afghanistan]].  On [[September 22]], [[2004]] ten prisoners were brought from Afghanistan. A total of 242 detainees have been moved out of Guantánamo as of [[July 20]], [[2005]], according to the [http://usinfo.state.gov/xarchives/display.html?p=washfile-english&amp;y=2005&amp;m=July&amp;x=20050720174600adynned0.488476&amp;t=livefeeds/wf-latest.html U.S. Department of Defense],
Of these 242, 173 have been released, and 69 transferred to the governments of other countries. 

On [[November 12]], [[2005]], the [[Wall Street Journal]] reported that as of [[November 7]], [[2005]],  358 of the 505 detainees then held at Guantánamo Bay had had Administrative Review Board hearings. Of these, 3 percent were granted and awaiting release, the decision was to transfer in 20 percent, the decision was to continue to detain in 37 percent, and there was no decision yet in 40 percent.  

The WSJ reports that of the 505 detainees held in Guantánamo,  100 or more are from Saudi Arabia, about 80 are from Yemen, about 65 are from Pakistan and about 50 are from Afghanistan. Two detainees are from Syria.

A [http://law.shu.edu/news/guantanamo_report_final_2_08_06.pdf report based on data supplied by the Defense Department] showed that 86% of the prisoners were handed over by local bounty-hunters rather than as the result any American investigation or collection of intelligence.

The WSJ reports that there are 28 detainees at Guantánamo on hunger strikes. Of those, 23 are being tube-fed at the local military hospital. This number is down sharply from July of [[2005]], when more than 100 detainees were on hunger strikes.

===Detention camps===
[[Image:camp_delta.jpg|thumb|300px|A Camp Delta recreation and exercise area at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The detention block is shown with sunshades drawn on [[December 3]], [[2002]].]]

It is argued that U.S. government is currently in breach of the Geneva Conventions, as the Third [[Geneva Convention]] makes no distinction between 'Prisoners of War' and 'illegal combatants'.[http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,921192,00.html] The [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration believes that the Third Geneva Convention, by defining who is subject to its protections, clearly implies that there may be persons who engage in hostilities against American forces who are not covered by its purview. No foreign state has supported this view. The United States of America government currently refuses to give Guantánamo detainees trials.

The Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly has released its own report on [http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc05/EDOC10497.htm the Lawfulness of detentions by the United States of America in Guantánamo Bay] and more recently both Amnesty International and the United Nations have expressed their own concerns in a [http://web.amnesty.org/pages/guantanamobay-index-eng series of reports] into what they call &quot;a human rights scandal&quot;.

Camp Delta is the main prison at Guantánamo Bay. As of [[July 22]], [[2005]] there are &quot;about 510 prisoners at Guantánamo.&quot; [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/22/politics/22gitmo.html]

The Migrant Operations Center on Guantánamo typically keeps less than 30 individuals interdicted at sea in the Caribbean region.

==Camp Delta==
''Main article: [[Camp Delta]]''

'''Camp Delta''' (composed of detention camps: 1,2,3,4,5,6, and [[Camp Echo]]) is located in the [[United States|U.S.]] [[United States Navy|naval base]] that stands on [[Guantánamo Bay]] in [[Cuba]]. It is a permanent 612-unit detention center. Construction of the camp began on [[February 27]], [[2002]] with workers from Kellogg, Brown and Root, a subsidiary of [[Halliburton]], [[Seabee|Navy Seabees]], and Marine Engineers. It finished approximately in the middle of April 2002. The U.S. army military police make up the security force present at Camp Delta. 

Camp 3 is the maximum security camp; when a prisoner first arrives, he is sent here. When a detainee shows co-operation with the staff, he is moved to Camp 2. With more co-operation, the prisoner is moved to Camp 1. Finally, when a prisoner shows no security risk and is actively co-operating with the interrogation process, he is moved to Camp 4. 

Camp 4 detainees are housed in buildings with four communal living rooms of 10 persons, each with a private toilet and sink, as well as a larger shower and toilet room that serve the entire complex.  Detainees each have a bed with a mattress, locker for storing personal items like diaries and books. Camp 4 also has small, common recreational areas for playing board games and team sports.  Detainees at Camp 4 share communal meals, and wear white instead of orange.[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/guantanamo-bay_delta.htm]

[[Camp Echo]] is a detention center where pre-commissions are held. The detainees here have access to [[lawyers]] and hold private conversations with them. [[Camp Iguana]] is a low-security detention center once used for juvenile detainees, now used for some of the 38 deemed non-illegal combatants while they await transfer to a permanent home abroad.

==Camp Iguana==
{{main|Camp Iguana}}

Camp Iguana was a separate, smaller compound, over a kilometer distant from the main prison compound, used to house the most privileged  prisoners.  In 2002 and 2003 it housed three of the youngest detainees who were under age 16. The Iguana compound was closed when the three juveniles were flown home in [[January 2004]].  At least ten more minors were detained with the adult prisoners in Camp Delta {{ref|CliveStaffordSmith}}.

The compound was reopened in mid-2005, when the [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]s had determined that 38 detainees were not &quot;illegal combatants&quot;.   Some of these 38 detainees who could not safely be repatriated to their home country were moved to Camp Iguana.  

According to an article in the London [[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]] on [[June 26]] [[2003]], the living quarters are air-conditioned and consist of &quot;a bedroom with twin beds, a small living room with two armchairs, sofa and television, and a bathroom and kitchenette&quot;, with an oven present for aesthetic reasons, and a refrigerator whose fruit and dessert contents are reportedly handled as part of a reward system. A line of black tape on the floor separates the living room and kitchen areas while privacy in the bathroom is handled by a blue curtain.

==Camp X-Ray (closed April 2002)==
[[Image:camp_xray.jpg|thumb|300px|Camp X-Ray, shown here under construction, was a temporary holding facility for detainees held at U.S. Naval Base Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.]]
'''Camp X-Ray''' was a temporary detention facility located at the [[Joint Task Force Guantánamo]] on the [[United States Navy|U.S. Naval Base]] in Guantánamo Bay, [[Cuba]]. It was named ''Camp X-Ray'' because various temporary camps in the station were named sequentially from the beginning and then from the end of the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]]. The legal status of [[detainee|detainees]] at the camp has been a significant source of [[controversy]], ultimately reaching the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]. 

As of [[April 29]], [[2002]], the official Camp X-Ray was closed and all prisoners were transferred to [[Camp Delta]]. However, the term &quot;Camp X-Ray&quot; is sometimes still used as synonym for the entire facility where suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban illegal combatants are detained.

Care of the detainees at Camp X-Ray was handled by Joint Task Force 160 (JTF-160), while interrogations were conducted by Joint Task Force 170 (JTF-170).

JTF-160 was under the command of [[United States Marines|Marine]] [[Brigadier General]] [[Michael Lehnert]] until [[March 2002]], when he was replaced by Brigadier General [[Rick Baccus]]. In [[November 2002]], Baccus was replaced as commander by [[Major General]] [[Geoffrey Miller (MG)|Geoffrey Miller]]. He was in turn replaced by Brigadier General Jay Hood in March 2004 while Miller was sent to deal with the [[Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse]] in [[Iraq]]. [[U.S. Army]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Bill Cline serves as the commander for security forces. Since Camp X-Ray's closure and the subsequent opening of Camp Delta, JTF-160 and 170 have been combined into Joint Task Force Guantánamo (JTF-GTMO).

The U.S. government has classified the detainees in Camp X-Ray as &quot;[[illegal combatant]]s,&quot; rather than [[POW|prisoners of war]] (POWs), which they claim means that they do not have to be conferred the rights granted to POWs under the [[Geneva Conventions]]. The U.S. government justifies this designation by claiming that they do not have the status of either regular [[soldier]]s nor that of [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]], and they are not part of a regular [[army]] or [[militia]]. In [[July 2003]], about 680 alleged [[Taliban]] members and suspected [[Al-Qaeda]] [[terrorism|terrorists]] from 42 different countries were housed there. None have been allowed to meet with [[attorney]]s.

The [[human rights]] organization [[Human Rights Watch]] has criticized the [[George W. Bush|Bush administration]] over this designation in its 2003 world report, stating: &quot;Washington has ignored [[human rights|human rights standards]] in its own treatment of terrorist suspects. It has refused to apply the Geneva Conventions to prisoners of war from [[Afghanistan]], and has misused the designation of 'illegal combatant' to apply to [[crime|criminal]] suspects on U.S. soil.&quot;

On [[April 23]], [[2003]], the U.S. military reported that three of the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] war prisoners held at Camp Delta had been identified as juveniles, were separated from the adult prisoners, and moved to markedly better conditions at Camp Iguana.

On [[July 23]], [[2003]], U.S. Major General [[Geoffrey Miller]] said that three-quarters of the roughly 660 detainees had confessed to some involvement in terrorism. Many have informed about friends and colleagues. According to Miller, the confessions were acquired through rewards that included extended recreation time, extra food rations to keep in their cells, or a move to the prison's medium-security facility. However, some have questioned the value of the confessions, given the conditions under which they were obtained. Similarly, the general's statement, if true, could be construed to mean that a quarter of the detainees have admitted no guilt to the charges that they are terrorists or were involved in terrorism, and therefore may be unjustly incarcerated.

As of [[August 2003]], at least 29 inmates of Camp Delta had attempted [[suicide]] in protest. The U.S. officials would not say why they had not previously reported the incident [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4204027.stm]. After this event [[the Pentagon]] reclassified suicides as &quot;[[manipulative self-injurious behavior]]s&quot; because it is alleged by camp physicians that detainees do not genuinely wish to end their lives. The prisoners supposedly feel that they may be able to get better treatment or release with suicide attempts. [[Daryl Matthews]], a professor of forensic psychiatry at the [[University of Hawaii]] who examined the prisoners, stated that given the cultural differences between interrogators and prisoners, such a classification was difficult if not impossible. Depression is common in Guantánamo, with 1/5 of all prisoners taking [[antidepressants]] such as [[prozac]].[http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article5405.htm]

In late [[January 2004]], U.S. officials released three children aged 13 to 15 and returned them to [[Afghanistan]].  Prison officials say these three were the only detainees below the age of 16.  In [[March 2004]], twenty-three adult prisoners were released to [[Afghanistan]], five were released to the [[United Kingdom]] (the final four British detainees were released in [[January 2005]]), and three were sent to [[Pakistan]].

On [[August 4]], [[2004]], the three ex-detainees who were returned to the U.K. (who were freed by the British authorities within 24 hours of their return home), filed a report in the U.S. claiming persistent severe abuse at the Camp, of themselves and others (See [http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1275478,00.html]''The Guardian'' newspaper article). They claimed that false confessions were extracted from them under duress, in conditions which amounted to torture. They alleged that conditions deteriorated when Major General Geoffrey Miller took charge of the camp, including increased periods of solitary confinement for the detainees. They claimed that the abuse took place with the knowledge of the intelligence forces. Their claims are currently being investigated by the British Government.

There are five British residents remaining: [[Bisher Amin Khalil Al-Rawi]], [[Jamil al Banna]], [[Shis period at the [[Home Ministry (Japan)|Home Ministry]], he lead the [[Keishicho (to 1945)|Keishicho]] (Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department).

He became the Commander of the 24th Infantry Brigade in August [[1934]]; the [[Commanding General]] of the [[Military Police]] in the Kantogun in September [[1935]]; [[Lieutenant General]] in December [[1936]]; [[Chief of Staff]] of the Kantogun in March [[1937]]; the Vice-Minister of War in May [[1938]] (during the first [[Konoye]] Cabinet); and the [[Inspector General]] of [[Army Aviation]] in December 1938.

In July 1937, he personally lead the units of the 1st Independent Mixed Brigade at the [[Chahar Battle]].  When the [[China Incident]] occurred, the section stationed in [[Manchukuo]] moved to [[Hopei]] and fought near [[Peking]] against Chinese forces. Then the Brigade was ordered to participate in the offensive in [[Chahar]] Province. The Brigade marched via [[Chengde]] and [[Dolonnor]] and reached [[Zhangbei]] in five days. The distance of this march was 700km. Units were assigned to certain infantry divisions. Seeing this use of armor, [[Commander Sakai]], the tank commader, opposed Tojo, who was the commander of the [[Chahar Expeditionary Force]]; another officer in same operation was [[Kitsuju Ayabe]]. (Later, he became the highest commander of all Japanese forces.)

In the late [[1930s]], Tojo became a member of the military clique, the [[Kodoha]], that pushed [[Japan]] into the Second World War. Appointed [[Ministry of War|War Minister]] in [[1940]], he was instrumental in leading Japan into the [[Axis Alliance]] with [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]. In July 1940, he was appointed [[War Minister]] in the second [[Fumimaro Konoye]] Cabinet, and remained in that post in the third Konoye Cabinet. When [[Prime Minister]] Konoye was unable to secure an agreement with the [[United States of America|United States]], Tojo's faction drove him into retirement. In [[1941]], Tojo was appointed [[prime minister]] by [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Hirohito]] and took command of the entire Japanese military. He also took leadership in [[Imperial Way Faction]] at that time. At varying times during his premiership, Tojo held the [[portfolios]] of [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Foreign Affairs]], Education, [[interior ministry|Home Affairs]], Commerce and Industry, and Munitions. As education minister, he continued [[militaristic]] and [[nationalist]] indoctrination in the national education system, and reaffirmed [[right-wing]] policies in government, in accordance with outlines traced by [[Sadao Araki]], his ideological and political precursor.

In February 1944, Tojo assumed the post of Chief of the Army General Staff. However, following a series of military disasters, culminating in the [[fall of Saipan]], he was abandoned by his backers and forced to resign on [[July 18]], [[1944]]. He retired to the first reserve list and went into seclusion.

Tojo's nickname was &quot;the razor (''kamisori'')&quot;.

==Military Service==

2dLt (Infantry), April 1905; was graduated from [[War College]], December 1915; official duty, [[Switzerland]], August 1919; Major, August 1920; official duty, [[Germany]], July 1921; LtCol, August 1924; Colonel, August 1918; [[Regimental Commander]], 1st Infantry, August 1929; MajGen, March 1933; Commandant,&quot;Rikugun Shikan Gakko&quot; ([[Military Academy]]), March 1934; 

===Rise to office of Prime Minister===
In those days, the Japanese army was strongly pushing to begin the war because Germany was winning. Tojo was one of these advocates of war. However, Hirohito did not want to start the war and preferred to keep negotiating with the U.S. in order to find a way out of the conflict. However, the prevailing opinion within the Japanese Army at that time was that continued negotiations could be dangerous. In addition, the US cut off Japan's oil supply. Hirohito thought that he might be able to control extreme opinions in the army by using Tojo since he was charismatic and had many connections within the military. Actually, at that time, Tojo was said to be the only person who could control the army. Also, Tojo was a loyal retainer of the emperor as Hirohito said later. Therefore, Hirohito called Tojo to come to the Imperial Palace one day before Tojo's took office. Tojo wrote in his diary, &quot;I thought I was called because the emperor was really angry at my opinion.&quot; 

The signal for war in the Pacific was given on [[August 26]] [[1941]], at a session of the [[Black Dragon Society]] in Tokyo. At this meeting, War Minister Hideki Tojo ordered that preparation be made to wage a total war against the armed forces of the United States, and that Japanese guns be mounted and supplies and munitions concentrated in the Marshalls and Caroline groups of the mandated islands by November, 1941. Approving Tojo's war orders, former Foreign Minister Koki Hirota, head of the Black Dragons secret services, discussed the advantages and consequences of a conflict with the United States.  Many of those at the meeting considered December, 1941, or February, 1942, the most suitable time for Japan to attack.

During September 1941 the situation worsened with continued sanctions imposed against Japanese trade and became irreversibly worse in October when Lieutenant-General Hideki Tojo became Japanese Prime Minister with the support of the Nippon nations powerful military establishment.

After arrival, Tojo given one order from the emperor: that was to keep negotiating no matter what. The emperor of Showa said from Japanese record, &quot;keep negotiating even if the U.S requires Japan to retreat its soldiers from China to Manchuria.&quot; Tojo accepted this order, and pledged to obey it because he was respecting the emperor. With that,Tojo then became the Prime Minister.  

However, from the U.S. perspective, the new prime minister looked like as if Japan decided to begin the war because the person who strongly stated to begin the war became the prime minister. This misconception became one of the reasons to show the [[Hull Note]] to Japan.

Tojo did his best to keep negotiating. However, the results were not good for the Japanese side. Japan then made the final decision to begin the war after seeing the Hull Note. The night of [[December 7]] (The U.S was 6th), Tojo was said to have sat on a futon (Japanese bed)with his back straight and his knees together, sobbing. He might have regretted his act, or might have been apologizing to the emperor.

On [[5 November]] Prime Minister Tojo revealed to his inner circle of the offensive plans for a defensive war that he felt was increasingly certain to happen. The eventual plan drawn up by Army and Navy Chiefs of Staff envisaged such a mauling of the western powers that defence perimeter line established based on the abilities of Japanese tenaciousness, operating on interior lines for communications and western casualty counts, could not be breached.

In addition, the Japanese fleet which attacked the Pearl Harbor was ordered by admiral Isoroku Yamamoto that if the negotiation did not succeed immediately before the attack, the fleet must return to Japan without the air raid on Pearl Harbor.

Numerous theories about political forces at work during this process include conspiracy theories about a concerted effort within the military-industrial complex of Japan and the right wing to derail negotiations and forge ahead with plans for colonialism and war.

===General Tojo, diplomatic actions and politics===
This fallacy became apparent as the course of the war against Japan unfolded. Japan had come to believe that the wars in Europe had so weakened the imperialists that the Mikado could pick up an extended East Asian empire at will. The Japanese military hierarchy planned a line of defence based on islands stretching from Rabaul in the Bismarck Archipelago to the Kuriles north of Japan, intending to swallow and digest the insular possessions of France, Britain, Holland, Australia, the Portuguese, and of the United States, while finishing off the Chinese - concluding the decades-long conflict that began with the notorious &quot;[[Twenty-One Demands]]&quot;.

The &quot;Indies&quot; was the Crown Jewel to the Japanese. Without it, the embargoes placed against Japan would bankrupt her. Japan had 2 years supply of oil reserve for non-military use, one year if she went to war.

===The growth of Japanese military dominance of East Asia=== 

The aggressive Japan's major problem lay in that with great modern industrial expansion had turned into a major manufacturing nation and required sufficient raw materials that could be obtained over eastern Asia. Hence Japan's swift advance in securing these areas which brought on an immediate conflict with the western powers, who also had considerable political and economic interests in the Far East region. The Japanese move into French Indo-China and diplomatic discourse with Siam (Thailand) constituted a threat to the security of British Malay, the American Philippines, Dutch East Indies and  the southern lands of Australian and New Zealand.

On Sunday [[7 December]] the Imperial Japanese Navy hit the American military base at Pearl Harbour with an aerial onslaught. The elements of total war were clearly revealed by the surprise attack 
on Pearl Harbour. Itself in line with the practices of total warfare, was also in the Japanese military tradition, for they had begun other wars previously the same way.

On [[16 February]] [[1942]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] diplomats secretly proposed a 
peace deal with Japan. A possible agreement was that if Great 
Britain formally recognised the authority of [[imperial Japan]] over 
Northern [[China]] and [[Manchuria]], the Japanese would give Britain 
sovereignty over the [[Malay Peninsula]] and Singapore.

At the same time as this diplomatic movement, a political 
confrontation was in progress between the Toho kai party and the
[[Kodoha]] party. This was possibly the last internal political 
power struggle in the government before the [[Midway]] and [[Coral 
Sea]] defeats in 1943, which sent the Japanese [[military]] reeling.

The [[ultranationalist]] Toho kai party was led by [[Nakano Seigo]] 
who appeared to have some political influence at the time 
and expressed his outright support and confidence for 
[[Japanese Navy]]. He anxiously awaited the approval of the 
peace talks, so as to stabilize the recent conquests in 
[[Southeast Asia]]. Seigo also wanted to prevented any further
sacrifices by the Japanese people towards the war effort,
and pressured the government to halt the ambitious 
conquest of Asia.

On the other side was the largely pro-[[Imperialist]] faction,
which represented the [[military]] interests of Japan, was 
led by Tojo. He displayed a completely different perspective
over the issue. He reasoned that the successes in recent 
campaigns in [[Southeast Asia]] were extremely rapid, and 
continuation of the conquests could lead to gaining most
of Asia and Australia before the United States and the
Allies could react to further develop the so-called 
[[Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere]].

General Tojo rejected any form of peace processes in 
the conquered lands and gave authorization for more conquests.
This angered and frustrated the Toho Kai until Seigo finally
committed suicide on [[October 27]] [[1943]]. When Japan rejected 
such peace agreements, the imperial empire lost the opportunity 
to mantain their new territories in [[Southeast Asia]] in the long 
term Japan was unable to reinforce the defensive infantries, 
which allowed the [[United States]] to launch counter-offensives 
by 1943.

Elated by these early successes Admiral Yamamoto, the Chief of the Combined Fleet, convinced his superiors to expand further including the objectives of Midway, the Aleutians, and the Solomons, expanding the thin line of sea communications dangerously thinner. Individual Japanese  commanders of the new Rising Sun Empire of Asia would go off on wild hunts to enhance their name after easy conquests unrelated to any overall strategic plan and was categorised as &quot;victory disease&quot; by the Japanese people.

===Prime Minister Tojo and the Navy plan to invade Australia===

Prime Minister Tojo believed that there were no contingency plans considered for [[Yamamoto_Isoroku|Yamamoto]]'s Invasion Plan to [[Australia]].  General Tojo was concerned that the Japanese merchant and transport fleets were extended to its limit and the [[United States|Americans]] could readily divert their [[B-17]] Flying Fortresses to [[Sydney]] to destroy the invading forces.

Emperor [[Hirohito]] decided to postpone the Invasion Plan until [[Japanese forces]] had taken [[Burma]] and joined forces with the rebel [[Indian Nationalists]].  The outcomes of the Battles of the [[Coral_Sea|Coral Sea]] and Midway ensured the Invasion Plan for [[Australia]] was never revised.

General Tojo was an ardent supporter of the [[North Strike Group]] and declared his intention to realise operations from [[Manchukuo]] and nearby areas against the Russians in the [[Soviet Far East]], [[Outer Mongolia]] and [[Siberian]] lands, as well as against the [[Kwantung Army]].  He was a fanatical [[anticommunist]] since his time leading [[Kempeitai]] forces in [[Manchukuo]].

==Postwar legacy==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Tojo-in-custody.jpg|frame|right|Tojo in custody]] --&gt;

After Japan surrendered in [[1945]] Tojo shot himself in the chest in a [[suicide]] attempt. He survived and was arrested a short time later. He recovered from his injuries at a hospital. 

He then was tried by the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] for [[war crimes]]. He was '''found guilty of the following crimes:'''
*count 1 (waging wars of aggression, and war or wars in violation of international law)
*count 27 (waging unprovoked war against [[China]]) 
*count 29 (waging aggressive war against the [[United States]])
*count 31 (waging aggressive war against the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]])
*count 32 (waging aggressive war against the [[Netherlands]] ([[Indonesia]]))
*count 33 (waging aggressive war against [[France]] ([[Indochina]])) 
*count 54 (ordering, authorizing, and permitting inhumane treatment of Prisoners of War ([[Prisoner of war|POW]]s) and others)

He was [[sentenced to death]] on [[November 12]], [[1948]] and executed by [[hanging]]. He is the only [[head of government]] to date to be executed for war crimes.

Because of the crimes committed under his authority, Tojo is often considered responsible for the murder of more than 10 million civilians in China, Korea, Philippines, Indochina, and in the other Pacific island nations, as well as the murder of tens of thousands of Allied POWs and for the approval of government-sanctioned biological [[human experimentation|experiments]] on POWs and Chinese civilians. There is some controversy over the extent of his responsibility, as he often claimed to be working on the orders of Emperor Hirohito, who was granted immunity from war crimes prosecution. As a result, some believe that Tojo and many other convicted war criminals ultimately became martyrs for the Emperor.

Tojo's commemorating tomb is located in a shrine in [[Hazu, Aichi]]. He was survived by a number of his descendants, including his granddaughter, [[Yuko Tojo]], a right-wing activist, and his second son, [[Teruo Tojo]], who designed fighter and passenger aircraft during and after the war and eventually served as an executive at [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.|Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]].

A '''hormone''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''horman'' - &quot;to set in motion&quot;) is a [[chemical compound|chemical]] messenger from one [[cell (biology)|cell]] (or group of cells) to another.  All [[multicellular organism]]s produce hormones (including [[Plant hormone|plants]] - ''see article [[phytohormone]]''). 

The best-known animal (and human) hormones are those produced by [[endocrine gland]]s of [[vertebrate]] animals, but hormones are produced by nearly every [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] system and [[Biological_tissue|tissue]] type in a human or animal body. Hormone [[molecule]]s are secreted (released) directly into the [[bloodstream]]; however, some hormones, called ectohormones, are secreted to the outside environment. They move by circulation or [[diffusion]] to their target cells, which may be nearby cells (paracrine action) in the same tissue or cells of a distant organ of the body.  The function of hormones is to serve as a signal to the target cells; the action of hormones is determined by the pattern of secretion and the [[signal transduction]] of the receiving tissue.

Hormone actions vary widely, but can include stimulation or inhibition of growth, induction or suppression of [[apoptosis]] (programmed cell death), activation or inhibition of the [[immune system]], regulating [[metabolism]] and preparation for a new activity (e.g., fighting, fleeing, mating) or phase of life (e.g., puberty, caring for offspring, menopause). In many cases, one hormone may regulate the production and release of other hormones.  Many of the responses to hormone signals can be described as serving to [[homeostasis|regulate]] metabolic activity of an organ or tissue. Hormones also control the [[reproductive cycle]] of virtually all multicellular organisms.

==History==
The concept of internal secretion developed in the [[19th century]]; [[Claude Bernard]] described it in [[1855]], but did not specifically address the possibility of secretions of one organ acting as messengers to others. Still, various endocrine conditions were recognised and even treated adequately (e.g., [[hypothyroidism]] with extract of thyroid glands).

The major breakthrough was the identification of [[secretin]], the hormone secreted by the [[duodenum]] that stimulates [[pancreas|pancreatic]] secretions, by [[Ernest Starling]] and [[William Bayliss]] in [[1902]]. Previously, the process had been considered (e.g., by [[Ivan Pavlov]]) to be regulated by the nervous system. Starling and Bayliss demonstrated that injecting duodenal extract into dogs rapidly increased pancreatic secretions, raising the possibility of a chemical messenger.

Starling is also credited with introducing the term ''hormone'', having coined it in a [[1905]] lecture. Later reports indicate it was suggested to him by the Cambridge physiologist [[William B. Hardy]] (Henderson 2005).

The remainder of the [[20th century]] saw all the major hormones discovered, as well as the cloning of the relevant [[gene]]s and the identification of the many interlocking feedback mechanisms that characterise the endocrine system.

==Physiology of hormones==
Most cells are capable of producing one or more, sometimes many, molecules which signal other cells to alter their growth, function, or metabolism. The classical [[endocrine gland]]s and their hormone products are specialized to serve regulation on the overall organism level, but can often be used in other ways or only on the tissue level.

The rate of production of a hormone is often regulated by a [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] control system, generally by [[negative feedback]]. Homeostatic regulation of hormones depends, apart from production, on the [[metabolism]] and [[excretion]] of hormones.

Hormone secretion can be stimulated and inhibited by:
*Other hormones (''stimulating''- or ''releasing''-hormones)
*Plasma concentrations of ions or nutrients, as well as binding [[globulin]]s
*[[Neuron]]s and mental activity
*Environmental changes, e.g., of light or temperature

One special group of hormones is [[trophic hormone]]s that stimulate the hormone production of other [[endocrine system|endocrine glands]].  For example: [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH) causes growth and increased activity of another endocrine gland - the [[thyroid]] - hence increasing output of thyroid hormones.

A recently-identified class of hormones is that of the &quot;Hunger Hormones&quot; - [[ghrelin]], [[orexin]] and [[PYY 3-36]] - and &quot;Satiety hormones&quot; - e.g., [[leptin]], obestatin.

==Types of hormones==
Vertebrate hormones fall into four chemical classes:
#[[Amine-derived hormone]]s are derivatives of the [[amino acid]]s [[tyrosine]] and [[tryptophan]]. Examples are [[catecholamine]]s and [[thyroxine]].
#[[Peptide hormone]]s consist of chains of amino acids. Examples of small peptide hormones are [[thyrotropin-releasing hormone|TRH]] and [[vasopressin]]. Peptides composed of scores or hundreds of amino acids are referred to as [[protein]]s. Examples of protein hormones include [[insulin]] and growth hormone.
#[[Steroid hormone]]s are derived from [[cholesterol]]. The [[adrenal cortex]] and the [[gonad]]s are primary sources. Examples of steroid hormones are [[testosterone]] and [[cortisol]]. [[Sterol hormone]]s such as [[calcitriol]] are a [[homologous]] system.
#[[Lipid]] and [[phospholipid]] hormones are derived from lipids such as [[linoleic acid]] and phospholipids such as [[arachidonic acid]]. The main class is the [[eicosanoid]]s, which includes the widely-studied [[prostaglandin]]s.

==Pharmacology==
Many hormones are used as [[medication]]. The most commonly-prescribed hormones are [[estrogen]]s and [[progestagen]]s (in the [[contraceptive pill]] and as [[Hormone-replacement therapy|HRT]]), [[thyroxine]] (as [[levothyroxine]], for [[hypothyroidism]]) and [[steroid]]s (for [[autoimmune disease]]s and several [[pulmonology|respiratory disorders]]). [[Insulin]] is used by many [[diabetes mellitus|diabetics]]. Local preparations for use in [[otolaryngology]] often contain [[pharmacology|pharmacologic]] equivalents of [[adrenaline]], while [[steroid]] and [[vitamin D]] creams are used extensively in [[dermatology|dermatological]] practice.

A &quot;pharmacologic dose&quot; of a hormone is a medical usage referring to an amount of a hormone far greater than naturally occurs in a healthy body. The effects of pharmacologic doses of hormones may be different from responses to naturally-occurring amounts and may be therapeutically useful. An example is the ability of pharmacologic doses of [[glucocorticoid]] to suppress inflammation.

==Important human hormones==
Spelling is not uniform for many hormones. Current North American and international usage is estrogen, gonadotropin, while British usage retains the Greek [[diphthong]] in oestrogen and the unvoiced aspirant h in gonadotrophin.

===Amine hormones===
[[Amine-derived hormone]]s:
*[[catecholamine]]s
**[[adrenaline]] (or epinephrine)
**[[dopamine]] 
**[[nor his death when a more objective strategic assessment of the benefits of the Antonine Wall could be made. The Romans did not entirely withdraw from Scotland at this time however, as the large fort at Newstead was maintained along with seven smaller outposts until at least c. [[180]].

During the twenty year period following the reversion of the frontier to Hadrian's Wall, Rome was concerned with continental issues primarily problems in the [[Danube]] provinces. Increasing numbers of [[hoard]]s of buried coins in Britain at this time indicate that peace was not entirely achieved. Sufficient Roman silver appears in Scotland to suggest more than ordinary trade and it is likely that the Romans were boosting [[treaty]] agreements with cash payments, a situation with comparators elsewhere in the empire at the time. 

In [[175]] a large force of [[Sarmatian]] cavalry, consisting of 5,500 men arrived in Britannia, probably to re-inforce troops fighting unrecorded uprisings. Certainly, in 180 Hadrian's Wall was breached and barbarians had killed the commanding officer or governor there in what [[Dio Cassius]] described as the most serious war of the reign of [[Commodus]]. [[Ulpius Marcellus]] was sent as replacement governor and by [[184]] he had won a new peace only to be faced with a mutiny from his own troops. Unhappy with Marcellus' strictness, they tried to elect a legate named [[Caerellius Priscus|Priscus]] as usurper emperor, he refused but Marcellus himself was lucky to leave the province alive. The Roman army in Britannia continued its insubordination, they sent a delegation of 1,500 to [[Rome]] to demand the execution of [[Tigidius Perrenis]], a [[Praetorian Prefect]] whom they felt had earlier wronged them by posting lowly [[equites]] to legate ranks in Britannia. Commodus met the party outside Rome and agreed to have Perrenis killed, but this only made them feel more secure in their mutiny.

The future emperor, [[Pertinax]] was sent to Britannia to restore order and was initially successful in regaining control. A riot broke out amongst the troops however, in which Pertinax was attacked and left for dead, and he asked to be recalled to Rome, briefly succeeding Commodus in [[192]].

==Trade and industry==
By the time of the Roman occupation, Britain's [[tin]] exports to the Mediterranean had been largely eclipsed by the more convenient supply from [[Hispania|Iberia]]. [[Gold]], [[iron]],  [[lead]], [[silver]], [[jet (lignite)|jet]], [[marble]] and [[pearl]]s however were all exploited by the Romans in Britain along with more everyday commodities such as hunting dogs, animal skins, timber, wool, corn and slaves. Foreign investment created a vigorous domestic market and imports were often of exotic Continental items such as fine pottery, olive oil, lavastone [[quern]]s, glassware, [[garum]] and fruit.

Mineral extraction sites such as the [[Dolaucothi Gold Mines|Dolaucothi]] gold mine, the [[Weald]]en ironworking zone and the lead and silver mines of the [[Mendip Hills]] seem to have been private enterprises leased from the government for a fee. Although mining had long been practised in Britain, the Romans introduced new technical knowledge and large-scale industrial production to revolutionise the industry. Many prospecting areas were in dangerous, upland country, and, although mineral exploitation was presumably one of the main reasons for the Roman invasion, it had to wait until these areas were subdued.

Although Roman designs were most popular, rural craftsmen still produced items derived from the [[Iron Age]] [[La Tène culture|La Tène]] artistic traditions. Local pottery rarely attained the standards of the [[Gaul]]ish industries although the [[Castor ware]] of the [[Nene Valley]] was able to withstand comparison with the imports. Most native pottery was unsophisticated however and intended only for local markets.

By the third century, Britain's economy was diverse and well-established, with commerce extending into the non-Romanised north. The design of Hadrian's Wall especially catered to the need for customs inspections of merchants' goods.

==The third century==
The death of [[Commodus]] put into motion a series of events which eventually led to civil war. Following the short reign of [[Pertinax]], several rivals for the throne emerged, including [[Septimius Severus]] and [[Clodius Albinus]]. The latter was the new governor of Britain, and had seemingly won the natives over after their earlier rebellions; he also controlled three legions, making him a potentially significant claimant to the purple. His sometime rival Severus promised him the title of ''Caesar'' in return for Albinus' support against [[Pescennius Niger]] in the east. Once Niger was neutralised however, Severus turned on his ally in Britain&amp;mdash;though it is likely that Albinus saw that he would be the next target, and was already preparing for war.

Albinus crossed to Gaul in 195 where the provinces were also sympathetic to him and set up at [[Lugdunum]]. Severus arrived in February 196 and the ensuing battle was decisive. Although Albinus came close to victory, Severus' reinforcements won the day, and the British governor found it expedient to commit suicide. Severus soon purged Albinus' sympathisers, perhaps as well confiscating large tracts of land in Britain in punishment. 

Albinus demonstrated the two major political problems posed by Roman Britain. First, in order to maintain its security it had three legions stationed there. These would provide an ambitious man with weak loyalties a powerful base for rebellion, as it had for Albinus. Second, deploying the legions elsewhere would strip the island of its garrison, with the result that Britain was defenceless to invaders.

Traditionally, the view has been that northern Britain descended into anarchy during Albinus' absence. Certainly [[Cassius Dio]] records that the new governor, [[Virius Lupus]] was obliged to buy peace from the fractious northern tribe known as the [[Maeatae]], however more recent work suggests that it is more likely that he left a reasonable force behind to protect the frontier and that the level of chaos was not as great as earlier thought. Even so, a succession of militarily distinguished governors were appointed to the province and [[Lucius Alfenus Senecio]]'s report back to Rome in 207 described barbarians &quot;rebelling, over-running the land, taking booty and creating destruction&quot;. Alfenus requested either re-inforcements or an Imperial expedition and Severus chose the latter option, despite now being 62 years old. Archaeological evidence shows that Alfenus had been rebuilding the defences of Hadrian's Wall and the forts beyond it and Severus' arrival in Britain prompted the rebellious tribes to immediately sue for peace. The emperor had not come all that way to leave without a victory however and it is likely that he wished to provide his teenage sons [[Caracalla]] and [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]] with first hand experience of controlling and administering a barbarian province.

An expedition led by Severus and probably numbering around 20,000 troops, moved north in 208 or 209, crossing the wall and passing through eastern Scotland in a route similar to that used by Agricola. Harried by guerrilla raids by the natives and slowed by an unforgiving terrain, Severus was unable to meet the Caledonians on a battlefield. The campaign pushed northwards as far as the [[River Tay]] and peace treaties were signed with the Caledonians who seem to have suffered similar losses to the Romans. By 210, Severus had returned to York with the frontier set at Hadrian's Wall and assumed the title ''Britannicus''. Almost immediately another northern tribe, the [[Maeatae]] rebelled. Caracella left with a punitive expedition but by the next year his ailing father had died and he and his brother left the province to press their claim for the throne. 

As one of his last acts, [[Septimius Severus]] tried to solve the problem of powerful and rebellious governors in Britain by dividing the existing province into [[Britannia Superior|Upper Britain]] and [[Britannia Inferior|Lower Britain]]. Although this kept the potential for rebellion in check for almost a century, it was not permanent. Historical sources provide little information on the following decades, a period often called the Long Peace. Even so the number of [[hoard]]s found in the period rises, suggesting unrest and a string of forts were built along the coast of southern Britain to control piracy, over the next hundred years they expanded in number, becoming the [[Saxon Shore Forts]].

During the middle of the third century the Roman empire was convulsed by barbarian invasions, rebellions and new imperial pretenders. Britannia apparently avoided these troubles, although increasing [[inflation]] had its economic effect. In [[259]], a so-called [[Gallic Empire]] was established when [[Postumus]] rebelled against [[Gallienus]]. Britannia was part of this until [[274]] when [[Aurelian]] reunited the empire.

In the late 270s a half-Brythonic usurper named [[Bononus]] rebelled to avoid the repercussions of letting his fleet be burnt by barbarians at [[Cologne]]. He was quickly crushed by [[Probus]], but soon afterwards an unnamed governor in Britannia also attempted an uprising. Irregular troops of [[Vandal]]s and [[Burgundians]] were sent across the Channel by Probus to put down the uprising, perhaps in [[278]].

The last of the string of rebellions to affect Britannia was that of [[Carausius]] and his successor [[Allectus]]. Carausius was a naval commander, probably in the [[English Channel]].  He was accused of keeping pirate booty for himself, and his execution was ordered by the Emperor [[Maximian]].  He then in 286 set himself up as emperor in Britain and northern Gaul, and remained in power whilst Maximian dealt with uprisings elsewhere. In 288, an invasion failed to unseat the usurper. An uneasy peace ensued, during which Carausius issued coins proclaiming his legitimacy and inviting official recognition.

In [[293]] [[Constantius Chlorus]] launched a second offensive, besieging the rebel's port at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] and cutting it off from naval assistance. After the town fell, Constantius tackled Carausius' [[Franks|Frankish]] allies. Subsequently the usurper was murdered by his treasurer, [[Allectus]]. Allectus' brief reign was brought to an end when [[Asclepiodotus]] landed near [[Southampton]] and defeated him in a land battle.

Constantius himself arrived in London to receive the victory and chose to divide the province further, into four provinces: 
*[[Maxima Caesariensis]] (based on London): from Upper Britannia 
*[[Britannia Prima]]: from Upper Britannia 
*[[Flavia Caesariensis]]: from Lower Britannia
*[[Britannia Secunda]]: from Lower Britannia

These four provinces were part of [[Diocletian]]'s [[Tetrarchy]] reform in 293, Britannia became one of the four dioceses&amp;mdash;governed by a ''vicarius''&amp;mdash;of the prætorian prefecture [[Galliae]] ('the [[Gaul]]s', also comprising the provices of [[Gaul]], [[Germania]] and [[Hispania]]), after the abolition of the imperial tetrarchs under the Western Emperor (in Rome itself, later [[Ravenna]]).

==Government of Britannia==
Under the Roman Empire, administration of peaceful provinces was ultimately the remit of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] but those like Britain that required permanent garrisons of troops were placed under the Emperor's control. On the ground however imperial provinces were run by resident [[Roman governor|governors]] who were former senators who had held the [[Roman consul|consul]]ship. These men were carefully selected often having strong records of military success and administrative ability. In Britain, a governor's role was primarily military but numerous other tasks were also his responsibility such as maintaining diplomatic relations with local client kings, building roads, ensuring the public courier system functioned, supervising the [[civitates]] and acting as a judge in important legal cases. When not campaigning he would travel the province hearing complaints and recruiting new troops.

To assist him in legal matters he had an adviser, the ''legatus iuridicus'', and those in Britain appear to have been distinguished lawyers perhaps because of the challenge of incorporating tribes into the imperial system and devising a workable method of taxing them. Financial administration was dealt with by a ''procurator'' with junior posts for each tax-raising power. Each legion in Britain had a commander who answered to the governor and in time of war probably directly ruled troublesome districts. Each of these commands carried a tour of duty of two to three years in different provinces.  Below these posts was a network of administrative managers covering intelligence gathering, sending reports to Rome, organising military supplies and dealing with prisoners. A staff of seconded soldiers provided clerical services.

Colchester was probably the earliest capital of Roman Britain but it was soon eclipsed by London with its strong mercantile connections.

==The fourth century==
Constantius Chlorus returned to Britain in 306, aiming to invade northern Britain. The province's defences had been rebuilt in the preceding years and, although his health was poor, Constantius wished to penetrate far into enemy territory and win a further victory. Little is known of his campaigns and there is little archaeological evidence for them. From fragmentary historical sources it seems he reached the far north of Britain and won a great battle in early summer of that year before returning south to York.

Constantius remained in Britain for the rest of the time he was part of the [[Tetrarchy]], dying on [[July 25|25th July]] [[306]]. His son, [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] had managed to be by his side at that moment, and assumed his duties in Britain. Unlike the earlier usurper Albinus, he was able to successfully use his base in Britain as a starting point on his march to the imperial throne.

For a few years, the British provinces were loyal to the usurper [[Magnentius]], who succeeded [[Constans]] following his death. Following his defeat and death in the [[Battle of Mons Seleucus]] in 353, [[Constantius II]] dispatched his chief imperial notary [[Paul &quot;Catena&quot;]] to Britain to hunt down Magnentius' supporters. Paul's investigations deteriorated into a [[witch hunt]], which forced the ''vicarius'' [[Flavius Martinus]] to intervene. When Paul instead suspected Martinus of treason, the ''vicarius'' found himself forced to physically attack Paul with a sword with the aim of [[assassin]]ating him, but at the end committed [[suicide]].

In the 4th century, Britain also saw increasing attacks from the [[Saxon people|Saxons]] in the east, and the [[Ireland|Irish]] in the west. A series of forts was built, starting around 280, to defend the coasts, but these preparations were not enough when a general assault of Saxons, [[Ireland|Irish]] and [[Attacotti]], combined with apparent dissension in the garrison on Hadrian's Wall, left Roman Britain prostrate in 367. This crisis, sometimes called the [[Great Conspiracy]], was settled by [[Count Theodosius]] with a string of military and civil reforms.

Another usurper, [[Magnus Maximus]], raised the standard of revolt in [[Segontium Roman Fort|Segontium]] in 383, and crossed [[English Channel|the Channel]]. Maximus held much of the western empire, and fought a successful campaign against the [[Picts]] and [[Scoti|Scots]] around [[384]]. His continental exploits required troops from Britain, and it appears that forts at Chester and elsewhere were abandoned at this period, triggering raids and settlement in north Wales by the Irish. His rule was ended in 388, but not all of the British troops may have returned: the Empire's military resources were struggling after the catastrophic [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of Adrianople]] in 378. Around 396, there were increasing barbarian incursions in Britain, and an expedition, possibly led by [[Stilicho]], brought naval action against the raiders. It seems peace was restored by 399, although it is likely that no further garrisoning was ordered, and indeed by 401 more troops were withdrawn to assist in the war against [[Alaric I]].

==Town and country==
A number of important settlements were founded by the Romans, during their occupation of Britain. Many of which still survive.

Cities and towns which have Roman origins include: (with their Latin names in brackets)

==The end of Roman rule==
[[image:Brittain_410.jpg|thumb|250px|Roman Britain in the year 410]]
The traditional view of historians, informed by the work of [[Michael Rostovtzeff]], was of a widespread economic decline at this time.  However, consistent archaeological evidence has told another story, and the accepted view is undergoing re-evaluation.  The destruction of many sites is now believed to be much later than had formerly been thought.  Many buildings changed use, but were not destroyed. There were growing barbarian attacks, but these were focused on vulnerable rural settlements rather than towns.  Some villas such as [[Great Casterton]] in [[Rutland]] and [[Hucclecote]] in [[Gloucestershire]] had new mosaic floors laid around this time, suggesting that economic problems may have been limited and patchy, although many suffered some decay before being abandoned in the fifth century; the story of [[Saint Patrick]] indicates that villas were still occupied until at least 430. New buildings were still going up in this period in [[Verulamium]] and [[Cirencester]]. Some urban centres, for example [[Canterbury]], [[Cirencester]], [[Wroxeter]], [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]] and [[Gloucester]], remained active during the fifth and sixth centuries, surrounded by large farming estates.  

Urban life had generally grown less intense by the fourth quarter of the fourth century, and [[coin]]s minted between 378 and 388 are very rare, indicating a likely combination of economic decline, diminishing numbers of troops, and problems with the payment of soldiers and officials. Coinage circulation increased during the 390s, although it never attained the levels of earlier decades. Copper coins are very rare after 402, although minted silver and gold coins from hoards indicate they were still present in the province even if they were not being spent. By 407 there were no new Roman coins going into circulation and by 430 it is likely that coinage as a medium of exchange had been abandoned. Pottery mass production probably ended a decade or two previously; the rich continued to use metal and glass vessels, while the poor probably adopted leather or wooden ones.

==Religion==
Religion in Roman Britain consisted originally of [[Paganism|pagan]] worship. A common element was the conflation of Roman gods and local Iron Age deities such as Mars Rigonemetos at [[Nettleham]]. The degree to which earlier native beliefs survived is difficult to gauge precisely. Certain northern European ritual traits such as the significance of the number 3, the importance of the head and of water sources such as springs remain in the archaeological record but the differences in the [[votive offering]]s made at Bath before and after the Roman conquest suggest that continuity was only partial.

Worship of the emperor himself is widely recorded, especially at military sites.

Oriental cults such as [[Mithraism]] and [[Christianity]] grew in popularity towards the end of the occupation. The [[Temple of Mithras, London|Temple of Mithras]] is one example of the popularity of [[mystery religion]]s amongst the rich urban classes and by the fourth century there is archaeological evidence of Christian worship; small timber churches are suggested at Lincoln and Silchester and fonts have been found at [[Icklingham]] and the [[Saxon Shore|Saxon Shore Fort]] at [[Richborough]]. The [[Water Newton Treasure]] is a hoard of Christian silver church plate from the early fourth century and the Roman villas at [[Lullingstone]] and [[Hinton St Mary]] contained Christian wall paintings and mosaics respectively. Amongst the ordinary Romano-Britons it is difficult to determine the adoption of Christianity although a large fourth century cemetery at [[Poundbury]] with its east-west oriented burials and lack of [[grave goods]] has been interpreted as an early Christian burial ground. Such burial rites were becoming increasingly common in pagan contexts during the period as well however.

It is not clear when Christianity came to Britain, or how.  Some ancient texts seem to suggest that Christianity came early though by no means achieved anything approaching religious supremacy until after the Roman conquest due in part to the continued influx of pagan influences from the continent.  Early Roman writers, and pre-reformation scholars certainly believed that Celtic Britain may have been Christianized early. [[Tertullian]] (155-222) wrote in '''[http://www.tertullian.org/anf/anf03/anf03-19.htm#P2021_691723 Adversus Judaeos]''' that Britain had already received and accepted the Gospel in his lifetime:
:''[...] Hispaniarum omnes termini et Galliarum diversae nationes et Britannorum inaccessa Romanis loca Christo [...]''
:[...] all the limits of the Spains, and the diverse nations of the Gauls, and the haunts of the Britons, inaccessible to the Romans, but subjugated to Christ [...]
According to archaeological record, Christianity seems to have been slower to spread in Britain than in some other parts of the Roman Empire, although there were British martyrs in the periods of persecution: St [[Alban]] of [[Verulamium]] and SS [[Aaron]] and [[Julius]] of [[Isca Silurum]].  By the fifth century, however, the new religion appears to have become established.  The evidence for this process is complex, and described in [[Celtic Christianity]].  What evidence there is, is sketchy, however there is evidence to suggest that what Christian community that did exist in early Britain had already established some orthodoxy by 363, as evidenced by a letter found in Bath, Somerset from a Christian man, Vinisius, who writes from the Roman city of Wroxeter (near present-day Shrewsbury) to a Christian lady named Nigra, living in Bath. Vinisius warns Nigra of the arrival of one Bilonicus, whom he calls a ''canem Arii'', that is, a follower (dog) of the heretic Arios.  The early Church in Roman Britain seems to have also developed the customary diocesan system as evidenced from the records of the Council of Arles in Gaul, 314. These contain the earliest references to bishops in Britain. Represented at the Council were bishops from thirty-five sees from North Africa, Gaul, Britain, Spain, Italy and Dalmatia. Signatories include three bishops from Britain. These were Eborius of York, Restitutus of London, and Adelphius.

==Sub-Romana minimal sacrifice in quality.

===Bullets===
While the case is usually the most expensive component of a cartridge, the bullet is usually the most expensive part of the ''reloaded'' round, especially with handgun ammunition.  It is also the best place to save money with handgun ammunition.

For the truly frugal, the cheapest method of getting bullets is to cast them.  This requires a set of bullet molds, which are available from a number of sources, and a source of known quality lead.  [[Linotype]] and wheelweights are often used as sources of lead, and blended togethe to achieve the desired   [[Brinell hardness test|Brinell hardness]].  Cast bullets are also the cheapest bullets to buy, though generally only handgun bullets are available in this form.  Some firearms, such as those using polygonal rifling like [[GLOCK]] and {{H&amp;K]], advise against the use of cast bullets.  For shooters who would like to shoot cast bullets, aftermarket barrels are generally available for these models with conventional rifling, and the cost of the barrel can generally be recouped in ammunition savings after a few thousand rounds.

Soft lead bullets are generally used in handguns with velocities of 1000 fps (300 m/s) or lower, while harder cast bullets may be used, with careful powder selection, in rifles with velocities of 2000 fps (600 m/s) or slightly more.  The limit is the point at which the powder gas temperature and pressure starts to melt the base of the bullet, and leave a thin coating of molten and re-solidified lead in the bore of the gun--a process called '''leading''' the bore.  Cast lead bullets may also be fired in full power magnum handgun rounds like the [[.44 Magnum]] with the addition of a gas check, which is a thin [[zinc]] or [[copper]] washer or cup that is crimped over a tiny heel on the base of appropriate cast bullets.  This provides protection for the base of the bullet, and allows velocites of over 1500 fps (450 m/s) in handguns, with little or no leading of the bore.

Most shooters prefer jacketed bullets, especially in rifles and pistols.  The hard jacket material, generally copper or [[brass]], resists deformation and handles far higher pressures and temperatures than lead.  With the exception of a single company that offers a [[swage|swaging]] machine desinged to turn [[.22 Long Rifle]] cases into brass jackets for .22 caliber (5.56 mm) bullets, handloaders have no choice but to purchase pre-made jacketed bullets.  The process of manufacturing a jacketed bullet is far more complex than that for a cast bullet; first, the jacket must be punched from a metal sheet of precise thickness, filled with a premeasured lead core, and then swaged into shape with a high pressure press.  This involved process makes jacketed bullets far more expensive on average than cast bullets.  Further complicating this are the requirements for controlled expansion bullets (see [[terminal ballistics]]), which require a tight bond between the jacket and the core.  Premium expanding bullets are, with match grade bullets, at the top tier in expense.

A more ecenomical alternative was made available to the handloader in the [[1980s]], the copper plated bullet.  Copper plated bullets are lead bullets than are [[electroplate]]d with a copper jacket.  While thinner than a swaged bullet jacket, the plated jacket is far thicker than normal electroplate, and provides significant structural integrity to the bullet.  Since the jacket provides the strength, soft lead can be used, which allows bullets to be swaged or cast into shape before plating.  While not strong enough for most rifle cartridges, plated bullets work well in many handgun rounds, up to about 1500 fps (600 m/s).  Plated bullets fall between cast and and traditional jacketed bullets in price.

While originally sold to only to handloaders as an inexpensive substitute for jacketed bullets, the plated bullet has come far.  The ammunition manufacturer Speer now offers the Gold Dot line, commercially loaded premium handgun ammunition using copper plated [[hollow point bullet]]s.  The strong bond between jacket and core created by the electroplating process makes expanding bullets hold together very well, and the Gold Dot line is now in use by many police departments.

===Maximizing case life===
Since the case is the single most expensive part of a loaded round, the more times a case can be re-used, the better.  Cases that are loaded to a moderate pressure will generally last longer, as they will not be [[work hardening|work hardened]] or flow under pressure as much as cases loaded to higher pressures.  Work hardening can cause cracks to occur in the neck as the hardened brass loses its malleability, and is unable to survive swaging back into shape during the resizing operation.  Rifle brass tends to flow towards the neck (this is why rifle brass must be trimmed periodically) and this takes brass away from the rear of the case.  Eventually, this will show as a bright ring near the base of the cartridge, just in front of the thick web of brass at the base.  If brass is used after this ring appears, it risks a crack, or worse, a complete head separation, which will leave the forward portion of the brass lodged in the chamber of the gun.  This generally requires a special stuck case removal tool to extract, so it is very undesirable to have a head separation.

Work hardening happens to all cases, even low pressure handgun cases.  The sudden increase in pressure upon firing hits the brass like a hammer, changing it's crystaline structure and making it more brittle.  The neck of the case, if it becomes too brittle, will be incapable of standing the strain of resizing, expanding, crimping, and firing, and will split during loading or firing.  While a neck split during firing is not a significant danger, a split neck will render the case incapable of holding the bullet in place, so the case must be discarded.

The simplest way to decrease the effects of work hardening is to decrease the pressure in the case.  Loading to the minimum power level listed in the reloading manual, instead of the maximum, can significantly increase case life.  Slower powders generally also have lower pressure peaks.  If the manual lists pressures for each load given, then pick a powder and load that gives a low peak pessure.  

[[Anneal]]ing brass to make it softer and less brittle is fairly easy, but annealing cartridge cases is a more complex matter.  Since the base of the case should be hard, it cannot be annealed.  Since annealing brass requires heating it to about about 660 F (350 C) and then cooling it back to room temperature, the heating must be done in such a way as to prevent the base of the case from heating up and loosing its hardness.  The traditional way is to stand the cases in a shallow pan full of water, then heat the necks of the cases with a torch, but this method makes it very difficult to get an even heating of the case neck.  A better method is to mark the case with a 660 F (350 C) temperature sensitive crayon at the point to which it is to be annealed (just behind the shoulder for bottlenecked cartridges, near the bullet seating depth for straight wall cartridges).  Latch the cartridge base into a holder, such as a shell holder, that will securely hold it while you spin the case.  Place the neck of the case in a [[propane]] torch flame, and heat it until the crayon mark changes color, indicating the correct temperature--the surface of the brass will also attain a bluish shade as it oxidizes slightly due to the heat.  Once the correct temperature is reached, quickly quench the case in water to stop the annealing process and prevent the heat from reaching the base of the case.

Cases that have small cracks at the neck may not be a complete loss.  Many cartridges, both commercial and [[wildcat cartridge|wildcats]], can be made by shortening a longer cartridge.  For example, a [[.223 Remington]] can be shortened to become a [[.222 Remington]], which can further be shortened to beome a [[.221 Fireball]].  [[.30-06 Springfield]] can become [[.308 Winchester]], which can become [[.308 x 1.5]] or any number of speicalized [[benchrest shooting]] cartridges.  Since the cracking is likley due to a brittle neck, the cases should be annealed before attempting to reform them, or the crack might propagate and ruin the new case as well.

===Minimizing powder cost===
Powder is another significant cost of reloading, and one over which the handloader has significant control.  In addition to the to the obvious step of using a minimum charge, rather than a full power one, significant const savings can be obtained through careful powder choice.  Given the same bullet and cartridge, a faster burning powder will generally use a smaller charge than a slower powder.  For example, Accurate Arms lists 5 powders as suitable for a [[.44 Magnum]] firing a 240 grain lead semiwadcutter.  AA #2 is a very fast pistol powder, while AA #9 is a very slow pistol powder, and loads are listed four both of these.  The minimum loads listed are 9.0 grains of AA #2 for a velocity of 1126 fps, and 19.5 grains of #9 for 1364 fps.  The difference is 777 loads per pound for AA #2, and 358 loads per pound for AA #9.All the Accurate Arms pistol powders cost the same per pound, about US$16, so the difference is US$0.0206 vs. US$0.0447, over 2 cents per round.  Where the tradeoff comes in is in terms of power and accuracy; AA #2 is designed for small cases, and will burn inconsistenly in the large .44 Magnum case.  AA #9, however, will fill the case much better, and the slow burn rate of AA #9 is ideal for magnum hangun rounds, producing 20% higher veloocities (at maximum levels) while still producing less pressure than the fast burning AA #2.  A medium burning powder might actually be a better choice, as it would split the difference in powder weights while delivering more power and accuracy than the fastest powder.

One solution that is applicable to [[revolver]]s in particular is the possibility of using a reduced volume case.  Cartridges such as [[.357 Magnum]] and [[.44 Magnum]] are just longer versions of their parent rounds of [[.38 Special]] and [[.44 Special]], and the shorter rounds will fire in the longer chambers with no problems.  The reduced case capacity allows greater accuracy with even lighter loads.  A .44 Special loaded with a minimum load of AA #2 uses only 4.2 grains of powder, and produces a modest 771 fps.

The '''Houston Texans''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]]. They currently belong to the [[AFC South|Southern Division]] of the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The Texans joined the NFL as a 2002 [[expansion team]]. The city's previous franchise, the '''Houston Oilers''', moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] in 1997 and changed their name to the [[Tennessee Titans]]. &lt;!--Note: detailed history should be put into the Franchise history section below, not in this lead section--&gt;

==Franchise history==
===The NFL seeks a 32nd team===
After the 1995 [[Cleveland Browns]] relocation controversy, and the establishment of both the [[Baltimore Ravens]] and a newly reactivated Browns club, the NFL sought another expansion team to give the league an even number of 32 clubs.

The NFL's newest team was originally destined for [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], as the league desired a franchise in the United States's second-largest [[media market]] (having lost both the [[Saint Louis Rams|Rams]] and the [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]] to relocation).  Thus, initially the NFL was dealing exclusively with Los Angeles-based groups.  For reasons unknown and unexplained (one possibility was overconfidence, seeing that the NFL was dealing with Los Angeles exclusively), Los Angeles seemed to be indifferent with the prospect of being awarded an NFL franchise.  No real progress seemed to be made toward securing a suitable stadium (both the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] and the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] are aging facilities).

Seeing this, Houston (which itself lost the [[Tennessee Titans|Oilers]] to relocation) took a highly aggressive approach toward gaining the franchise for itself, marketing its size (Houston is the fourth-largest city and tenth-largest media market in the United States) and the fact that it too had lost a franchise to relocation.  Having learned from the loss of the Oilers that an aging stadium (the [[Astrodome]]) would not sway the NFL, Houston put together a package which included a new [[Reliant Stadium|stadium]].  Houston's aggressiveness (and LA's slothfulness) paid off, and thus the Houston Texans were born.

===On the field: 2002-2004===
The Texans made NFL history by becoming the first expansion team to win consecutive season openers: first in 2002, defeating its established NFC in-state rival [[Dallas Cowboys]] in its first regular season game by a score of 19-10; then in 2003, beating the [[Miami Dolphins]] 21-20. In 2004, the Texans were the host team for [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]]. 

Until 2005, the team had steadily improved with each successive season with a record of 4-12 in its first season, 5-11 in 2003, and 7-9 in 2004. In 2004, they cleared some major hurdles and won two consecutives games twice in that season after failing to do so in either 2002 or 2003. The team could have won three in a row to end the season, but they were stymied by the [[Cleveland Browns]]. During one notable series in 2004, the Texans won several competitions against the [[Tennessee Titans]] (the previous Houston franchise) and the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]]. As of 2005, they have not yet won a game against the [[Indianapolis Colts]] (a [[bellwether]] of the [[AFC South]] division). Texans fans were pleased with the progress made up to this point, even though they booed the team for its dreadful performance in the aforementioned Browns game that ended the 2004 season.

===2005 Fallout===
In 2005, there were expectations for a .500 season or even a playoff berth. However, the team got off to a slow start and with the offense not playing well, offensive coordinator [[Chris Palmer (football coach)|Chris Palmer]] was fired and replaced by [[Joe Pendry]]. This marked the first major shakeup of the Texans' coaching staff in franchise history. In the [[2005 NFL Draft]] the Texans drafted seven players but only one [[offensive lineman]], long considered the team's weakest area. In December 2005, the (at the time) 1-12 Texans hired former Broncos, Giants, and Falcons coach [[Dan Reeves]] as a &quot;consultant&quot;. With their loss to the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in the last game of the season, called by many the ''[[Reggie Bush|Bush]] Bowl'', the ''Toilet Bowl'' or the ''Stupor Bowl'', the Texans ended their season with a 2-14 record, the worst record in the NFL in the 2005 season (a record some have laid blame on the Texans' front office or a certain [[Curse of Judge Hofheinz|curse]]), and earned the right to the first selection in the [[2006 NFL Draft]]. As of January 2006, many sports commentators expect that Reggie Bush, the [[Heisman Trophy]] winning running back from the University of Southern California, will be the top pick in the draft (though rumors persist that [[Vince Young]], a Houston native, may be chosen).

On January 2, 2006, head coach [[Dom Capers]] was fired by owner Bob McNair. General Manager Charley Casserly, rumored to also be a target for firing, will remain with the team. Dan Reeves will continue in his consultant role as the team searches for a new coach and prepares for the 2006 NFL draft. On January 22, 2006, Bob McNair announced that [[Denver Broncos]] offensive coordinator [[Gary Kubiak]] would become the Texans' second head coach.

As of the [[2005 NFL season]], Houston is the only NFL team with 3 distinctions: they have yet to post a winning season, they have yet to play in a regular-season [[Monday Night Football]] game, and have yet to make their first playoff appearance. The Texans are also one of three franchises, along with [[New Orleans Saints|New Orleans]] and [[Jacksonville Jaguars|Jacksonville]],  to have never played in a [[Super Bowl]] or [[List of NFL champions|NFL championship game]].

==[[Lyric]]s==

Come, cheer up, my lads, 'tis to glory we steer,
&lt;br&gt;To add something more to this wonderful year;
&lt;br&gt;To honour we call you, as freemen not slaves,
&lt;br&gt;For who are as free as the sons of the waves?

CHORUS
&lt;br&gt;   Hearts of oak are our ships, Jolly tars are our men,
&lt;br&gt;   we always are ready; Steady, boys, steady!
&lt;br&gt;   We'll fight and we'll conquer again and again.

&lt;br&gt;We ne'er see our foes but we wish them to stay,
&lt;br&gt;They never see us but they wish us away;
&lt;br&gt;If they run, why we follow, and run them ashore,
&lt;br&gt;And if they won't fight us, we cannot do more.

CHORUS...

&lt;br&gt;They swear they'll invade us, these terrible foes,
&lt;br&gt;They frighten our women, our children and beaus,
&lt;br&gt;But should their flat bottoms in darkness get o'er,
&lt;br&gt;Still Britons they'll find to receive them on shore.

CHORUS...

&lt;br&gt;We'll still make them fear and we'll still make them flee,
&lt;br&gt;And drub them ashore as we've drubbed them at sea,&quot;
&lt;br&gt;Then cheer up, my lads, with our hearts let us sing,
&lt;br&gt;Our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen, our Queen.

CHORUS...

{{otheruses2|HMS Beagle}}
'''HMS ''Beagle''''' was a [[Cherokee class brig-sloop|''Cherokee'' class]] 10-gun [[brig]] of the [[Royal Navy]], named after the [[beagle]], a breed of dog. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on [[11 May]] [[1820]] from the [[Woolwich Dockyard]] on the [[River Thames]], at a cost of £7,803. In July of that year she took part in a naval review celebrating the coronation of King [[George IV of the United Kingdom]] in which she was the first ship to sail under the new [[London Bridge]]. After that there was no immediate need for ''Beagle'' so she was kept in reserve for five years and &quot;lay in ordinary&quot;, moored afloat but unmanned. She was then adapted as a survey [[barque]] and took part in three expeditions. On the second survey voyage the young naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] was on board, and his work would eventually make the ''Beagle'' one of the most famous ships in history.

On [[27 September]] [[1825]] ''Beagle'' docked at Woolwich for repairs and fitted out for her new duties at a total cost of £5,913. Her guns were reduced from ten cannons to six and a mizzenmast was added to improve her manoeuvrability, thereby changing her from a [[brig]] to a [[barque|bark]] (or barque).

''Beagle'' set sail on [[22 May]] [[1826]] for her first voyage, under the command of Captain Pringle Stokes. The mission was to accompany the larger ship [[HMS Adventure (1809)|HMS ''Adventure'']] (380 tons) on a [[hydrographic]] survey of [[Patagonia]] and [[Tierra del Fuego]], under the overall command of the Australian Captain [[Philip Parker King]]. 

Faced with the more difficult part of the survey in the desolate waters of [[Tierra del Fuego]], Captain Pringle Stokes fell into a deep depression. At [[Puerto Hambre|Port Famine]] on the [[Strait of Magellan]] he locked himself in his cabin for 14 days, then (in August [[1828]]) shot himself and died in delirium 11 days later. Captain Parker King then replaced Stokes with the Executive Officer of the ''Beagle'', Lieutenant W.G. Skyring. They sailed to [[Rio de Janeiro]] where on [[15 December]] [[1828]] Rear Admiral Sir [[Robert Otway]], commander in chief of the South American station aboard [[HMS Ganges (1821)|HMS ''Ganges'']], named as (temporary) Captain of the ''Beagle'' his aide, Flag Lieutenant [[Robert FitzRoy]].

The 23 year old aristocrat FitzRoy proved an able commander and meticulous surveyor. In one incident a group of Fuegians stole a ships boat, and FitzRoy took their families on board as hostages. Eventually he held two men, a girl and a boy who was given the name of [[Jemmy Button]], and these four native Fuegians were taken back with them when the ''Beagle'' returned to [[Plymouth]], England on [[14 October]] [[1830]].

==Second voyage==
''For more detail see [[The Voyage of the Beagle]].''

It was originally intended that [[HMS Chanticleer|''Chanticleer'']] would make the second South American Survey, but due to her poor condition ''Beagle'' was substituted for the voyage. FitzRoy had been considering how to return the Fuegians who had trained as missionaries, and on [[25 June]] [[1831]] he was re-appointed as commander. The ''Beagle'' was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on [[4 July]] [[1831]] under the command of Captain Robert FitzRoy. 

She was immediately taken into dock for extensive rebuilding and refitting. As she required a new deck, FitzRoy had the upper-deck raised considerably, by 8 inches (200 mm) aft and 12 inches (300 mm) forward. The Cherokee class ships had the reputation of being &quot;coffin brigs&quot;, which handled badly and were prone to sinking. By helping the decks to drain more quickly with less water collecting in the [[Gunwale|gunnel]]s, the raised deck gave the Beagle better handling and made her less liable to become top-heavy and capsize. Additional sheathing added to the hull added about 7 tons to her displacement. FitzRoy spared no expense in her fitting out, which included 22 chronometers and 5 of a kind of barometer he had invented.

Particularly in the light of the fate of Stokes and the suicide of his own uncle, FitzRoy was concerned about the lonely position of a captain at that time. His attempts to get a friend to accompany him fell through, and he asked his friend and superior, Captain [[Francis Beaufort]], to seek a gentleman passenger who would act as a companion as well as having opportunities as a [[Natural history|naturalist]]. This led to [[Charles Darwin]] joining the voyage. 

''Beagle'' was originally scheduled to leave on [[October 24]], [[1831]] but because of delays in her preparations the departure was delayed until December. She attempted to depart on [[10 December]] but ran into bad weather. Finally, on [[December 27]] at 2:00 pm, the ''Beagle'' left Plymouth harbour on what was to become a groundbreaking scientific expedition. After completing extensive surveys in [[South America]] she returned via [[New Zealand]] to [[Falmouth, Cornwall]], [[England]] on [[2 October]] [[1836]].

Six months later, ''Beagle'' set off in [[1837]] to survey large parts of the coast of [[Australia]] under the command of Commander [[John Clements Wickham]], with assistant surveyor Lieutenant [[John Lort Stokes]] who had been a Midshipman on the first voyage of the ''Beagle'', then mate and assistant surveyor on the second voyage (no relation to Pringle Stokes). They started with the western coast between the [[Swan River, Western Australia|Swan River]] (modern [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Australia]]) and the [[Fitzroy River, Western Australia]], then surveyed both shores of the [[Bass Strait]] at the southeast corner of the continent. In May [[1839]] they sailed north to survey the shores of the [[Timor Sea|Arafura Sea]] opposite [[Timor]]. Wickham named the [[Beagle Gulf]] and Port Darwin, which was first sighted by Stokes and which later gave its name to the city of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Australia]]. When Wickham fell ill and resigned, the command was taken over in March [[1841]] by Lieutenant John Lort Stokes who continued the survey. The third voyage was completed in [[1843]].

==Final years==
In [[1845]] the ''Beagle'' was refitted as a static [[coastguard]] watch vessel and transferred to [[Customs and Excise]] to control smuggling on the [[Essex]] coast to the north bank of the [[Thames estuary]]. She was moored mid-river on the [[River Roach]] which forms part of a maze of waterways in the marshes south of [[Burnham-on-Crouch]]. In [[1851]] [[oyster]] companies and traders petitioned for her to be removed as she was obstructing the river, and the [[1851]] [[Navy List]] dated [[25 May]] showed her renamed as ''Southend &quot;W.V. No. 7&quot; at Paglesham''. In [[1870]], she was sold to local scrap merchants &quot;Murray and Trainer&quot; for breaking up.

Investigations started in [[2000]] by a team led by Dr Robert Prescott of the [[University of St Andrews]] found documents confirming that ''&quot;W.V. 7&quot;'' was the ''Beagle'', and noted a vessel matching her size shown midstream on the [[1847]] hydrographic survey chart. A later chart showed a nearby indentation to the north bank which could have been a dock for the ''Beagle''. Site investigations found an area of [[marsh]]y ground some 15 ft (5 m) deep matching this chart position, with many fragments of [[pottery]] of the correct period. 

An [[atomic dielectric resonance]] survey carried out in November [[2003]] found traces of timbers forming the size and shape of the lower hull, indicating a substantial amount of timbers from below the waterline still in place. An old [[anchor]] of [[1841]] pattern was excavated. It was also found that the [[1871]] [[census]] recorded a new [[farmhouse]] in the name of William Murray and Thomas Rainer, leading to speculation that the merchant's name was a misprint for T. Rainer. The farmhouse was demolished in the [[1940s]], but a nearby boathouse incorporated timbers matching [[knee timber]]s used in the ''Beagle''. Further investigations are proposed.

Their investigations featured in a [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] [[Television]] programme which showed how each watch ship would have accommodated 7 coastguard officers, drawn from other areas to minimise collusion with the locals. Each officer had about 3 rooms to house their family, forming a small community. They would use small boats to intercept smugglers, and the investigators found a [[causeway]] giving access at low tide across the soft mud of the river bank. Apparently the next coastguard station along was the ''Kangaroo'', a sister ship of the ''Beagle''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''[[St Albans]]''' is in southern [[Hertfordshire]], England, around 22 miles (35.5km) north of London, beside the site of a [[Catuvellauni]] settlement and the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] town of [[Verulamium]].
==The Romans leave==
The post-Roman development of St Albans was in memorial to Saint [[Alban]], the earliest known British Christian [[martyr]], executed in circa AD [[250]] (the exact date is a matter of some controversy, with scholars suggesting dates of [[209]], [[254]] and [[304]]). The town itself was known for some time by the Saxon name ''Verlamchester''.
A shrine was erected on the site of his death following Emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]]'s adoption of [[Christianity]] as the religion of the [[Roman Empire]]. In the [[5th century]] a monastic church was constructed.

==The Abbey is founded==
Another [[abbey]] was founded by King [[Offa of Mercia]] in 793. The settlement grew up around the precincts of another [[monastery]], founded in AD 900-950 by [[Abbot Ulsinus]] (also known as Wulsin). According to [[Matthew Paris]], the 13th century chronicler of St Albans Abbey, Abbot Ulsinus (Wulsin) founded three churches in [[948]], reputedly to tend to the physical and spiritual needs of the growing number of pilgrims to Alban's shrine: St Peter's, St Stephen's and St Michael's.  Each church was equidistant from the Abbey and on one of the main approaches to the town.

Also in [[948]], Abbott Ulsinus (Wulsin) founded [[St Albans School]], an education establishment still in use.

Around 500 people lived in the town in 1086 (at the time of the [[Domesday Book]]). 

The building of the Abbey Church (now the [[St Albans Cathedral|Cathedral and Abbey Church of St Alban]]) was started in 1077 by [[Paul de Caen]], the 14th Abbot and completed in 1089. It was 350 feet long with a tower and seven apses. 

The head of the abbey was confirmed as the premier abbot in England in 1154. The abbey was extended by [[John de Cella]] in the 1190s, and again between 1257 and 1320 but financial constraints limited the effectiveness of these later additions. A [[convent]] was founded nearby in 1140.

In [[August]] [[1213]] the first draft of the [[Magna Carta]] was drawn up in [[St Albans Abbey]].

In [[1290]] the funeral procession of [[Eleanor of Castile]] stopped overnight in the town and an [[Eleanor cross]] was erected at a cost of £100 in the Market Place. The cross, which stood for many years in front of the 15th century Clock Tower, was demolished in 1701.

A market was running outside the abbey from the 10th Century, it was confirmed by King John in 1202 and by a [[Royal Charter]] of Edward VI in 1553.

==Conflict==
[[Image:20040409-003-abbey-gateway.jpg|thumb|Abbey Gateway from the 1360s]]
During the 14th century the Abbey came into increasing conflict with the townsfolk of St Albans, who demanded rights of their own.  This led, among other
things, to the construction of a large wall and gate surrounding the Abbey (for instance, the Great Gatehouse, the &quot;Abbey Gateway&quot;, which is the only surviving monastic building other than the Abbey Church, dates from 1365). 

St Albans played a role in the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of [[1381]]: the peasants, led by a local man William Grindcobbe and [[Jack Straw (rebel leader)|Jack Straw]], forced their way into the Abbey and demanded a charter for the freedom of St Albans from the Abbot ('Charter of freedom of the villeins of St Alban's forcibly obtained from the Abbot and Convent', 16 June 1381 ).  However, this was short-lived. Once the 14 year old King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] had regained control of the capital and then the whole country, Grindcobbe was tried in the Moot Hall and adjudged a 'traitor' alongside [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]] ('the mad priest of Kent', one of the rebel leaders who had escaped from [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]] to [[Coventry]]). He was hung, drawn and quartered in July 1381.

Another notable building dating from around this time, the Clockhouse belfy or Clock Tower, built between 1403 and 1412, seems to have been intended both as a visible and audible statement of the town's continuing civic ambitions against the power of the Abbot.

During the [[Wars of the Roses]] two battles were fought in and around St Albans. The [[First Battle of St Albans]] on 22 May [[1455]] was a Lancastrian defeat that opened the war. The Lancastrian army occupied the town but the Yorkist forces broke in and a battle took place in the streets of the town. On 17 February [[1461]] the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] on Bernards Heath north of the town centre resulted in a Lancastrian victory. 

Following the [[Reformation]], the Abbey was dissolved in 1539 and the Abbey Church sold to the town in 1553 for £400: it became a protestant parish church for the borough and the Lady Chapel was used as a [[St Albans School|school]]. The great gateway was used as a prison until the 19th century. In May 1553, in response to a public petition, the first [[royal charter]] for the town was issued by King [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], granting it the status of [[borough]]. The charter defined the powers of the mayor and councillors, then known as burgesses, as well as specifying the Wednesday and Saturday market days which continue to this day.

During the [[English Civil War]] (1642-45) the town sided with parliament but was largely unaffected by the conflict.
==An early transport hub==
Three main roads date from the [[medieval]] period - Holywell Hill, St Peter's Street, and Fishpool Street. These remained the only major streets until around 1800 when London Road was constructed, to be followed by Hatfield Road in 1824 and Verulam Road in 1826. 

Verulam Road was created specifically to aid the movement of stage coaches, since St Albans was the first major stop on the [[stagecoach|coaching]] route north from London. The large number of [[coaching inn|coaching inns]] is, in turn, one reason why the City has so many [[public house|pubs]] today (another being that it was, and remains, a major centre for [[Christianity|Christian]] [[pilgrimage]]). 

The railway arrived in 1868, off-setting the decline in coaching since the 1840s.

Growth was always slow and steady, with no sudden burst: in 1801 there were 6,000 people living in St Albans, in 1850 11,000, in 1931 29,000, and in 1950 44,000.

==The City Charter==
In [[1877]], in response to a public petition, Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] issued the second [[royal charter]], which granted city status to the borough and Cathedral status to the former Abbey Church. Lord Grimthorpe financed a £130,000 renovation and rebuilding of the then dilapidated cathedral, which is most apparent in his generally poorly regarded [[Neo-Gothic]]-style rebuild of the west front. However, without Grimthorpe's money, it seems reasonable to assume that the Abbey Church would now almost certainly be a ruin, like many other churches of former monasteries.

The [[football (soccer)|football]] club was founded in 1880.

[[Ralph Chubb]], the poet and printer, lived on College Street in St Albans from 1892 to 1913, and attended the Abbey School (the local name for [[St Albans School]]).  His work frequently references the Abbey of St Albans, and he ascribed mystical significance to the geography and history of the town.
==Modern growth==
===Between the wars===
In the inter-war years St Albans, in common with much of the surrounding area, became a centre for emerging high-technology industries, most notably [[aerospace]]. Nearby [[Radlett]] was the base for [[Handley Page Aircraft Company|Handley Page]], while [[Hatfield]] became home to [[de Havilland]] (later [[Hawker-Siddeley]]). St Albans itself became a centre for the [[Marconi plc|Marconi]] company, specifically, [[Marconi Instruments]]. Marconi (later part of [[The General Electric Company]]) remained the city's largest employer (with two main plants) until the 1990s. A third plant - working on top secret defence work - also existed. Even Marconi staff only found out about this when it closed down. All of these industries are now gone from the area.

In 1936 St Albans was the last but one stop for the [[Jarrow Crusade]].

===Post-war growth===
The City was expanded significantly after [[World War II]], as government policy promoted the creation of [[New Towns]] and the expansion of existing towns. Substantial amounts local authority housing were built at Cottonmill (to the south), Mile House (to the south-east) and New Greens (to the north). The Marshalswick area to the north-east was also expanded, completing a pre-war programme.

In 1974 St Albans City Council, St Albans Rural District Council and Harpenden Town Council were merged to form St Albans District Council (part of a much wider local government reorganisation).

The 2001 census returns show a population of 129,000 for St Albans City and District.

==HistoryBattle of lake trasimene.gif|240px|right|thumb|[[Battle of Lake Trasimene]], -217.&lt;br&gt;From the Department of History, United States Military Academy]]
The only alternate route to central Italy laid at the mouth of the [[Arno]]. This route was practically one huge marsh, and happened to be during this particular season, more overflowed than usual; a state of which would subject his men to the same suffering as they had endured on the Alps. Hannibal knew that this route was full of difficulties, but it remained the surest and certainly the quickest route to Central Italy.  As Polybius claims ''“he [Hannibal] ascertained that the other roads leading into Etruria were long and well know to the enemy, but that one which led through the marshes was short, and would bring them upon Flaminius by surprise. This was what suited his peculiar genius, and he therefore decided to take this route.”''  For four days and three nights, Hannibal’s men marched ''“through a route which was under water”'' suffering terribly from fatigue and enforced want of sleep. He crossed the [[Apennines]] and the seemingly impassable Arno without opposition, but in the marshy lowlands of the Arno, he lost a large part of his force, including, it would seem, his remaining elephants.

Arriving in Eturua in the spring of 217 BC, Hannibal decided to lure the main Roman army under Flaminius into a pitched battle, by devastating under his very own eyes the area he had been sent to protect. As Polybius tells us, ''“he [Hannibal] calculated that, if he passed the camp and made a descent into the district beyond, Flaminius (partly for fear of popular reproach and partly of personal irritation) would be unable to endure watching passively the devastation of the country but would spontaneously follow him . . . and give him opportunities for attack.”'' {{ref|Hart}}. At the same time, he tried to sever the allegiance of Rome’s allies, by proving that she was powerless to protect them. Despite of this, Hannibal found Flaminius still passively encamped at Arretium. Unable to draw Flaminius into battle by mere devastation, Hannibal marched boldly around his opponent’s left flank and effectively cut Flaminius off from Rome (thus executing the first conscious [[turning movement]] in military history). Advancing through the uplands of [[Etruria]], Hannibal provoked Flaminius to a hasty pursuit and, catching him in a defile on the shore of [[Lake Trasimeno|Lake Trasimenus]], destroyed his army in the waters or on the adjoining slopes while killing Flaminius as well (see [[Battle of Lake Trasimene]]). He had now disposed of the only field force which could check his advance upon Rome, but, realizing that without [[siege engine]]s he could not hope to take the capital, he preferred to exploit his victory by passing into central and southern Italy and exciting a general revolt against the sovereign power. After Lake Trasimene, Hannibal stated, ''“I have not come to fight Italians, but on behalf of the Italians against Rome.”''

===Fabius ''Cunctactor''===
{{seealso|Fabian strategy|Fabius Maximus}}
Rome, reeling from her disastrous defeat at Lake Trasmimene, was put into an immense state of panic. According to Polybius ''“On the news of the defeat reaching Rome, the chiefs of the state were unable to conceal or soften down the facts, owing to the magnitude of the calamity, and were obliged to summon a meeting of the commons and announce it. When the Praetor [the head of the Roman Senate]  . . .said, ‘We have been defeated in a great battle”, it produced such consternation that to those who were present on both occasions, the disaster seemed much greater now than during the actual battle.”'' {{ref|Cotrell}} In times of such crisis, there was but one thing to do; and that was to appoint a [[Roman dictator|dictator]]. Dictatorial power permitted a single man to develop his own strategies, make appointments in the civil government, and prepare armies without the usual political wrangling; a post that gave him near total authority for a period of approximately six months.'' “Abandoning”'' says Polybius ''“the system of government by magistrates elected annually, they [the Romans] decide to deal with the present situation more radically, thinking that the state of affairs and the impending peril demand the appointment of a single general with full powers”'' {{ref|Cottrell}}. The man they appointed as sole commander, or “dictator”, was a man named Quintus [[Fabius Maximus]], intelligent and prudent general coined as the  ''&quot;Cunctator&quot;'' (akin to the [[English language|English]] [[noun]] ''cunctation''), or the ''&quot;Delayer&quot;'' in [[Latin]]

Departing from Roman military traditions, Fabius adopted the [[Fabian strategy]] of refusing open battle with his opponent while placing several Roman armies in Hannibal’s vicinity limit his movement. While seeking to avoid battle, Fabius instead, sent out small detachments against Hannibal’s foraging parties, and always maneuvered the Roman army in hilly terrain, so as to nullify Hannibal’s decisive superiority in cavalry. Residents of small northern villages were encouraged to post lookouts, so that they could gather their livestock and possessions and take refuge into fortified towns. This, Fabius knew, would wear down the invaders’ endurance and discourage Rome’s allies from going over to the enemy, without having to challenge the Carthaginians to battle. 
[[image:Hannibal.gif|thumb|200px|left|Hannibal - Silver double shekel, c. 230 BC, The British Museum]]
Having ravaged Apulia without provoking Fabius to battle, Hannibal decided to march through [[Samnium]] to [[Campania]], one of the richest and most fertile provinces of Italy, hoping that the devastation would draw Fabius into battle. Livy tells us that ''“He [Hannibal] began to provoke and try his temper, by frequently shifting his camp and laying waste the territory of the allies before his eyes; and one while he withdrew out of quick sight and halted suddenly, and concealed himself in some winding of the road, if possible, to entrap [ambush] him on his descending into the plain”'' {{ref|Contrell}}. The dictator closely followed Hannibal’s path of destruction, yet still refused to let himself be drawn into battle, and thus remained on the defensive. While Fabius refrained himself from being drawn into battle, his troops became increasingly irritated by his ''“cowardly and unenterprising spirit”'' {{ref|Hart}}. His inactive policies, while tolerable among wiser minds in the Roman Senate, were deemed unpopular, because the Romans had been long accustomed to facing their enemies in the field. Fabius’s strategy was especially frustrating to the mass of the people, who were eager to see a quick conclusion to the war. Moreover, it was widely believed, that if Hannibal continued plundering Italy unopposed, the terrified allies, believing that Rome was incapable of protecting them, might defect and pledge their allegiance to the Carthaginians. 

As the year wore on Hannibal decided that it would be unwise to winter in the already devastated lowlands of Campania but Fabius had ensured that all the passes out of Campania were blocked. Fortunately, the Carthaginian general hit upon a highly imaginative deception scheme. At night, he gathered together all the cattle, and after tying burning torches to their horns, he drove them along a ridge near the pass. To the Romans guarding the pass, this gave the impression that the Carthaginians, aided by torches, were attempting to escape through the woods, and thus left the defile to attack them. After the Romans had chased off after the cattle, Hannibal promptly occupied the passed, and his army made their way through the pass unopposed. Fabius was within striking distance but in this case his caution worked against him. Smelling a stratagem (rightly) he stayed put. For the winter, Hannibal found comfortable quarters in the Apulian plain. What Hannibal achieved in extricating his army was, as [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] puts it, ''&quot;a classic of ancient generalship, finding its way into nearly every historical narrative of the war and being used by later military manuals&quot;''. This was severe blow to Fabius’s prestige, and soon after this, his period of power ended. The rest of autumn season continued that year albeit with frequent skirmishes— and after six months of exercising dictatorial power, Fabius would be removed from his position, in accordance with the Roman law.

===Battle of Cannae===
{{Main|Battle of Cannae}}
In the campaign of [[217 BC]] Hannibal had failed to obtain a following among the Italians; in the following year he had an opportunity to turn the tide in his favor. In the Spring of 216 B.C. Hannibal took the initiative and seized the large supply depot at Cannae in the Apulian plain. Thus, by seizing Cannae, Hannibal had placed himself between the Romans and their crucial source of supply. As Polybius notes the capture of Cannae ''“caused great commotion in the Roman army; for it was not only the loss of the place and the stores in it that distressed them, but the fact that it commanded the surrounding district”''. Once the Roman Senate resumed their Consular elections in 216, they appointed [[Caius Terentius Varro]] and [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus]] as Consuls. In the meantime, the Romans, hoping to gain success through sheer strength in numbers, raised a new army of unprecedented size. ''“They decided”'', [[Polybius]] writes, ''“to bring eight legions into the field, a thing which had never been done before by the Romans, each legion consisting of about five thousand men...Most of their wars are decided by one Consul and two legions, with their quota of allies; and they rarely employ all four at one time and on one service. But on this occasion, so great was the alarm and terror of what would happen, they resolved to bring not only four but eight legions into the field''&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/polybius-cannae.html]&lt;sup&gt;. As each legion was accompanied by an equal number of allied troops, both infantry and cavalry, the total strength of the army which faced Hannibal could not have been much less than 90,000 {{ref||Cottrell}}. Some estimates have the Roman forces as large as 100,000 men, though this figure cannot be completely validated. 
[[Image:Battle cannae destruction.gif|right|thumb|330px|Destruction of the Roman army, courtesy of The Department of History, United States Military Academy.]]
The Roman and Allied legions of the Consuls [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (General)|Aemilius]] and [[Gaius Terentius Varro|Varro]], resolving to confront Hannibal, marched southward to [[Apulia]]. After a two days’ march, they found him on the left bank of the Audifus River, and encamped six miles away. Ordinarily, each of the two Consuls would command their own portion of the army, but since the two armies were combined into one, the Consuls had to alternate their command on a daily basis. The Consul Varro, who was in command on the first day, was a man of reckless and hubris nature, and was determined to defeat Hannibal. Hannibal capitalized on the eagerness of  Varro and drew him into a trap by using an envelopment tactic which eliminated the Roman numerical advantage by shrinking the surface area where combat could occur. Hannibal drew up his least reliable infantry in a semicircle in the center with the wings composed of the Gallic and Numidian horse. The Roman legions forced their way through Hannibal's weak center but the Libyan Mercenaries in the wings swung around by the movement, menaced their flanks. The onslaught of Hannibal's cavalry was irresistible, and Hasdrubal, his brother, who commanded the left, pushed in the Roman right and then swept across the rear and attacked Varro's cavalry on the Roman left. Then he attacked the legions from behind. As a result, the Roman army was hemmed in with no means of escape. Due to these brilliant tactics, Hannibal, with much inferior numbers, managed to surround and destroy all but a small remainder of this force. Depending upon the source, it is estimated that 50,000-70,000 Romans were killed or captured at Cannae. Among the dead were the Roman consul [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus]], as well two consuls for the preceding year, two [[quaestor]]s, twenty-nine out of the forty-eight [[military tribune]]s, and an additional eighty senators (at a time when the Roman Senate was comprised of no more than 300 men, this constituted 25%&amp;mdash;30% of the governing body). This makes the [[Battle of Cannae]] one of the most catastrophic defeats in the history of [[Ancient Rome]], and one of the bloodiest battles in all of human history (in terms of the number of lives lost within a single day). 

The moral effect of this victory was such that most of southern Italy joined his cause. As Polybius notes, ''“How much more serious was the defeat of Cannae, than those which preceded it can be seen by the behavior of Rome’s allies; before that fateful day, their loyalty remained unshaken, now it began to waver for the simple reason that they despaired of Roman Power.”''  {{ref|Sealy}}. During that same year, the Greek cities in Sicily were induced to revolt against Roman political control, while the Macedonian king, [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] had pledged his support to Hannibal —thus initiating the [[First Macedonian War]] against Rome. Hannibal also secured an alliance with newly appointed King [[Hieronymous]] of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]. Had Hannibal now received proper material reinforcements from his countrymen at Carthage he might have made a direct attack upon Rome; for the present he had to content himself with subduing the fortresses which still held out against him, and the only other notable event of [[216 BC]] was the defection of [[Capua]], the second largest city of Italy, which Hannibal made his new base. Yet even this defection failed to satisfy him as only a few of the Italian city-states which he had expected to gain as allies consented to join him.

===Stalemate===
The war in Italy settled into a strategic stalemate in the years following Cannae. The Romans, after suffering three consecutive defeats and losing countless other battles, had at this point, learned their lesson. They utilized the [[Attrition warfare|attritional]] strategies Fabius had taught them, and which, they finally realized, were the only feasible means of defeating Hannibal. They always kept Hannibal in view, they only fought when everything was in their favor; they sought to starve him rather than destroy him in battle; and cut down his power of doing harm as fast as circumstances warranted {{ref|Dodge}}. Despite their defeats and the defections, the Romans could still field larger armies than Hannibal, and could readily replace their loses. The consuls the Roman Senate elected always had an upwards of 80,000 men to oppose Hannibal, whose army was deteriorating in quality and barely more than half of that of the Romans’. Instead of using a single large army, Rome now began to field multiple smaller armies. These armies sought to tire Hannibal through fatiguing marches, constant skirmishes, and famine.  As a result, for the next few years, Hannibal was forced to sustain a [[scorched earth]] policy and obtain local provisions for protracted and ineffectual operations throughout Southern Italy. Since he was no longer able to draw his opponents into a [[pitched battle]], his immediate objectives were reduced to minor operations which centered mainly round the cities of [[Campania]]. 

As the war drew on, Hannibal repeatedly appealed to the Carthaginian oligarchy for reinforcements and aid. The War-faction and the Pro-Roman Peace Party were the two main political parties that controlled Carthage during this time. The latter, represented Peace and Conciliation with Rome, and the other, represented a war policy and a policy of resistance to Rome. Despite the apparent unanimity of the acceptance of war, [[Hanno the Great|Hanno]], the leader of the Peace Party, condemned Hannibal’s actions. As spokesperson for the Carthaginian noble class, he opposed the policy of foreign conquest pursued by Hannibal. As a result, Hanno undermined support in Carthage for Hannibal's military efforts in Italy. Moreover, the success of the Romans in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] (Carthage's main source of wealth in the Mediterranean) had convinced the Carthaginians that their most valuable colony was at stake. Thus, in the hopes of stemming the tide against the Romans there, reinforcements desperately needed by Hannibal in Italy, were otherwise rerouted to Iberia. Carthage also diverted her limited resources in Sardinia as well as Sicily. At the same time, Hannibal experienced great difficulty materializing his allies. Many of the allies defected to the Carthaginians, on the condition that they could not be forced to serve against their will. This not only rendered this defection less beneficial to Hannibal, but also ensured him that he could not rely on his allies as he hoped for. To make matters worst, his men grew increasingly weak beyond the point where he was no longer able to beat the Romans, who were daily growing stronger in numbers and experience.
[[Image:Second Punic War Battles.gif|180px|right|thumb|Hannibal's three-main victories in Italy: ''(1)'' The [[Battle of the Trebia]] ''(2)'' [[Battle of Lake Trasimene]] ''(3)'' [[Battle of Cannae]] respectively, The Department of History, United States Military Academy]]
As the forces detached under his lieutenants were generally unable to hold their own, and neither his home government nor his new ally [[Philip V of Macedon]] helped to make good his losses, his position in southern Italy became increasingly difficult and his chance of ultimately conquering Rome grew ever more remote. Granted, Hannibal still won a number of notable victories: Completely destroying two Roman armies in [[212 BC]], and at one point, killing two Consuls (which included the famed [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus|Marcellus]]) in a battle in [[208 BC]]. Nevertheless, without the resources his allies could contribute, or reinforcements from Carthage, Hannibal could not make further significant gains. Thus, inadequately supported by his Italian allies, abandoned by his government, and unable to match Rome’s resources, Hannibal slowly began losing ground. Hannibal continued defeating the Romans whenever he could bring them into battle, yet he was never able to complete another decisive victory that produced a lasting strategic effect. [[Leonard Cottrell]] encapsulated Hannibal's situation with an interesting [[analogy]]: ''“So the rest of the war becomes rather like a group of lesser animals [The Romans] following a wounded lion [Hannibal]. Every now and then the beast turns, and they scatter. Sometimes it conceals itself and then, leaping out, tears its tormentors to pieces. Afterwards, it moves on alone and unmolested for a while, but before very long it hears once again the stealthy pad-pad of footsteps following some way behind.”''

===End of War in Italy===
In [[212 BC]] the Romans had so alienated [[Taranto|Tarentum]] that conspirators admitted Hannibal to the city. The conspirators then blew the alarm on some Roman trumpets allowing Hannibal's troops to pick off the Romans as they stumbled out into the streets. Hannibal was able to keep control of his troops to the extent that there was no general looting. Instead Hannibal having committed himself to respect Tarentine freedom told the Tarentines to mark every house where Tarentines lived. Only those houses not so marked and thus belonging to Romans were looted.  The citadel, however, held out so denying Hannibal the use of harbor. His brother Hanno, however, was defeated at Beneventum further depleting the overall Carthaginian force. Despite resisting a siege by Roman forces at Herdonea, the tide was slowly beginning to turn in Rome's favor. Further, in the same year, he lost his hold upon Campania, where he failed to prevent the concentration of three Roman armies around Capua. 

Two Roman armies besieged Capua so persistently that Hannibal himself was forced to attack the besieging armies with his full force in [[211 BC]]. It was only a temporary relief, for two years later the Romans were again before Capua with three armies. By a sudden march through [[Samnium]] that brought him within three kilometers of Rome, Hannibal attempted to draw them away by a [[feint]] against their capitol. He was hoping that his feint on Rome would force the siege of Capua to be lifted, and draw the Roman army out into the open where Hannibal could destroy them in a [[pitched battle]]. Yet his strategy caused more alarm than real danger to the city. The siege of Capua continued, and the city fell in the same year.  Likewise, in summer of 211 BC, the Romans completed their conquest of Syracuse and destruction of a Carthaginian army in Sicily. Shortly thereafter, the Romans pacified Sicily and entered into an alliance with the [[Aetolian League]] to counter Phillip V. Philip, who attempted to exploit Rome's preoccupation in Italy to conquer [[Illyria]], now found himself under attack from several sides at once and was quickly subdued by Rome and her Greek allies. Meanwhile, Hannibal had defeated Fulvius at Herdonea in Apulia, but lost Tarentum in the following year. 

In [[210 BC]] Hannibal again proved his superiority in tactics by a severe defeat inflicted at Herdoniac (modern [[Ordona]]) in Apulia upon a [[proconsul]]ar army, and in [[208 BC]] destroyed a Roman force engaged in the siege of [[Locri|Locri Epizephyri]]. But with the loss of Tarentum in [[209 BC]] and the gradual reconquest by the Romans of Samnium and [[Lucania]], his hold on south Italy was almost lost. In [[207 BC]] he succeeded in making his way again into Apulia, where he waited to concert measures for a combined march upon Rome with his brother [[Hasdrubal]]. On hearing, however, of his brother's defeat and death at the [[Battle of the Metaurus|Metaurus]] he retired into [[Bruttium]], where he maintained himself for the ensuing years. The combination of these events marked the end to Hannibal's success in Italy. With the failure of his brother [[Mago Barca|Mago]] in [[Liguria]] ([[205 BC]]-[[203 BC]]) and of his own negotiations with Philip of Macedon, the last hope of recovering his ascendancy in Italy was lost. In 203 BC, after nearly fifteen years of fighting in Italy, and with the military fortunes of Carthage rapidly declining, Hannibal was recalled to [[Carthage]] to direct the defence of his native country against a Roman invasion under [[Scipio Africanus]].

==Conclusion of Second Punic War (203&amp;mdash;201 B.C.) ==
[[Image:scipio.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Scipio Africanus]]]]
===Return to Africa===
In [[203 BC]], when [[Scipio]] was carrying all before him in Africa and the Carthaginian peace party were arranging an [[armistice]], Hannibal was recalled from Italy by the war party at Carthage. After leaving a record of his expedition engraved in [[Punic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] upon brazen tablets in the temple of [[Juno]] at [[Crotone|Crotona]], he sailed back to Africa. His arrival immediately restored the predominance of the war party, who placed him in command of a combined force of [[Africa]]n [[levies]] and his mercenaries from Italy. In [[202 BC]] Hannibal, met Scipio in a fruitless peace conference. Despite mutual admiration, negotiations floundered due to Roman allegations of &quot;Punic Faith,&quot; referring to the breach of protocols which ended the First Punic War by the Carthaginian attack on Saguntum, as well as perceived breach in contemporary military etiquette (Hannibal's numerous ambuscades). The decisive battle at [[Battle of Zama|Zama]] soon followed.  

===The Battle of Zama===
{{Main|Battle of Zama}}
Both Scipio and Hannibal met on the field of Zama. Hannibal amassed some 50,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry, while Scipio had a total of 34,000 infantry and 8,700 cavalry at his disposal. Placing his inexperienced cavalry on the flanks, Hannibal aligned his troops in three phalangial lines behind eighty [[war elephants]]. The first line consisted of mixed infantry of [[Gaul]]s, [[Liguria]]ns, and Balerians. In his second line he placed the Carthaginian and [[Libya]]n levies while his veterans from Italy were placed in the third line. Hannibal intentionally held back his third infantry line (perhaps the first example of a true [[Military reserves|reserve]] in military history), in order to thwart Scipio's tendency to pin the Carthaginian center and envelop his opponent's lines, as he had previously done at the [[Battle of Ilipa]]. Hannibal hoped that the combination of the war elephants and the depth of the first two lines would weaken and disorganize the Roman advance, whereupon he would complete a victory with his reserves in the third line and overlap Scipio's lines. Though this formation was indeed well-concieved, it failed to materialize into a victory for the aging Hannibal, who was suffering from mental exhaustion and deteriorating health after years of campaigning in Italy. 

At the outset of the battle, the superior Roman cavalry swept their Carthaginian counterparts and pursued them off the field— depriving him of his entire body of cavalry (though it is believed that Hannibal had intended his cavalry to lure their opponents away from the battlefield, in effect eliminating the advantage the Romans enjoyed in this arm). Likewise, Hannibal’s first two lines, unable to cope against the well-trained and confident Roman soldiers, were disposed of thereafter. For years, Hannibal had won victories with his experienced army, but now he facing the best of Roman army, while he himself commanded a makeshift army, who fared poorly against the Romans. As Livy states ''“...the Romans immediately drove back the line[s] of their opponents; then pushing their elbows and the bosses of their shields, and pressing forward into the places which they had pushed them, they advanced at a considerable pace, as if there had been no one their to resist them...”'' {{ref|Dodge}}.  

[[Image:Zama.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Painting of the [[Battle of Zama]] by [[Cornelis Cort]], 1567]] Moreover, Scipio came up with an inventive method of neutralizing Hannibal's elephants. Hannibal lost all of his original elephant troops (who crossed the Alps with him) by the battle of Cannae, but they were replenished in Africa. First of all, Scipio knew that elephants could only be ordered to charge forward, but they could only continue their charge in a straight line. So rather than lining his Roman forces in the traditional manipular lines, which put the velites, princeps, and triari in succeeding lines of 500 men groups, Scipio instead put the maniples in a chequer pattern, with his elite heavy infantry in diagonals. Scipio realized that intentionally opening gaps in his troops meant that the elephants would continue between them, without harming a soul. He did this, and after the elephants passed through his troops harmlessly and were picked off on the other side (many of them were so distraught, in fact, they charged back into their own Carthaginian lines). Scipio's troops then  fell back into formation and continued marching. 

Despite these setbacks, the battle remained a closely contended engagement. When the Roman infantry confronted the Carthaginian third line, the resulting clash was fierce and bloody, with neither side achieving local superiority. In fact, during one point of the battle, it seemed that Hannibal was on the verge of victory. However, Scipio was able to rally his men, and his cavalry, after pursuing the Carthaginian cavalry, returned in time to deliver a devastating blow in Hannibal's rear. This two-pronged attack caused the Carthaginian formation to disintegrate and collapse. Unable to cope against the well-trained and confident Roman soldiers with his own indifferent troops after losing his notorious advantage, Hannibal experienced a crushing defeat that put an end to all resistance on the part of Carthage. In total, as many as 20,000 men of Hannibal’s army were mercilessly killed at Zama, and an equal number of men were taken as prisoners. The Romans on the other hand, lost as few as 500 dead and 4,000 wounded. With their foremost general defeated, the Carthaginians had no choice but to accept defeat and surrender to Rome.

==Later career==
===Peacetime Carthage (200&amp;mdash;196 B.C.) ===
Hannibal was still only in his forty-sixth year and soon showed that he could be a statesman as well as a soldier. Following the conclusion of a peace that left Carthage stripped of its formerly mighty empire Hannibal prepared to take a back seat for a time. However, the blatant corruption of the [[oligarchy]] gave Hannibal a chance of a come back and he was elected as ''[[suffet]]'', or chief [[magistrate]]. The office had become rather insignificant, but Hannibal restored its power and authority. The oligarchy, always jealous of him, had even charged him with having betrayed the interests of his country while in Italy, for neglecting to take Rome when he might have done so. So effectively did Hannibal reform abuses that the heavy tribute imposed by Rome could be paid by installments without additional and extraordinary taxation. He also reformed the [[Council of One Hundred]], stipulating that its membership be chosen by direct election rather than co-option

===Exile and death (195&amp;mdash;183 B.C.) ===
Seven years after the victory of Zama, the Romans, alarmed by Carthage's renewed prosperity, demanded Hannibal's surrender. Hannibal thereupon went into voluntary [[exile]]. First he journeyed to [[Tyre]], the mother-city of Carthage, and thence to [[Ephesus]], where he was honorably received by [[Antiochus III]] of [[Syria]], who was preparing for war with Rome. Hannibal soon saw that the king's army was no match for the Romans. He advised him to equip a fleet and land a body of troops in the south of Italy, offering to take command himself. But he could not make much impression on Antiochus, who listened more willingly to courtiers and flatterers and would not entrust Hannibal with any important charge. 

[[Cicero]] offers a story of Hannibal while at the court of [[Antiochus III]]. Hannibal attended a lecture by a certain Phormio, a [[philosopher]], that ranged through many topics. When [[Phormio]] finished the portion about the duties of a general, Hannibal was asked his opinion. ''&quot;I have seen,&quot;'' he replied, ''&quot;during my life many an old fool; but this one beats them all.&quot;'' There is another story told about Hannibal while in exile, which puts an odd spin on his supposed &quot;Punic perfidy&quot;.  [[Antiochus III]] showed off a vast and well armed formation to Hannibal and asked him if they would be enough for [[Roman Republic|Rome]], to which Hannibal replied,'' &quot;Yes, enough for the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], however greedy they may be.&quot;''

In [[190 BC]] he was placed in command of a [[Phoenicia]]n fleet but was defeated in a battle off the river [[Eurymedon River|Eurymedon]]. According to [[Strabo]] and [[Plutarch]], Hannibal also received hospitality at the [[Armenia|Armenian]] court of [[Artaxias I|Artaxias]] where he planned and supervised the building of the new royal capital [[Artaxata]]. From the court of Antiochus, who seemed prepared to surrender him to the Romans, Hannibal fled to [[Crete]], but he soon went back to [[Asia Minor]] and sought refuge with [[Prusias I of Bithynia]], who was engaged in warfare with Rome's ally, [[King Eumenes II of Pergamum|King Eumenes II]] of [[Pergamum]]. Hannibal went on to serv Prusias in this war. In one of the victories he gained over Eumenes at sea, it is said that he used one of the first examples of [[biological warfare]] - he threw cauldrons of snakes into the enemy vessels. Once more the Romans were determined to hunt him down, and they sent [[Flaminius]] to insist on his surrender. Prusias agreed to give him up, but Hannibal determined not to fall into his enemies' hands. At [[Libyssa]] on the eastern shore of the [[Sea of Marmora]], he took poison, which, it was said, he had long carried about with him in a ring. The precise year of his death is a matter of controversy. If, as [[Livy]] seems to imply, it was [[183 BC]], he died in the same year as Scipio Africanus.

==Sources==
Most of the sources we have about Hannibal are Romans, who considered him the greatest enemy they had ever faced. [[Livy]] gives us the idea that he was extremely cruel. Even [[Cicero]], when he talked of Rome and her two great enemies, spoke of the ''&quot;honorable&quot;'' [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] and the ''&quot;cruel&quot;'' Hannibal. Yet a different picture is sometimes revealed. When Hannibal's successes had brought about the death of two Roman [[consul]]s, he vainly searched for the body of [[Gaius Flaminius]] on the shores of [[Lake Trasimeno|Lake Trasimene]], held ceremonial rituals in recognition of [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (General)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]], and sent [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus|Marcellus]]' ashes back to his family in Rome. By contrast, when [[Gaius Claudius Nero|Nero]] had accomplished his march back and forth to and from the [[Metaurus River|Metaurus]] he flung the head of Hannibal's brother into Hannibal's camp. Any bias attributed to [[Polybius]], however, is more troublesome, since he was clearly sympathetic towards Hannibal. Nevertheless, Polybius spent a long period as a hostage in Italy and relied heavily on Roman sources, so there remains the possibility that he was reproducing elements of Roman [[propaganda]].

Hannibal's name is also commonplace in popular culture, an objective measure of his influence on Western European history.  Long after his death, his name continued to carry a portent of great or imminent danger within the [[Roman Republic]]. It was written that he taught the Romans, who claimed to be fierce descendants of [[Mars (god)|Mars]], the meaning of [[fear]]. For generations, Roman housekeepers would tell their children brutal tales of Hannibal when they misbehaved (the equivalent of the modern day ''&quot;[[Bogeyman]]&quot;''). In fact, Hannibal became such a figure of terror, that when ever disaster struck, the Roman Senators would exclaim  ''&quot;[[List of Latin phrases|Hannibal ad portas]]&quot;'' (''“Hannibal is at the Gates!”'') to express their fear or anxiety. This famous [[Latin]] phrase evolved into a [[List of idioms in the English language|common expression]] that is often used when a client arrives through the door or when one is faced with calamity&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.alanemrich.com/Class/Class_Practical_Latin.htm]&lt;sup&gt;. This illustrates the psychological impact Hannibal's presence in Italy had on [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman Culture]] .

Similar to [[Robert E. Lee]] and [[Erwin Rommel]] after him, Hannibal's victories against superior forces in an ultimately losing cause won him enduring fame that outlasted his [[Carthage|native country]]. His crossing of the Alps remains one of the most monumental military feats of [[ancient warfare]] &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/ha/Hannibal.html]&lt;sup&gt; and has since captured the imagination of the Western World (romanticized by several artworks and subject to Roman [[folklore]]).

===Military history===
Hannibal's legacy also extends to the field of [[military history]], as he is universally ranked as one of the greatest military strategists and tacticians of the [[Western world]], alongside [[Epaminondas]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]], [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]], [[Turenne]], [[John Churchill|The Duke of Marlborough]], [[Frederick the Great]], and [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] among others. In fact, his exploits (especially his victory at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]) continue to be studied in several military academies all over the world.
[[Image:Napoleon4.jpg|right|200px|thumb|''[[Napoleon I of France|Napoléon]] crossing the Alps,'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]]. Napoleon's famous crossing of the Alps during the [[Napoleon I of France#An interlude of peace|Second Italian Campaign]], is often associated with Hannibal, whose name is inscribed on the rock in the left foreground of the painting.]]
The author of the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]] article praises Hannibal in these words: ''&quot;As to the transcendent military genius of Hannibal there cannot be two opinions. The man who for fifteen years could hold his ground in a hostile country against several powerful armies and a succession of able generals must have been a commander and a [[tactician]] of supreme capacity. In the use of stratagems and [[ambuscade]]s he certainly surpassed all other generals of antiquity. Wonderful as his achievements were, we must marvel the more when we take into account the grudging support he received from Carthage. As his veterans melted away, he had to organize fresh levies on the spot. We never hear of a mutiny in his army, composed though it was of Africans, Spaniards and [[Gauls]]. Again, all we know of him comes for the most part from hostile sources. The Romans feared and hated him so much that they could not do him justice. Livy speaks of his great qualities, but he adds that his vices were equally great, among which he singles out his more than Punic perfidy and an inhuman cruelty. For the first there would seem to be no further justification than that he was consummately skilful in the use of ambuscades. For the latter there is, we believe, no more ground than that at certain crises he acted in the general spirit of ancient warfare. Sometimes he contrasts most favorably with his enemy. No such brutality stains his name as that perpetrated by Claudius Nero on the vanquished Hasdrubal. Polybius merely says that he was accused of cruelty by the Romans and of avarice by the Carthaginians. He had indeed bitter enemies, and his life was one continuous struggle against destiny. For steadfastness of purpose, for organizing capacity and a mastery of military science he has perhaps never had an equal.&quot;  ''

Even his Roman chroniclers acknowledged his military genius, writing that, ''“he never required other to do what he could and would not do himself”'' &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.carpenoctem.tv/military/hannibal.html]&lt;sup&gt;. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] himself regarded Hannibal as a gifted strategist, describing him as ''“the most audacious of all, probably the most stunning, so hardy, so sure, so great in all things.''” [[Alfred Graf von Schlieffen]]’s eponymously-titled &quot;[[Schlieffen Plan]]&quot; was developed from his military studies, with particularly heavy emphasis on Hannibal's victory at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]. [[George S. Patton|Patton]] believed that he was a reincarnation of General Hannibal as well as many other people including a Roman [[legionary]]. [[Norman Schwarzkopf]], the commander of the Coalition Forces in the Gulf War, claimed that ''&quot;The technology of war may change, the sophistication of weapons certainly changes. But those same principles of war that applied to the days of Hannibal apply today&quot;''.

===&quot;''Father of Strategy''&quot;===

According to the military historian, [[Theodore Ayrault Dodge]], ''“Hannibal excelled as a [[tactician]]. No battle in history is a finer sample of tactics than [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]. But he was yet greater in logistics and strategy. No captain ever matched to and fro among so many armies of troops superior to his own numbers and material as fearlessly and skillfully as he. No man ever held his own so long or so ably against such odds. Constantly overmatched by better soldiers, led by generals always respectable, often of great ability, he yet defied all their efforts to drive him from Italy, for half a generation.”''  Furthermore, Dodge christened Hannibal as the &quot;father of strategy&quot; due to his visionary conduct of warfare&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.carpenoctem.tv/military/hannibal.html]&lt;sup&gt;. He wrote: ''&quot;Excepting in the case of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], and some few isolated instances, all wars  up to the [[Second Punic War]], had been decided largely, if not entirely, by battle-tactics. Strategic ability had been comprehended only on a minor scale. Armies had marched towards each other, had fought in parallel order, and the conqueror had imposed terms on his opponent. Any variation from this rule consisted in ambuscades or other strategems. That war could be waged by avoiding in lieu of seeking battle; that the results of a victory could be earned by attacks upon the enemy’s communications, by flank-maneuvers, by seizing positions from which safely to threaten him in case he moved, and by other devices of strategy, was not understood . . .[However] For the first time in the history of war, we see two contending generals avoiding each other, occupying impregnable camps on heights, marching about each other's flanks to seize cities or supplies in their rear, harasssing each other with small-war, and rarely venturing on a battle which might prove a fatal disaster—all with a well-conceived purpose of placing his opponent at a strategic disadvantage. . .That it did so was due to the teaching of Hannibal&quot;''.

      <comment>/* Aircraft Carrier Type */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[United States Navy]] uses '''hull classification symbols''' (sometimes called '''hull codes''') to identify the types of its ships.  See also [[pennant number]], a somewhat analogous system used by the [[Royal Navy]] and some European navies.

The combination of symbol and hull number identify a modern Navy ship uniquely.    A heavily modified or repurposed ship may receive a new symbol, and either retain the hull number or receive a new one.  Also, the system of symbols has changed a number of times since it was introduced in [[1907]], so ships' symbols sometimes change without anything being done to the physical ship.

Many of these symbols listed here are not presently in use. The [[Naval Vessel Register]] maintains an online database of US Navy ships.

The [[United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification|1975 ship reclassification]] of cruisers, frigates, and ocean escorts brought US Navy classifications into line with other nations' classifications, and eliminated the perceived &quot;cruiser gap&quot; with the [[Soviet Navy]].

If a ship's hull classification symbol has &quot;T-&quot; preceding it, that symbolizes that it is a ship of the [[Military Sealift Command]], with a primarily civilian crew.

== Warships ==
Warships are designed to participate in combat operations.

=== Aircraft Carrier Type ===
All ships designed primarily for the purpose of conducting combat operations by [[aircraft]] which engage in attacks against airborne, surface, sub-surface and shore targets.  The &quot;CV&quot; designation was originally derived from cruisers, since aircraft carriers were seen as an extension of the sea control and denial mission of cruisers.  The &quot;V&quot; designation for heavier than air craft comes from the [[French language|French]] verb &quot;''Volare''&quot; (to fly).  Since 1935, &quot;CV&quot; has been a two-letter, unitary hull classification symbol, meaning &quot;aircraft carrier.&quot;  Aircraft carriers are designated in two sequences: The first, which has run from CV-1 USS ''Langley'' to the very latest ships, and the second, the CVE escort carrier sequence, ran from CVE-1 ''Long Island'' to CVE-128 ''Okinawa'' before being discontinued.

*AVG Auxiliary Aircraft Ferry (Escort carrier) (1941-2)
*ACV Auxiliary Aircraft Carrier (Escort carrier) (1942)
*CV Multi-purpose [[Aircraft Carrier]]
*CVA Attack Aircraft Carrier (category merged into CV, 1975)
*CVAN Attack Aircraft Carrier, Nuclear (all CVA and CVAN changed to CV on 30 June 1975) 
*CVB Large Aircraft Carrier (category merged into CVA, 1952)
*CVE [[Escort aircraft carrier]] (retired) (1943-retirement of type)
*CVHA Assault Helicopter Aircraft Carrier (retired in favor of various L-series [[amphibious assault ship]] hull codes)
*CVHE Escort Helicopter Aircraft Carrier (retired)
*CVL [[Light aircraft carrier]] (retired)
*CVN Multi-purpose Aircraft Carrier (Nuclear-Propulsion)
*CVS Antisubmarine Aircraft Carrier (retired)
*CVT Training Aircraft Carrier (changed to AVT (Auxiliary))
*CVU Utility Aircraft Carrier (retired)

=== Surface Combatant Type ===
Surface ships which are designed primarily to engage enemy forces on the high seas.  The primary surface combatants are battleships, cruisers and destroyers.  Battleships are very heavily armed and armored; cruisers moderately so; destroyers and smaller warships , less so.  Before 1920, ships were called &quot;&lt;type&gt; no. X,&quot; with the type fully pronounced.  The types were commonly abbreviated in ship lists to &quot;B-X,&quot; &quot;C-X,&quot; &quot;D-X&quot; et cetera - for example, before 1920, [[USS Minnesota (BB-22)]] would have been called &quot;USS ''Minnesota'', Battleship number 22&quot; verbally and &quot;USS ''Minnesota'', B-22&quot; in writing.  After 1920, the ship's name would have been both written and pronounced &quot;USS ''Minnesota'' (BB-22)&quot; In generally decreasing size, the types are:

*B [[Battleship]] (pre-1920)
*BB [[Battleship]]
*BBG Guided Missile Battleship (theoretical only, never assigned)
*BM [[Monitor (ship)|Monitor]] (1920-retirement)

*ACR Armored Cruiser (pre-1920)
*C [[Cruiser]] (pre-1920 Protected Cruisers and Peace Cruisers)
*CA (first series) Cruiser (retired, composed all surviving pre-1920 Protected and Peace Cruisers)
*CA (second series) [[Heavy Cruiser]], category later renamed Gun Cruiser (retired)
*CAG Guided Missile Heavy Cruiser (retired)
*CB [[Large Cruiser]] (retired)
*CBC Large Command Cruiser (retired, never used operationally)
*CC [[Battlecruiser]] (retired, never used operationally)
*CC (second usage) Command Cruiser (retired)
*CG Guided Missile Cruiser                        
*CGN Guided Missile Cruiser (Nuclear-Propulsion)
*CL [[Light Cruiser]] (retired)
*CLAA Antiaircraft Cruiser (retired)
*CLG Guided Missile Light Cruiser (retired)
*CLGN Guided Missile Light Cruiser (Nuclear-Propulsion) (retired)
*CLK Hunter-Killer Cruiser (abolished 1951)
*CS Scout Cruiser (retired)
*CSGN [[Strike Cruiser]]

*D Destroyer (pre-1920)
*DD [[Destroyer]]
*DDE Escort Destroyer (not to be confused with Destroyer Escort, DE - an Escort Destroyer, DDE, was a Destroyer, DD, converted for antisubmarine warfare) (category abolished 1962)
*DDG Guided Missile Destroyer
*DDK Hunter-Killer Destroyer (category merged into DDE, [[4 March]] [[1950]])
*DDR Radar Picket Destroyer (retired)
*DE [[Destroyer escort|Destroyer Escort]] (World War II, later became Ocean Escort)
*DE Ocean Escort (abolished [[30 June]] [[1975]])
*DEG Guided Missile Ocean Escort (abolished [[30 June]] [[1975]])
*DER Radar Picket Destroyer Escort (abolished [[30 June]] [[1975]])

A word about the DE type symbol is in order here.  There were two distinct breeds of DE, the World War II Destroyer Escorts (some of which were converted to DERs) and the postwar DE/DEG classes, which were known as Ocean Escorts despite carrying the same type symbol as the WWII Destroyer Escorts.  All DEs, DEGs, and DERs were reclassified as FFs, FFGs, or FFRs, [[30 June]] [[1975]].

*DL Destroyer Leader (later Frigate) (retired)
*DLG Guided Missile Frigate (abolished [[30 June]] [[1975]])
*DLGN Guided Missile Frigate (Nuclear-Propulsion) (abolished [[30 June]] [[1975]])

The DL category was established in 1951 with the abolition of the CLK category.  CLK 1 became DL 1 and DD 927-930 became DL 2-5.  By the mid-1950s the term Destroyer Leader had been dropped in favor of Frigate.  Most DLGs and DLGNs were reclassified as CGs and CGNs, [[30 June]] [[1975]].  However, DLG 6-15 became DDG 37-46.  The old DLs were already gone by that time.

*DM Destroyer Minelayer (retired)

*FF [[Frigate]] (retired)
*FFG Guided Missile Frigate
*FFR Radar Picket Frigate (retired)
*FFT Frigate (Reserve Training) (retired)

The FF, FFG, and FFR designations were established [[30 June]] [[1975]] as new type symbols for ex-DEs, DEGs, and DERs.  The first new-build ships to carry the FF/FFG designation were the [[Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate|''Oliver Hazard Perry'' (FFG-7) class frigates]].  A new series of frigate-size warships for shallow-water combat at expense of battlegroup performance is under production:

*K [[Corvette]] (retired]

*LCS [[Littoral Combat Ship]]

*M Monitor (1880s-1920)


Note that this list is from a United States Navy perspective. Frigate and Corvette designations are used in other navies.

:''For alternative meanings of ''habeas corpus'', see [[habeas corpus (disambiguation)]].

In [[common law|English common law]] '''''habeas corpus''''' is the name of several [[writ]]s which may be issued by a [[judge]] ordering a [[prison|prisoner]] to be brought before the [[court]]. More commonly, the name refers to a specific writ known in full as '''''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum''''', a [[prerogative writ]] ordering that a prisoner be brought to the court so it can be determined whether or not he is being imprisoned lawfully.

The words ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' are [[Latin]] for &quot;(That) you may have/hold the body to be subjected to (examination)&quot;, and are taken from the opening words of the writ in medieval times. Other ''habeas corpus'' writs also existed, for example ''habeas corpus ad testificandum'' (&quot;[That] you may have/hold the body to bear witness&quot;), for the production of a prisoner to give evidence in court.

==''Habeas corpus ad subjiciendum''==

Known as the &quot;''Great Writ''&quot;, the writ of ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' is a legal proceeding in which an individual held in custody can challenge the propriety of that custody under the law.  A petitioner (the individual in custody) files a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, asserting that his custody violates the law.  The writ, if granted, is addressed to the custodian (warden, jailer) of the petitioner, directing that the custodian release the petitioner. The writ applies to almost all forms of official detention, civil or criminal, and was also employed in cases of imprisonment for private debt. In many jurisdictions today the writ can also be issued against private individuals.

The right of ''habeas corpus'' -- the right to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus -- has long been celebrated as the most efficient safeguard of the liberty of the subject. [[Albert Venn Dicey|Dicey]] wrote that the Habeas Corpus Acts &quot;declare no principle and define no rights, but they are for practical purposes worth a hundred constitutional articles guaranteeing individual liberty&quot;. In most countries, however, the procedure of ''habeas corpus'' can be suspended in time of national emergency. In most [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, comparable provisions exist, but they are generally not called &quot;''habeas corpus''&quot;.

[[William Blackstone|Blackstone]] cites the first recorded usage of ''habeas corpus'' in [[1305]], in the reign of [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]]. However, other [[Writ#History|writs]] were issued with the same effect as early as the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] in the 12th century. [[Winston Churchill]], in his chapter on the [[English Common Law]] in 'The Birth of Britain', explains the process thus:

:Only the King had a right to summon a jury.  [[Henry II of England|Henry]] accordingly did not grant it to private courts .. But all this was only a first step.  Henry also had to provide means whereby the litigant, eager for royal justice, could remove his case out of the court of his lord into the court of the King.  The device which Henry used was the royal writ .. and any man who could by some fiction fit his own case to the wording of one of the royal writs might claim the King's justice.

The procedure for the issuing of writs of ''habeas corpus'' was first codified by the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679]], following judicial rulings which had restricted the effectiveness of the writ. A previous act had been passed in [[1640]] to overturn a ruling that the command of the King was a sufficient answer to a petition of ''habeas corpus''.

Then, as now, the writ of ''habeas corpus'' was issued by a superior court in the name of the Monarch, and commanded the addressee (a lower court, sheriff, or private subject) to produce the prisoner before the Royal courts of law. Petitions for ''habeas corpus'' could be made by the prisoner himself or by a third party on his behalf, and as a result of the Habeas Corpus Acts could be made regardless of whether the court was in session, by presenting the petition to a judge.

Since the [[18th century]] the writ has also been used in cases of unlawful detention by private individuals, most famously in ''[[Somersett's Case]]'' ([[1771]]), where the black slave Somersett was ordered to be freed, the famous words being quoted from an earlier case: &quot;The air of [[England]] has long been too pure for a slave, and every man is free who breathes it.&quot;

Although the form of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' implies that the prisoner is brought to the court in order for the legality of the imprisonment to be examined, modern practice is to have a hearing with both parties present on whether the writ should issue, rather than issuing the writ and waiting for the return of the writ by the addressee before the legality of the detention is examined. The prisoner can then be released or bailed by order of the court without having to be produced before it.

The right of ''habeas corpus'' has been suspended or restricted several times during English history, most recently during the [[18th century|18th]] and [[19th century|19th centuries]]. Although internment without trial has been authorised by statute since that time, for example during the two World Wars and the [[Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], the procedure of ''habeas corpus'' has in modern times always technically remained available to such internees. However, as ''habeas corpus'' is only a procedural device to examine the lawfulness of a prisoner's detention, so long as the detention was in accordance with an [[Act of Parliament]], the petition for ''habeas corpus'' would be unsuccessful. 

Since the passage of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], the courts have been able to declare an Act of Parliament to be incompatible with the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. However, such a declaration of incompatibility has no immediate legal effect until it is acted upon by the government.

===United States===

This procedure, part of English [[common law]], was considered important enough to be specifically mentioned in the [[United States Constitution]], which says, &quot;The Privilege of the Writ of ''Habeas Corpus'' shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.&quot; ([[Article One (United States Constitution)|Article One]], section nine). 

In the USA, the writ of ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' is a civil (as opposed to a criminal) proceeding in which the court inquires as to the legitimacy of a prisoner's custody. Typically, ''habeas corpus'' proceedings investigate whether a criminal trial was conducted fairly and constitutionally after the criminal appellate process has been exhausted.  ''Habeas corpus'' is also used as a legal avenue to challenge other types of custody such as pretrial detention or detention by the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement pursuant to a deportation proceeding.

The &quot;constitutional&quot; writ of ''habeas corpus'', which was originally understood to apply only to those held in custody by officials of the executive branch of the federal government, and not to those held by state governments, and then only within the jurisdiction of the court, should be distinguished from what can be called &quot;statutory&quot; ''habeas corpus''.  Congress granted all federal courts jurisdiction under Title 28, Section 2241 of the [[United States Code]] to issu[[Battle of Trafalgar]]. Napoleon Bonaparte had been massing forces once again for the invasion of the British Isles. However, he had already decided that his navy was not adequate to secure the Channel for the invasion barges and had started moving his troops away for a campaign elsewhere in Europe. On the 19th, the French and Spanish fleet left Cádiz, probably because [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]], the French commander, had heard that he was to be replaced by another admiral. Nelson, with twenty-seven ships, engaged the thirty-three opposing ships.

Nelson's last dispatch, written on the 21st, read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At daylight saw the Enemy's Combined Fleet from East to E.S.E.; bore away; made the signal for Order of Sailing, and to Prepare for Battle; the Enemy with their heads to the Southward: at seven the Enemy wearing in succession. May the Great God, whom I worship, grant to my Country, and for the benefit of Europe in general, a great and glorious Victory; and may no misconduct in any one tarnish it; and may humanity after Victory be the predominant feature in the British Fleet. For myself, individually, I commit my life to Him who made me, and may his blessing light upon my endeavours for serving my Country faithfully. To Him I resign myself and the just cause which is entrusted to me to defend. Amen. Amen.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Turner, The Battle of Trafalgar (1822).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[The Battle of Trafalgar (painting)|''The Battle of Trafalgar'']] by [[J. M. W. Turner]] (oil on canvas, 1822&amp;ndash;1824) shows the last three letters of the famous signal, &quot;[[England expects that every man will do his duty]]&quot; flying from [[HMS Victory|''Victory'']].]]

As the two fleets moved towards engagement, he then ran up a thirty-one flag signal to the rest of the fleet which spelled out the famous phrase &quot;[[England expects that every man will do his duty]]&quot;. The original signal that Nelson wished to make to the fleet was ''England confides that every man will do his duty'' (meaning 'is confident that they will'). The signal officer asked Nelson if he could substitute the word 'expects' for 'confides' as 'expects' was included in the [[Telegraphy|telegraph]]ic code devised by [[Home Riggs Popham|Sir Home Popham]] whereas 'confides' would have to be spelled letter by letter. Nelson agreed and the signal was run up ''Victory''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[mizzenmast]].
[[Image:Battle of Trafalgar Poster 1805.jpg|thumb|right|Detail from an 1805 poster commemorating the Battle of Trafalgar.]]

After crippling the French flagship [[French ship Bucentaure (1804)|''Bucentaure'']], ''Victory'' moved on to the [[French ship Redoutable (1791)|''Redoutable'']]. The two ships entangled each other, at which point snipers in the fighting tops of ''Redoutable'' were able to pour fire down onto the deck of ''Victory''. Nelson was one of those hit: a bullet entered his shoulder, pierced his lung, and came to rest at the base of his spine. Nelson retained consciousness for four hours, but died soon after the battle was concluded with a British victory.(See [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson#Last words]].)

After the battle ''Victory'' was then towed to [[Gibraltar]], with Nelson's body on board preserved in a barrel of [[brandy]] (see [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson#&quot;Tapping the Admiral&quot;]]). Upon his body's arrival in [[London]], Nelson was given a [[state funeral]] (one of only five non-royal Britons to receive the honour - others are [[Arthur Wellesley]] and [[Churchill]]) and entombment in [[St. Paul's Cathedral]]. He was laid to rest in a wooden coffin made from the mast of ''L'Orient'' which had been salvaged after the Battle of the Nile, within a [[sarcophagus]] originally carved for [[Thomas Cardinal Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]] (when Wolsey fell from favour, it was confiscated by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and was still lying around in royal collections in [[1805]]!).

[[Image:The Ball which mortally wounded the LAMENTED NELSON - Project Gutenberg eText 15233.png|thumbnail|right|150px|The bullet that killed Nelson.]]

Nelson was noted for his considerable ability to inspire and bring out the best in his men, to the point that it gained a name: &quot;The Nelson Touch&quot;. Famous even while alive, after his death he was lionized like almost no other military figure in British history (his only peers are the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] and Nelson's contemporary, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]). Most military historians believe Nelson's ability to inspire officers of the highest rank and seamen of the lowest was central to his many victories, as was his unequaled ability to both strategically plan his campaigns and tactically shift his forces in the midst of battle. He may have been the greatest field commander in history. Certainly, he stands as the greatest warrior afloat. 

It must also be said that his &quot;Nelson touch&quot; also worked with non-seamen; he was beloved in England by virtually everyone. (The only people not affected by him were those offended by his affair with Lady Hamilton!) Now as then, he is a popular hero, included in the top 10 of the ''[[100 Greatest Britons]]'' poll sponsored by the [[BBC]] and voted for by the public, and commemorated in the extensive [[Trafalgar 200]] celebrations in [[2005]], including the [[International Fleet Review]]. Even today phrases such as &quot;[[England expects]]&quot; and [[111 (number)#In other fields|&quot;nelson&quot; (meaning &quot;111&quot;)]] remain closely associated with English sporting teams.

===Monuments to Nelson===
The monumental [[Nelson's Column]] and the surrounding [[Trafalgar Square]] are notable locations in [[London]] to this day, and Nelson was buried in [[St. Paul's Cathedral]]. The first large monument to Nelson was a 43.5m tall pillar on [[Glasgow Green]] erected less than year after his death in [[1806]]. [[Nelson's Monument]] was later constructed atop [[Calton Hill, Edinburgh|Calton Hill]] in [[Edinburgh]]. The first monument funded by popular subscription, sculpted by [[Richard Westmacott]], was erected in Birmingham in [[1809]]. Westmacott also sculpted memorials in [[Liverpool]] and [[Barbados]]. A Monument in [[Great Yarmouth]] to Nelson was started before his death but only completed in [[1819]]. This is sometimes known as the Britannia monument as it is topped by that martial female rather than a statue of Nelson; a statue of Nelson can however be found in the grounds of [[Norwich Cathedral]] alongside the other Napoleonic hero, the [[Duke of Wellington]], near the school he attended.

In [[Montreal]] there is a monument to Nelson erected in [[1809]] in [[Place Jacques-Cartier]] which was a market place at the time. It has carved scenes from Nelson's career around the base and the statue on top was claimed to be the oldest public statue of Nelson in the world. It was removed for several years due to excessive weathering but has been replaced after restoration.

There is also the [[Nelson Memorial, Swarland|Nelson memorial]] in [[Swarland]], [[Northumberland]] which was raised as a private memorial of Nelson by his friend and sometime agent, Alexander Davison. [[Nelson's Pillar]], a monument to Nelson in [[Dublin]] was destroyed by an bomb planted by former [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] men in [[1966]]. The city of [[Nelson, New Zealand]] bears his name as well as [[Nelson Island (British Columbia)| Nelson Island]] on the [[Sunshine Coast, British Columbia]], Canada.

One of the most unique monuments was constructed on Salisbury Plain, within cannon shot of Stonehenge, on land then owned by the Marquess of Queensbury.  The monument consists of a series of clumps of trees in otherwise arable farmland.  Known as the &quot;Nile Clumps&quot; they have been arranged to represent the positioning of French and British ships at the [[Battle of the Nile]], considered as Nelson's greatest tactical victory.  Some clumps still survive, and work is underway to replant some of those that have &quot;sunk&quot;.  They stand on land owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], forming part of the [[Stonehenge Historic Landscape]] estate.

===Nelson and the Royal Navy===
[[Image:Nelson On His Column - Trafalgar Square - London - 240404.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Nelson's Column]] in [[Trafalgar Square]].]]
''Victory'' is still kept on active commission in honour of Nelson &amp;mdash; it is the flagship of the [[Second Sea Lord]], and is the oldest commissioned ship of the Royal Navy. She can be found in Number 2 Dry Dock of the [[Royal Navy Museum]] at the [[Portsmouth Naval Base]], in [[Portsmouth]], [[England]].

Two Royal Navy battleships have been named [[HMS Nelson|HMS ''Nelson'']] in his honour. The Royal Navy celebrates Nelson every [[21 October]] by holding Trafalgar Day dinners and toasting ''&quot;The Immortal Memory&quot;'' of Nelson.

The bullet that killed Nelson is permanently on display in the Grand Vestibule of [[Windsor Castle]]. The uniform that he wore during the battle, with the fatal bullet hole still visible, can be seen at the [[National Maritime Museum]] in Greenwich. A lock of Nelson's hair was given to the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] from the [[Royal Navy]] after the [[Russo-Japanese War]] to commemorate the victory at the [[Battle of Tsushima]]. It is still on display at ''Kyouiku Sankoukan'', a public museum maintained by the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]].

==Nelson's descendants==
Nelson had no legitimate children; his illegitimate daughter by Lady Hamilton, Horatia, subsequently married the Rev. Philip Ward and died in [[1881]]. She and Rev. Ward had nine children: Horatio Nelson Ward (born [[8 December]] [[1822]]); Eleanor Phillipa Ward (born April [[1824]]); Marmaduke Philip Smyth Ward (born [[27 May]] [[1825]]); John James Stephen Ward ([[13 February]] [[1827]]-[[1829]]); Nelson Ward (born [[8 May]] [[1828]]); William George Ward (born [[8 April]] [[1830]]); Edmund Ward ([[10 July]], [[1832]]-[[1833]]); Horatio Ward (born [[24 November]], [[1833]]), Philip Ward (born May [[1834]]); Caroline Ward (born January [[1836]]).

Because Lord Nelson had no legitimate heirs, the Viscountcy and 1798 Barony of Nelson (both &quot;of the Nile and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk&quot;) became extinct upon his death. However, the 1801 Barony of Nelson (&quot;of the Nile and of Hilborough in the County of Norfolk&quot;) passed by a special remainder to Lord Nelson's brother, [[William Nelson, 1st Earl Nelson|The Revd William Nelson]]. William was also created [[Earl Nelson]] in recognition of his brother's services, which title is still extant.

==Literary influences==
Although Nelson's exploits are often claimed to have provided inspiration for fictional characters such as [[Jack Aubrey]], [[Horatio Hornblower]] and [[Honor Harrington]], a close reading of the books does not bear this out. It is more likely Nelson's fame makes him the only Naval figure of the time that reviewers recall. Nelson appears, unnamed but recognizable, in [[Susan Sontag]]'s novel [[The Volcano Lover: A Romance]], which centers around [[Lady Emma Hamilton]]'s affair with him.
Nelson himself appears as a ghost, in Amber Benson's and Christopher Golden's [[Ghosts of Albion]].  Barry Unsworth's Losing Nelson centers on the Nelson's actions in Naples in 1799.

==Last words==
Nelson's final words (as related by Victory's Surgeon [[William Beatty]], based on the accounts of those who were with Nelson when he died) were &quot;Thank God I have done my duty&quot;. According to Beatty, he repeated these words several times until he became unable to speak.

In his dying hours, Nelson was also attended by his chaplain, Alexander Scott, his steward, Chevalier and Walter Burke, the [[purser]], whose accounts have been available for modern biographers of Nelson. In those accounts, Nelson's last words were &quot;Drink, drink. Fan, fan. Rub, rub.&quot;. This was a request to alleviate his symptoms of thirst, heat and the pains of his wounds (Pocock, Horatio Nelson, 1987, p.331).

It is a common misconception that Nelson's last words were &quot;Kiss me, Hardy&quot;, spoken to the captain of HMS ''Victory'', [[Thomas Hardy (naval officer)|Thomas Hardy]]. Nelson did, in fact, say this to Hardy a short time before his death, but they were not his last words, and Hardy was not present at his death (having been called back on deck). Some have speculated that Nelson actually said &quot;Kismet, Hardy&quot;, but this is impossible, since the word ''[[kismet]]'' did not enter the English language until much later.

==&quot;Tapping the Admiral&quot;==
According to a [[legend]], naval [[rum]] rather than brandy was used to preserve his body in a barrel until it was returned to England. It is claimed that his crew had drunk half of the rum from the barrel by the time they reached London; the crew were supposed to have sucked out the rum using thin straws. However, this legend is unlikely, due to the great respect that the crew had for Nelson, and because his body was guarded night and day by a marine. Nevertheless, this legend has given rise to the slang term &quot;tapping the Admiral&quot;, meaning illicit drinking, and may be related to the nickname given to Naval rum rations later, &quot;Nelson's Blood&quot; (although this may possibly be a deliberate echo of the [[Eucharist|Communion]] ritual).

==Titles==
Lord Nelson's full title, at the time of his death, was ''Vice Admiral of the White The Right Honourable Horatio, Viscount Nelson, [[Order of the Bath|Knight of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath]]''. In addition, he was Baron Nelson, of the Nile and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk, Baron Nelson, of the Nile and of Hillborough in the County of Norfolk, Duke of [[Bronte, Sicily|Bronte]] in the nobility of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]], Knight of the Grand Cross of the Order of St Ferdinand and of Merit and a Knight of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s Order of the Crescent, Knight Grand Commander of the Order of St Joachim, Colonel of the Marines, and Freeman of Norwich, Bath, Yarmouth, London, Salisbury and Exeter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Carta Marina.jpeg|thumb|right|300px|[[Carta marina]] of [[Baltic Sea]] (1539)]]
The '''Hanseatic League''' ([[German language|German]]: ''die Hanse'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''de Hanze'', [[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Hanza'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''Hansan'') consisted of an [[military alliance|alliance]] of [[trade|trading]] cities that established and maintained a trade [[monopoly]] over the [[Baltic Sea]] and most of [[Northern Europe]] for a time in the later [[Middle Ages]] and the Early Modern period, between the [[13th century|13th]] and [[17th century | 17th centuries]].  

==History==
Historians generally trace the origins of the League to the foundation of the town of [[Lübeck]], established in [[1158]]/[[1159]] after the capture of the area by [[Henry the Lion]] of [[Saxony]]. Exploratory trading adventures, [[raid]]s and [[piracy]] had occurred earlier throughout the Baltic — the [[sailor]]s of [[Gotland]] sailed up rivers as far away as [[Novgorod]], for example — but the scale of international [[economic system|economy]] in the Baltic area remained insignificant before the growth of the Hanseatic League. German cities achieved domination of trade in the Baltic with striking speed over the next century, and Lübeck became a central node in all the sea trade that linked the areas around the [[North Sea]] and the Baltic Sea. The 15th century saw the the climax of Lübeck's hegemony. [[Visby]], one of the midwives of the Hanseatic league in 1358, declined to become a member. Visby dominated trade in the Baltic before the Hanseatic league, with its monopolistic ideology, got rid of the [[Gotland]]ic free-trade competition.

===Foundation===
[[Image:hanseatic league.JPG|right|Hanseatic League]]

Lübeck became a base for northern German [[merchant]]s from Saxony and [[Westphalia]] to spread east and north. Well before the term ''Hanse'' appeared in a document ([[1267]]), merchants in a given city began to form [[guilds]] or Hansa with the intention of trading with towns overseas, especially in the less-developed eastern Baltic area, a source of [[timber]], [[wax]], [[resin]]s, [[fur]]s, even [[rye]] and [[wheat]] brought down on [[barge]]s from the [[hinterland]] to port markets.
Visby functioned as the leading centre in the Baltic before the Hanse. For hundred years the Germans sailed under the Gotlandic flag to Novgorod. Sailing east, Visby merchants established a branch at Novgorod. To begin with the Germans used the Gotlandic Gutagard. With the influx of too many merchants the Gotlanders arranged their own trading stations for the Gemanan Petershof further up from the river.   - see a translation of the  [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1229novgorod-germans.html grant] of privileges to merchants in [[1229]]. They  helped establish key towns on the east Baltic coast - Danzig ([[Gdańsk]]) Reval ([[Tallinn]]), [[Riga]] and Dorpat ([[Tartu]]), all founded (like others on the Baltic coast) under [[Lübeck law]], which provided that they had to appeal in all legal matters to Lübeck's city council. Before the foundation of the Hanseatic league in 1358 the word Hanse was not used in the Baltic. The Gotlanders used the word ''varjag''.

Hansa societies worked to acquire special trade privileges for their members. For example, the merchants of the [[Cologne]] (Köln) Hansa contrived to convince [[Henry II of England]] to grant them (in [[1157]]) special trading privileges and market rights which freed them from all [[London]] tolls and allowed them to trade at fairs throughout [[England]]. The &quot;Queen of the Hanse&quot;, Lübeck, where traders transshipped goods between the North Sea and the Baltic, gained the Imperial privilege of becoming an [[Imperial Free City|Imperial city]] in [[1227]], the only such city east of the River [[Elbe]]. 

Lübeck, which had access to the Baltic and North Sea fishing grounds, formed an alliance in 1241 with [[Hamburg]], another trading city thench ''hussard'') which before the [[15th century]], according to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] meant &quot;freebooter, freelance.&quot; 

Then, in the second half of the 15th century, it acquired the meaning of &quot;light horsemen.&quot; It is this sense that the term could be applied to the dashing, heroic light [[cavalry]] regiments who &quot;fought with George Washington in the Revolutionary War.&quot;  The military connotations of &quot;hoosier&quot; are strikingly reinforced in the Journal of the Kosciuszko Guards by [[William S. Hemphill]]. William S. Hemphill was born in 1832 and died in 1907. 

There is no indication of the exact year in which the journal was written, but it was, presumably, sometime in the years following the end of the Civil War in 1865 and before his death in 1907. The word ''hoosier'' or ''hoosiers'' occurs frequently in the journal. Indeed, the Indiana regiment who fought in the Civil War named their camp &quot;Hoosiertown.&quot; 

Perhaps, the most telling anecdote is of a splendid [[Massachusetts]] regiment who disdained to soil their hands with the chore of moving a massive rock. So the regiment from Indiana, referred to as &quot;Hoosiers,&quot; sets about the project. The soldiers from Massachusetts merely looked on. &quot;A large, fine looking man,&quot; Hemphill recalls, &quot;wearing a common soldier's blouse and slouch hat, on passing, had paused to watch the proceedings.&quot; 

He began to berate the leader of the Massachusetts regiment, a second lieutenant. Abashed, the second lieutenant takes on airs, and threatens to teach the interloper some manners, but upon noticing that the &quot;burley form of the Hoosier looked rather formidable, decided to appeal to Hemphill, who was in charge of the Indiana regiment.&quot; 

&quot;Sergeant,&quot; the second lieutenant said, &quot;this is one of your men; arrest him and take him to your commanding officer. I will prefer charges against him and have him properly punished!&quot; Hemphill took no action; as he reported later, because &quot;I was full of laughter that I could make no answer.&quot; 

When the interloping Hoosier realized how upset the second lieutenant was, he makes a pretty speech&amp;mdash;if not an apology, then of polite remonstrance&amp;mdash;;ending with these plainspoken words: &quot;I guess the Sergeant will not arrest me, but if you wish to prefer charges against me, you can do so. I am Lieut. Col. George Humphrey, of the 12th Ind. Inf. at your service.&quot; 

Hemphill adds: &quot;It was a complete take down; and the Lieutenant's turn to apologize. The Hoosiers all joined in the laugh, and three cheers were given for Col. Humphrey; while the crest fallen Yankees quietly returned to their camp to wonder what kind of men the Hoosiers were anyhow.&quot;

===Humorists===
Humorist [[Dave Barry]] has suggested that it comes from &quot;the sound pigs make when they sneeze.&quot;  He had also speculated that, for all we know, it could be a Native American word meaning &quot;sex with caribou,&quot; although many of his astute readers pointed out that there are no [[caribou]] in Indiana.

==Other uses==

In some areas, the word ''hoosier'' has a different connotation.  In the [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] area of [[Missouri]] and [[Illinois]], a hoosier may be someone who is lower-class and white (like ''[[white trash]]'' and ''[[redneck]]'').

&quot;[[Hoosier (furniture)|Hoosier]]&quot; was also a brand name used by the [[Hoosier (furniture)|Hoosier Manufacturing Company]], and refers particularly to its kitchen cabinets, which are collectible antiques. The company also made tables and [[chair]]s.  This furniture is much sought after in the antique world.  Little is known about this furniture company, other than that it was based in [[New Castle, Indiana]], between [[1903]] and [[1935]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] subfield of [[numerical analysis]] the '''Horner scheme''' or '''Horner algorithm''', named after [[William George Horner]], is an [[algorithm]] for the efficient evaluation of [[polynomial]]s in [[monomial form]].

==History==
Even though it is named after William George Horner, who described the algorithm in [[1819]], it was already known to [[Isaac Newton]] in [[1669]] and even to the Chinese [[mathematician]] [[Ch'in Chiu-Shao]] around [[1200s]].

It has been shown that the Horner scheme is optimal, that is, any algorithm that evaluates an arbitrary polynomial must use at least as many steps. That the number of additions required is minimal was shown by [[Alexander Ostrowski]] in [[1954]], and [[Victor Pan]] proved that the number of multiplications is minimal in [[1966]].

==Basic idea==
Assume we want to evaluate the polynomial in the [[monomial form]]

:&lt;math&gt;p(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3 + \cdots + a_nx^n.&lt;/math&gt;

for given ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. That is we want to know

:&lt;math&gt;p(x) = y&lt;/math&gt;

for a given ''x''. When using the monomial form of the polynomial we need ''n'' additions and (''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''n'')/2 multiplications for the calculation of ''p''(''x''). Our aim is to decrease the number of multiplications because they are slow and [[numerical stability | numerically unstable]] compared to the additions. The Horner algorithm rearranges the polynomial into the [[recursion|recursive]] form
 
:&lt;math&gt;p(x) = a_0 + x(a_1 + x(a_2 + \cdots x(a_{n-1} + a_n x)))&lt;/math&gt;

and then evaluates the polynomial recursively using only ''n'' additions and ''n'' multiplications. Additionally it is numerically more stable because we eliminated some multiplications. Alternatively it could be computed with ''n'' [[fused multiply-add]]s.

==Horner algorithm==

Given the polynomial

:&lt;math&gt;p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \cdots + a_n x^n.&lt;/math&gt;

we rearrange it into

:&lt;math&gt;p(x) = a_0 + x(a_1 + x(a_2 + \cdots x(a_{n-1} + a_n x)))&lt;/math&gt;

Then starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards we define

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
    b_n &amp; := &amp; a_{n}             \\
b_{n-1} &amp; := &amp; a_{n-1} + b_{n} x \\
        &amp; \vdots &amp;              \\
  b_{0} &amp; := &amp; a_{0} + b_{1} x 
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

If we put the ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in the polynomial we see that

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
p(x) &amp; = &amp; a_0 + x(a_1 + x(a_2 + \cdots x(a_{n-1} + b_n x))) \\
p(x) &amp; = &amp; a_0 + x(a_1 + x(a_2 + \cdots x(b_{n-1}))) \\
     &amp; \vdots &amp;              \\
p(x) &amp; = &amp; a_0 + x(b_1) \\
p(x) &amp; = &amp; b_0 \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

so ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the value of the polynomial ''p'' at ''x''.

==Application==
The Horner scheme is often used to convert between different positional [[numeral system]]s (in which case ''x'' is the base of the number system, and the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the digits) and can also be used if ''x'' is a [[matrix (math)|matrix]], in which case the gain is even larger.

The Horner scheme can also be viewed as a fast algorithm for dividing a polynomial by a linear polynomial (see [[Ruffini's rule]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The Hexer''' or '''the Witcher''' ([[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Wiedźmin'') named Geralt is a character created by [[Andrzej Sapkowski]]. Hexers appear in Sapkowski's ''Hexer cycle'', comprising two short story collections and five novels. The novels sometimes wrongly described as the ''Hexer Saga'' (''Saga o wiedźminie''), where the correct over-title is ''Blood of the Elves''. The stories and novels have been translated into Czech, Slovak, German, Russian, Lithuanian, French and Spanish. English translation of ''The Final Wish'' short story collection is going to be published by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]] in [[2006]].

''Hexers'' are professional monster killers who receive special training and preparation. They are sterile mutants with supernatural abilities. During their training they are also taught to suppress their feelings, which leads many people to believe that they have no emotions. Geralt, the central character in Sapkowski's stories, is one of the best hexers.

Alternatively, the word ''warlock'' has been used informally in English translations, while ''witcher'', being a new word in English (as ''wiedźmin'' is in Polish) describes better the spirit of Geralt's profession. ''Witcher'' is also used by the makers of a computer game based on the books. Sapkowski himself prefers the translation ''hexer''.

==The Hexer cycle==
[[Image:Wiedzmin plakat.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Movie poster]]
===Short stories===
The hexer cycle started as a series of short stories, at first published in ''[[Fantastyka]]'', a Polish science fiction magazine. The first short story was ''Wiedźmin'' (''Hexer'') ([[1986]]), written for a contest of ''Fantastyka'' magazine, where it won the 3rd place. The first four stories of Geralt (and ''Droga, z której się nie wraca'' (''The road with no return''), which took place in the same world, but dozens of years before the Hexer stories) were published in a short story collection titled ''Wiedźmin''. All fifteen short stories were later collected in three books published by superNOWA - ''Ostatnie życzenie'' (''The final wish''), ''Miecz przeznaczenia'' (''The sword of destiny'') and ''Coś się kończy, coś się zaczyna'' (''Something ends, something begins'').

===The Saga===
''Blood of the Elves'' is the over-title of the five novels about Geralt - ''Krew elfów'' (''Blood of the Elves''), ''Czas pogardy'' (''Season of contempt''), ''Chrzest ognia'' (''Baptism by fire''), ''Wieża jaskółki'' (''The Swallow's Tower'') and ''Pani jeziora'' (''Lady of the lake'') - in which Sapkowski joins the threads started in the short stories, and adds new ones. Apart from the hexer himself, another central character is princess Ciri.

===List of books===

====Short story collections:====
*''[[The Final Wish]]'' (''Ostatnie życzenie'') ([[1993]])
*''[[Sword of Destiny]]'' (''Miecz przeznaczenia'') ([[1992]])
*''[[Something ends, something begins]]'' (''Coś się kończy, coś się zaczyna'') ([[2000]])

====Hexer saga:====
*''[[Blood of the Elves]]'' (''Krew elfów'') ([[1994]])
*''[[Season of Contempt]]'' (''Czas pogardy'') ([[1995]])
*''[[Baptism by Fire]]'' (''Chrzest ognia'') ([[1996]])
*''[[The Swallow's Tower]]'' (''Wieża jaskółki'') ([[1997]])
*''[[Lady of the Lake (novel)|Lady of the Lake]]'' (''Pani jeziora'') ([[1999]])

==Comic books==
In [[1993]]-[[1995]], Sapkowski's stories were adapted into six [[comic book]] albums by [[Maciej Parowski]] (story), [[Boguslaw Polch]] (art), and Sapkowski himself. They are:

*''The Road with no Return'' (''Droga bez powrotu'', based on short story ''Droga, z której się nie wraca'')
*''Geralt'' (based on the short story ''Wiedźmin'')
*''Lesser Evil'' (''Mniejsze zło'', based on a short story of the same title)
*''The Final Wish'' (''Ostatnie życzenie'', based on a short story of the same title)
*''The Border of Possibility'' (''Granica możliwości'', based on a short story of the same title)
*''Betrayal'' (''Zdrada'')

==Film==
'''The Hexer''' is also the title of a movie ([[2001]]) and television series ([[2002]]), directed by [[Marek Brodzki]], written by [[Michal Szczerbic|Michał Szczerbic]], and produced by [[Lew Rywin]]. The role of Geralt was played by [[Michal Zebrowski|Michał Żebrowski]], and the music was composed by [[Grzegorz Ciechowski]]. The film was essentially the TV series chopped into about 2 hours and received very poor reviews from both the fans and the critics.

==TV Series==
A 13 episode TV series came out the following year. The series was much more coherent than the confusing movie, but was still considered a failure mostly due to the film's already bad reputation. The TV series has been unofficially released in English on the internet.

==Role-playing game==
In [[2001]] a [[role-playing game]] called ''The Hexer: A Game of Imagination'' (''Wiedźmin: Gra Wyobraźni'') based on Sapkowski's books was published by MAG. A second edition of the game is currently in production.

==Computer game==
A [[computer role-playing game]] based on Sapkowski's saga called ''[[The Witcher (computer game)|The Witcher]]'' is in develop stage by [[CD Projekt|CD Projekt's]] studio called [[CD Projekt RED]] and it will be released on [[2006 in gaming|2006]].

'''{{Audio|He-Mossad.ogg|Ha-Mōśād le-Mōdī`īn ū-le-Tafqīdīm Meyūhadīm}}''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: &amp;#1492;&amp;#1502;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1505;&amp;#1491; &amp;#1500;&amp;#1502;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1491;&amp;#1497;&amp;#1506;&amp;#1497;&amp;#1503; &amp;#1493;&amp;#1500;&amp;#1514;&amp;#1508;&amp;#1511;&amp;#1497;&amp;#1491;&amp;#1497;&amp;#1501; &amp;#1502;&amp;#1497;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1495;&amp;#1491;&amp;#1497;&amp;#1501;, '''Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations''' [http://www.mohr.gov.il/Mohr/MohrTopNav/MohrEnglish/MohrAboutUs/]) is an [[Israel|Israeli]] [[intelligence agencies|intelligence agency]], commonly referred to as '''Mossad'''. It is responsible for [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence collection]], [[counter-terrorism]], and [[Covert operation|covert action]], including paramilitary activities, some of questionable legality. The Institute is a component of [[Israel Secret Intelligence Service]] and is separate from Military Intelligence [[Aman (IDF)|Aman]] and the General Security Service [[Shabak]].

==Introduction==

Mossad is one of the world's best-known and most highly regarded [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]].  Mossad was formed in December 1949 as the &quot;Central Institute for Coordination&quot;, at the recommendation of Reuven Shiloah to [[Prime Minister]] [[David Ben Gurion]]. Shiloah wanted a central body to coordinate and improve cooperation between the existing security services &amp;mdash; the army's intelligence department (AMAN), the General Security Service (GSS or &quot;Shabak&quot;) and the foreign office's &quot;political department&quot;. In March 1951, it was reorganized and made a part of the prime minister's office, reporting directly to the prime minister. Its current staff is estimated at approximately 1,200.

Mossad is a civilian service, and does not use [[military rank]]s, although most of its staff have served in the [[Israeli Defense Force]] as part of Israel's compulsory draft system, and many of them are [[officer (armed forces)|officer]]s. 

Mossad's original motto: ''be-tahbūlōt ta`aseh lekhā milkhamāh'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: &amp;#1489;&amp;#1514;&amp;#1495;&amp;#1489;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1500;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1514; &amp;#1514;&amp;#1506;&amp;#1513;&amp;#1492; &amp;#1500;&amp;#1498; &amp;#1502;&amp;#1500;&amp;#1495;&amp;#1502;&amp;#1492;, &quot;For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war.&quot; - Proverbs XXIV, 6 or the more recognised translation &quot;By way of deception thou shalt make war&quot;) was changed recently as part of the Mossad's public 'coming out' to another Proverbs passage: ''be-'éyn tahbūlōt yīpōl `ām; ū-teshū`āh be-rōv yo'éts'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: &amp;#1489;&amp;#1488;&amp;#1497;&amp;#1503; &amp;#1514;&amp;#1495;&amp;#1489;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1500;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1514; &amp;#1497;&amp;#1508;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1500; &amp;#1506;&amp;#1501;, &amp;#1493;&amp;#1514;&amp;#1513;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1506;&amp;#1492; &amp;#1489;&amp;#1512;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1489; &amp;#1497;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1506;&amp;#1509;, &quot;Where no counsel is, the people fall, but in the multitude of counselors there is safety.&quot; - Proverbs XI, 14)

Its many successes in serving Israel's security interests have earned Mossad a reputation for being extremely effective as an intelligence agency. Controversy exists over a few cases where it has employed the tactics of [[kidnapping]] and [[assassination]]. It has also been at the forefront of several publicly embarrassing failures.

==Departments==

Mossad is headquartered in [[Tel Aviv]] and has eight departments:
* Collections Department is the largest, with responsibility for espionage operations.
* Political Action and Liaison Department conducts political activities and liaison with friendly foreign intelligence services and with nations with which Israel does not have normal diplomatic relations.
* Special Operations Division (Metsada) conducts [[assassination]], [[sabotage]], and [[paramilitary]] projects. 
* LAP (Lohamah Psichlogit) Department is responsible for [[psychological warfare]], [[propaganda]] and deception operations. 
* Research Department is responsible for intelligence synthesis.
* Technology Department is responsible for development of technologies to support Mossad operations.

== Famous Mossad Successes ==

* Audio surveillance of Nikita Khrushchev's [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|Secret Speech]]. The recording was later turned over to the CIA.
* Location and abduction of Nazi [[War Criminal]] [[Adolf Eichmann]]
* Assisting in [[Operation Moses]], the immigration of [[Ethiopia]]n Jews to Israel.
* Assisting in the defection and rescuing the family of [[Munir Redfa]], an Iraqi pilot who [[defection|defected]] and flew his [[MiG 21]] to Israel.
* Assassination of those responsible for the [[Munich massacre]] at the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympic Games]], called &quot;Operation Wrath of God&quot;.
* Abduction of [[Mordechai Vanunu]] in [[Italy]] 1986
* Providing highly sensitive information about [[Iraq]]'s [[Osiraq]] [[nuclear reactor]], destroyed in an Israeli airstrike in 1981.
* Providing intelligence for Israeli military operations, thousands of miles away from Israel, for instance, for [[Operation Entebbe]].
* Providing intelligence for the assassination of [[Abu Jihad]] by Israeli commandos (unverified but widely believed)
* The assassination of [[Gerald Bull]] (unverified but widely believed)

== Famous Mossad Failures ==
In 1954, as part of [[Lavon_Affair#Operation_Suzannah|Operation Suzannah]], a post office in Alexandria, [[Egypt]] was firebombed and [[U.S. Information Agency]] libraries in Alexandria and Cairo and a British-owned theater were bombed by Mossad operatives. The aim of this [[False flag|false flag]] operation was to influence the British into cancelling or delaying their withdrawal from the [[Suez Canal]].

In 1973, [[Ahmed Bouchiki]], an innocent Arab waiter in [[Lillehammer]], [[Norway]], was killed. He had been mistaken for [[Ali Hassan Salameh]], one of the leaders of [[Black September (group)|Black September]], the [[Palestinian]] group responsible for the [[Munich Massacre]], who had been given shelter in Norway. The Mossad agents had used fake [[Passport Canada|Canadian passports]], which angered the [[Canada|Canadian]] government. 

In 1981, fake [[United Kingdom|British]] passports  were discovered in a grocery bag in London, leading to a diplomatic row with Israel over Mossad involvement in an attempt to infiltrate [[China]]. 

In 1997, two Mossad agents were caught in [[Jordan]], which had signed a peace treaty with Israel, on a mission to assassinate Sheikh [[Khaled Mashal]], a leader of [[Hamas]], by injecting him with [[poison]]. Again, they were using fake Canadian passports. This led to a diplomatic row with Canada and Jordan, and Israel was forced to provide the poison [[antidote]] and release around 70 Palestinian prisoners, in particular the Hamas leader [[Sheikh Ahmed Yassin]] &amp;mdash; who played a prominent role in encouraging attacks on Israeli [[civilian]]s (and soldiers) during the [[Al-Aqsa intifada]] &amp;mdash; in exchange for the Mossad agents, who would otherwise have faced the death penalty for e=[[Submachine gun]]

The '''Heckler &amp; Koch MP5''' is a [[submachine gun]] developed by [[Germany|German]] [[weapon]]s manufacturer [[Heckler &amp; Koch]] (HK) in the 1960s. 

A typical MP5 fires [[9 mm Luger Parabellum|9 x 19 mm Luger]] [[ammunition]] from a curved, detachable box-type [[Magazine (firearm)|magazine]]. The MP5's accuracy, reliability, and wide range of accessories and variants have made it the submachine gun of choice for [[military]] and [[law enforcement]] agencies worldwide.

As with most HK weapons, the trigger assembly is completely replaceable, and includes [[Automatic fire|fully-automatic]], 4-, 3- and 2-round burst, single fire, and safe positions in various combinations. MP5s were long chambered for the 9 mm Luger cartridge, commonly used in [[pistol]]s. In the late 1990s, more powerful [[10 mm Auto]] and [[.40 S&amp;W]] versions were introduced, but soon phased out in favor of the new [[Heckler &amp; Koch UMP|UMP]] submachine gun. The MP5 has a roller-delayed blowback mechanism tracing back to a mid-1940s German prototype known as the [[StG45(M)]] and further developed in the [[CETME]] rifle.  The design was developed by Mauser from the roller-locking system patented by [[Edward Stecke]] in the 1930s and used in the [[MG42]].

==Variants==
The original MP5 was available with a fixed (MP5A2) or retractable (MP5A3) stock. Some variants did not have a 3-round burst capacity, or had only a 3-round burst mode. HK has made many general improvements to the MP5 over the years since its introduction.

The next major development was the MP5SD series (SD1&amp;ndash;SD6), introduced in 1974. This model had an integrated [[suppressor]] and a specially-made barrel which reduced the muzzle velocity of its ammunition to just below the [[speed of sound]]. The result was that the MP5SD series is almost inaudible at distances of more than 15 [[Metre|meters]]. By its remarkable sound and almost invisible muzzle flash, it is chosen as a stealthy operating weapon in many police and military forces.

The [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5K|MP5K]] (the &quot;K&quot; stands for ''kurz'', meaning ''short''), which is only 325 [[1 E-3 m|mm]] long, was introduced in 1976 at the request of a [[South America]]n arms dealer who saw the potential for its sale to [[bodyguard]]s as a concealable, but fully-automatic weapon. It has a vertical foregrip to reduce muzzle rise and aid in automatic firing and it can also be fired from inside a special briefcase. Additionally, a version without the diopter sights but a smooth upper surface and small pistol sights was developed to reduce the likelihood that the weapon would snag during the draw. A further development of the model by the U.S. division of HK was the MP5K-PDW ([[Personal defense weapon|Personal Defense Weapon]]), in 1991. This model was built for [[United States Air Force]] pilots who needed a compact weapon. Unlike the original, the PDW adds a folding stock and can accept a [[suppressor]] and laser sight. All variants of the MP5K are available in the similar configurations as the original weapon. A semi-automatic civilian version known as the SP89 was briefly offered before the 1994 assault weapons ban.

Under a special contract from the [[United States Navy]], HK developed the MP5N or &quot;MP5 Navy&quot; variant for the Navy's elite special operations units (including the [[U.S. Navy SEALs]]). The MP5N features a fully-ambidextrous trigger group, a retractable stock, and a threaded barrel for mounting suppressors. In addition, HK replaced many of the metal parts on the MP5N with lighter and corrosion-resistant plastics.

The MP5/10, an MP5 chambered in the 10 mm Auto cartridge, was HK's first attempt to increase the power of the MP5 series. In 1994, the US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] adopted the MP5/10 as their standard submachine gun. Despite the discontinuance of MP5/10 production and the agency's adoption of the .40 S&amp;W cartridge for pistols, the FBI recently solicited HK for the purchase of an additional fifty MP5/10.  The name ''MP10'' has been incorrectly used by some to indicate the MP5/10.  This error was popularized by [[Tom Clancy]]'s book ''[[Rainbow Six (book)|Rainbow Six]]''.

==History==
The MP5 was first introduced by HK in 1966 under the name HK54. This name comes from HK's old numbering system. The &quot;5&quot; designates the model as a submachine gun, while the &quot;4&quot; identifies it as taking 9 x 19 mm ammunition. The current name dates from when it was officially adopted by the [[West Germany|West German]] government for use by its Police and Border Guard as the ''Maschinenpistole 5'', or MP5 in mid-1966. The [[GSG 9]], the counter-terrorist part of the Border Guard, then introduced the MP5 to other Western counter-terrorist units.

With the increased use of body armor, the future of the MP5 is uncertain. Several new trends in gun design have begun to eclipse the submachine gun; small caliber PDW like HK's new [[MP7]] and compact carbines such as the [[M4 Carbine|M4]], [[AKS-74]], the G36C variant of HK's [[Heckler &amp; Koch G36|G36]], and the [[XM8 rifle]] based on the G36. The only major criticism of the MP5 has been its high cost &amp;mdash; approximately 900 [[United States dollar|USD]] for an MP5N &amp;mdash; the same price as an assault rifle. HK has started to complement the MP5 series with the more powerful and cheaper [[HK UMP|UMP]], which is available in [[.45 ACP]], .40 S&amp;W and 9 mm Parabellum calibers. However, since the UMP uses a simple blowback action, it may not necessarily be a rival for the MP5 among the most discriminating users.

One famous [[counter-terrorism|counter-terrorist]] operation involving this gun is [[Operation Nimrod]] on [[April 30]], [[1980]] in the UK, where the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS), armed with MP5s, was deployed to assault the terrorists who had taken over the [[Iran]]ian embassy in [[London]].

An MP5 was used by Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] of [[Nepal|Nepal]] to [[massacre|massacre]] the royal family (including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] and [[Queen Aiswarya]]), in a shooting spree in 2001.

==Operation==
''Keep the finger off of the trigger until target has been selected and you are ready to fire. Always point the weapon in a safe direction. Always treat the weapon as if it were loaded.''

#On models with &quot;SEF&quot; trigger group, place selector (found on the left side of weapon, above pistol grip) to &quot;S&quot; position. On models with &quot;Pictogram&quot; trigger group rotate rear of selector all the way up, so that front of selector points to depiction of bullet with X through it ''(will be only depiction outlined in white)''. Weapon is now safed.
#Holding the weapon by the pistol grip with the right hand, grasp charging handle located on front left side of weapon with the left hand and pull all the way to rear, lock into place by maneuvering handle clockwise into slot found near top of weapon. 
#Insert loaded magazine into magazine well located directly behind rear of foregrip.
#Grasp charging handle with left hand, maneuver handle down back into travel slot. Release handle, allowing it to slam forwards. Hitting the top of the gun hard enough with the palm of the hand will also allow the bolt to slam closed by itself.

The weapon is now loaded.

===Firing===

#While holding the weapon by the pistol grip with the right hand, and having the left hand  supporting front of weapon by grasping the foregrip (reverse hand positions if left-handed), place buttstock of weapon firmly against shoulder.
#Depending on model*, rotate selector down one position to &quot;E&quot; or to image of single red bullet. Weapon will now fire one bullet each time trigger is pulled. If fully-automatic fire is desired, rotate selector to &quot;F&quot;, or depiction of 7 red bullets in a row.
#Select target and place top of post sticking up from front site over target. Center top of post inside aperture of rear sight (see [http://hkpro.com/sights.htm] for more in depth sighting procedures), gently squeeze trigger.

''*Some models will have burst options (2 or 3 red bullets in a row), or will be labeled numerically (0 for safe, 1 for semi-automatic, 20 or 25 for fully-automatic)''

===Unloading===

#Holding weapon by the pistol grip with the right hand, use right thumb to rotate selector to safe position.
#With left hand, grasp magazine. Place left thumb between magazine release (~4mm-thick piece of metal sticking down from bottom of gun) and front of trigger guard. While grasping the magazine with the left hand, use the left thumb to push the magazine release towards the magazine, and while holding the release in this position, pull the magazine out of the magazine well.
#Pull back charging handle and lock to rear via slot mentioned in step two of loading procedure, if weapon is &quot;condition 1&quot; (meaning cocked with round chambered) prepare for round to be ejected from right side of weapon when charging handle is brought to rear. Collect round and temporarily store in a place where it will not be lost.
#After charging handle has been locked in the rearward position, visually inspect weapon to be sure no round remains in the chamber. This is done by rotating the weapon so that the right side faces up, and looking forwards into the ejection port. Chambered round should be fairly easy to spot by its golden-brass color. If any doubt remains as to status of weapon, inspect chamber physically by inserting finger through ejection port and feeling around chamber. 

:'''WARNING:''' Be sure charging handle is securely positioned to the rear; the handle going forwards when a finger is inside the weapon will cause injury to the user. 

After the weapon has been visually/physically inspected it can be declared as &quot;Condition 3&quot; (unloaded). When the weapon is unloaded, the charging handle should remain in the rearward position, with no magazine inserted in order to signify its condition to any others who may be around, or handling the weapon.

==Popular culture==

The MP5 is a very popular image in [[popular culture]]. It is a very common movie and TV prop.

It appears in countless films such as ''[[Air Force One (film)|Air Force One]]'', ''[[Batman Begins]]'', ''[[Bad Boys II]]'', ''[[Die Hard]]'', ''[[Mission: Impossible III]]'', ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', ''[[Returner]]'', ''[[S.W.A.T. (film)|S.W.A.T.]]'', ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'', ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'' and ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'', to name a few. It is also present in the [[Television program|TV series]] ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''.

It is notable that up until the 1990s, the MP5 and [[Uzi submachine gun|Uzi]] were the only non-American (designed abroad) weapons that were as widespread in Hollywood productions as the US-produced [[Colt Firearms|Colt]] [[M1911]] pistols, [[M16 (rifle)|M16]] assault rifles, [[Thompson submachine gun|Tommy Guns]] and revolvers.

[[Image:Rote armee fraktion logo.png|thumb|100px|RAF logo with [[red star]] and MP5 (with straight, or &quot;waffle&quot;, magazine)]]

The MP5 is also commonly used in written popular culture. The most famous of which is in the novel ''[[Rainbow Six (book)|Rainbow Six]]'', where [[Tom Clancy]] arms his fictional counter-terrorist team with suppressed MP5/10s. Clancy nicknames them MP10s, from where the common misconception of the correct designation is sourced.

Many [[computer and video games]] feature the MP5 as a playable weapon. It appears in name or similarity in many [[First-person shooter|first-person shooter]]s and other types of games, most famously ''[[Half-Life]]'', ''[[Max Payne 2]]'', ''[[Counter-Strike]]'', ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six]]'' series, ''[[Grand Theft Auto (series)|Grand Theft Auto]]'' series, ''[[SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs]]'' series, ''[[Battlefield 2]]'', ''[[Perfect Dark Zero]]'' and ''[[Far Cry]]'', among many others.

The MP5 is also pictured in the logo of the former German radical leftist terrorist group the [[Red Army Faction]] (right picture).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Henry Middleton''' ([[1717]] &amp;ndash; [[June 13]], [[1784]]) of [[South Carolina]] was the second [[President of the Continental Congress|President]] of the [[Continental Congress]], and thus the leader of what was to become the [[United States]], from [[October 22]], [[1774]] until [[Peyton Randolph]] was able to resume his duties briefly beginning on [[May 10]], [[1775]].

He was preceded in office by [[Peyton Randolph]] and succeeded first by [[Peyton Randolph]] for a few days, then by [[John Hancock]].

While a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]], he resigned in order to prepare for the coming war.  He was replaced by his son [[Arthur Middleton]] (1742-1787), who went on to sign the [[Declaration of Independence]] and the [[Articles of Confederation]].  

Arthur's son, also named [[Henry Middleton (governor)|Henry]] (1770-1846), had a long career in politics. He was [[List of Governors of South Carolina|Governor of South Carolina]] (1810-1812), [[U.S. Representative]] (1815-1819), and the Minister to [[Russia]] (1820-1830).

Several of Henry's other children married well:
*Henrietta was married to [[Edward Rutledge]].
*Sarah was the first wife of [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]]. 
*Thomas married Anne Manigault; one daughter Esther married Ralph Stead Izard a distant cousin of South Caroina Congressman [[Ralph Izard]] &amp; Alice De Lancey.(Alice was niece of [[James DeLancey]]; [[James DeLancey]]'s sister Susannah was the wife of Sir [[Peter Warren]] (Admirial). Another daughter Elizabeth Middleton was married to Ralph DeLancey Izard son of [[Congressman]] [[Ralph Izard]]. 
{Note: Joseph-a brother of Anne Manigault- was first married to a daughter of [[Arthur Middleton]] and Mary Izard; by Joseph Manigault's second marriage he was the father of [[Confederate]] [[General]] Arthur Middleton Manigault (1824-1886)whose wife was a cousin 1st removed of [[Confederate]] [[General]] [[Benjamin Huger]]}

[[Image:NCI clove ham.jpg|thumb|Ham with cloves]]
Technically, '''ham''' is the [[thigh]] and [[buttock]] of any [[animal]] that is [[slaughter|slaughtered]] for [[meat]], but the term is usually restricted to a cut of [[pork]], the haunch of a [[pig]] or [[boar]].  Although it can be cooked and served fresh, most ham is cured in some fashion.

Ham can either be dry-cured or wet-cured. A dry-cured ham has been rubbed in a mixture containing [[sodium chloride|salt]] and a variety of other ingredients (most usually some proportion of [[sodium nitrate]] and [[sodium nitrite]]).  [[Sugar]] is common in many dry cures in the [[United States]].  This is followed by a period of drying and aging. Dry-cured hams require a prolonged period of rehydration prior to consumption. A wet-cured ham has been cured with a brine, either by immersion or injection.  The division between wet and dry cure is not always hard-and-fast as some ham curing methods begin wet but are followed by dry aging.

The majority of common wet-cured ham available in U.S. supermarkets is of the &quot;city ham&quot; variety, in which brine is injected into the meat for a very rapid curing suitable for mass market.  Traditional wet curing requires immersing the ham in a brine for an extended period, often followed by light smoking.  Traditional wet cured ham includes the [[England|English]] ''Wiltshire ham''.

Dry-cured varieties include ''[[prosciutto]] crudo'' (the [[Italy|Italian]] style of dry-cured ham) and ''Parma ham'' or ''prosciutto di Parma'' (''prosciutto crudo'' from the city of [[Parma]]).  Spain has ''[[jamón serrano]]'' and jamón iberico.  The United States has ''country ham'' (including ''Virginia ham''), which is smoked.  [[England]] has the ''York ham''. [[Germany]]'s ''Westphalian ham'' is usually smoked over [[juniper]].

Ham is also processed into other meat products such as [[SPAM]] luncheon meat. Baked ham is also a traditional dish served on Easter.

==National regulation of ham production==
Each country that produces ham has its own regulations. 

===USA===
In the United States, ham is regulated primarily on the basis of its cure and water content.  US law (specifically the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]) recognizes the following categories:

Fresh ham is an uncured hind leg of pork. Country Ham is uncooked, cured, dried, smoked-or-unsmoked, made from a single piece of meat from the hind leg of a hog or from a single piece of meat from a pork shoulder.  [[Smithfield ham]], a country ham, must be made in or around [[Smithfield, Virginia]] to be sold as such.
[[image:ham.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Sliced ham]]
For most other purposes, under US law, a &quot;ham&quot; is a cured hind leg of pork that is at least 20.5% [[protein]] (not counting [[fat]] portions) and contains no added water.  However &quot;ham&quot; can be legally applied to such things as &quot;[[turkey (food)|turkey]] ham&quot; if the meat is taken from the thigh of the animal. If the ham has less than 20.5% but is at least 18.5% protein, it can be called &quot;ham with natural juices&quot;.  A ham that is at least 17.0% protein and up to 10% added solution can be called &quot;ham&amp;mdash;water added&quot;.  Finally, &quot;ham and water product&quot; refers to a cured hind leg of pork product that contains any amount of added water, although the label must indicate the percent added ingredients.  If a ham has been cut into pieces and molded, it must be labeled &quot;sectioned and formed&quot; or &quot;chud>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:15in howitzer.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Loading a WW1 British 15 in (381 mm) howitzer]]
A '''howitzer''' or '''hauwitzer''' is a type of field [[artillery]]. The name derives from the [[Czech language|Czech]] word ''houfnice'', denoting a [[15th century]]  cannon used by [[Hussite]]s during the [[Hussite Wars]]. Howitzers are distinguished from other types of [[cannon]] artillery by their trajectory in that they tend to fire at high angles and deliver plunging fire. In addition to this the barrel of a howitzer is commonly below 30 calibers (the length of the [[Barrel (firearms)|barrel]] is less than 30 times as long as the diameter of the [[bore]]), whereas other cannon and field guns tend to fire at no more than 45° ''and'' have a caliber of 30 or over. Development of the gun-howitzer, a weapon that can fire at both high and low angles was continued after the [[World War II|Second World War]]. With much longer barrels than howitzers, barrel lengths of 39, 45 or longer are now common, they have replaced separate guns and howitzers on the battlefield.

Howitzers are still either towed, or now self-propelled where they mix the maneuverability and to some extent the protection of tanks with their heavy firepower. Small howitzers can be towed by a light vehicle or carried by [[helicopter]]. Most are towed by five-ton or larger trucks.
The &quot;pack&quot; howitzer (such as the [[25 Pounder Short Mark 1]]) has existed since before the [[World War I|First World War]]. It can be disassembled into several main components and carried by [[mule]] through very difficult terrain, although the gun size is still a limiting factor and smaller howitzers have generally been abandoned in favor of larger guns with greater capabilities.  

Modern self-propelled howitzers such as the [[South Africa]]n [[G6 howitzer|G6]] fire 105 to 155 mm  diameter shells up to about 25-30 km at a maximum rate of about 10 per minute. 

[[Image:Howitzer_firing.jpg|thumb|left|250px|155 mm [[M198 howitzer]]]]

The Dutch, German, Italian and Greek armies have been using or will be using [[PzH 2000 howitzer]] (155 mm, self-propelled) shortly.

The [[Big Bertha]] was a large, 42 [[centimetre|centimeter]] howitzer used in the German push of 1914.  The gun was based on a similar 42 centimeter gun manufactured for a short while by [[Krupp]] for the German military.

[[Image:DSCN5244 fortlaramie12poundermtnhowitzer e.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[19th century]] 12 pounder (5 kg) mountain howitzer displayed by the [[National Park Service]] at [[Fort Laramie]] in [[Wyoming]], [[USA]]]]

That similar, older 42 centimeter gun was based almost completely on a gun designed by [[Louis Gathmann]] in the late [[1800s]]. Louis was known as the inventor of the &quot;Big Berthas&quot; up through his death in June of 1917.

In November [[1990]] [[United Kingdom|British]] customs officers seized parts of a 1000 mm howitzer destined for the [[Iraq]] [[Project Babylon]] &quot;supergun&quot;, which, had it been built, would have been the largest gun ever constructed.

:''This article is about the ''Hummer'' vehicle. For the form of oral sex, see [[Oral sex#Variants]], or for the common variant of bird, see [[Hummingbird]].''
'''Hummer''' is a [[marque]] of vehicles sold by [[General Motors]]. For the military vehicles of which the trademark is based see [[HMMWV]].

==History==

Hummers were traditionally built by [[AM General]] Corporation, formerly the heavy industries division of [[American Motors]], in its [[Mishawaka, Indiana]] assembly plant.  AM General had planned to sell a civilian version of the Hummer as far back as the late [[1980s]].  In [[1990]], two matching white Hummers were driven from [[London]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] to [[Beijing]], [[People's Republic of China]] over the rough roads of the central [[Soviet Union]].  The Hummers made the drive with ease, and highlights of this journey were broadcast on [[ESPN]] in the [[United States]].  The publicity would pale in comparison to the attention that the [[HMMWV]] received for its service in [[Operation: Desert Storm]] the following year.  

In [[1991]], [[AM General]] began selling a civilian version of the M998 [[High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle]] (HMMWV or Hum-Vee) vehicle to the public under the brand name '''Hummer'''. In [[1999]], AM General sold the brand name to General Motors but continued to manufacture the vehicles, which GM then re-sold.  In the next few years, GM introduced two new homegrown models, the [[Hummer H2|H2]] and [[Hummer H3|H3]], and renamed the original vehicle to H1.  AM General continues to build the H1 and is contracted by GM to produce the H2.  The H3 is built in Shreveport, LA.

As of 2004, Hummer has gone international with selected importers and distributors in Europe and other markets. It has only been sold in small volumes, but some celebrities and business people have bought Hummers to satisfy their curiosity. Markets such as Australia have taken interest to Hummers with importers converting the latest H3 to right hand drive despite GM not officially selling the brand in Australia.

From 2006, GM will be building/assembling the Hummer H3 at the Port Elizabeth plant in South Africa to make Hummers internationally available. Hummers at the Port Elizabeth plant will be built for local South African consumption and exported to Australia, the United Kingdom and Japan.

==Evaluation==

The first two Hummer models are large, heavy vehicles with large engines and complex drivelines. The third one, the [[Hummer H3|H3]], is smaller and geared more towards people who want an everyday SUV.  They also feature aggressive styling and advertising, setting them apart from competing models. This has made them a target of criticism, as many people view Hummers as ill-suited for use as a passenger vehicle on public streets. As fuel prices have risen, detractors have also singled out the Hummer as an egregious waster of resources—a charge based largely on the Hummer's fuel consumption and size.

Since both the H1 and H2 can weigh over 8,500&amp;nbsp;lb (GVWR), the United States fuel economy regulations do not apply to them.  GM does not disclose their expected fuel economy ratings, and the company is not required to display a [[Monroney sticker]] on the vehicles.  However, expected [[Miles_per_gallon|mpg]] ratings can be derived from their fuel capacity and range ratings.  These metrics show that the [[Diesel]] H1 is expected to reach 16&amp;nbsp;[[Miles_per_gallon|mpg]] (U.S.), while the H2 should get 9.6&amp;nbsp;mpg.  ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine observed 12&amp;nbsp;mpg with their H2 SUV.  These ratings are similar to those of other heavy trucks and SUVs.

==Models==
&lt;!--[[Image:Hummer20Limo206.jpg|thumb|right|Hummer Limo]]--&gt;
There are three current and possibly two future models in the Hummer line:
* [[Hummer H1]]
* [[Hummer H2]]
** Hummer H2 [[Sports Utility Truck|SUT]] 
* [[Hummer H3]]
** Hummer H3T
* [[Hummer H4]]
* Hummer Hx

==Licensing==
General Motors has been very active in licensing the Hummer brand. Various companies have licensed the Hummer trademarks for use on [[Eau de Cologne|colognes]], [[flashlight]]s, [[bicycle]]s [http://www.hummerbikes.com], [[laptop]]s [http://www.hummerlaptops.com], [[apparel]], [[jewelry]], [[CD player]]s and other items.

==Hummers in popular culture== 
*[[Governor of California|California governor]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was the first private citizen to own a Hummer and continues to own several.

:''This article refers to the Military HMMWV, not the civilian [[Hummer]] sold by [[General Motors]]''

The '''M998 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle''' ('''HMMWV''' or '''Hum-Vee''') is a highly durable [[military]] motor [[vehicle]]. It has largely supplanted the role formerly served by the [[jeep]] and other light trucks with the [[United States]] military, and is also used by a number of other countries and organizations.

== Features ==

There are at least 17 variants of the HMMWV in service with the [[United States armed forces]].  HMMWV serve as cargo/troop carriers, automatic weapons platforms, [[ambulance]]s (four litter patients or eight ambulatory patients), M220 [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW missile]] carriers, [[M119 howitzer]] prime movers, [[M-1097 Avenger]] [[surface-to-air missile]] platforms, MRQ-12 direct [[air support]] vehicles, S250 shelter carriers among many others. It is capable of [[Wiktionary:Ford|fording]] 0.762&amp;nbsp;m normally, or 1.5&amp;nbsp;m with deep-water fording kit.

Optional equipment includes a winch (maximum load capacity 6000&amp;nbsp;lb. (2700&amp;nbsp;kg)), and supplemental armor.  The M1025 and M1043/M1044 armament carriers provide mounting and firing capabilities for the [[MK19 grenade launcher]], the [[M2 machine gun]], the [[M240G]] machine gun and [[M249]] SAW. The newly introduced M1114 &quot;up-armored&quot; HMMWV also features a similar weapons mount.

== History ==

[[image:Hmmwv-036.jpg|thumb|A HMMWV firing a [[BGM-71_TOW|TOW]] missile]]

In the [[1970s]], the [[United States Army]] concluded that the militarized civilian [[truck]]s in use no longer satisfied their requirements.  In [[1979]], the Army drafted specifications for a High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle, or HMMWV. In July of that year, [[AM General]] began preliminary design work, and less than a year later, the first prototype, the M998, was in testing. 

In June [[1981]], the Army awarded AM General a contract for development of several more prototype vehicles to be delivered to the U.S. government for another series of tests, and the company was later awarded the initial production contract for 55,000 HMMWVs to be delivered in [[1985]].  HMMWVs first saw combat in the [[Gulf war|First Gulf War]].

They have become the backbone of U.S. forces around the world. Over 10,000 were used during [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] by U.S. forces as well as some other countries in during [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

== Usage in Iraq and political implications ==
[[Image:Destroyed humvee.jpg|thumb|A destroyed Humvee following an [[Rocket_propelled_grenade|RPG]] attack]]

The HMMWV has proven very vulnerable to light infantry weapons as far back as the Somalia intervention; in its defense, it was never designed to offer such protection. With the rise of [[asymmetric warfare]] and [[low-intensity conflicts]], the HMMWV has found itself thrust into urban combat roles it was not originally intended for. Although the large variety of HMMWV types is a testament to the vehicle’s adaptability to changing mission conditions, it was never designed to be an [[armoured personnel carrier|armored personnel carrier]] (APC).

As it is not an armored vehicle, HMMWVs are very vulnerable to [[rocket propelled grenade]]s (or RPGs, which are common among the Iraqi resistance) and offer the troops within little protection from small arms fire. Although there are several [[Humvee armor kit|armor kits]] available for the vehicle which afford it greater protection from small-arms fire, these were not provided in great numbers to American forces in Iraq prior to the invasion.  As a result of this, American soldiers and Marines often improvise extra armor layers with scrap materials (also known as &quot;[[hillbilly armor]]&quot;) to improve the safety of the HMMWV.  While “hardening” or “up-armoring” their vehicles with sandbags, metal, and plywood does make the vehicles arguably safer, it also slows them down.  It has also been argued that hardening simply creates more [[shrapnel]] when attacked with an RPG or [[improvised explosive device]]. This extra hardening further hampered the ability of the M998 and M1025 due to the addition of excess weight which overloaded the suspension and drivetrain components of these HMMWVs. Performance issues due to the high center of gravity and extra weight of up-armoring kits increase the risk of sway and rollover. Unlike similar-size civilian cargo and tow trucks, which typically have dual rear wheels to reduce sway, the HMMWV has single rear wheels. The independent rear suspension coupled with the body design may preclude &quot;dually&quot; fitment which is the standard for solid-axle trucks of that weight range.

In response to the perceived vulnerability of HMMWVs operating in Iraq, the U.S. Department of Defense contracted [[AM General]] to make the M1114 Uparmored HMMWV. The M1114 has been in limited production since [[1996]] and had seen limited use in the [[Balkans]] before deployment to the [[Middle East]]. This design has a larger, more powerful engine with a [[turbocharger]], [[air conditioning]] and a strengthened [[suspension]] and boasts a fully armored passenger area protected by hardened steel and bullet-proof glass. With the increase in direct attacks and guerilla warfare in Iraq [[AM General]] has diverted the majority of its manufacturing power to producing these vehicles.

In December [[2004]], Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] came under criticism from U.S. soldiers and their families for not providing better equipped HMMWV [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6694474/].  Rumsfeld pointed out that, prior to the war, armor kits were produced only in small numbers per year.  As the role of American forces in Iraq changed from fighting the Iraqi Army to suppressing the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] insurgency, armor kits were being manufactured as fast as additional production facilities could be brought online. Armor aggravates the severe inherent performance limitations of 
a light truck with independent suspension, but it does offer improved protection. Other countries experienced in urban war such as Russia and Israel rely on tracked armored personnel carriers, but the wheeled HMMWV fits current anti-track sentiment among Army senior leadership as exemplified by the Stryker and other wheeled systems.

==Replacement==

The US government is seeking a replacement for the AM General truck, and the U.S. Army's Tank and Automotive Command is currently refereeing a prototype competition.  [[Navistar International]] and [[Lockheed Martin]] are participating, while AM General has not been selected.  The Navistar entry is based on their [[International CXT]] line, and this truck has already been prototyped to replace the HMMWV for non-military use by the U.S. [[Department of Homeland Security]], [[Department of Defense]], and [[Border Patrol]].

Science is a body of verifiable [[empirical knowledge]], a global community of scholars, and a set of techniques for investigating the universe knowntate apparatus who controlled the press. In the end both were surprised to find their expected allies turning against them as invaders.

The [[UN Secretary General]] report dated [[9 December]] [[1991]] (S/23273) explicitly states &quot;Iraq's aggression against Iran&quot; in starting the war and breaching International security and peace. (See also &quot;Who started the Iran-Iraq war?&quot; by R.K. Ramazani, [http://www.student.virginia.edu/~vjil/ ''The Virginia Journal of International Law''] 33, Fall 1992, pp. 69&amp;ndash;89)

==Invasion and repulse==
[[image:Jang.jpg|right|thumb|280px|The eight-year Iran-Iraq war resulted in [[USD]]$350 billion in damage in Iran alone.]] The two nations severed diplomatic relations in June 1980, and sporadic border clashes increased. On [[September 17]], Iraq declared the Shatt al-Arab part of its territory. [[Iraq]] launched a full-scale invasion of [[Iran]] on [[September 22]] [[1980]], claiming as a pretext, an Iranian assassination attempt on [[Foreign Minister]] [[Tariq Aziz]].

The objectives of Iraq's invasion of Iran were:
#Acquisition of the [[Arvand/Shatt al-Arab]] waterway as part of Iraqi territory (Iraq's only port connection to The [[Persian Gulf]]).
#Acquisition of the three islands of [[Abu Musa]] and the [[Greater and Lesser Tunbs]], on the unilateral behalf of the [[UAE]].
#Annexing [[Khuzestan]] (or &quot;Arabistan&quot;) as part of Iraqi territory.

The [[blitzkrieg|surprise offensive]] advanced quickly against the still disorganized [[military of Iran|Iranian forces]], advancing on a wide front into Iranian territory along the [[Mehran]]-[[Khorramabad]] axis in Central Iran and towards Ahvaz in the oil-rich southern province of [[Khuzestan]].

[[Image:Jang2.jpg|right|thumb|Iranian soldiers protecting their territory.]]
Iraq encountered unexpected resistance, however. Rather than turning against the Ayatollah's government as exiles had promised, the people of Iran rallied around their revolution and mounted far stiffer resistance; an estimated 100,000 volunteers arrived at the front by November. An Iraqi Air Force attack on Iranian airfields was ineffective, and the Iraqis soon found the Iranian military was not nearly as depleted as they had thought. In June of [[1982]], a successful Iranian counter-offensive recovered the areas previously lost to Iraq.

Most of the fighting for the rest of the war occurred on Iraqi territory, although some have interpreted the Iraqi withdrawal as a [[tactics|tactical]] ploy by the Iraqi military. By fighting just inside Iraq, Saddām Husayn could rally popular Iraqi patriotism. The Iraqi army could also fight on its own territory and in well- established defensive positions. The Iranians continued to employ unsophisticated human wave attacks, while Iraqi soldiers remained, for the most part, in a defensive posture.

[[image:Saddam7.jpg|thumb|left|Upon invading Iran on [[22 September]] [[1980]], then-Iraqi President Saddām Husayn boasted he would be in [[Tehran]] in 3 days.]]

Iraq offered a cessation of hostilities in [[1982]], but Iran's insistence from July 1982 onward to destroy the Iraqi government prolonged the conflict for another six years of static warfare.

Newly declassified US intelligence (SNIE 34/36.2-82 available at http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB167/) explores a number of documents produced by U.S. agencies over the last thirty years concerning the Iraqi regime's policies and activities directed at maintaining itself in power and eliminating or neutralizing opposition to the regime.

==The Tanker War and U.S. entanglement==
The [[United States]] had been wary of the [[Tehran]] regime since the [[Iranian Revolution]], not least because of the detention of its Tehran [[embassy]] staff in the 1979&amp;ndash;81 [[Iran hostage crisis]]. Starting in 1982 with Iranian success on the battlefield, the U.S. made its backing of Iraq more pronounced, supplying it with intelligence, economic aid, normalizing relations with the government (broken during the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]), and allegedly also supplying weapons [http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/arming_iraq.php].

Starting in 1981, both Iran and Iraq attacked [[oil tanker]]s and merchant ships, including those of neutral nations, in an effort to deprive the opponent of trade. After repeated Iraqi attacks on Iran's main exporting facility on [[Bushehr Province#Kharg Island (Khark Island)|Khark Island]], Iran attacked a Kuwaiti tanker near [[Bahrain]] on [[May 13]] [[1984]], and a [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] tanker in Saudi waters on [[May 16]]. Attacks on ships of noncombatant nations in the Persian Gulf sharply increased thereafter, and this phase of the war was dubbed the &quot;Tanker War.&quot;

[[Lloyd's of London]], a British [[insurance]] [[market]], estimated that the Tanker War damaged 546 commercial vessels and killed about 430 civilian mariners. The largest of attacks were directed by Iran against Kuwaiti vessels, and on [[November 1]] [[1986]], Kuwait formally petitioned foreign powers to protect its shipping. The [[Soviet Union]] agreed to charter tankers starting in [[1987]], and the United States offered to provide protection for tankers [[flag of convenience|flying the U.S. flag]] on [[March 7]] [[1987]] ([[Operation Earnest Will]] and [[Operation Prime Chance]]). Under [[international law]], an attack on such ships would be treated as an attack on the U.S., allowing the U.S. to retaliate militarily. This support would protect ships headed to Iraqi ports, effectively guaranteeing Iraq's revenue stream for the duration of the war.

An Iraqi plane accidentally attacked the ''[[USS Stark (FFG-31)|USS Stark]]'', a [[Oliver Hazard Perry class|''Perry'' class]] [[frigate]] on [[May 17]], killing 37 and injuring 21. But U.S. attention was on isolating Iran; it criticized Iran's mining of international waters, and sponsored [[Wikisource:UN Security Council Resolution 598|UN Security Council Resolution 598]], which passed unanimously on [[July 20]], under which it skirmished with Iranian forces. In [[October]] 1987, the U.S. attacked Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for an Iranian attack on the U.S.-flagged tanker ''Sea Isle City''.

On [[April 14]] [[1988]], the frigate [[USS Samuel B. Roberts (FFG-58)|USS ''Samuel B. Roberts'']] was badly damaged by an Iranian mine. U.S. forces responded with [[Operation Praying Mantis]] on [[April 18]], the [[United States Navy]]'s largest engagement of surface warships since [[World War II]]. Two Iranian ships were destroyed, and an American helicopter was shot down, killing the two pilots.

In the course of these escorts by the U.S. Navy, the cruiser [[USS Vincennes (CG-49)|USS ''Vincennes'']] shot down [[Iran Air Flight 655]] with the loss of all 290 passengers and crew on [[July 3]] [[1988]]. The [[Federal Government of the United States|American government]] claimed that the airliner had been mistaken for an Iranian [[F-14 Tomcat]], and that the Vincennes was operating in international waters at the time and feared that it was under attack. It has since emerged, however, that the Vincennes was in fact in Iranian territorial waters, and that the Iranian passenger jet was turning away and increasing altitude after take-off. The U.S. paid compensation but never apologised.

Through all of this members of the [[Reagan Administration]] had, at the same time, also been secretly selling weapons to Iran; first indirectly (possibly through [[Israel]]) and then directly. It claimed that the administration hoped Iran would, in exchange, persuade several radical groups to release Western hostages. (for details see the [[Iran-Contra Affair]]). The money from the sales was channeled to equip the [[Nicaragua]]n ''contrarrevolucionarios'' (''[[Contras]]''), right-wing rebels.

==&quot;War of the Cities&quot;==
Toward the end of the war, the land conflict regressed into stalemate largely because neither side had enough self-propelled artillery or airpower to support ground advances.

The relatively professional Iraqi armed forces could not make headway against the far more numerous Iranian infantry. But the Iranians were overmatched in towed and self-propelled artillery, which left their tanks and troops vulnerable. What followed was a blood bath with the Iranians substituting infantry for artillery. Both sides turned to more brutal weapons and tactics.

Iraq's air force soon began strategic bombing against Iranian cities, chiefly Tehran, starting in 1985. In response to these, Iran began launching SS-1 &quot;[[Scud]]&quot; missiles against [[Baghdad]]. Iraq did not respond in kind against Tehran until early 1988, able to deploy only air raids against the Iranian capital up until that point. In October 1986, Iraqi aircraft attacked civilian passenger trains and aircraft, including an [[Iran Air]] Boeing 737 airliner unloading passengers at [[Shiraz International Airport]]. 34 elementary and high schools were attacked by Iraqi warplanes in 1986 alone, killing hundreds of children. ''(source: [[IRNA]] archives)''

In retaliation for the successful Iranian ''Karbala-5'' operation in the fronts, during the course of 42 days, Iraq attacked 65 cities in 226 sorties, bombing civilian neighborhoods. Eight Iranian cities came under the attack of Iraqi missiles. Sixty-five children were killed during bombings in an elementary school in [[Borujerd]] alone. These events became known as &quot;the war of the cities&quot;. ''(Source: ibid.)''

The war saw the use of [[chemical weapon]]s, especially [[tabun (nerve gas)|tabun]], by Iraq. International antipathy to the Tehran regime meant Iraq suffered few repercussions despite these attacks. The UN eventually condemned Iraq for using chemical weapons against Iran, after the war. Chemical weapons had not been used in any major war since World War I.

Iraq financed, with foreign assistance, the purchase of more technologically advanced weapons, and built more modern, well-trained armed forces. After setbacks on the battlefield it offered to return to the 1975 border. Iran was internationally isolated and facing rising public discontent. Finally, a cease-fire was agreed to on [[August 20]] [[1988]].

==Arming the combatants==
Iraq's [[military of Iraq|army]] was primarily armed with weaponry it had purchased from the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[satellite state|satellites]] in the preceding decade. During the war, it purchased billions of dollars worth of advanced equipment from the Soviets and the [[France|French]] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3324053.stm], as well as from the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Egypt]], [[Germany]], and other sources (including [[Europe]] and facilities for making and/or enhancing chemical weapons). [[Germany]] [http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,716376,00.html] along with other Western countries (among them [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Spain]](Explosivos Alaveses), [[Italy]] and the [[United States]]) provided Iraq with [[biological weapon|biological]] and [[chemical weapon]]s technology and the precursors to nuclear capabilities. Much of Iraq's financial backing came from other [[Arab]] states, notably oil-rich [[Kuwait]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].

The source of Iraqi arms purchases between 1970 and 1990 (10 % of the world market during this period) are estimated to be:

Iran's foreign supporters included [[Syria]] and [[Libya]], through which it obtained Scuds. It purchased weaponry from [[North Korea]] and the [[People's Republic of China]], notably the [[Silkworm missile|Silkworm antiship missile]]. Iran acquired weapons and parts for its Shah-era U.S. systems through covert arms transactions from officials in the [[Reagan Administration]], first indirectly through [[Israel]] and then directly. It was hoped Iran would, in exchange, persuade several radical groups to release Western hostages, though this did not result; proceeds from the sale were diverted to the [[Nicaragua]]n [[Contras]] in what became known as the [[Iran-Contra Affair]].

===Aircraft===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:iraqi_airforce1.jpg|thumb|right|Iraqi Aircraft attacking Iranian territory.]] --&gt;
During war, Iran operated U.S.-manufactured [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantom]] and [[F-5 Freedom Fighter]] fighters, as well as [[AH-1 Cobra]] attack [[helicopter]]s. It also operated a number of [[F-14 Tomcat]] fighters, which, according to a few sources, proved devastating to the Iraqis in the early phases of the war. However, due to the Iranian government's estrangement, spare parts were difficult to obtain. Despite this the Iranians managed to maintain a constant presence with their Tomcats during the entire conflict, mostly due to a combination of spare parts acquired on the black market and parts made in Iran. These were supported by [[KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135]]s, a [[aerial refueling|refueling tanker]] based on the [[Boeing 707]].[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iran/airforce.htm]

Iraq's air force used Soviet weapons and reflected Soviet training, although it expanded and upgraded its fleet considerably as the war progressed. It conducted strategic bombing using [[Tupolev Tu-16]] Badgers. Its fighters included the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]], later supplemented by large purchases of [[Sukhoi Su-17|Sukhoi Su-22]]s and French [[Dassault Mirage F1]]s. It also deployed the Anglo-French [[Aérospatiale Gazelle]] attack helicopter and the [[Exocet]] antiship missile.[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/airforce.htm]

===U.S.-Iraqi arms transfers in the war===
[[image:Saddam_rumsfeld.jpg|thumb|right|[[Donald Rumsfeld]] meeting Saddām on [[19 December]] – [[20 December]] [[1983]]. Rumsfeld visited again on [[24 March]] [[1984]]; the same day the UN released a report that Iraq had used [[Mustard gas|mustard]] and [[Tabun (nerve gas)|Tabun]] nerve gas against Iranian troops.  The ''NY Times'' reported from Baghdad on [[29 March]] [[1984]], that &quot;American diplomats pronounce themselves satisfied with Iraq and the U.S., and suggest that normal diplomatic ties have been established in all but name.&quot; [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB82/ NSA Archive Source] ]]
Western support for Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war has clearly been established. It is no secret that the [[United States]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[West Germany]], [[France]], many western companies, and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] provided military support and even components of Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction program. The role the United States played in the war against Iran however, although present to some degree, is not as well known.

After the revolution, with the Ayatollahs in power and levels of enmity between Iran and the U.S. running high, early on during the Iran-Iraq war, [[realpolitik]]ers in Washington came to the conclusion that Saddām was the lesser of the two evils, and hence efforts to support Iraq became the order of the day, both during the long war with Iran and afterward. This led to what later became known as the ''Iraq-gate'' scandals.

Much of what Iraq received from the West, however, were not arms per se, but so-called dual-use technology&amp;mdash; mainframe computers, armored ambulances, helicopters, chemicals, and the like, with potential civilian uses as well as military applications. It is now known that a vast network of companies, based in the West, fed Iraq's warring capabilities right up until August 1990, when Saddam invaded Kuwait [http://www.cjr.org/archives.asp?url=/93/2/iraqgate.asp].

The Iraq-gate scandal revealed that an [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] branch of Italy's largest bank, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, relying partially on U.S. taxpayer-guaranteed loans, funneled $5 billion to Iraq from 1985 to 1989. In August 1989, when [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents finally raided the Atlanta branch of BNL, the branch manager, Christopher Drogoul, was charged with making unauthorized, clandestine, and illegal loans to Iraq&amp;mdash;some of which, according to his indictment, were used to purchase arms and weapons technology. 

Beginning in September, 1989, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' laid out the first charges that BNL, relying heavily on U.S. government-guaranteed loans, was funding Iraqi chemical and nuclear weapons work. For the next two and a half years, the ''Financial Times'' provided the only continuous newspaper reportage (over 300 articles) on the subject. Among the companies shipping militarily useful technology to Iraq under the eye of the U.S. government, according to the ''Financial Times'', were [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Tektronix]], and [[Matrix Churchill]], through its [[Ohio]] branch [http://www.cjr.org/archives.asp?url=/93/2/iraqgate.asp].

Even before the [[Persian Gulf War]] started in 1990, the ''Intelligencer Journal'' of Pennsylvania in a string of articles reported: &quot;If U.S. and Iraqi troops engage in combat in the Persian Gulf, weapons technology developed in Lancaster and indirectly sold to Iraq will probably be used against U.S. forces ... And aiding in this ... technology transfer was the Iraqi-owned, British-based precision tooling firm Matrix Churchill, whose U.S. operations in Ohio were recently linked to a sophisticated Iraqi weapons procurement network.&quot; [http://www.cjr.org/archives.asp?url=/93/2/iraqgate.asp]

Aside from the ''New York Times'', the ''Los Angeles Times'', and ABC's Ted Koppel, the Iraq-gate story never picked up much steam, even though The U.S. Congress became involved with the scandal. [http://www.fas.org/spp/starwars/congress/1992/h920519l.htm FAS report]

In December 2002, Iraq's 1,200 page Weapons Declaration revealed a list of Western corporations and countries&amp;mdash;as well as individuals&amp;mdash;that exported chemical and biological materials to Iraq in the past two decades. Many American names were on the list. Alcolac International, for example, a [[Maryland]] company, transported thiodiglycol, a mustard gas precursor, to Iraq. A [[Tennessee]] manufacturer contributed large amounts of a chemical used to make sarin, a nerve gas implicated in so-called (Persian) Gulf War Syndrome. A [http://www.laweekly.com/ink/03/23/news-crogan.php full list] of those companies and their involvements in Iraq [http://www.laweekly.com/ink/03/18/features-crogan1.php] [http://www.laweekly.com/ink/03/18/features-crogan2.php].

On [[25 May]] [[1994]], The [[U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|U.S. Senate Banking Committee]] released a report in which it was stated that ''pathogenic (meaning ''disease producing''), toxigenic (meaning ''poisonous'') and other biological research materials were exported to Iraq, pursuant to application and licensing by the U.S. Department of Commerce.'' It added: ''These exported biological materials were not attenuated or weakened and were capable of reproduction.'' [http://www.gulfwarvets.com/arison/banking.htm]

The report then detailed 70 shipments (including anthrax bacillus) from the United States to Iraqi government agencies over three years, concluding ''It was later learned that these microorganisms exported by the United States were identical to those the UN inspectors found and recovered from the Iraqi biological warfare program.'' See another list [http://cns.miis.edu/research/wmdme/flow/iraq/seed.htm here], and [http://groups.msn.com/exposureofthetruth/biologicalssoldtoiraq.msnw another here].

843 companies has been listed as being involved in the arming of Iraq. [http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/context.jsp?item=us_support_of_iraq_wmd_843] Twenty-four U.S. firms exported arms and materials to Baghdad [http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/arming_iraq.php].

[[Donald W. Riegle, Jr.|Donald Riegle]], Chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Senate committee]] that made the report, said, &quot;''UN inspectors had identified many United States manufactured items that had been exported from the United States to Iraq under licenses issued by the Department of Commerce, and [established] that these items were used to further Iraq's chemical and nuclear weapons development and its missile delivery system development programs.''&quot; He added, &quot;''the executive branch of our government approved '''771''' different export licenses for sale of dual-use technology to Iraq. I think that is a devastating record.''&quot;

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|U.S. Centers for Disease Control]] sent Iraq 14 agents &quot;with biological warfare significance,&quot; including West Nile virus, according to Riegle's investigators [http://www.sptimes.com/2003/03/16/Perspective/How_Iraq_built_its_we.shtml] [http://www.tallahassee.com/mld/tallahassee/news/politics/4186725.htm].

The [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], a [[Jewish]] organization dedicated to preserving the memory of [[the Holocaust]], released a list of U.S. companies and their exports to Iraq.

==Weapons of Mass Destruction==
[[Image:Iran-iraq-war-gas-masks.JPG|right|thumb|Iran suffered heavy casualties from Saddām's chemical weapons.]]With more than 100,000 Iranian victims{{ref|1}} of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons during the eight-year war, [[Iran]] is, after Japan, one of the world's top afflicted countries by [[Weapons of Mass Destruction]].

The official estimate does not include the civilian population contaminated in bordering towns or the children and relatives of veterans, many of whom have developed blood, lung and skin complications, according to the Organization for Veterans of Iran.

Nerve gas agents killed about 20,000 Iranian soldiers immediately, according to official reports. Of the 90,000 survivors, some 5,000 seek medical treatment regularly and about 1,000 are still hospitalized with severe, chronic conditions. Many others were hit by mustard gas.

Furthermore, 308 Iraqi missiles were launched at population centers inside Iranian cities between 1980 and 1988 resulting in 12,931 casualties.{{ref|1}}

There is great resentment in Iran that the international community helped Iraq develop its chemical weapons arsenal and armed forces, and also that the world did nothing to punish Iraq for its use of chemical weapons against Iran throughout the war &amp;mdash; particularly since the US and other western powers later felt obliged to oppose the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and eventually invade Iraq itself to remove Hussein.

==Human Wave Attacks in the Iran-Iraq War==
Many people claim that the Iran-Iraq conflict spawned a particularly gruesome variant of the &quot;human wave&quot; attack. The Iranian clergy, with no professional military training, were slow to adopt and apply professional military doctrine. The country at that time lacked sufficient equipment to breach Iraqi minefields and were not willing to risk their small tank force. Therefore, [[Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps|Pasdaran]] forces and [[Basij]] volunteers were often used to sweep over minefields and entrenched positions developed by the more professional Iraqi military. Allegedly, unarmed human wave tactics involving children as young as 9 were employed. One unnamed East European journalist claims to have seen &quot;tens of thousands of children, roped together in groups of about 20 to prevent the faint-hearted from deserting, make such an attack.&quot;[http://countrystudies.us/iraq/104.htm]

There has been a suggestion that girls were more commonly used for frontline mine clearance, and boys for unarmed &quot;assaults.&quot; Reliable firsthand accounts of the use of children in human wave attacks are rare, however. The most serious contemporary firsthand account recently surfaced at the end of an article[http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20041104.html] by the technology journalist [[Robert X. Cringely]], who relates the experience of a trip to the front for an unconnected ''[[Penthouse magazine|Penthouse]]'' magazine assignment. In recent years, however, Cringely's credibility has been questioned, after the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' and [[Stanford University]] revealed in 1998 that Cringely falsely claimed to hold a Ph.D. from Stanford University. Cringely also falsely claimed to be a former Stanford professor. ''[http://daily.stanford.org/Daily98-99/11-11-1998/news/tempo?page=content&amp;id=4462&amp;repository=0001_article (The Stanford Daily, [[11 November]] [[1998]])]''

==Aftermath== 
&lt;!--Image of unknown copyright status removed. [[Image:Iraqibaghdadi.jpg|frame|The [[Hands of Victory]] triumphal arch in Baghdad has 5000 helmets of killed Iranian soldiers piled at the base of the swords, and alludes to the [[Islamic conquest of Iran]] where the [[Persian empire]] fell to invading Arab forces.]]--&gt;
The war was disastrous for both countries, stalling economic development and disrupting oil exports. It cost Iran an estimated 1.5 million casualties (1, p. 206), and $350 billion (1, p. 1). [[Iraq]] was left with serious debts to its former [[Arab]] backers, including US$14 billion loaned by [[Kuwait]], a debt which contributed to [[Saddam Hussein|Saddām's]] [[1990]] decision to [[Persian Gulf War|invade]].

Much of both sides' oil industry was damaged in [[air raid]]s.	

The war left the [[border]]s unchanged. Two years later, as war with the western powers loomed, Saddām recognized Iranian rights over the eastern half of the [[Shatt al-Arab|Shatt al-`Arab]], a reversion to the status quo ante bellum that he had repudiated a decade earlier.

The war was extremely costly, one of the deadliest wars since the [[Second World War]]. (Conflicts since [[1945]] which have surpassed the Iran-Iraq War in terms of casualties include the [[Vietnam War]], [[Korean War]], the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]], and the [[Second Congo War|war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]).  Many of the prisoners taken by both sides weren't released until up to 10 years after the conflict was over.

==Final ruling==
[[Image:Shohada hoveizeh.JPG|thumb|right|An Iranian mother mourns the loss of her son in a war cemetery in [[Hoveizeh]].]]
On [[9 December]] [[1991]], the UN Secretary-General reported the following to the UN Security Council:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That Iraq's explanations do not appear sufficient or acceptable to the international community is a fact. Accordingly, the outstanding event under the violations referred to is the attack of [[22 September]] [[1980]], against Iran, which cannot be justified under the charter of the United Nations, any recognized rules and principles of international law or any principles of international morality and entails the responsibility for the conflict.

&lt;p&gt;Even if before the outbreak of the conflict there had been some encroachment by Iran on Iraqi territory, such encroachment did not justify Iraq's aggression against Iran&amp;mdash;which was followed by Iraq's continuous occupation of Iranian territory during the conflict&amp;mdash;in violation of the prohibition of the use of force, which is regarded as one of the rules of jus cogens.

&lt;p&gt;On one occasion I had to note with deep regret the experts' conclusion that &quot;chemical weapons ha[d] been used against Iranian civilians in an area adjacent to an urban centre lacking any protection against that kind of attack&quot; (s/20134, annex). The Council expressed its dismay on the matter and its condemnation in resolution 620 (1988), adopted on [[26 August]] [[1988]].

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Isambard Kingdom Brunel''' ([[April 9]], [[1806]] &amp;ndash; [[September 15]], [[1859]]), [[Royal Society|FRS]] was a [[British]] [[engineer]]. Voted the second greatest Briton of all time in a [[2002]] [[BBC]] poll (after [[Winston Churchill]]),&lt;ref&gt;BBC News [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2509465.stm Churchill voted greatest Briton] Retrieved Feb. 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; he is best known for the creation of the [[Great Western Railway]], a series of famous [[steamship]]s, and numerous important [[bridge]]s. Though his projects were not always successful, they often contained innovative solutions to long-standing engineering problems.  During his short career, Brunel achieved many engineering &quot;firsts&quot;, including the building of the first [[tunnel]] under a [[navigable river]] and development of the first [[propeller]]-driven steamship, which was at the time also the largest ship ever built.&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, Rob. ''The Rough Guide To London'', Rough Guides, 2003. ISBN 1843530937&lt;/ref&gt;.

Brunel was a heavy [[cigar]] smoker and suffered several years of ill health with [[kidney]] problems, before succumbing to a [[stroke]] at the age of fifty-three.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, John. ''Troubled It Projects: Prevention and Turnaround'', IEE, 2001. ISBN 0852961049&lt;/ref&gt;

A major programme of events celebrating the life and work of Brunel is planned for the bicentenary of his birth under the name ''Brunel 200''.&lt;ref&gt;Brunel 200 [http://www.brunel200.com Brunel 200 website] Retrieved Feb. 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Brunel is also to be featured on the reverse side of the [[British two pound coin|£2 coin]] in the UK to commemorate the same anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;British Royal Mint [http://www.royalmint.com/RoyalMint/web/site/PackedSets/UKIB2BP.asp?pg=1&amp;orderby=release 2006 Brunel £2 Two-Coin] Retrieved Feb. 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Life==
The son of noted engineer [[Sir]] [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] and Sophia Brunel ''née'' Kingdom, Isambard K. Brunel was born in [[Portsmouth]], [[England]], on [[April 9]], [[1806]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunel University [http://www.brunel.ac.uk/about/history/ikb History : Isambard Kingdom Brunel] Retrieved Feb. 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was working there on the block-making machinery for the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]].  At 14 the young Brunel was sent to [[France]] to be educated at the the [[Lycée Henri-Quatre]] in [[Paris]] and later, the [[University of Caen]] in [[Normandy]].&lt;ref name=3ships&gt;Dumpleton. ''Brunel's Three Ships'', Intellect Books, 2002. ISBN 1841508004&lt;/ref&gt;

Isambard rose to prominence when, aged 20, he was appointed as the chief engineer of his father's greatest achievement, the [[Thames Tunnel]], which runs beneath the river between [[Rotherhithe]] and [[Wapping]]. The first major sub-river tunnel ever built, it succeeded where other attempts had failed thanks to Marc Brunel's ingenious [[tunnelling shield]] – the human-powered forerunner of today's mighty tunnelling machines – which protected workers from cave-in by placing them within a protective casing.  Marc Brunel had been inspired to create the shield after observing the habits and anatomy of the [[shipworm]] (''Teredo navalis'').  Most modern tunnels are cut in this way, notably the [[Channel Tunnel]] between England and France.&lt;ref&gt;West, Graham. ''Innovation and the Rise of the Tunnelling Industry'', Cambridge University Press, 1988. ISBN 0521335124&lt;/ref&gt;

Brunel established his Design Offices at 17-18 Duke Street, London, and he lived with his family in the rooms above.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, Felix; Mendelssohn, Cecille; Ward, Jones. ''The 1837 Diary of Felix and Cecille Mendelssohn Bartholdy'', Oxford University Press, 1997. ISBN 0198165978&lt;/ref&gt; [[R.P. Brereton]], who became his chief assistant in 1845, was in charge of the office in Brunel's absence, and also took direct responsibility for major construction activities such as the Royal Albert Bridge as Brunel's health declined.

==The Thames Tunnel==
[[Image:ThamesTunnelFromWapping.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Thames Tunnel]] in 2005, now part of the [[London Underground]] [[East London Line]] between [[Rotherhithe]] and [[Wapping]].]]
{{main|Thames Tunnel|the Thames Tunnel}}
Isambard worked for nearly two years to create a tunnel under [[London|London's]] [[River Thames]], with operatives driving a horizontal shaft from one side of the river to the other under the most difficult and dangerous conditions. Brunel's father, Marc, was the chief engineer, and the project was funded by the Thames Tunnel Company.  The composition of the Thames river bed at Rotherhithe was often little more than waterlogged sediment and loose gravel, and although the extreme conditions proved the ingenuity of Brunel's tunnelling machine, the work was hard and hazardous. &lt;ref&gt;Aaseng, Nathan. ''Construction : Building The Impossible'', The Oliver Press, Inc., 1999. ISBN 1881508595&lt;/ref&gt;

The tunnel was often in imminent danger of collapse due to the instability of the river bed, yet the management decided to allow spectators to be lowered down to observe the diggings at a [[shilling]] a time.  For the workers the building of the tunnel was particularly unpleasant because the Thames at that time was still little better than an open sewer, so the tunnel was usually awash with foul-smelling, contaminated water. Further complications occurred because the [[superstition|superstitious]] Irish [[navvies]] would frequently extinguish the lights if they feared that a breach was going to occur, believing thatspace="preserve">[[Image:minuteman3launch.jpg|framed|A [[Minuteman III]] missile soars after a test launch.]]
An '''intercontinental ballistic missile''', or '''ICBM''', is a very-long-range (greater than 5,500 km or 3,500 miles) [[ballistic missile]] typically designed for [[nuclear weapons delivery]], i.e., delivering one or more [[nuclear weapon|nuclear warheads]]. It uses a [[Ballistics|ballistic]] [[trajectory]] involving a significant ascent and descent, including [[sub-orbital flight]]. ICBMs are differentiated by maximum range from other [[ballistic missile]]s: [[intermediate-range ballistic missile]]s (IRBMs), short-range ballistic missiles, and the newly named theater ballistic missiles. One particular weapon developed by the Soviet Union ([[FOBS]]) had a partial [[orbit|orbital]] trajectory, and unlike most ICBMs its target could not be deduced from its orbital flight path. It was decommissioned in compliance with arms control agreements, which address the maximum range of ICBMs and prohibit orbital or fractional-orbital weapons.  The following nations currently have operational ICBM systems: [[Russia]], the [[United States]], [[France]] [http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/nudb/datab16.asp], the [[UK]], and [[People's Republic of China|China]]. [[Pakistan]] has IRBMs but its ICBMs are under Research and Development see [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction#Missiles|Pakistan's ballistic missiles]]. 
[[India]] has IRBMs but is developing ICBMs, see [[India and weapons of mass destruction#Missiles|ballistic missiles of India]]. 

In [[2002]], the United States and Russia agreed in the [[SORT]] treaty to reduce their deployed stockpiles to not more than 2,200 warheads each.

== Flight phases ==
The following flight phases can be distinguished:
*boost phase - 3 to 4 minutes (for a [[solid rocket]] shorter than for a [[Liquid rocket propellants|liquid-propellant rocket]]); altitude at the end of this phase is 150 -200 km, typical burn-out speed is 7 km/s
*midcourse phase - ca. 25 minutes - [[suborbital flight]] in an [[elliptic orbit]], i.e. the orbit is part of an [[ellipse]] with vertical major axis; the [[apogee]] (halfway the midcourse phase) is at an altitude of typically ca. 1200 km; the [[semi-major axis]] is between one half of the radius of the Earth and the radius; the projection of the orbit on the Earth's surface is a [[great circle]] - the missile may release several independent warheads, and penetration aids such as metallic-coated balloons, aluminum [[Chaff (radar countermeasure)|chaff]], and full-scale warhead [[decoy]]s
*[[reentry]] phase (starting at an altitude of 100 km) - 2 minutes - impact is at a speed of up to 4 km/s (for early ICBMs less than 1 km/s).

See also [[Missile Defense Agency]], [[countermeasure]].

== History ==
The [[progenitor]] of the ICBM was the German A9/10, which was never developed but only proposed by [[Wernher von Braun]]. The [[progenitor]] of the IRBM was the German [[V-2 rocket|V2]] (Vergeltung, or &quot;vengeance&quot;) rocket designed by von Braun that used liquid propellant and an inertial guidance system.  It was launched from a mobile launcher in order to make it less susceptible to Allied air attacks. Following World War 2 von Braun and his lead scientist went to work directly for the US Army through [[Operation Paperclip]] developing the V2 into the [[Redstone]] [[IRBM]] and [[Jupiter IRBM]]. Due to treaty agreements the US was able to base these IRBMs in countries close to the [[USSR]] within strategic range. The USSR had no similar territory in the 1950s so under the direction of [[Sergei Korolev]] a crash programme to develop an ICBM began which at one stage consumed 5% of the entire Soviet military budget. Korolev was given access to captured V2 materials but evolved a distinct design, the [[R-7 rocket|R-7]], that was declared 'operational' in 1957. Competition between the US armed services meant that each force developed its own ICBM programme, slowing progress. The US's first ICBM was the [[Atlas (rocket)|Atlas]], operational in 1959. Both the R7 and Atlas required a large launch facility making them vulnerable to attack and could not be kept in a ready state. Early ICBMs formed the basis of many space launch systems. Examples include: [[Atlas (rocket)|Atlas]], [[Redstone rocket]], [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]], [[R-7 rocket|R-7]], and [[Proton (rocket)|Proton]], which was derived from the earlier ICBMs but never deployed as an ICBM. The [[UK]] built its own ICBM [[Black Knight (rocket)|Black Knight]] but it was never made operational due to the difficulty of finding a launch site away from population centers. Under the direction of [[Robert McNamara]] the US initiated the [[LGM-30 Minuteman]], [[Polaris ballistic missile|Polaris]] and [[Skybolt]] solid fuel ICBMs. Modern ICBMs tend to be smaller than their ancestors (due to increased accuracy and smaller and lighter warheads) and use solid fuels, making them less useful as orbital launch vehicles. Deployment of these systems was governed by the strategic theory of [[Mutually Assured Destruction]].

In the 1970s development began of [[Anti-ballistic missile|Anti-Ballistic Missile]] Systems by both the US and USSR but these were restricted by treaty in order to preserve the value of the existing ICBM systems. President [[Ronald Reagan]] launched the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] as well as the [[MX]] and [[Midgetman]] ICBM programmes. This led to the agreement of a series of [[Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty]] negotiations. 

Countries in the early stages of developing ICBMs have all used liquid propellants for simplicity's sake.

== Modern ICBMs ==
Modern ICBMs typically carry [[multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle]]s (''MIRVs''), each of which carries a separate [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] warhead, allowing a single missile to hit multiple targets.  MIRV was an outgrowth of the rapidly shrinking size and weight of modern warheads and the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaties which imposed limitations on the number of launch vehicles ([[SALT I]] and [[SALT II]]). It has also proved to be an &quot;easy answer&quot; to proposed deployments of [[Anti-ballistic missile|ABM]] systems &amp;ndash; it is far less expensive to add more warheads to an existing missile system than to build an ABM system capable of shooting down the additional warheads; hence, most ABM system proposals have been judged to be impractical.  The only operational ABM systems were deployed in the 1970s, the US Safeguard ABM facility was located in North Dakota and was operational from 1975-1976.  The USSR deployed its Galosh ABM system around Moscow in the 1970s, which remains in service.  

ICBMs can be deployed from multiple platforms:
*in [[missile silo]]s, which offer some protection from military attack (including, the designers hope, some protection from a nuclear first strike)
*on [[submarine]]s: [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s (SLBMs); most or all SLBMs have the long range of ICBMs (as opposed to IRBMs) 
*on heavy trucks; this applies to one version of the [[RT-2UTTH Topol M]] which may be deployed from a self-propelled [[Mobile launcher vehicle|mobile launcher]], capable of moving through roadless terrain, and launching a missile from any point along its route
*mobile launchers on rails; this applies, for example, to РТ-23УТТХ &quot;Молодец&quot; ([[RT-23 Molodets|RT-23UTTH &quot;Molodets&quot;]] -- SS-24 &quot;Sсаlреl&quot;)  
The last three kinds are mobile and therefore hard to find.

During storage, one of the most important features of the missile is its serviceability.  One of the key features of the first [[embedded system|computer-controlled]] ICBM, the [[Minuteman missile]] was that it could quickly and easily use its computer to test itself.

In flight, a booster pushes the warhead and then falls away.  Most modern boosters are [[solid rocket|solid-fueled rocket motor]]s, which can be stored easily for long periods of time.  Early missiles used [[liquid rocket|liquid-fueled rocket motor]]s.  Liquid-fueled ICBMs were generally not kept fueled all the time, and therefore fueling the rocket was necessary before a launch.  This annoying procedure was a source of significant operational delay, and therefore might cause the rockets to be destroyed before they could be used.  It also provided opponents with intelligence because it was a definite observable event that indicated the start of an attack.

Once the booster falls away, the warhead falls on an unpowered path much like an orbit, except that it hits the earth at some point.  Moving in this way is stealthy.  No rocket gases or other emissions occur to indicate the missile's position to defenders.  Also, it is the fastest way to get from one part of the Earth to another.  This increases the element of surprise.  The high speed of a ballistic warhead (near 5 miles per second) also make it difficult to intercept.

Many authorities say that missiles also release aluminized balloons, electronic noisemakers, and other items intended to confuse interception devices and radars.

The high speed can cause the missile to get very hot as it reenters the atmosphere.  Ballistic warheads are protected by heatshields constructed of materials such as [[pyrolytic graphite]], and in early missiles, thick [[plywood]].  Plywood approaches the strength per weight of carbon fiber/epoxy composites and chars slowly, protecting the missile.

Accuracy is crucial, because doubling the accuracy decreases the needed warhead energy by a factor of four.  Accuracy is limited by the accuracy of the navigation system and the available geophysical information.  Many authorities believe that most government-supported geophysical mapping initiatives such as [[GPS]], and ocean satellite altitude systems such as [[Seasat]], probably have a covert purpose to map mass concentrations and determine local gravitic anomalies, in order to improve accuracies of ballistic missiles.

Strategic missile systems are thought to use custom [[integrated circuit]]s designed to calculate [[navigation]]al [[differential equation]]s thousands to millions of times per second in order to reduce navigational errors caused by calculation alone.  These circuits are usually a network of binary addition circuits that continually recalculate the missile's position.  The inputs to the navigation circuit are set by a general purpose computer according to a navigational input schedule loaded into the missile before launch.

Low-flying guided [[cruise missile]]s are an alternative to [[ballistic missile]]s.

== Specific missiles ==
=== Land-based ICBMs and cruise missiles ===
The US Air Force currently operates just over 500 ICBMs at around 15 missile complexes located primarily in the northern Rocky Mountain states and the Dakotas. These are of the [[LGM-30 Minuteman]] III and [[Peacekeeper missile|Peacekeeper]] ICBM variants. Peacekeeper missiles were phased out in 2005[http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123011845]. All USAF [[Minuteman II]] missiles have been destroyed in accordance to START, and their launch silos have been sealed or sold to the public. To comply with the [[START II]] most US multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles, or [[MIRV]]s, have been eliminated and replaced with single warhead missiles. However, since the abandonment of the START II treaty, the U.S. is said to be considering retaining 800 warheads on 500 missiles.[http://www.thebulletin.org/issues/nukenotes/mj04nukenote.html]

The United States Air Force awards two badges for performing duty in a nuclear missile silo.  The [[Missile Badge]] is presented to commissioned officers while the [[Space and Missile Badge|Space and Missile Pin]] is awarded to silo ground and support personnel.

=== Sea-based ICBMs ===
[[Image:Trident missile image.jpg|thumb|Trident launch at sea from a Royal Navy submarine.]]
*The [[US Navy]] currently has 14 [[Ohio class submarine|''Ohio''-class]] [[SSBN]]s deployed. Each submarine is equipped with a complement of 24 Trident missiles, eight with [[Trident I]] missiles, and ten with [[Trident II]] missiles (336 missiles total).

*The [[French Navy]] constantly maintains at least four active units, relying on two classes of nuclear-powered ballistic submarines ([[SSBN]]): the older [[Redoutable class submarine|''Redoutable'' class]], which are being progressively decommissioned, and the newer [[Triomphant class submarine|''Triomphant'' class]].  These carry 16 [[M45 SLBM|M45]] missiles with TN75 warheads, and are scheduled to be upgraded to [[M51 SLBM|M51]] nuclear missile around 2010.

*The UK's [[Royal Navy]] has four [[Vanguard class submarine]]s, each armed with 16 Trident II SLBMs.

*[[China]]'s [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] has one [[Xia class submarine]] with 12 single-warhead JL-1 [[SLBM]]s. The PLAN is also developing the new Type 094 [[SSBN]] that will have up to 16 [[JL-2]] SLBMs (possibly [[MIRV]]), which are also in development.

'''Irish traditional music sessions''' are informal gatherings at which people play [[Irish traditional music]]. The general session scheme is that someone starts a tune, and those who know it join in. Good session etiquette requires not playing if one does not know the tune, and waiting until a tune one knows comes along.  

Typically, the first tune is followed by another two or three tunes in a ''set''.  The art of putting together a set is hard to put into words, but the tunes must flow from one to another in terms of key and melodic structure, without being so similar as to all sound the same.  The tunes of a set will usually all be of the same sort, i.e. all jigs or all reels, although on rare occasions and amongst a more skilled group of players a complementary tune of a different sort will be included, such as a slip jig (9/8) amongst the jigs (6/8).  Although bands sometimes arrange sets of reels and jigs together, this is all but unheard of in an Irish session context.  

Some sets are specific to a locale, or even to a single session, whilst others, like the &quot;Coleman set&quot; of reels (&quot;The Tarboulton&quot;/&quot;The Longford Collector&quot;/The Sailor's Bonnet&quot;), represent longstanding combinations that have been played together for decades.  Sets are sometimes thrown together ''ad hoc'', which sometimes works brilliantly and sometimes fails on the spot.

After the set ends, someone will usually starts another.  Most often there are more-or-less recognized session leaders; sometimes there are no leaders.  At times a song will be sung or a slow air played by a single musican between sets.

Sessions are often held in [[pub]]s (with the hope that listeners will buy drink for the musicians) and everyone who is able to play Irish music is welcome, within limits; this can be problematic when non-Irish musicians encounter a session and imagine that they may &quot;jam&quot; without knowing a single tune or even having a clear idea of what traditional music is, or when some over-enthusiastic neophyte shows up with a bodhrán, guitar, pair of spoons, or some other instrument chosen because &quot;it's easy to play.&quot;  A pub owner might have one or two musicians paid to come regularly in order for the session to have a base.  Sunday afternoons and weekday nights (especially Tuesday and Wednesday) are common times for sessions to be scheduled, on the theory that these are the least likely times for dances and concerts to be held, and therefore the times that professional musicians will be most able to show.

Sessions can be held in homes or at various public places in addition to pubs; often at a festival sessions will be got together in the beer tent or in the vendor's booth of a music-loving craftsman or dealer.  When a particularly large musical event &quot;takes over&quot; an entire village, spontaneous sessions may erupt on the street corners.  

The objective in a session is not to provide music for an audience of passive listeners; although the ''punters'' (non-playing attendees) often come for the express purpose of listening, the music is most of all for the musicians themselves.  This is why, as a general rule, requesting a particular song or tune of the players is considered rude (quite aside from the fact that most Irish traditional musicians have never learnt &quot;Misty&quot; or &quot;Free Bird&quot;).  The session is an experience that's shared, not a performance that's bought and sold.

In his &quot;Field Guide to the Irish Music Session,&quot; Barry Foy defines a session as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''...a gathering of Irish traditional musicians for the purpose of celebrating their common interest in the music by playing it together in a relaxed, informal setting, while in the process generally beefing up the mystical cultural mantra that hums along uninterruptedly beneath all manifestations of Irishness worldwide.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The sessions are a key aspect of traditional music; some say it is the main sphere in which the music is formulated and innovated. Further, the sessions enable young musicians to practice in a group. 

Socially, sessions (Seisiún in Gaelic) have often been compared to an evening of playing card games, where the conversation and cameraderie are an essential component. In many rural communities in Ireland, sessions are an integral part of community life. 

Sessions are an excellent way to witness the real, amorphous identity of Irish traditional tunes.

'''Insects''' are [[invertebrate]] [[animal]]s of the Class '''Insecta''', the largest and (on land) most widely-distributed [[taxon]] within the [[Phylum]] [[Arthropod]]a. Insects comprise the most diverse group of animals on the earth, with around 925,000 [[species]] described&amp;mdash;more than all other animal groups combined: &quot;Indeed, in no one of her works has Nature more fully displayed her exhaustless ingenuity,&quot; [[Pliny's Natural History|Pliny the Elder]] exclaimed. Insects may be found in nearly all environments on the planet, although only a small number of species have adapted to life in the [[ocean]]s where [[crustacea]]dries.  Traditionally, infantry have suffered large casualty rates from disease, exposure, and privation--often in excess of those suffered from enemy attacks.  Better equipment of troops in this area greatly reduce this rate of loss.  One of the most valuable pieces of gear is the [[entrenching tool]]--basically a small shovel--which can be employed not only to dig important defenses, but also in a variety of other daily tasks and even as an effective weapon.

Specialized equipment consists of a variety of gear which may or may not be carried depending on the mission and the level of equipment of an army.  Communications gear has become a necessity, as it allows effective command of infantry units over greater distances.  In some units, individual communications are being used to allow the greatest level of flexibility.  Engineering equipment, including demolitions, mines, and other gear, is also commonly carried by the infantry or attached specialists.  A variety of other gear, often relating to a specific mission, or to the particular terrain in which the unit is employed, can be carried by infantry units.

There are some general rules to which all infantry equipment must adhere to be effective and widely adopted:

* Reliability:  Equipment failure is fatal to the infantry, and if equipped with unreliable gear, morale will suffer greatly.  Soldiers tend to prefer reliable proven technology to new, unproven gadgets.  Additionally, the conditions in which infantry operate are often extreme and gear must be able to survive and operate in these condition without fail.
* Utility:  Infantry have very limited weight capacity, and thus gear which doesn't help them do their job will be discarded.
* Availability:  Since infantry units are often large, and must be able to be raised in quantity, a particular tool must be available in sufficient quantity to equip the units.  This means that it must be inexpensive enough to afford in quantity during peacetime, and producible enough to meet wartime demands.
* Simplicity:  Infantry relies on large numbers of troops, often conscripted and therefore of lesser quality than those available to other branches.  An army must be able to train its troops uniformly in minimal time on the tools of the trade.  Overly complex gear will often be useless in combat due to a lack of training or the difficulty of maintenance under field conditions.

== Quotations ==
* &quot;I love the infantry because they are the underdogs.  They are the mud-rain-frost-and-wind boys. They have no comforts, and they even learn to live without the necessities. And in the end they are the guys that wars can't be won without.&quot; [[Ernie Pyle]]
*&quot;I'm convinced that the infantry is the group in the army which gives more and gets less than anybody else.&quot; [[Bill Mauldin]], ''Up Front'' (1945)
*&quot;Infantry is the Queen of Battle.&quot; - slogan of the [[United States Army]]
*&quot;The Air Force and Navy, no matter what they say, are and have always been, delegated to a support position. Bombers can't capture a city. Battleships can't knock out a tank 50 miles inland. These jobs are, and have always been, the role of the common grunt, the leatherneck, the infantryman.&quot; - [[Stephen Ambrose]]
*&quot;But never think that war, no matter how necessary, nor how justified, is not a crime. Ask the infantry and ask the dead.&quot; [[Ernest Hemingway]]
*&quot;To seek out and close with the enemy; to kill or capture him; to seize and hold ground; to repel attack, by day or night, regardless of season, weather or terrain&quot; - The stated role of the Royal Australian Infantry Corps, an Arms Corps of the [[Australian Army]].
*&quot;The infantry doesn't change. We're the only arm of the military where the weapon is the man himself.&quot; [[C.T. Shortis]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], an '''identity function''', also called '''identity map''' or '''identity transformation''', is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] which does not have any effect: it always returns the same value that was used as its argument. In other words, the identity function is the function ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''.

==Definition==
Formally, if ''M'' is a [[set]], the identity function ''f'' on ''M'' is defined to be that function with [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] and [[codomain]] ''M'' which satisfies
:''f''(''x'') = ''x'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;for all elements ''x'' in ''M''.

The identity function ''f'' on ''M'' is often denoted by id&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; or 1&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Algebraic property==
If ''f'' : ''M''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''N'' is any function, then we have ''f'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; id&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f'' = id&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''f'' (where &quot;&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt;&quot; denotes [[function composition]]). In particular, id&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[identity element]] of the [[monoid]] of all functions from ''M'' to ''M''.

Since the identity element of a monoid is [[unique]], one can alternately define the identity function on ''M'' to be this identity element. Such a definition generalizes to the concept of an [[identity morphism]] in [[category theory]], where the [[endomorphism]]s of ''M'' need not be functions.

==Examples==
*The identity function on the positive [[integer]]s is a [[completely multiplicative function]] (essentially multiplication by 1), considered in [[number theory]]. 
*In an ''n''-dimensional [[vector space]] the identity function is represented by the [[identity matrix]] ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, regardless of the [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]].
*In a [[metric space]] the identity is trivially an [[isometry]]. An object without any [[symmetry]] has as [[symmetry group]] the trivial group only containing this isometry (symmetry type ''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image: Intel_i386.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An Intel 80386 Microprocessor.]]

The '''Intel 80386''' is a [[microprocessor]] which was used as the [[central processing unit|central processing unit (CPU)]] of many [[personal computer]]s from [[1986]] until [[1994]] and later.  During its design phase the processor was code-named simply &quot;P3&quot;, the third-generation processor in the [[x86]] line, but was and is frequently referred to as the '''i386'''.  Designed and manufactured by [[Intel]], the i386 processor was [[tape-out|taped-out]] in October of 1985.  Intel decided against producing the chip before then, as the cost of production would have been uneconomic.  Full-function chips were first delivered to customers in 1986. [[Motherboard]]s for 386-based computer systems were highly elaborate and expensive to produce, but were rationalised upon the 386's mainstream adoption.

The processor was a significant evolution in a long line of processors that stretched back to the [[Intel 8008]].  The predecessor of the 80386 was the [[Intel 80286]], a [[16-bit]] processor with a [[memory segment|segment]]-based memory management and protection system.  The 80386 added a [[32-bit]] architecture and a [[paging]] translation unit, which made it much easier to implement operating systems
which used [[virtual memory]].

The 80386 featured three operating modes: '''real''' mode, '''protected''' mode and '''virtual''' mode. In the real mode, the 80386 (like the 80286) would run just as a fast 80186. The protected mode allowed the use of all the possibilities of the 286 and the protected mode extension of the 386, especially addressing up to 4 GB of memory. Finally, the virtual 8086(or ''V86'') mode made it possible to run one or more virtual 8086 machines in a protected environment.   &lt;!--, such as [[UNIX]]. or OS/2, W2K.. --&gt;
[[Image:80386DX_arch.png|300px|thumb|The 386DX architecture.]]

Though Intel would shortly introduce the [[Intel 80486|80486]] and eventually the [[Intel Pentium]] line of processors, the support in the 386 for the 32-bit [[flat memory]] model would be arguably the most important feature change until the release of  [[EM64T]] in [[2004]]. (Other microprocessor architectures, such as the [[Motorola 68000]], had long since supported a &quot;flat&quot; 32-bit addressing model.)  Most applications running on current Intel-based personal computers will still run on the older 80386, albeit very slowly; there were relatively few instructions added to the main instruction set in later generations, and in most cases their usage can be avoided.  Building a program for the [[80286]] was often much harder.

Early 80386s had a bug in the 32-bit multiply instruction which would leave the high word in the result undefined. Once discovered, such processors were stamped '16-bit SW only'. This bug was checked for by programs such as [[Microsoft Windows]] which would issue a warning message.

Late in the 80386's production run, Intel introduced the 80386SX, which was meant to be a low cost version of the 386 line. The SX series of chips was 32-bit internally, but had a 16-bit external bus (in much the same way that the [[8088]] in the original IBM PC was a lower cost version of the [[8086]]) and so no 32-bit physical address space extension.  The original 80386 was subsequently renamed the 80386DX to avoid confusion.  Neither CPU included a math [[coprocessor]] (most motherboards included a socket for an [[Intel 80387|80387]]), though the naming would cause some head-scratching later when the 80486 came in a DX variant that did include [[floating-point]] capability (which was physically present but disabled in early 486SXs).

The 386SL was introduced as an alternative processor for [[laptop computer]]s. The processor offered several power management options (e.g. [[System Management Mode|SMM]]), as well as different &quot;sleep&quot; modes to conserve [[battery (electricity)|battery]] power. It also contained support for an external [[cache]] of 16 to 64 KB. The extra functions caused this variant to have over 3 times as many [[transistor]]s as the 386DX. The 386SL was only available in one clock speed, 25 MHz. [http://www.informit.com/articles/article.asp?p=130978&amp;seqNum=27&amp;rl=1]

An embedded version of the chip, the [[Intel 80386EX|386EX]], was produced later, and was successfully used in space applications.
[[Image:Am386DX40.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The AMD Am386DX-40]]

Because of the high degree of compatibility, the range of processors compatible with the 80386 is often collectively termed the ''i386 architecture''; the instruction set for the architecture is now known as [[IA-32]] or, informally, ''i386''.

From a business perspective, the i386 was significant because it was the first significant microprocessor to be [[single-sourced]] &amp;ndash; it was available only from Intel Corp.  Prior to this, the difficulty of making chips and the uncertainty of reliable supply required that any mass-market semiconductor be [[multi-sourced]], that is, made by two or more manufacturers, the second and subsequent ones manufacturing under license from the designer.  Single-sourcing the i386 allowed Intel greater control over its development and substantially greater profits in later years.  However, [[AMD]] introduced its compatible [[Am386]] processor in March 1991 after overcoming legal obstacles, thus breaking Intel's monopoly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[computing]], an '''instruction register''' is the part of a [[Central processing unit|CPU]]'s [[control unit]] that stores the instruction currently being executed.  In simple processors each instruction to be executed is loaded into the instruction register which holds it while it is decoded, prepared and ultimately executed, which can take several steps.  More complicated processors use a [[instruction pipeline|pipeline of instruction registers]] where each stage of the pipeline does part of the decoding, preparation or execution and then passes it to the next stage for its step.  Modern processors can even do some of the steps of out of order as decoding on several instructions is done in parallel.

Decoding the [[opcode]] in the instruction register includes determining the instruction, determining where its operands are in memory, retrieving the operands from memory, allocating processor resources to execute the command (in [[superscalar]] processors), etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''INTERCAL''', [[programming language]] [[parody]], is the [[canonical]] [[esoteric programming language]] created by [[Don Woods]] and [[James Lyon]], two [[Princeton University]] students, in [[1972]].  It satirizes aspects of the [[FORTRAN]] and [[COBOL]] [[programming language]]s, as well as the proliferation of proposed language constructs and notations in the 1960s.  Consequently, the humour may appear rather dated to modern readers brought up with [[C programming language|C]] or [[Java programming language|Java]].

The current version, C-INTERCAL, is maintained by [[Eric S. Raymond]].  INTERCAL is said by the original authors to stand for &quot;Compiler Language With No Pronounceable Acronym&quot;. 

INTERCAL is purposely different from all other computer languages.  Common operations in other languages have cryptic and redundant syntax in INTERCAL.  From the INTERCAL Reference Manual: 

:It is a well-known and oft-demonstrated fact that a person whose work is incomprehensible is held in high esteem. For example, if one were to state that the simplest way to store a value of 65536 in a 32-bit INTERCAL variable is:

An '''Impi''' is a [[Zulu]] word for any armed body of men. However, in English it is often used to refer to a Zulu [[regiment]], which is called an ''ibutho'' in Zulu. The first impis were formed by Zulu king [[Shaka]], who was then only the exiled illegitimate son of king [[Senzangakona]], but already showing much prowess as a general in the army of [[Mthethwa]] king [[Dingiswayo]] in the Mthethwa-[[Ndwandwe]] war in the early 1810s.

==Youth==
Impi warriors were raised from the age as low as of six, joining the army as ''udibi'' porters at first, being enrolled into [[age set|same-age groups]] (''intanga''). Until they were ''buta'''d, Zulu boys accompanied their fathers and brothers on campaign as servants. Eventually, they would go to the nearest ''ikhanda'' to ''kleza'' (which literally means to drink directly from the udder), at which point they would become ''inkwebane'', or cadets. They would spend their time training until they were formally enlisted by the king. They would challenge each other to stick fights, which had to be accepted on pain of dishonor. 

==Enlistment==
On being formally formed into regiments  -''ibutho'' (plural ''amabutho'') after their 20th birthday, they would build their ''ikhanda'' (often referred to as a 'homestead', and it was basically a stockaded group of huts surrounding a corral for cattle) which would be where they would come when mustered for active service. They would have to come for this muster until they married, which was a privilege the king bestowed. They were trained to outrun a horse, cover about 80 km (50 miles) a day on foot and hide and stalk in the underbrush. The amabutho were recruited on the basis of age rather than regional or tribal origin. The reason for this was to enhance the centralised power of the Zulu king at the expense of clan and tribal leaders. They swore loyalty to the king of the Zulu nation. 

Every ibutho was a thousand warriors strong and originally contained warriors from the same ''intanga'' (this practice later changed as  casualties suffered by the regiments made reinforcements necessary). Each ibutho had its own colors in colored shields, headdress and other ornaments.  An impi - a force which contained several ''amabutho'' - was also accompanied by ''udibi'', young boys who carried implements like cooking pots and sleeping mats and on occasion acted as scouts. Shaka insisted that troops wear no shoes&amp;mdash;they could run faster and were not disabled by the loss of their sandals. Training for this was to stamp thorns into the ground with bare feet.

==Service==
In wartime, the Zulu soldier went into battle minimally dressed, painting his upper body and face with chalk and red ochre, despite the popular conception of elaborately panoplied warriors. In Shaka's day, warriors often wore elaborate plumes and cow tail regalia, but by the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] of 1879, many warriors wore only loin cloth into battle. As a weapon he carried the ''[[iklwa]]'' stabbing spear (losing one could result in execution), [[cudgel]]s (''[[knobkerrie]]''). He also carried shields, which were property of the king. The iklwa with its long (c. 25cm) tip was an invention of Shaka that superseded the older thrown [[assegai]]. It could theoretically be used both in melee and as a thrown weapon, but warriors were forbidden in Shaka's day from throwing it, which would disarm them and give their opponents something to throw back. Moreover, Shaka felt it discouraged warriors from closing into hand to hand combat. However, after the Zulus encountered the Boers and the British, who were armed with firearms, the Zulus re-introduced the throwing spear in an effort to counter their enemies firepower. By the time of [[Zulu War]], king [[Cetshwayo]] also equipped them with [[musket]]s and they also used [[rifle]]s captured from the British. However, many of their weapons were obsolete or in bad condition and warriors were usually badly trained in their use.

==Tactics==
Shaka used impis with a modified encircling tactic - ''impondo zankoma'' ('bull's horns'); Impi troops would divide into four groups. The main group (''isifuba'', 'chest') would face the enemy, two wings (''izimpondo'', 'horns') on two sides of the enemy and then force them towards the center. The fourth party (usually the veterans) remained as a reserve. They travelled light, and carried their own food or foraged along the way. The image of the Zulu warrior who could &quot;run fifty miles and fight a battle at the end of it&quot; is not at all true, but the barefooted Zulu warrior was swift, and could cover perhaps 25 miles a day. Thus tactics against their enemies (other African tribes, the [[Boers]], and the British) were surprise and overwhelming force, rather than siege or long campaigns.  During the [[Anglo-Zulu War]], British commander [[Frederick Augustus Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] complained that they did not 'fight fair'. 

==History==
Against the [[Ndwandwe]], numerically superior northern neighbours who invaded Zulu territory to suppress them, [[Shaka]] played hide-and-seek games, while laying waste to the land to prevent foraging. Shaka waited and only attacked when the Ndwandwe were divided or exhausted.

Impi were also famous for their custom 'washing of spears (in their enemy's blood)' in which they cut open the belly of killed (and allegedly sometimes still living) opponents. The Zulus believed that this meant the release of the opponent's spirit so it could not haunt the killer.

Complex ceremonies surrounded battles, and great honours were bestowed upon the courageous in battle. Cowards were dishonoured and occasionally executed. Wounds were crudely serviced, but the Zulus had an unusual rate of recovery. Overall, the Zulu army was versatile and all but invincible against other African armies. However, they faced tougher opposition when confronted with the Boers, from around 1830 and later the British. Although Zulu impis under [[Dingane]] had some early success against the [[Trek Boers]], they suffered a bloody defeat when attacking a fortified [[laager]] at the [[battle of Blood River]] in 1838. Similarly, the Zulus scored a famous victory over the British at the [[battle of Isandlwana]] in 1879, but ultimately were no match for the [[Martini-Henry]] [[rifle]]s and [[Gatling gun|Gatling machine guns]] used against them in by the British troops.They suffered successive defeats at the [[battle of Kambula]], [[battle of Gingindlovu]] and the [[battle of Ulundi]], which led to the destruction of the Zulu Kingdom.

==Trivia==
The [[Aiel]] ''algai'd'siswai'' of the [[Wheel of Time]] fictional universe are largely based on Impi warriors.

[[Rudyard Kipling]] refers to them in his poem &quot;Fuzzy-Wuzzy&quot;:

:''We took our chanst among the Khyber 'ills,''
::''The Boers knocked us silly at a mile,''
:''The Burman give us Irriwady Chills,''
::''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;An a Zulu Impi dished us up in style.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[mythology]] of pre-Christian [[Ireland]] did not entirely survive the conversion to [[Christianity]], but much of it was preserved, shorn of its religious meanings, in [[medieval]] [[Irish literature]], which represents the most extensive and best preserved of all the branches of [[Celtic mythology]]. Although many of the manuscripts have failed to survive, and much more material was probably never committed to writing, there is enough remaining to enable the identification of four distinct, if overlapping, cycles: the [[Mythological Cycle]], The [[Ulster Cycle]], the [[Fenian Cycle]] and the [[Historical Cycle]]. There are also a number of extant mythological texts that do not fit into any of the cycles. In addition, there are a large number of recorded [[folk tales]] that, while not strictly mythological, feature personages from one or more of these four cycles.

==The sources==

The three main manuscript sources for Irish mythology are the late [[11th century|11th]]/early [[12th century]] ''[[Lebor na hUidre]]'' which is in the library of the [[Royal Irish Academy]], the early 12th century ''[[Book of Leinster]]'' in the library of [[Trinity College, Dublin]], and the [[Rawlinson]] manuscript B 502 (''Rawl.''), housed in the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford University]]. Despite the dates of these sources, most of the material they contain predates their composition. The earliest of the prose can be dated on linguistic grounds to the [[8th century]], and some of the verse may be as old as the [[6th century]].

Other important sources include a group of four manuscripts originating in the west of Ireland in the late [[14th century|14th]] or early [[15th century]]: ''The Yellow Book of Lecan'', ''The Great Book of Lecan'', ''The Book of Hy Many'', and ''The Book of Ballymote''. The first of these contains part of the earliest known version of the ''[[Táin Bó Cúailnge]]'' and is housed in Trinity College. The other three are in the Royal Academy. Other 15th century manuscripts, such as ''The Book of Fermoy'' also contain interesting materials, as do such later syncretic works such as [[Geoffrey Keating]]'s ''Foras Feasa ar Éirinn'' (''The History of Ireland'') (ca. [[1640]]), particularly as these later compilers and writers may have had access to manuscript sources that have since disappeared.

When using these sources, it is, as always, important to question the impact of the circumstances in which they were produced. Most of the manuscripts were created by [[Christianity|Christian]] [[monk]]s, who may well have been torn between the desire to record their native culture and their religious hostility to pagan beliefs resulting in some of the gods being [[wiktionary:Euhemerize|euhemerized]]. Many of the later sources may also have formed part of a propaganda effort designed to create a history for the people of Ireland that could bear comparison with the mythological descent of their British invaders from the founders of [[Rome]] that was promulgated by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] and others.  There was also a tendency to rework Irish genealogies to fit into the known schema of Greek or Biblical genealogy.

It was once unquestioned that medieval Irish literature preserved truly ancient traditions in a form virtually unchanged through centuries of [[oral tradition]] back to the ancient [[Celts]] of Europe. Kenneth Jackson famously described the Ulster Cycle as a &quot;window on the Iron Age&quot;, and Garret Olmsted has attempted to draw parallels between ''[[Táin Bó Cuailnge]]'', the Ulster Cycle epic, and the iconography of the [[Gundestrup Cauldron]]. However, this &quot;nativist&quot; position has been challenged by &quot;revisionist&quot; scholars who believe that much of it was created in Christian times in deliberate imitation of the [[Epic poetry|epic]]s of [[classical literature]] that came with [[Latin]] learning. The revisionists would point to passages apparently influenced by the [[Iliad]] in ''Táin Bó Cuailnge'', and the existence of ''Togail Troi'', a very early Irish adaptation of the [[Aeneid]] found in the Book of Leinster, and note that the material culture of the stories is generally closer to the time of the stories' composition than to the distant past. A consensus has emerged which encourages the critical reading of the material.

==Mythological cycle==

The [[Mythological Cycle]], comprising stories of the former gods and origins of the Irish, is the least well preserved of the four cycles. The most important sources are the ''[[Metrical Dindshenchas]]'' or ''Lore of Places'' and the ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]'' or ''Book of Invasions''. Other manuscripts preserve such Mythological tales as ''[[The Dream of Aengus]]'', ''[[The Wooing Of Étain]]'' and ''[[Cath Maige Tuireadh]]'', ''The (second) Battle of Magh Tuireadh''. One of the best known of all Irish stories, ''Oidheadh Clainne Lir'', or ''[[Children of Lir|The Tragedy of the Children of Lir]]'', is also part of this cycle.

''Lebor Gabála Érenn'' is a pseudo-history of Ireland, tracing the ancestry of the Irish back to [[Noah]]. It tells of a series of invasions or &quot;takings&quot; of Ireland by a succession of peoples, one of whom was the people known as the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]], who were believed to have inhabited the island before the arrival of the [[Gaels]], or [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]]. They faced opposition from their enemies, the [[Fomorians]], led by  [[Balor]] of the Evil Eye. Balor was eventually slain by [[Lugh|Lug Lámfada]] (Lug of the Long Arm) at the second battle of Magh Tuireadh. With the arrival of the Gaels, the Tuatha Dé Danann retired underground to become the [[fairy]] people of later myth and legend.

The ''Metrical Dindshenchas'' is the great onomastic work of early Ireland, giving the naming legends of significant places in a sequence of poems. It includes a lot of important information on Mythological Cycle figures and stories, including the Battle of Tailtiu, in which the Tuatha Dé Danann were defeated by the Milesians.

It is important to note that by the middle ages the Tuatha Dé Danann were not viewed so much as gods as the shape-shifting magician population of an earlier [[Golden Age]] Ireland. Texts such as ''Lebor Gabála Érenn'' and ''Cath Maige Tuireadh'' present them as kings and heroes of the distant past, complete with death-tales. However there is considerable evidence, both in the texts and from the wider Celtic world, that they were once considered [[deity|deities]].

Even after they are displaced as the rulers of Ireland, characters such as [[Lugh|Lug]], the [[Mórrígan]], [[Aengus]] and [[Manannan]] appear in stories set centuries later, betraying their immortality. A poem in the [[Book of Leinster]] lists many of the Tuatha Dé, but ends &quot;Although [the author] enumerates them, he does not worship them&quot;. [[Goibniu]], [[Creidhne]] and [[Luchta]] are referred to as ''Trí Dée Dána'' (&quot;three gods of craftsmanship&quot;), and the [[Dagda]]'s name is interpreted in [[medieval]] texts as &quot;the good god&quot;. [[Nuada]] is [[cognate]] with the [[Prehistoric Britain|British]] god [[Nodens]]; [[Lugh|Lug]] is a reflex of the pan-[[Celt]]ic deity [[Lugus]]; [[Tuireann]] may be related to the [[Gaulish]] [[Taranis]]; [[Ogma]] to [[Ogmios]]; the [[Badb]] to [[Catubodua]].

==Ulster cycle==

The [[Ulster Cycle]] is set around the beginning of the Christian era and most of the action takes place in the provinces of [[Ulster]] and [[Connacht]]. It consists of a group of heroic stories dealing with the lives of [[Conchobar mac Nessa]], king of Ulster, the great hero [[Cúchulainn]], the son of Lug, and of their friends, lovers, and enemies. These are the [[Ulaid]], or people of the North-Eastern corner of Ireland and the action of the stories centres round the royal court at [[Emain Macha]], close to the modern city of [[Armagh]]. The Ulaid had close links with the Irish colony in [[Scotland]], and part of Cúchulainn's training takes place in that colony.

The cycle consists of stories of the births, early lives and training, wooings, battles, feastings and deaths of the heroes and reflects a warrior society in which warfare consists mainly of single combats and wealth is measured mainly in cattle. These stories are written mainly in prose. The centrepiece of the Ulster Cycle is the ''[[Táin Bó Cúailnge]]''. Other important Ulster Cycle tales include ''The Tragic Death of Aife's only Son'', ''Bricriu's Feast'', and ''The Destruction of Ua Derga's Hostel''. ''The Exile of the Sons of Usnach'', better known as the tragedy of [[Deirdre]] and the source of plays by [[John Millington Synge]] and [[William Butler Yeats]], is also part of this cycle.

This cycle is, in some respects, close to the mythological cycle. Some of the characters from the latter reappear, and the same sort of shape-shifting magic is much in evidence, side by side with a grim, almost callous realism. While we may suspect a few characters, such as [[Medb]] or [[Cú Roí]], of once being deities, and Cúchulainn in particular displays superhuman prowess, the characters are firmly mortal and rooted in a specific time and place. If the Mythological Cycle represents a Golden Age, the Ulster Cycle is Ireland's [[Heroic Age]].

==Fenian cycle==

Like the Ulster Cycle, the Fenian Cycle is concerned with the deeds of Irish heroes. The stories of the Fenian Cycle appear to be set around the [[3rd century]] and mainly in the provinces of [[Leinster]] and [[Munster]]. They differ from the other cycles in the strength of their links with the Irish-speaking community in Scotland and there are many extant Fenian texts from that country. They also differ from the Ulster Cycle in that the stories are told mainly in [[verse]] and that in tone they are nearer to the tradition of romance than the tradition of epic. The stories concern the doings of [[Fionn mac Cumhail]] and his band of soldiers, the [[Fianna]].

The single most important source for the Fenian Cycle is the ''Acallamh na Senórach '' (''Colloquy of the Old Men''), which is found in two [[15th century]] [[manuscripts]], the ''Book of Lismore'' and Laud 610, as well as a [[17th century]] manuscript from [[Killiney]], [[County Dublin]]. The text is dated from linguistic evidence to the [[12th century]]. The text records conversations between the last surviving members of the Fianna and [[St Patrick]] and runs to some 8,000 lines. The late dates of the manuscripts may reflect a longer oral tradition for the Fenian stories.

The Fianna of the story are divided into the Clann Baiscne, led by Fionn, and the Clann Morna, led by his enemy, [[Goll mac Morna]]. Goll killed Fionn's father, [[Cumhal]], in battle and the boy Fionn was brought up in secrecy. As a youth, while being trained in the art of poetry, he accidentally burned his thumb while cooking the Salmon of Knowledge, which allowed him to suck or bite his thumb in order to receive bursts of stupendous wisdom. He took his place as the leader of his band and numerous tales are told of their adventures. Two of the greatest Irish tales, ''Toraigheacht Dhiarmada agus Ghrainne'' (''The Pursuit of [[Diarmuid]] and [[Grainne]])'' and ''[[Oisin]] in Tir na nOg'' form part of the cycle. The Diarmuid and Grainne story, which is one of the few Fenian prose tales,  is a probable source of ''[[Tristan and Isolde]]''.

The world of the Fenian Cycle is one in which professional warriors spend their time hunting, fighting, and engaging in adventures in the spirit world. New entrants into the band are expected to be knowledgeable in poetry as well as undergo a number of physical tests or ordeals. Again, there is no religious element in these tales unless it is one of hero-worship.

==Historical cycle==

It was part of the duty of the medieval Irish bards, or court [[Irish poetry|poets]], to record the history of the family and the genealogy of the king they served. This they did in poems that blended the mythological and the historical to a greater or lesser degree. The resulting stories form what has come to be known as the Historical Cycle, or more correctly Cycles, as there are a number of independent groupings.

The kings that are covered range from the almost entirely mythological [[Labraid Loingsech]], who became High King of Ireland around [[431 BC]] to the entirely historical [[Brian Boru]]. However, the greatest glory of the Historical Cycle is the ''[[Buile Shuibhne]]'' (''The Frenzy of Suibhne''), a [[12th century]] tale told in verse and prose.

Suibhne, king of Dal nAraide, was cursed by St Ronan and became a kind of half man, half bird, condemned to live out his life in the woods, fleeing from his human companions. The story has captured the imaginations of contemporary Irish poets and has been translated by [[Trevor Joyce]] and [[Seamus Heaney]].

==Other tales==

===Adventures===

The adventures, or ''[[echtrae]]'', are a group of stories of visits to the Irish [[Other World]]. The most famous, ''Oisin in Tir na nOg'' belongs to the Fenian Cycle, but several free-standing adventures survive, including ''The Adventure of Conle'', ''[[The Voyage of Bran|The Voyage of Bran mac Ferbail]]'' and ''The Adventure of [[Lóegaire]]''.

===Voyages===

The voyages, or ''[[immrama]]'', are tales of sea journeys and the wonders seen on them. These probably grew from the experiences of fishermen combined with the Other World elements that inform the adventures. Of the seven ''immrama'' mentioned in the manuscripts, only three survive: ''The Voyage of [[Mael Duin]]'', ''The Voyage of the Ui Chorra'', and ''The Voyage of Snedgus and Mac Riagla''. ''The Voyage of Mael Duin'' is the forerunner of the later ''[[Voyage of St. Brendan]]''.

===Folk tales===

At the beginning of the 19th Century, [[Herminie T. Kavanagh]] wrote down many Irish folk tales which she published in magazines and in two books.  Twenty-six years after her death, the tales from her two books, ''Darby O'Gill and the Good People'', and ''Ashes of Old Wishes'' were made in to the film [[Darby O'Ging of roads, bridges and railways is criminal. All who in contravention of this teaching, participate in such crimes are guilty of grevious sins and may not be absolved in [[Confession]] nor admitted to the [[Holy Communion]] if they persist in such evil courses'' (Coogan, De Valera p344). 

This stance would have influenced many Catholic Irish people at the time. 

The lack of public support for the Anti-Treaty IRA, the determination of the government to defeat them and their lack of will also contributed to their defeat. By February 1923, republican leader [[Liam Deasy]] had already surrendered to Free State forces and called on other republicans to do the same. As the conflict petered out into a ''de facto'' victory for the pro-Treaty side, De Valera asked the IRA leadership to call a ceasefire, but they refused. Some historians suggest that the death of [[Liam Lynch]], the intransigent Republican leader, in a skirmish in the Knockmealdown mountains in [[County Waterford]] on April 10th, allowed the more pragmatic [[Frank Aiken]], who took over as IRA Chief of Staff, to call a halt to what seemed a futile struggle. Aiken's accession to IRA leadership was followed on the 30th of April by the declaration of a [[ceasefire]] on behalf off the anti-treaty forces. Aiken followed this on the 24th of May 1923 by an order to IRA volunteers to dump arms rather than surrender them or continue a fight which they were incapable of winning. Thousands of Anti-Treaty IRA members (including De Valera) were arrested by the Free State forces in the weeks after the end of the war, when they had dumped their arms and returned home.

===Attacks on Loyalists===
Although the cause of the civil war was the treaty, as the war developed the Irregulars sought to identify their actions with the traditional republican cause of the &quot;men of no property&quot; and the result was that the war also saw large Loyalist landowners, and some not very well-off Protestant [[Loyalists]], attacked and a large number of country estates occupied by small holders. Many, but not all of these people, had supported the Crown forces during the War of Independence. This support was often largely moral, but sometimes it took the form of actively assisting the British in the conflict. This made their situation post-independence difficult, and in the anarchy of the Civil War they became easy targets. Sometimes these attacks had sectarian overtones, although most anti-treaty IRA men made no distinction between Catholic and [[Protestant]] supporters of the Irish government. The Free State made efforts to protect Protestants and their property, most notably in [[County Louth]], where a special police force was set up specifically for this purpose. Controversy continues to this day about the extent of intimidation of Protestants at this time.

==Cost and results==
The Civil War, though short, was bloody. It cost the lives of many senior figures, including Michael Collins. Both sides carried out brutal acts: the anti-treaty forces murdered TDs (MPs) and burned many historic homes (such as the famous Moore Hall in [[County Mayo|Mayo]], because its owner had become a senator); the government executed anti-treaty prisoners, officially and unofficially. The pro-treaty National Army suffered 800 fatalities and perhaps as many as 4000 people were killed in total. As their forces retreated the Irregulars caused much destruction and the economy of the Free State suffered a hard blow in the earliest days of its existence as a result. In addition, about 12,000 Republicans were [[internment|interned]] by the end of the Civil War, most of whom were not released until 1924. After Aiken called an end to the Anti-Treaty campaign, up to 8000 IRA prisoners went on [[hunger strike]] in protest at their continued detention.

However, it has also been argued that the Irish Civil War could have been far worse than it actually was. The numbers killed were relatively modest by the standards of other contemporary civil wars - for example in [[Russian Civil War|Russia]] and [[Spanish Civil War|Spain]]. Moreover, the new Police force, the [[Civic Guard]]s, was not involved which meant that it was possible for the Free State to establish an unarmed and politically neutral police service after the war.  &lt;!-- CG became Garda Síochána in August 1923 --&gt;

The fact that the Irish Civil War was fought between Irish Nationalist factions meant that the issue of [[Northern Ireland]] was ignored and Ireland was spared what could have been a far bloodier civil war based on [[ethnic]] and [[sectarian]] lines over the future of Ireland's six north-eastern counties. In fact, because of the Irish Civil War, [[Northern Ireland]] was able to consolidate its existence and partition of Ireland was confirmed for the foreseeable future. Collins, up to the outbreak of the civil war and possibly until his death, had been planning to launch a clandestine guerrilla campaign against the Northern state and was funelling arms to the northern units of the IRA to this end. This may have led to open hostilities between north and south had the Irish Civil War not broken out. In the event, it was only after their defeat in the Civil War that anti-treaty Irish Republicans seriously considered whether to take armed action against British rule in Northern Ireland. The northern units of the IRA largely supported the Free State side in the civil war due to Collins's policies and over 1000 of them joined the new Free State's [[Irish Army]].    

In [[1926]], having failed to persuade the majority of the anti-treaty side of accepting the new status quo as a basis for an evolving Republic, a large faction led by De Valera and Aiken left to resume constitutional politics and to found the [[Fianna Fáil]] party. [[Sinn Fein]] became a small, isolated poltical party. The IRA, then much more numerous and influential than Sinn Fein, remained associated with Fianna Fail (though not directly) until banned by De Valera in 1935.

[[Image:Eamondv.jpg|thumb|left|Eamon de Valera in the 1930s.]] 
As with most civil wars, the internecine conflict left a bitter legacy, which continues to influence Irish politics to this day.  The two largest political parties in the Republic are still Fianna Fáil and [[Fine Gael]], the descendants respectively of the anti-treaty and pro-treaty forces of 1922. Until the 1970s, almost all of Ireland's prominent politicians were veterans of the civil war, a fact which poisoned the relationship between Ireland's two biggest parties. Examples of Civil War veterans include: Eamon de Valera, Frank Aiken, [[Todd Andrews]], [[Sean Lemass]]{{fn|2}}, (Republican) and [[W.T. Cosgrave]], Richard Mulcahy and [[Kevin O'Higgins]]{{fn|3}} (Free State). Moreover, many of these men's sons and daughters also became politicians, meaning that the personal wounds of the civil war were felt over three generations. In the 1930s after Fianna Fail took power for the first time, it looked possible for a while that the Civil War might break out again between the [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|IRA]] and the pro-Free State [[Blueshirts]]. Fortunately, this crisis was averted and by the 1950s, political violence was no longer prominent in Southern Irish politics. 
[[Image:WTCosgrave2.jpg|thumb|right|W.T. Cosgrave]]

However, the breakaway IRA continued (and continues in various forms) to exist. Up until the 1980s it still claimed to be the Provisional Government of the Irish Republic declared in 1918 and annulled by the Treaty of 1921. Some people, notably [[Michael McDowell]], claim that this attitude, which dates from the Civil War, still underpins the politics of the [[Provisional IRA]].

'''Internet Explorer''', abbreviated '''IE''' or '''MSIE''', is a [[proprietary software|proprietary]] [[graphical user interface|graphical]] [[web browser]] made by [[Microsoft]] and included as part of the [[Microsoft Windows]] line of operating systems. It is the most widely used web browser today.

Microsoft has shipped Internet Explorer as the default browser in all versions of Microsoft Windows since [[Windows 95]] OSR1. The last major upgrade to Internet Explorer, 6.0 SV1{{ref|sv1}}, is included in [[Windows XP]] Service Pack 2 and [[Windows Server 2003]] Service Pack 1 only. [[software beta|Beta versions]] of Internet Explorer 7 for Windows XP SP2 have been available since [[July 27]] [[2005]] and versions specific to [[Windows Server 2003]] as well as for 64-bit editions of Windows will also be released, though it won't be available for older versions of Windows. Internet Explorer versions, prior to the one included in Windows XP SP2, are also available as a separate download for versions of Windows uptil [[Windows XP]].

In the past, Internet Explorer was also developed for several other operating systems: [[Internet Explorer for Mac]] and [[Internet Explorer for UNIX]] (the latter for use through the [[X Window System]] on [[Solaris Operating Environment|Solaris]] and [[HP-UX]]).  All of these versions have ceased active development.

Internet Explorer is currently known as '''Microsoft Internet Explorer''', but the name will change to '''Windows Internet Explorer''' with the release of Internet Explorer 7.

==History==
[[Image:Internet Explorer 4.png|thumb|Internet Explorer 4.0 under Windows]]
{{main|History of Internet Explorer}}
Internet Explorer is derived from [[Spyglass]] [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]], an early commercial web browser. In 1995, Spyglass Mosaic was licensed by [[Microsoft]] in an arrangement under which Spyglass would receive a quarterly fee plus a percentage of Microsoft's revenues for the software. Although bearing a name similar to [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications|NCSA]] Mosaic, which was the first widely used browser, Spyglass Mosaic was relatively unknown in its day and did not use any of the NCSA Mosaic source code {{ref|SpyglassMosaic}}.

Internet Explorer 3 was the first major browser with [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] support released in August, 1996 and it could handle the [[Platform for Internet Content Selection|PICS]] system for content [[metadata]]. The improvements were significant, compared to its main competitor at the time, [[Netscape Navigator]].

The browser was not widely used until version 4, which was released in October 1997 and was integrated with the [[Windows 98]] operating system. This integration, however, was subject to numerous criticisms (see [[United States v. Microsoft]]).  Version 5, released in September 1998, was another significant release that supported [[bi-directional text]], [[ruby character]]s, [[XML]] and [[Extensible Stylesheet Language|XSL]]. 

Version 6 was released on [[August 27]] [[2001]], a few weeks before [[Windows XP]]. This version included DHTML enhancements, content restricted inline frames, and better support of CSS level 1, DOM level 1 and SMIL 2.0. The MSXML engine was also updated to version 3.0. Other new features included a new version of the IEAK, Media bar, [[Windows Messenger]] integration, fault collection, automatic image resizing, [[P3P]], and a new look-and-feel that is in line with the style of Windows XP.

On [[February 15]] [[2005]], Microsoft Chairman [[Bill Gates]] announced that the new version of its browser will be released at the RSA Conference 2005 in San Francisco {{ref|RSAConference2005}}. The decision to update the browser occurred in the wake of a decline in the use of Internet Explorer for the first time. Microsoft also stated that Internet Explorer 7 will only be available for Windows XP SP2 and later, including Windows Server 2003 SP1 and Windows Vista. The first [[software beta|beta version]] of the browser was released on [[July 27]] [[2005]] for technical testing, and a first public preview version of Internet Explorer 7 (Beta 2 preview: Pre-Beta 2 version) was released on [[January 31]], [[2006]]. Version 7 is intended to defend users from [[phishing]] as well as deceptive or malicious software, and also features full user control of ActiveX, and better security framework. It includes important bug fixes, enhancements to support the web standards, improvements in HTML 4.01/CSS 2, [[Tabbed document interface|Tabbed Browsing]], Tab preview and management, and web feeds reader.

==Features==
{{main|Features of Internet Explorer}}

[[Image:XPSP2_popup.png|thumb|right|The pop-up blocker included in Internet Explorer 6 SP 2]]

Internet Explorer has been designed to view the broadest range of web pages and to provide certain features within the operating system, including [[Windows Update]]. During the heydays of the historic [[browser wars]], Internet Explorer superseded Netscape by supporting many of the progressive features of the time.

===Component architecture===
The [[Component Object Model]] (COM) technology is used extensively in Internet Explorer. It allows third parties to add functionalities via [[Browser Helper Object]]s (BHO); and allows websites to offer rich content via [[ActiveX]]. As these objects have the same privileges as the browser itself (in certain situations), this raised concern over security. This issue was addressed in Internet Explorer 6.0 Service Pack 2, which provides an [[Add-on]] Manager for controlling ActiveX controls and Browser Helper Objects.  Internet Explorer 7 provides a &quot;No Add-Ons&quot; version (Under Programs/Accessories/System Tools) to address this issue, as well.

===Usability and accessibility===
[[Image:Ie7tabbedbrowsing.PNG|thumb|Tabbed browsing in Internet Explorer 7 Beta 2 preview]]
Since it is tightly integrated with the operating system, Internet Explorer makes use of the accessibility framework provided in Windows. Internet Explorer is also a user interface for FTP, with operations similar to that of [[Windows Explorer]].

The ability to block [[popup]] windows was introduced with Internet Explorer 6.0, Service Pack 2.

[[Tabbed browsing]] can be added to Internet Explorer 6 by installing Microsoft's [[MSN Search Toolbar]], and is natively supported as of Internet Explorer 7.

===Security framework===
Internet Explorer uses a zone-based [[computer security|security]] framework, which means that sites are grouped based upon certain conditions. It allows the restriction of broad areas of functionality, and also allows specific functions to be restricted.

Patches and updates to the browser are released periodically and made available through [[Windows Update]] [[website]]. Although security patches continue to be released for a range of platforms, most recent feature additions and security improvements are released for Windows XP only. A report in April 2005 showed that only [http://www.winplanet.com/article/2825-.htm 24% of corporate PCs] had upgraded to XP SP2.

Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 2 provide Download Monitoring and Install Monitoring that user can choose to download, or not to download and, choose to install, or not to install Applications, Executables and Installations. This prevents installation of Spywares, Adwares, Viruses or Malwares.

===Standards support===
Internet Explorer almost fully supports [[HTML]] 4.01, [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] Level 1, [[XML]] 1.0 and [[Document Object Model|DOM]] Level 1, with minor implementation gaps. It partially supports CSS Level 2 and DOM Level 2, with some implementation gaps and conformance issues. It supports [[XHTML]] 1.0 to the extent that HTML 4.01 compatibility guidelines are followed. Internet Explorer uses [[DOCTYPE sniffing]] to choose between &quot;[[quirks mode]]&quot; (renders similarly to older versions of MSIE) and [[standards mode]] (renders closer to W3C's specifications) for HTML and CSS rendering.  It fully supports [[XSLT]] 1.0 or the December 1998 Working Draft of [[Extensible Stylesheet Language|XSL]], depending on the version of [[MSXML]] (a [[dynamic link library]]) available. It also provides its own dialect of [[ECMAScript]] called [[JScript]].

===Proprietary extensions===
Internet Explorer has introduced an array of proprietary extensions to many of the standards, including HTML, CSS and the DOM.  This has resulted in a number of web pages that can only be viewed properly using Internet Explorer. Many view this as an example of what is called &quot;[[embrace and extend|embrace, extend and extinguish]]&quot; (EEE), a way to drive competitors out of business by forcing them to use proprietary technology that a company controls, resulting in [[vendor lock-in]]. Netscape Navigator up to version 4.7 was also responsible for massive proprietary extension of the core web standards, but was not criticized for it as much.

==Version 7.0==
[[Image:IE7_Quick_Tabs.png|thumb|Internet Explorer 7's &quot;Quick Tabs&quot;]]
Version 7.0 of Internet Explorer has been renamed to '''Windows Internet Explorer''', as part of Microsoft's rationalization of component names that are included with Windows.  Set to ship with [[Windows Vista]], and as a separate download for [[Windows XP|Windows XP with Service Pack 2]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] Service Pack 1, large amounts of the underlying architecture, including the rendering engine and security framework, have been completely overhauled. Partly as a result of these security enhancements, the browser will be a stand-alone application, rather than integrated with the Windows shell, and it will no longer be capable of acting as a file browser. 

The Windows Vista version will incorporate additional security measures, most significantly &quot;Protected Mode&quot;, whereby the browser runs in a sandbox with even lower rights than a limited user account software. As such, it can write to only the Temporary Internet Files folder and can not install start-up programs or change any configuration of the operating system. This is expected to increase the security of the system considerably.[http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/02/09/528963.aspx]

On January 31st 2006, Microsoft released a public preview build (Beta 2 preview: Pre-Beta 2 version) of Internet Explorer 7 for Windows XP Service Pack 2 (not for Windows Server 2003 SP 1) on their web site. It stated that more public preview builds (possibly Beta 2 in April) of Internet Explorer 7 will be released in first half of 2006, and final version will be released in second half of 2006.[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie7/ie7betaredirect.mspx]

===New features===
[[Image:Ie7feedreader.PNG|thumb|Internet Explorer 7's [[Web feed]] reader]]
* Version 7 supports [[tabbed browsing]], which has been a popular feature in competing web browsers for some time. In addition to this, there is a feature called &quot;Quick Tabs&quot;, which displays a thumbnail preview of opened tabs, treating tabs like [[Exposé (Mac OS X)|Exposé]] treats application windows. With this new feature, user can find, open, close, and refresh opened tabs easily.
* A search box has been added to the top-right corner, to do fast searches using a search engine.  MSN Search is the default{{ref|search7default}}, but additional providers may be added.  Microsoft provides a list of common providers, but any web site can identify itself as having a search capability.[http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/02/07/527266.aspx]
* Long-awaited support for per-pixel [[alpha compositing|alpha channel]] transparency in [[PNG]] images has been added.[http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/04/26/412263.aspx]
* Feed reader integration in [[Web feed]]s support is built in version 7.0. The feed reader is fully integrated with the browser, so that user can read web feeds (RSS or Atom) without an RSS reader. It also discovers web feeds automatically. Updates to web feeds can be retrieved when the web browser isn't running. The web feeds feature set is also available to third-party developers through API's, so that the list of subscribed feeds (as well as their current contents) can be used. [http://blogs.msdn.com/rssteam/archive/2006/02/09/528195.aspx]
* ActiveX Opt-In blocks ActiveX Control unless it allowed to be installed. This feature improves security from unverificable and vulnerable controls. ActiveX controls can be chosen to be installed on Information Bar. User can turn on and off ActiveX Contol by using Add-on Manager.   
* A number of improvements to CSS support have been made.  Microsoft's stated goal with version 7 was to fix the most significant &quot;bugs&quot; and areas which caused the most trouble for developers, and then improved coverage of the standards would come later.
* The well-known problem of having the right-hand portion of a web page cut off when the page is printed, has been fixed.  Page content can also be &quot;shrunk&quot; to fit more text on a single page.  The revamped &quot;Print Preview&quot; interface will also let users drag the page margins around and see the results immediamanded by [[Oliver Law]], who became the first black man to lead white American combat troops.

== Status of the Brigades after the war ==
[[Image:International Brigades monument berlin.jpg|thumbnail|The monument which honours the German brigadists in Berlin]]
[[Image:25 anni int brigades.jpg|thumb|Czechoslovak poster celebrating the 25th anniversary of establishing the International Brigades.]]
[[Image:Perelachaise-BrigadesInternationales-p1000377.jpg|thumb|The monument honouring the French Brigadists in [[Père Lachaise]] cemetery.]]

Since the Civil War was eventually won by the Nationalists, the Brigadists were initially on the &quot;wrong side&quot; of History, especially since most of their home countries had a right-wing government (in France, for instance, the [[Popular Front]] was not in power anymore). However, since most of these countries found themselves at war with the very powers which had been fought in Spain, the Brigadists gained some prestige as the first guard of the democracies, having fought a prophetical combat. Retrospectively, it was clear that the war in Spain was as much a Spanish Civil war as a precursor of the coming [[Second World War]]. Some glory was therefore accredited to the volunteers (a great deal of the survivors having also fought gallantly during the World War), but this soon faded in the fear that it would promote (by association) communism. Also, the ambiguous stance viz. Germany of the Communist Parties in the West, during the period between the Hitler-Stalin pact and the German invasion of the Soviet Union, contributed to widespread uneasiness when evaluating the Brigadists' role in the politics of the Nazi era. Since the fall of the Soviet bloc, the International Brigades have been quite unanimously regarded as anti-Fascist heroes, and the legitimacy of their fight has, for the most part, washed away the stain of summary executions and Stalinist manipulation, despite being non-governmental combatants.

=== Swiss Brigadists ===
766 [[Switzerland|Swiss]] went to fight for the Republic, while only 40 went on the other side. It is interesting to note that the pro-republicans were later prosecuted for breaking the Swiss neutrality laws, which prohibit Swiss nationals from fighting for foreign countries, while the pro-fascists were never prosecuted. This might be explained on one hand by the anti-communism of the Swiss government at the time, but also because the Swiss living in Spain at the time (nearly 4000) were very much afraid of what was perceived as a communist movement. The Republican fighters were re-habilitated in the 1990s.

Interestingly, it has been noted that the punishments of those prosecuted were very variable (ranging from 15 days to 4 months in prison) but that the French-speaking tribunals had been as a rule much more lenient than the German-speaking ones. This is very much corellated to the openly pro-fascist sentiment of the elite in those parts at the time.

=== Recognition of former Brigadists ===

On [[26 January]] [[1996]] the Spanish government gave Spanish citizenship to the Brigadists. At the time, roughly 600 remained. By the end of 1938, Prime Minister [[Juan Negrin]] had promised Spanish citizenship to the Brigadists, a promise which had not been kept since the Republic had lost the war.

==Misc==

=== Symbolism and  Heraldic ===

[[Image:Flag of the International Brigades.svg|150px|left|Flag of the International Brigades]]
The International Brigades were inheritors of a Communist aesthetic, which explains the numerous very stylised posters about the subject. 

The flags featured the colours of the Spanish Republic : Red, Yellow and Purple, often along with Communist symbols (Red flags, [[hammer and sickle]], fist,...). The emblem of the brigades themselves was the three-pointed red star, which is often featured.

'''Food irradiation''' is the process of exposing food to [[ionizing radiation]] in order to disinfest, [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilize]], or [[food preservation|preserve]] [[food]].  It is, like most technology involving ionizing radiation, the subject of some controversy regarding its safety.  [[Irradiation]] is used on other things as well, such as medical hardware.  Largely to avoid consumer fear of the term &quot;radiation&quot;, it is often called '''cold pasteurization''' or '''electronic pasteurization''' to emphasize its similarity to the process of [[pasteurization]]. 

== Food irradiation ==
[[Image:Radura-Symbol.svg|thumb|220px|The radura logo, used to show a food has been treated with radiation]]
By irradiating food, depending on the dose, some or all of the [[microbe]]s and [[insect]]s present are [[kill]]ed. This prolongs the life of the food in cases where microbial spoilage is the limiting factor in shelf life. Some foods (e.g., [[herb]]s and [[spice]]s) are irradiated at such high doses (5 [[gray (unit)|kilograys]] or more) that they are partially sterilized. It has also been shown that irradiation can delay the ripening or sprouting of [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s and replace the need for [[pesticide]]s.  Irradiation may also create new chemicals in food that are unique to this process - chemicals that would not be created by cooking or other standard food processing techniques.

The [[United Nations Environmental Program]] passed the [[Montreal Protocol|Montreal Protocol on Substances that deplete the Ozone Layer]] banning amongst other substances all non-critical uses of [[Methyl bromide|methyl bromide]], the most common [[fumigant]] for post-[[harvest]] [[quarantine]] treatment of fruit. Although in theory still permitted for quarantine applications, prices of the fumigant have increased dramatically as a consequence. Some governments and corporations think that irradiation is a legitimate replacement for such fumigants and in consequence some large agricultural nations of the world are currently building irradiation facilities for fresh fruit, although the food industry has been slow to adopt this technology on any large scale.

The United States [[Department of Agriculture]] has approved irradiation technology as an alternative treatment for fruits and vegetables that are considered hosts to a number of [[Tephritidae|fruit flies]] and seed [[weevil]]s. [[Food and agriculture organization of the United Nations|The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization]] (FAO) have passed a motion to support this step committing the member states to implement this technology for their national [[Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement|phytosanitary]] programs.

== Processes ==
While the term irradiation pertains to all forms of treating food products with ionizing radiation, specific types of radiation treatments are used in the food industry today.

===Radurization===
Radurization is the process of pasteurization by the use of radiation. It primarily used to treat foods that have a high moisture content and a high [[pH]]. The microbes that are targeted are mainly spoilage organisms. Meat and fish are the foods for which this process is mainly used. For dryer, acidic foods, [[yeast]]s and [[mold]]s can be denatured. The treatment dose for radurization is approximately 1 kGy.

===Radicidation===
The process of radicidation is used to eliminate [[pathogen]]s. This process kills vegetative cells only, meaning that it will not kill [[spore]]s. Also, certain radiation-resistant vegetative cells can survive, including some strains of the bacterium [[Salmonella]] which have been found to be radiation-resistant. [[Refrigeration]] is required for the product post-treatment. The dose for radicidation ranges from 2.5 - 5.0 kGy. At this level some physical and chemical changes may be detected, depending on the type of food. For example, leafy vegetables such as lettuce are more sensitive to irradiation than foods with a tougher consistency. 

===Radappertization===
Radappertization involves treating the product to levels of radiation of approximately 30 kGy. This high level of radiation kills all vegetative cells and also destroys spores from organisms such as [[Clostridium botulinum]]. Such levels are generally deemed suffcient for clinical sterility, but not usually employed on food items. Based on recommendations of the International Consultative Group on Food Irradiation that was formed by the joint FAO/IAEA division many national legislation limit applicable doses to 10kGy for many food items.
 
== Technologies ==
===Electron beam irradiation===
Electron beam irradiation uses [[electron]]s accelerated in an [[electric field]] to a velocity close to the speed of light. International and national regulations limit the energy of the beam to guarantee that no [[Induced radioactivity|induced radioactivity]] occurs. Electrons have [[cross-section]]s many times larger than photons, so that they do not penetrate the product beyond a few inches, making it necessary to treat fruit and vegetables individually; on the other hand, treatment times are only a few seconds. Electron facilities rely on substantial concrete shields to protect workers and the environment from radiation exposure.

===Gamma radiation===
[[Gamma radiation]] is radiation of [[photon]]s in the gamma part of the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]]. The radiation is obtained through the use of [[radioisotope]]s, generally [[cobalt]] 60 or in very few cases [[cesium]] 137. It is the most cost-effective technology and is preferred by many processors because the good penetration enables administering treatment to entire industrial pallets or totes, greatly reducing the need for material handling. A pallet or tote is typically exposed for several minutes depending on dose. The environment is protected by a large concrete shield. With most designs the radioisotope can be lowered into a water storage pool in order to allow maintenance personnel to enter the radiation shield. In this mode the water in the pool absorbs practically all radiation providing a safe working environment for plant personnel. Other not commonly used designs feature dry storage by providing movable shields that eliminate radiation levels in areas of the irradiation chamber. 

One variant of gamma irradiators keeps the cobalt 60 under water at all times and lowers the product to be irradiated under water in hermetic bells. No shielding is required for such designs.

===X-Ray irradiation===
Similar to gamma radiation, [[x-ray]]s are a lower-energy substitute for the former. These systems are scalable and have good penetration, with the added benefit of using an electronic source that stops radiating when switched off. They also permit very good dose uniformity. However these systems require a great deal of electrical energy when operating, and exposure times are longer than with gamma rays. Like most other types of  facilities, X-Ray systems rely on concrete shields to protect the environment from radiation.

== Public perception==
The effects of food irradiation have been studied for over 60 years. Under certain circumstances some research suggests that irradiation forms new chemicals in food, some of which are uniquely [[Radiolyse|radiolytic]] products. However, the levels of these compounds produced in irradiated foods have been deemed too low to present a meaningful risk to consumers. At very high doses, e.g. &gt;6 [[Gray (unit)|kilogray]], irradiation can reduce the [[vitamin]]s and other [[essential nutrient]]s; and negatively impact the [[flavor]], [[odor]] and [[texture]] of food. At the doses typically used in irradiation treatment of food, e.g. &lt;3.5 kilogray, these changes appear minimal. Independent scientific research on the subject has been extensive leading to endorsement of food irradiation by the [[US Food and Drug Administration]], the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] and the U.N. [[World Health Organization]] as a safe, effective  process.

Concerns have been expressed by public health groups that irradiation, by killing all [[bacteria]] in food, can serve to disguise poor food-handling procedures that could lead to other kinds of [[contamination]]. However, processors of irradiated food are subject to all existing regulations, inspections and potential penalties regarding plant safety and sanitization, including fines, recalls and criminal prosecutions. 

Others are concerned with the safety of irradiation plants and accidents that have occurred previously. The three recorded accidents on file at the IAEA in the history of irradiation facilities in the world were suffered by individual employees who entered the radiation chamber, disabling all available safety measures. 

Based on the intrinsic inability of the techniques used l militarists in his service, as the continuing limitation of Japan's naval armaments was wildly unpopular with them.
  
Yamamoto systematically opposed the invasion of [[Manchuria]] in [[1931]], the subsequent land war with China (1937), and the alliance with [[Nazi Germany]]. He further enraged militarist sentiments by personally apologizing to U.S. Ambassador Joseph C. Grew for the bombing of the gunboat U.S.S. Panay in December 1937. As Japan slid progressively toward war, the militarists marked Yamamoto for assassination and he was prudently reassigned from the Navy Ministry to sea as Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet ([[30 August]] [[1939]]), in part to make him harder for assassins to reach. He was promoted to Admiral, [[15 November]] [[1940]]. Yamamoto warned Premier [[Konoe Fumimaro]] to avoid war with the United States: &quot;If I am told to fight... I shall run wild for the first six months... but I have utterly no confidence for the second or third year.&quot; He was proven uncannily correct as the June 1942 [[Battle of Midway]] (generally considered the key turning point in the Pacific conflict) occurred almost six months to the day after the bombing of [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]].

In naval matters, Yamamoto opposed the building of the super-battleships [[Japanese battleship Yamato|Yamato]] and [[Japanese battleship Musashi|Musashi]]. He believed their construction a strain on Japan's limited resources and their utility questionable. Uninformed observers have criticized Yamamoto as being somehow latently &quot;battleship-centric&quot; for later employing both ships as flagships, but these selections were probably driven by the mundane demands of having adequate accommodations for the Combined Fleet staff personnel, and sufficient radio facilities for command and control. Ultimately, Yamamoto was proven correct about the super-battleships' limited usefulness as they spent much of the war at anchor and never successfully came to grips with their American counterparts, instead being sunk by massed air attack.

Yamamoto was responsible for a number of innovations in Japanese Naval Aviation. Although remembered for his association with aircraft carriers due to Pearl Harbor and Midway, Yamamoto did more to influence the development of land-based naval aviation, particularly the [[G3M]] and [[G4M]] medium bombers. His demand for great range and the ability to carry a torpedo was intended to conform to Japanese conceptions of attriting the American fleet as it advanced across the Pacific in war. The planes did achieve truly remarkable range, but at the price of outstripping the range of any potential fighter escorts while also being so lightly constructed and so loaded with fuel that they were tragically vulnerable to enemy fire. This earned the G4M the sardonic nick-name &quot;the Flying Cigarette Lighter&quot; and Yamamoto ironically died in one of these aircraft.

The range of the G3M and G4M contributed to a demand for great range in a fighter aircraft. This partly drove the requirements for the [[A6M Zero]] which was as noteworthy for its astonishing range as for its legendary maneuverability. Both qualities were again purchased at the expense of light construction and flammability that later contributed to the A6M's downfall as the war progressed.

As Japan moved toward war during 1940, Yamamoto gradually moved toward strategic as well as tactical innovation, again with mixed results. Prompted by talented young officers such as Minoru Genda, Yamamoto approved the reorganization of Japanese carrier forces into the First Air Fleet, a consolidated striking force that gathered Japan's six largest carriers into one unit. This innovation gave great striking capacity, but also concentrated the vulnerable carriers into a compact target; both boon and bane would be realized in war. Yamamoto also oversaw the organization of a similar large land-based organization in the 11th Air Fleet, which would later use the G3M and G4M to neutralize American air forces in the [[Philippines]] and sink the British Force &quot;Z.&quot;

In January 1941, Yamamoto went even farther and proposed a radical revision of Japanese naval strategy. For two decades, the Naval General Staff had planned in terms of Japanese light surface forces, submarines and land-based air units whittling down the American Fleet as it advanced across the Pacific until engaging in a climactic &quot;Decisive Battle&quot; in the northern Philippine Sea between the Ryukyu Islands on the west and the [[Marianas Islands]] on the east. This battle was intended to take place when the American forces had finally been worn down to parity with the Japanese Navy.

Correctly citing that this plan had never worked even in Japanese wargames, and painfully aware of American strategic advantages in military productive capacity, Yamamoto proposed instead to seek a decision with the Americans by first reducing their forces with a preemptive strike, and then following that with a &quot;Decisive Battle&quot; that would be sought offensively, rather than defensively. Yamamoto hoped, but probably did not believe, that if the Americans could be dealt such terrific blows early in the war, they might be willing to negotiate an end to the conflict. All hope of such vanished when he became aware that the note breaking diplomatic relations with the United States was delivered late and he correctly perceived the Americans would be resolved upon revenge. Yamamoto's thoughts on this matter were later dramatically encapsulated in the apocryphal &quot;[[Isoroku Yamamoto's sleeping giant quote|sleeping giant]]&quot; quote uttered in the movie &quot;[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]&quot;

The Naval General Staff proved reluctant to go along and Yamamoto was eventually driven to capitalize on his popularity in the fleet by threatening to resign to get his way. Admiral Osami Nagano and the Naval General Staff eventually caved in to this pressure, but only insofar as approving the Pearl Harbor Raid. Surprise attacks were a Japanese military tradition when starting a war and they could see their way clear to supporting such to give themselves six months to secure the resources of the Netherlands East Indies without the interference of the American navy.

The First Air Fleet commenced preparations for the Pearl Harbor Raid, solving a number of technical problems along the way, including how to launch torpedoes in the shallow water of Pearl Harbor and how to craft armor piercing bombs by machining down battleship gun projectiles.

===The attack on Pearl Harbor, 1941===
{{main|Attack on Pearl Harbor}}
As Yamamoto had planned, the First Air Fleet of six carriers armed with about 400 planes, commenced hostilities against the Americans on [[7 December]] [[1941]], launching 353 of those aircraft against Pearl Harbor in two waves. The attack was a complete success according to the parameters of the mission which sought to sink at least four American battleships and prevent the U.S. Fleet from interfering in Japan's southward advance for at least six months. American aircraft carriers were also considered a choice target, but were not prioritized ahead of battleships as some observers have mistakenly suggested.

In fact, five American battleships were sunk, three more damaged, and ten other cruisers, destroyers and auxiliaries were sunk or seriously damaged. Although Yamamoto later lamented that First Air Fleet Commander Vice Admiral [[Chuichi Nagumo]] did not seize the initiative to seek out and destroy the American carriers that were absent from the harbor, or further bombard various strategically important facilities on Oahu, Nagumo prudently withdrew after his stunning success. The Japanese lost only 29 aircraft when they had expected to lose far more and perhaps two carriers as well. Nagumo also had absolutely no idea where the American carriers might be and risked their finding and attacking him first at a vulnerable moment. His aircraft also lacked appropriate ordnance for attacking the machine tools and [[drydock]]s of the shipyard, or even the revetted fuel tanks, whose destruction could have been far more serious losses than the fighting ships themselves. Insufficient daylight remained after recovering the aircraft from the first two waves to launch and recover a third, and Nagumo's escorting [[destroyer]]s lacked the fuel capacity for him to loiter long. Too much has been made of Yamamoto's hindsight and wishful thinking and it is instructive to note that he did not punish Nagumo in any way for his withdrawal, which was after all according to plan.

On the political level, the attack was a disaster for Japan, rousing American passions for revenge due to it being a &quot;sneak attack&quot;. In fact, the Japanese had begun all their modern wars in this fashion and it was fully expected they would do so again - just not at Pearl Harbor. The shock of the attack coming in an unexpected place, with such devastating results and without the &quot;fair play&quot; of a declaration of war galvanized American determination to avenge the attack.

As a strategic blow intended to prevent American interference in the Netherlands East Indies for six months, the attack was a success, but unbeknownst to Yamamoto, a pointless one. The U.S. Navy had abandoned any intention of attempting to charge across the Pacific to the Philippines at the outset of war in 1935. In 1937, the [[U.S. Navy]] had further determined that even fully manning the U.S. Fleet to wartime levels could not be accomplished in less than six months, and myriad other logistic assets needed to execute a trans-Pacific movement simply did not exist and would require two years to construct after the onset of war. In 1940, U.S. Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral [[Harold Rainsford Stark|Harold Stark]] had penned &quot;Plan Dog&quot; which emphasized a defensive war in the Pacific while the U.S. concentrated on defeating Nazi Germany first, and consigned Admiral [[Husband Kimmel]]'s [[U.S. Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] to merely keeping the I.J.N. out of the eastern Pacific and away from the shipping lanes to [[Australia]].

As a tactical raid, the attack was a smashing victory, handily achieving its limited objectives at an amazingly low price of 29 aircraft (and five miniature submarines that contributed nothing of value). Hindsight and wishful thinking on the part of the Japanese regarding the attack's flaws, and American unpreparedness should not detract from the appreciation that military forces seldom achieve such complete surprise and devastation in an operation.  Credit for husbanding the ambitious brain-child of his talented air subordinates to fruition is Yamamoto's.

==Six months of running wild, December 1941 to May 1942==
With the American Fleet largely neutralized at Pearl Harbor, Yamamoto's Combined Fleet turned to the task of executing the larger Japanese war plan devised the Army and Navy General Staffs. The First Air Fleet proceeded to make a circuit of the Pacific, striking American, Australian, Dutch and British installations from [[Wake Island]] to Australia to Ceylon (now [[Sri Lanka]]) in the [[Indian Ocean]]. The 11th Air Fleet caught the American 7th Air Force on the ground in the Philippines hours after Pearl Harbor, and then proceeded to sink the British Force &quot;Z&quot; (battleship [[HMS Prince of Wales (1939)|HMS Prince of Wales]] and battlecruiser [[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS Repulse]]) underway at sea.

Under Yamamoto's able subordinates, Vice Admirals Ozawa, Kondo and Takahashi, the Japanese swept the inadequate remaining American, British, Dutch and Australian naval assets from the Netherlands East Indies in a series of amphibious landings and surface naval battles that culminated in the [[Battle of the Java Sea]] on [[27 February]] [[1942]]. With the occupation of the Netherlands East Indies, and the reduction of the remaining American positions in the Philippines to forlorn hopes on the [[Bataan Peninsula]] and [[Corregidor]] island, the Japanese had secured their oil- and rubber-rich &quot;Southern Resources Area&quot;.

Having achieved their initial aims with surprising speed and little loss (albeit against enemies ill-prepared to resist them), the Japanese paused to consider their next moves. Since neither the British nor the Americans were willing to negotiate, thoughts turned to securing and protecting their newly seized territory, and acquiring more with an eye toward additional conquest and/or attempting to force one or more enemies out of the war.

Competing plans developed at this stage, including thrusts to the west against India, the south against Australia and the east against the United States. Yamamoto was involved in this debate, supporting different plans at different times with varying degrees of enthusiasm and for varying purposes, including &quot;horse-trading&quot; for support of his objectives.

Plans included ideas as ambitious as invading [[India]] or Australia, as well as seizing [[Hawaii]]. These grandiose ventures were inevitably set aside as the Army could not spare enough troops from China for the first two, and Japan lacked the shipping to support the latter two. Instead, the Imperial General Staff supported an Army thrust into [[Burma]] in hopes of linking up with Indian Nationalists revolting against British rule, and attacks in [[New Guinea]] and the [[Solomon Islands]] designed to imperil Australia's sea line of communication with the United States.

Instead, the Imperial General Staff chose to pursue elements of the western and eastern options. The Army would attack into Burma, while the Navy would extend the defensive island perimeter to the east in an effort to sever the sea line of communications between the U.S. and Australia. Yamamoto agitated for an offensive Decisive Battle in the east to finish the American fleet, but the more conservative staff officers were unwilling to risk it.

In the midst of theses debates, the [[Doolittle Raid]] struck [[Tokyo]] and the surrounding areas, galvanizing the threat posed by the American aircraft carriers that had launched it in the minds of the staff officers, and giving Yamamoto an event he could exploit to get his way. The Naval General Staff agreed to Yamamoto's Midway (MI) Operation, subsequent to the first phase of the operations against Australia's link with America.

Yamamoto rushed planning for the Midway venture and the concurrent diversionary effort against the Aleutians, while dispatching a force under Rear Admiral Takagi, including the Fifth Carrier Division (the large, new carriers [[Shokaku]] and [[Zuikaku]]), to support the effort to seize the islands of [[Tulagi]] and [[Guadalcanal (Pacific Ocean island)|Guadalcanal]] for seaplane and airplane bases, and the town of [[Port Moresby]] on Papua New Guinea's south coast facing Australia.

The Port Moresby (MO) Operation proved an unwelcome reverse. Although Tulagi and Guadalcanal were taken, the Port Moresby invasion fleet turned back when Takagi clashed with an American carrier task force in the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] in early May. Although the Japanese sank a large American carrier in exchange for a smaller carrier, the Americans damaged the carrier Shokaku so badly she required dockyard repairs. Just as importantly, Japanese operational mishaps and American fighters and anti-aircraft fire devastated the dive-bomber and torpedo plane elements of both Shokaku's and Zuikaku's air groups. These losses side-lined the Zuikaku while she awaited replacement aircraft and replacement aircrew (and saw to the tactical integration and training of the later). These two ships would be sorely missed a month later at Midway.

==The Battle of Midway, June 1942==
Yamamoto's plan for the Midway (MI) Operation has been misunderstood and misevaluated for decades. It was not the spur-of-the-moment whim of an arrogant man. Nor was it a senselessly complex gamble or an emotional over-reaction to the Doolittle Raid. It was the logical extension of Yamamoto's efforts to knock the U.S. Pacific Fleet out of action long enough for Japan to fortify its defensive perimeter in the Pacific island chains. Yamamoto had realized from the beginning that it would be necessary to seek an early, offensive Decisive Battle to have any hope - however thin - of bringing the Americans to the negotiating table.

Yamamoto's plan was to draw American attention--and possibly carrier forces--north from Pearl Harbor by sending his Fifth Fleet (2 light carriers, 5 cruisers, 13 destroyers and 4 transports) against the [[Aleutians]], raiding [[Dutch Harbor]] on [[Unalaska Island]] and invading the more distant islands of [[Kiska]] and [[Attu Island|Attu]].

The following day, the First Mobile Force (4 carriers, 2 battleships, 3 cruisers, and 12 destroyers) would raid Midway and destroy its air force. Once Midway's air power was neutralized, the Second Fleet (1 light carrier, 2 battleships, 10 cruisers, 21 destroyers and 11 transports would land 5,000 troops to seize the [[atoll]] from the American [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]].

The seizure of Midway was expected to draw the American carriers west into a trap where the First Mobile Force would engage and destroy them. Afterward, the First Fleet (1 light carrier, 7 battleships, 3 cruisers and 13 destroyers), in conjunction with elements of the Second Fleet would mop up remaining American surface forces and complete the destruction of the Pacific Fleet.

To guard against mischance, Yamamoto initiated two security measures. The first was an aerial reconnaissance mission (Operation K) over Pearl Harbor to ascertain if the American carriers were there. The second was a picket line of submarines that would detect the movement of the American carriers toward Midway in time for the First Mobile Force, First Fleet and Second Fleet to combine against it.

The plan was well thought out, well organized and finely timed. Against 4 carriers, 2 light carriers, 11 battleships, 16 cruisers and 46 destroyers likely to be in the area of the main battle the Americans could field only 3 carriers, 8 cruisers, and 15 destroyers. The disparity appeared crushing. Only in numbers of available aircraft and submarines was there seeming parity between the two sides. Barring something extraordinary, it appeared Yamamoto held all the cards.

Unfortunately for Yamamoto, something extraordinary had happened. The worst fear of any commander is that somehow the enemy will learn his battle plan in advance, which is exactly what American [[Cryptography|cryptographers]] had discerned from breaking Japan's primary naval code. As a result, Admiral [[Chester Nimitz|Nimitz]], the Pacific Fleet commander, was able to circumvent both of Yamamoto's security measures and position his outnumbered forces in the exact position to conduct a devastating ambush.

Admiral Nimitz dispatched a destroyer to guard the intended refueling point of Operation K's [[flying boat]]s, causing the reconnaissance mission to be aborted and leaving Yamamoto ignorant of whether the Pacific Fleet was still at Pearl Harbor. He also dispatched his carriers toward Midway early, and they passed the Japanese submarine picket line before the Japanese submarines arrived, negating Yamamoto's back-up security measure. Nimitz's carriers then positioned themselves to ambush the First Mobile Force when it struck Midway. The Aleutians feint was properly ignored, and days before Yamamoto and his forces could reasonably expect American carriers to interfere in the Midway operation, they destroyed the four carriers of the First Mobile Force on [[4 June]] [[1942]] in an attack that caught the Japanese carriers at precisely their most vulnerable moment.

With his air power destroyed and his forces not yet concentrated for a fleet battle, Yamamoto was unable to maneuver his remaining units to trap the American forces when their tactical commander prudently withdrew to the east rather than risk a night surface encounter in which his carriers would be at a disadvantage. Correctly perceiving that he had lost, Yamamoto aborted the invasion of Midway and withdrew his forces from the field, having no desire to occupy a distant atoll he no longer had the capacity to support and defend. The defeat ended Yamamoto's six months of &quot;running wild&quot; and marked the high tide of Japanese expansion.

Yamamoto's plan for the MI Operation has been the subject of much out-of-context criticism. It has been blasted for violating the military principle of concentration of force while the value of other principles such as deception, and envelopment have been blithely waved away by critics. The complexity of the operation has been overemphasized with no regard for parallels in similar Allied operations, or the degree to which the American intelligence coup deranged the Japanese plan. Criticisms of the risk of the operation have freely ignored the pressing necessity of it to neutralize the rebounding Pacific Fleet, as well as the exceptional nature of the American cryptographic victory.

Absent the American code break-through, the MI plan would appear neither particularly complex, diffuse, or dangerous. The Aleutians feint would have drawn American attention, Operation K would have ascertained the Pacific Fleet's whereabouts, the submarine cordon would have picked up the American carriers moving toward Midway, and the First Fleet, Second Fleet and First Mobile Force would have concentrated into a lethal whole.

==Actions after Midway==
The [[Battle of Midway]] solidly checked Japanese momentum, but it was not actually the turning point of the Pacific War. The I.J.N. planned to resume the initiative with operations (FS) aimed at eventually taking Samoa and Fiji to cut the Australian life-line to the United States. This was expected to short-circuit the threat posed by General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and his American and Australian forces in New Guinea. To this end, development of the airfield on Guadalcanal continued and attracted the baleful eye of Yamamoto's opposite number, [[Admiral King]].

King ramrodded the American invasion of Guadalcanal and beat the Japanese to the punch, descending on the island in August 1942 and precipitating a bitter struggle that lasted until February 1943 and commenced a battle of attrition Japan could ill-afford.

Admiral Yamamoto remained in command, retained at least partly to avoid diminishing the morale of the Combined Fleet. However, he had lost face in the Midway defeat and the Naval General Staff were disinclined to indulge further gambles. This reduced Yamamoto to pursuing the classic defensive Decisive Battle strategy he had attempted to overturn.

Guadalcanal caught the Japanese over-extended and attempting to support fighting in New Guinea while guarding the Central Pacific and preparing to conduct the FS Operation. The FS Operation was abandoned and the Japanese attempted to fight in both New Guinea and Guadalcanal at the same time. Already overextended, they perpetually fell short of success for lack of shipping, lack of troops, and a disastrous inability to coordinate Army and Navy activities.

Yamamoto committed Combined Fleet units to a series of small attrition actions that stung the Americans, but suffered loses he could ill-afford in return. Three major efforts to carry the island precipitated a pair of carrier battles that Yamamoto commanded personally at the Eastern Solomons and [[Santa Cruz Islands]] in September and October, and finally a wild pair of surface engagements in November, all timed to coincide with Japanese Army pushes. The timing of each major battle was successively deranged when the Army could not hold up its end of the operation. Yamamoto's forces caused considerable loss and damage, but he could never draw the Americans into a decisive fleet action. As a result, the Japanese Navy's strength began to bleed off.

Particularly harmful were the severe losses of carrier dive-bomber and torpedo-bomber crews in the carrier battles that emasculated the carrier air groups. With Guadalcanal lost in February 1943, there was no further attempt to seek a major battle in the Solomon Islands although smaller attrition battles continued. Yamamoto shifted the load of the air battle from the depleted carriers to the land-based naval air forces. Some of these units were positioned at forward bases in the Solomon Islands, and while on an inspection trip to these positions on [[18 April]] [[1943]], Yamamoto once more fell victim -- this time personally -- to American code-breaking. A squadron of American [[P-38]] fighters ambushed his plane and its escorts.

==Yamamoto's death==
To boost morale following Guadalcanal, Yamamoto decided to make an inspection tour throughout the South Pacific. On [[14 April]] [[1943]], the US naval intelligence effort, code-named &quot;[[Magic (cryptography)|Magic]]&quot;, intercepted and decrypted reports of the tour.

The original message NTF131755, addressed to the commanders of Base Unit No. 1, the 11th Air Flotilla and the 26th Air Flotilla, was encoded in the Japanese Naval Cipher JN-25D (Naval Operations Code Book of the third version of RO), and was picked up by three stations of the &quot;Magic&quot; apparatus, including Fleet Radio Unit Pacific Fleet. The message contained specific details regarding Yamamoto's arrival and departure times and locations, as well as the number and types of planes that would transport and accompany him on the journey. 

Yamamoto, the itinerary revealed, would be flying from Rabaul to Ballale Airfield, on an island near [[Bougainville]] in the [[Solomon Islands]], on [[18 April]]. He and his staff would be flying in two medium bombers ([[G4M]] Bettys  of the 205th Kokutai Naval Air unit), escorted by six fighters ([[A6M]] [[Mitsubishi Zero]]s of the 204th Kokutai NAU), to depart Rabaul at 0600 and arrive at Ballale at 0800, Tokyo time.

Admiral Nimitz consulted Adm. [[William F. Halsey, Jr.]], Commander, South Pacific, then authorized the mission on [[17 April]].

===The Interception Mission===
To avoid detection by radar and Japanese [[coast-watchers]], the mission entailed an over-water flight south of the Solomons, a distance of 430 miles. This was beyond the range of the [[F4F Wildcat]] and [[F4U Corsair]] fighters then available to Navy and Marine squadrons of [[Guadalcanal (Pacific Ocean island)|Guadalcanal's]] [[Cactus Air Force]]. The mission was then given to the [[339th Fighter Squadron]] of the [[347th Fighter Group]], [[13th Air Force]], whose [[P-38 Lightning]] aircraft, equipped with [[drop tanks]], would have the range to intercept and engage.

Planning for this mission was begun by Fighter Command's deputy, Marine LtCol. Luther S. Moore, who had the P-38s fitted with a navy ship's compass at the request of Major John W Mitchell, commanding officer of the 339th. These fighters each carried a 20&amp;nbsp;mm cannon and 4 × 50-calibre (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns and normally carried two 165-gallon (625&amp;nbsp;L) drop tanks under their wings. For this raid a limited supply of 310-gallon (1136&amp;nbsp;L) tanks were flown up from New Guinea, sufficient to provide each Lightning with one of the larger tanks. Despite the differences in size, the tanks were located close enough to the aircraft's center of gravity to negate any performance problems.

Eighteen P-38s were tasked for the mission. One flight of four was designated as the &quot;killer&quot; flight while the remainder, which included two spares, would climb to 18,000 feet to act as &quot;top cover&quot; for the expected reaction by fighters based at Kahili. A flight plan was prepared by the Command Operations Officer, Marine Major John Condon, but was discarded for one prepared by Mitchell. He calculated an intercept time of 0935, based on the itinerary, to catch the bombers descending to land over Bougainville, ten minutes out from Ballale airfield. He worked backwards from that time and drew four precisely-calculated legs, with a fifth leg added if Yamamoto took other than the directmost route. In addition to heading out over the [[Coral Sea]], the 339th would &quot;wave-hop&quot; all the way to Bougainville at altitudes no greater than 50 feet (15&amp;nbsp;m), maintaining radio silence en route.

Although the 339th Fighter Squadron officially flew the mission, ten of the eighteen pilots were drawn from the other two squadrons of the 347th Group. A thorough, detailed briefing included a cover story for the source of the intelligence stating that a coast-watcher had spotted an important high officer boarding an aircraft at Rabaul, but the pilots were aware that their target was Admiral Yamamoto.

The specially-fitted P-38s took off from Guadalcanal's Fighter Two airstrip beginning at 0725. The date, [[April 18]], had the significance of being the one-year anniversary of the [[Doolittle Raid]] as well as being [[Easter Sunday]]. Two of the Lightnings assigned to the killer flight dropped out of the mission at the start, one with a tire flattened during takeoff, and the second when his drop tanks would not feed fuel to the engines.

In Rabaul, despite urgings by local commanders to cancel the trip for fear of ambush, Yamamoto's planes took off as scheduled for the 315-mile trip. They climbed to 6,500 feet, with their fighter escort behind and 1,500 feet higher, split into two V-formations of three planes.

Mitchell's flight of four led the squadron &quot;on the deck&quot; with the killer flight, consisting of Capt. Thomas G. Lanphier, Jr., 1st Lt. Rex T. Barber, and the spares, Lt. Besby F. Holmes and Lt. Raymond K. Hine, immediately behind, fighting off drowsiness, navigating by flight plan and [[dead-reckoning]]. This proved to be the longest fighter-intercept mission of the war, and was so skillfully executed by Major Mitchell that his force arrived at the intercept point one minute early, at 0934, just as the ever-punctual Yamamoto's aircraft descended into view in a light haze. Mitchell ordered his planes to drop tanks, turned to the right to parallel the bombers,  and began a full power climb.

Lt. Holmes was unable to drop his tanks and turned back to sea, followed by his wingman, Lt. Hine. Mitchell radioed Lanphier and Barber to engage and they turned to climb toward the eight aircraft. The closest escort fighters dropped their own tanks and began to dive toward the pair of P-38s. Lanphier, in a sound tactical move, immediately turned head-on and climbed towards the escorts while Barber chased the diving bomber transports. Barber banked steeply to turn in behind the bombers and momentarily lost sight of them, but when he regained contact he was immediately behind one, and began firing into its right engine, rear [[fuselage]], and [[empennage]]. Barber hit its left engine, it began to trail heavy black smoke, and the Betty rolled violently to the left, Barber narrowly avoiding a collision. Looking back he saw a column of black smoke and assumed it had crashed into the jungle. Barber headed towards the coast at treetop level, searching for the second bomber, not knowing which bomber carried Yamamoto.

Barber spotted the second bomber low over the water off Moila Point just as Holmes (whose wing tanks had finally come off) and Hine attacked it. Holmes damaged the right engine of the Betty, which began emitting a white vapor trail, then he and Hine flew over the damaged bomber, carrying Chief of Staff Vice Admiral [[Matome Ugaki]] and part of Yamamoto's staff. Barber next attacked the stricken bomber, pieces of it damaging his own aircraft, and it crash-landed in the water. Ugaki survived the crash as did two others and all were later rescued. Barber, Holmes and Hine were attacked by Zeroes, Barber's P-38 receiving 140 hits, and Holmes and Barber each claimed a Zero shot down during this meleé. The top cover briefly engaged reacting zeroes without making any kills and Major Mitchell observed the column of smoke from Yamamoto's crashed bomber. The P-38s broke off contact and returned to base, with Lt. Holmes so short of fuel that he was forced to land in the [[Russell Islands]]. Hine's Lightning was the only one missing and was never found.

As he approached Henderson Field, Lanphier radioed the Guadalcanal fighter director that &quot;I got Yamamoto&quot;, breaching security on the mission. Immediately on landing (his plane was so short on fuel that one engine quit during landing rollout) he again put in a claim for shooting down the bomber, relating that when he turned to engage the escort Zeroes he shot the wing off one, flipped upside down as he circled back towards the bombers, and saw the lead bomber turning a circle below him. He stated he came out of his turn at a right angle to the circling bomber and fired, blowing off its right wing. He stated that he witnessed Barber shoot down another bomber which also crashed in the jungle. Holmes put in a claim for the Betty that crashed into the water, so it was assumed that three bombers had been downed. The fifteen surviving pilots were not &quot;debriefed&quot; after the mission because this formal interrogation did not exist in the procedures on Guadalcanal at that time, and thus it was never formally established that no one else witnessed Lanphier's claim.
 
Lanphier initially received credit for the kill of Yamamoto's bomber but the other pilots on the mission were immediately skeptical. Although one of the most expertly-executed missions in history, the interception was subsequently marred by controversy over who actually shot down Yamamoto, and by Navy outrage over unauthorized releases of operational details to the press, including an October 1943 issue of ''[[Time Magazine]]'' which featured articles on both the shootdown and Lanphier by name. Mitchell had been nominated for the [[Medal of Honor]] for the mission, but as a result of the security issues this was downgraded to the [[Navy Cross]], which he and all the pilots of the killer flight were subsequently awarded.

After the war it was found that none of the escorting Japanese fighters were even damaged, much less shot down, and Lanphier was stripped of his claim for a Zero shot down. Since other Zero fighters were taking off from nearby Kahili airfield, both Barber and Holmes were allowed their claims during the second combat. Also records confirmed that only two bombers had been shot down, not three, and subsequently the Air Force officially awarded &quot;half kills&quot; to Lanphier and Barber for the Yamamoto shootdown. A video-taped interview in 1985 with one of the escorting Zero pilots, Kenji Yanagiya, appeared to corroborate Barber's claim, but the Air Force declined to reopen the issue.

The crash site and body of Admiral Yamamoto were found the next day in the jungle north of Buin by a Japanese search and rescue party, led by Army engineer Lieutenant Hamasuna. According to Hamasuna, Yamamoto had been thrown clear of the plane's wreckage, his white-gloved hand grasping the hilt of his [[samurai]] [[sword]], still upright in his seat under a tree. Hamasuna said Yamamoto was instantly recognizable, head dipped down as deep in thought. A [[post-mortem]] of the body disclosed that Yamamoto received two wounds, one to the back of his left shoulder and one to his left lower jaw that exited above his right eye. Whether or not the admiral initially survived the crash has also been a matter of controversy in Japan.

In Japan this became known as the &quot;Navy ''kō'' incident&quot;(海軍甲事件). It raised morale in the States, and shocked the Japanese who were officially told about the incident only on [[21 May]] [[1943]]. To cover up the fact that the Allies were reading Japanese code, American news agencies were told the cover story originally created for briefing the 339th, that civilian coast-watchers in the Solomons saw Yamamoto boarding a bomber in the area.

Captain Watanabe and his staff cremated Yamamoto's remains at Buin, and the ashes were returned to Tokyo aboard the battleship [[Japanese battleship Musashi|''Musashi'']], Yamamoto's last flagship. Yamamoto was given a full state funeral on [[3 June]] [[1943]], where he received, posthumously, the title of Fleet Admiral and awarded the [[Order of the Chrysanthemum]], First Class. He was also the only foreigner awarded [[Nazi Germany]]'s highest military order. Part of his ashes were buried in the public cemetery in Tama in Tokyo(多摩霊園), and the remainder at his ancestral burial grounds at the Chuko-Ji Temple in Nagaoka City.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For non-musical meanings of inversion, see [[inversion]].''
In [[music theory]], the word '''''inversion''''' has several meanings. There are inverted ''chords'', inverted ''melodies'', inverted ''intervals'', and (in [[counterpoint]]) inverted ''voices''.  The concept of inversion also plays a role in [[musical set theory]].

==Inverted chords==

An inverted [[chord (music)|chord]] is a chord which has a note other than its [[Root (chord)|root note]] as the [[bass note]]. Since [[Rameau]] (1722), chords remain equivalent when inverted, being functions rather than sonorities. However, before Rameau factors including the ''regola delle terze e seste'', &quot;rule of sixths and thirds&quot;, which required the resolution of imperfect consonances to perfect ones, precluded the analysis of &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sonorites as inversions of &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sonorities.

For example, the ''[[root position]]'' of a triad of C major has the C in the bass:

[[Image:c_triad.png]]

A triad in root position, therefore, consists of the root note and a third and a fifth above it. Triads in root position are also in [[normal form]].

The ''[[first inversion]]'' of the same triad has the E, the third of the triad, in the bass:

[[Image:inv2.png]]

This means that a triad in first inversion consists of the root plus a third and a sixth above it.  The ''[[second inversion]]'' has the fifth, the G, in the bass:

[[Image:inv3.png]]

A triad in second inversion, therefore, consists of the root plus a fourth and a sixth above it. 

The ''third inversion'' of a triad does not really make much sense to discuss, since inverting the second inversion just leads to the tonic again, an octave higher. Chords of four notes or more, however, can be in their third inversion: the third inversion of a [[dominant seventh]] in C major, for example (made up of the notes G, B, D and F) has the seventh, F, in the bass. This gives a chord made up of the root plus a second, fourth and sixth above it. 

The terms &quot;root&quot;, &quot;first inversion&quot;, and &quot;second inversion&quot; may also be applied to chords in which the notes are not closely spaced.  For instance, C-G-E, where the E is a major sixth above G, is also considered to be in root position, and more generally, any C major chord in which C is the lowest note is considered to be in root position.  Similarly, any C major chord with E on the bottom counts as a first inversion, any C major chord with G on the bottom counts as a second inversion; and analogously for all other chords.

===Notations for inverted chords===

There are at least four different notations for the inversions of chords.

(i) Perhaps the most commonly used method is [[figured bass]].  In this system, first inversions are normally indicated by the digit 6 and second inversions by the digits 64.  A full presentation of figured bass notation is given in the Wikipedia article on this subject. 

(ii) The letters a, b, c, etc., may be placed after any chord symbol to indicate the root, first and second inversion respectively. Hence the C chord below, in first inversion (i.e. with E in the bass) may be notated as Cb. (If no letter is added, the chord is assumed to be in root inversion, having the same meaning as if  'a'  had been added explicitly.)

[[Image:inv2.png]]

(iii) A less common, but occasionally used, notation for chord inversion is to place the number 1, 2 or 3  etc. after a chord to indicate that it is in first, second, or third inversion respectively.  Hence the C chord above, in first inversion (i.e. with E in the bass) may be notated as C1. No number is added in the case of a chord in root inversion. This notation should not be confused with a quite different meaning of the same notation, where a number is  placed after a note name to indicate the octave in which a single note is to sound,  e.g. C4 is often used simply to mean the single note [[middle C]].

(iv) A notation for chord inversion often used in [[popular music]] is to write the name of a chord, followed by a forward slash, and then the name of the note that is to sound in the bass. For example, the C chord above, in first inversion (i.e. with E in the bass) may be notated as C/E.  Interestingly, this  notation works consistently even when a note  not present in a triad or other chord is to sound in the bass, e.g. F/G  is a way of notating a particular approach to voicing a G13th chord. This should not be confused with notations of the &quot;[[diatonic functionality|function]] of function&quot; style, for instance the subdominant of the dominant is IV/V or S/D.

==Inverted intervals==

An [[interval (music)|interval]] is inverted by raising or lowering either of the notes the necessary number of [[octave]]s, so that both retain their names ([[pitch class]]) and the one which was higher is now lower and vice versa, changing the perspective or relation between the pitch classes. For example, the inversion of an interval consisting of a C with an E above it is an E with a C above it - to work this out, the C may be moved up, the E may be lowered, or both may be moved. 

Under inversion, perfect intervals remain perfect, major intervals become minor and the reverse, augmented intervals become diminished and the reverse. (Double diminished intervals become double augmented intervals, and the reverse.) Traditional interval names sum to nine: seconds become sevenths and the reverse, thirds become sixes and the reverse, and fourths become fifths and the reverse. Thus a perfect fourth becomes a perfect fifth, an augmented fourth becomes a diminished fifth, and a simple interval (that is, one that is narrower than an octave) and its inversion, when added together, will equal an octave. See also [[complement (music)]].

==Inversion in counterpoint==

Contrapuntal inversion requires that two [[melody|melodies]], having accompanied each other once, do it again with the melody that had been in the high voice now in the low, and vice versa.  Also called &quot;double counterpoint&quot; (if two voices are involved) or &quot;triple counterpoint&quot; (if three), themes that can be developed in this way are said to involve themselves in &quot;invertible counterpoint.&quot;

Invertible counterpoint can occur at various intervals, usually the octave (8va), less often at the 10th or 12th.  To calculate the interval of inversion, add the intervals by which each voice has moved and subtract one.  For example: If motive A in the high voice moves down a 6th, and motive B in the low voice moves up a 5th, in such a way as to result in A and B having exchanged registers, then the two are in double counterpoint at the 10th (6+5)-1 = 10.

Invertible counterpoint achieves its highest expression in the four canons of J. S. Bach's [[Art of Fugue|Art of Fugue]], with the first canon at the 8va, the second canon at the 10th, the third canon at the 12th, and the fourth canon in augmentation and contrary motion.  Other exemplars can be found in the fugues in [http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~tas3/wtc/ii16.html#movie G minor] and [http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~tas3/wtc/ii21.html#movie B-flat major] [external Shockwave movies] from Book II of
