==History==
''Main article: [[History of Alabama]]''

The memory of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] presence is particularly strong in Alabama. Among Native American people once living in present Alabama were [[Alabama (people)|Alabama]] (Alibamu), [[Cherokee]], [[Chickasaw]], [[Choctaw]], [[Creek people|Creek]], [[Koasati]], and [[Mobile (people)|Mobile]].  Trade with the Northeast via the [[Ohio River]] began during the Burial Mound Period  ([[1000 BC]]-A.D. [[700]]) and continued until European contact.  Meso-American influence is evident in the agrarian Mississippian culture that followed.

The [[France|French]] established the first [[Europe]]an settlement in the state with the establishment of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] in [[1702]].  Southern Alabama was French from [[1702]]&amp;ndash;[[1763]], part of British West Florida from [[1763]]&amp;ndash;[[1780]], and part of Spanish West Florida from [[1780]]&amp;ndash;[[1814]]. Northern and central Alabama was part of British Georgia from [[1763]]&amp;ndash;[[1783]] and part of the American Mississippi territory thereafter. Its statehood delayed by the lack of a coastline (rectified when Andrew Jackson captured Spanish Mobile in [[1814]]), Alabama became the 22nd state in [[1819]].

The state of Alabama seceded from the Union on [[January 11]], [[1861]] and became the [[Alabama Republic]] and on [[February 18]] [[1861]] became a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate state]].  While not many battles were fought in the state, it contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]].  After the war a provisional government was set up in [[1865]] and Alabama was officially readmitted to the Union on July 14 [[1868]].

The cradle of the Confederacy during the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]], Alabama was at stage center in the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights movement]] of the [[1950s]] and [[1960s]].

==Law and government==
''Main article: [[Law and Government of Alabama]]''
===Local &amp; County Government===
Alabama has 67 [[county|counties]], each having its own elected legislative branch, usually called the Board of Commissioners, which usually also has executive authority in the county.  Due to the restraints placed in the [[Alabama Constitution]], all but 7 counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have little to no [[home rule]].  Instead, most counties in the state have to lobby to the Local Legislation Committee the state legislature to get simple local policies such as waste disposal to land use zoning.

Alabama is an alcohol monopoly or [[Alcoholic beverage control state]].

===Political Climate===
The current governor of the state is [[Bob Riley (Alabama)|Bob Riley]] and the two U.S. senators are [[Jeff Sessions|Jefferson B. Sessions III]] and [[Richard Shelby|Richard C. Shelby]] (all three from the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]).  The current [[Alabama Constitution]] was adopted in [[1901]].

During [[Reconstruction]] following the [[American Civil War]], Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the [[Third Military District]] under [[John Pope (military officer)|General John Pope]]. In [[1877]], the Reconstruction period ended with the recognition of [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] as President-elect. [[White people|White]] Southerners assumed control of the government and passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise black residents.  The state became part of the &quot;[[Solid South]],&quot; a one-party system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] became essentially the only political party in every Southern state.  For nearly 100 years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary, with generally no Republican challenger running. 

From [[1876]] through [[1956]], Alabama supported only Democratic presidential candidates, by margins as high as 73 percentage points.  In [[1960]], Alabama gave most of its electoral votes to [[Harry F. Byrd]] as a protest.  In [[1964]], the national [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] began to win more votes in the South by following a &quot;[[Southern Strategy]]&quot; which emphasized &quot;[[States' rights|states' rights]]&quot; and the increasing liberalism of the national Democratic Party.  The first such candidate was conservative [[Barry Goldwater]], who became the first Republican candidate supported by Alabama.  In [[1968]], Alabama supported native son and [[American Independent Party]] candidate [[George Wallace]].  

The last Democratic candidate to win Alabama's votes in a presidential election was Southerner [[Jimmy Carter]] in [[1976]].  Today, the Republican party has become increasingly dominant in conservative Alabama politics. However, in local politics, Democrats still control many offices, including majorities in both houses of the Legislature, and registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in the state.  In 2004, [[George W. Bush]] won Alabama's nine electoral votes by a margin of 25 percentage points with 62.5% of the vote.  The only 11 counties voting Democratic were [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]] counties, where [[African American]]s are in the majority.

Alabama is located in the [[Bible Belt]], and its educational policies reflect this. According to the [[Alan Guttmacher Institute]], Alabama requires sex education classes to emphasize &quot;that [[homosexuality]] is not an acceptable lifestyle to the general public and that homosexual conduct is a criminal offense under the laws of the state.&quot; While the mandate is not typically enforced in Alabama classrooms, it is unclear whether or not the official requirements have changed since the Supreme Court's ruling in [[Lawrence v. Texas]]. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], in 2000, Alabama was home to 4,561 same-sex male couples and 4,167 same-sex female couples.

==Geography==
''Main article: [[Geography of Alabama]]''

{{ussm|alabama.PNG|al}}
Alabama is the 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; largest state in the United States with 135,775 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (52,423 mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of total area.  3.19% of that is water, making Alabama 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second largest inland waterway system in the [[United States]].  About three-fifths of the land area is a gentle [[plain]] with a general incline towards the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  The [[North Alabama]] region is mostly mountainous, with the [[Tennessee River]] cutting a large valley creating numerous creeks, streams, rivers, mountains, and lakes.  The lowest point east of the [[Mississippi River]] lies in [[Dekalb County]] along a creek cutting tower ridges, and creating [[Buck's Pocket State Park]].  Another natural wonder is &quot;Land Bridge&quot; the longest natural bridge span east of the [[Mississippi River]].  Alabama generally ranges in [[elevation]] from [[sea level]] at [[Mobile Bay]], to a little more than 1800 [[foot (unit)|feet]] or 550 [[metre|meters]] in the Appalachian mountains in the northeast.  The highest point is [[Mount Cheaha]].

==Economy==
[[Image:wiki_alabama.jpg|thumb|275px|Greetings from Alabama]]
According to the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]], the [[2003]] total [[gross state product]] was $132 billion. The [[per capita income]] for the state was $26,505 in 2003. Alabama's [[agricultural]] outputs include [[poultry]] and [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[cattle]], plant nursery items, [[peanut]]s, [[cotton]], [[grains]] such as [[maize|corn]] and [[sorgum]], [[vegetables]], [[milk]], [[soybeans]], and [[peaches]]. Even though neighboring [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] is called the [[Peach State]], Alabama produces twice as many peaches annually. Its [[Industry|industrial]] outputs include [[iron]] and [[steel]] products, including cast-iron and steel pipe, [[paper]], [[lumber]], and [[wood]] products, [[mining]] (mostly coal), and [[plastic]] products, cars and trucks, and [[apparel]]. Also, Alabama produces [[aerospace]] and [[electronic]] products, mostly in the [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] area, home of the [[NASA]] [[George C. Marshall Space Flight Center]] and the [[United States Army Aviation and Missile Command|US Army Missile Command]], headquartered at [[Redstone Arsenal]].

Also, the city of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] is a busy seaport on the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and with inland waterway access to the Midwest via the [[Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway]].

It is widely believed that the Austroasiatic languages are the [[autochthonous]] languages of Southeast Asia and eastern India, and that the other languages of the region, including the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Tai-Kadai languages|Tai-Kadai]], and [[Sino-Tibetan]] languages, are the result of later [[human migration|migrations of people]]. (There are, for example, Austroasiatic words in the Tibeto-Burman languages of eastern Nepal.) Some linguists have attempted to prove that Austroasiatic languages are related to [[Austronesian languages]], thus forming the [[Austric languages|Austric]] superfamily.

Linguists traditionally recognize two major divisions of Austroasiatic, the [[Mon-Khmer]] languages of Southeast Asia and the [[Munda languages]] of east-central and central India. [[Ethnologue]] identifies 168 Austroasiatic languages, of which 147 are [[Mon-Khmer]] languages and 21 are [[Munda languages]]. However, no evidence for this classification has ever been published, and it remains speculative. 

Each of the subdivisions of the classification below that is written in boldface type is accepted as a valid family. However, the relationships between these families within Austroasiatic is debated. It should be noted that little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published, and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review. The classification used here is that of Diffloth (in press), which does not accept traditional Mon-Khmer as a valid unit.

[[Image:Afro-Asiatic.png|right|300px|thumb|Map showing the distribution of Afro-Asiatic languages]]
The '''Afro-Asiatic languages''' constitute a [[language family]] of about 240 languages and over 307 million people widespread throughout [[North Africa]], [[East Africa]], the [[Sahel]], and [[Southwest Asia]].  Other names sometimes given to this family include &quot;Afrasian&quot;, &quot;Hamito-Semitic&quot; (deprecated), &quot;Lisramic&quot; (Hodge 1972), &quot;Erythraean&quot; (Tucker 1966).

The following language subfamilies are included:

* [[Berber languages]]
* [[Chadic languages]]
* [[Egyptian language|Egyptian languages]]
* [[Semitic languages]]
* [[Cushitic languages]]
* [[Beja language]] (subclassification controversial; widely classified as part of Cushitic)
* [[Omotic languages]] (controversial; sometimes argued to be outside Afro-Asiatic)

The [[Ongota]] language is often considered Afro-Asiatic, but its classification within the family remains controversial, partly for lack of data. [[Harold Fleming]] tentatively suggests that it is an independent branch of non-Omotic Afro-Asiatic.

It is not generally agreed on where [[Proto-Afro-Asiatic]] was spoken; [[Africa]] (e.g., [[Igor Diakonoff]], [[Lionel Bender]]) has often been suggested, particularly [[Ethiopia]], because it includes the majority of the diversity of the Afro-Asiatic language family and has very diverse groups in close geographic proximity, often considered a telltale sign for a linguistic geographic origin. The western [[Red Sea]] coast and the [[Sahara]] have also been put forward (e.g., [[Christopher Ehret]]).  [[Alexander Militarev]] suggests that their homeland was in the [[Levant]] (specifically, he identifies them with the [[Natufian culture]]).

The Semitic languages are the only Afro-Asiatic subfamily based outside of Africa; however, in historical or near-historical times, some Semitic speakers crossed from South Arabia back into Ethiopia, so some modern Ethiopian languages (such as [[Amharic]]) are Semitic rather than belonging to the substrate Cushitic or Omotic groups.  (A minority of academics, e.g. A. Murtonen (1967), dispute this view, suggesting that Semitic may have originated in Ethiopia.)

[[Tonal language]]s are found in the Omotic, Chadic, and South &amp; East Cushitic branches of Afro-Asiatic, according to Ehret (1996). The Semitic, Berber and Egyptian branches are not tonal. 

==Common features and cognates==

Common features of the Afro-Asiatic languages include:
*a two-[[grammatical gender|gender]] system in the singular, with the feminine marked by the /t/ sound,
*[[Verb Subject Object|VSO]] [[linguistic_typology|typology]] with [[Subject Verb Object|SVO]] tendencies,
*a set of [[emphatic consonant]]s, variously realized as glottalized, pharyngealized, or implosive, and
*a templatic [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] in which words inflect by internal changes as well as prefixes and suffixes.


Some cognates are:
*''b-n-'' &quot;build&quot; (Ehret: *''b&amp;#301;n''), attested in Chadic, Semitic (''*bny''), Cushitic (*''m&amp;#301;n''/*''m&amp;#259;n'' &quot;house&quot;) and Omotic (Dime ''bin-'' &quot;build, create&quot;);
*''m-t'' &quot;die&quot; (Ehret: *''maaw''), attested in Chadic (eg Hausa ''mutu''), Egyptian (''mwt'', ''mt'', Coptic ''mu''), Berber (''mmet'', pr. ''yemmut''), Semitic (*''mwt''), and Cushitic (Proto-Somali *''umaaw''/*''-am-w(t)-'' &quot;die&quot;), also similar to the Latin ''mortis'', indicating a possible vocabulary drift
*''s-n'' &quot;know&quot;, attested in Chadic, Berber, and Egyptian;
*''l-s'' &quot;tongue&quot; (Ehret: ''*lis' ''&quot;to lick&quot;), attested in Semitic (*''lasaan/lisaan''), Egyptian (''ns'', Coptic ''las''), Berber (''ils''), Chadic (eg Hausa ''harshe''), and possibly Omotic (Dime ''lits'-'' &quot;lick&quot;);
*''s-m'' &quot;name&quot; (Ehret: *''s&amp;#365;m'' / *''s&amp;#301;m''), attested in Semitic (*''sm''), Berber (''ism''), Chadic (eg Hausa ''suna''), Cushitic, and Omotic (though the Berber form, ''ism'', and the Omotic form, ''sunts'', are sometimes argued to be Semitic [[loanword]]s.)  The Egyptian ''smi'' &quot;report, announce&quot; may also be cognate.
* ''d-m'' &quot;blood&quot; (Ehret: *''dîm'' / *''dâm''), attested in Berber (''idammen''), Semitic (*''dam''), Chadic, and arguably Omotic.  Cushitic *''dîm''/*''dâm'', &quot;red&quot;, may be cognate.


In the verbal system, Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (including Beja) all provide evidence for a prefix conjugation:
{|
|-
| English || Arabic (Semitic) || Kabyle (Berber)
| Saho (Cushitic; verb is &quot;kill&quot;) || Beja (verb is &quot;arrive&quot;)
|-
| he dies || ''yamuutu'' || ''yemmut''
| ''yagdifé'' || ''iktim''
|-
| she dies || ''tamuutu'' || ''temmut''
| ''yagdifé'' || ''tiktim''
|-
| they (m.) die || ''yamuutuuna'' || ''mmuten''
| ''yagdifín'' || ''iktimna''
|-
| you (m. sg.) die || ''tamuutu'' || ''temmuted&amp;#803;''
| ''tagdifé'' || ''tiktima''
|-
| you (m. pl.) die || ''tamuutuuna'' || ''temmutem''
| ''tagdifín'' || ''tiktimna''
|-
| I die || ''&amp;#704;amuutu'' || ''mmute&amp;#947;''
| ''agdifé'' || ''aktim''
|-
| we die || ''namuutu'' || ''nemmut'' || ''nagdifé'' || ''niktim''
|}

A causative affix ''s'' is widespread (found in all its subfamilies), but is also found in other groups, such as the [[Niger-Congo languages]].

The [[possessive pronoun]] suffixes are supported by Semitic, Berber, Cushitic (including Beja), and Chadic.

==Classification history==

Medieval scholars sometimes linked two or more branches of Afro-Asiatic together; already in the [[9th century]], the Hebrew grammarian [[Judah ibn Quraysh]] of [[Tiaret]], [[Algeria]] perceived a relationship between Berber and Semitic (the latter being known to him through Arabic, Hebrew, and Aramaic.)

In the 1800's, Europeans began suggesting such relationships; thus in [[1844]] Th. Benfey suggested a language family containing Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (calling the latter &quot;Ethiopic&quot;).  In the same year, T. N. Newman suggested a relationship between Semitic and Hausa, but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty.  The traditional &quot;Hamito-Semitic&quot; family was named by [[Friedrich Müller]] in [[1876]] in his ''Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft'', and defined as consisting of a Semitic group plus a &quot;Hamitic&quot; group containing Egyptian, Berber, and Cushitic; the Chadic group was not included.  These classifications were partly based on non-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments. (See also [[Hamitic hypothesis]].)

[[Leo Reinisch]] (1909) proposed to link Cushitic and Chadic, while urging a more distant affinity with Egyptian and Semitic, thus foreshadowing Greenberg; but his suggestion was largely ignored. [[Marcel Cohen]] (1924) rejected the idea of a distinct &quot;Hamitic&quot; subgroup, and included Hausa (a Chadic language) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary.  [[Joseph Greenberg]] (1950) strongly confirmed Cohen's rejection of &quot;Hamitic&quot;, added (and sub-classified) the Chadic languages, and proposed the new name Afro-Asiatic for the family; his classification of it came to be almost universally accepted.  In 1969, [[Harold Fleming]] proposed the recognition of [[Omotic]] as a fifth branch, rather than (as previously believed) a subgroup of Cushitic, and this has become generally accepted.  Several scholars, including Harold Fleming and [[Robert Hetzron]], have since questioned the traditional inclusion of Beja in Cushitic, but this view has yet to gain general acceptance.

There is little agreement on the subclassification of the five or six branches mentioned; however, [[Christopher Ehret]] (1979), [[Harold Fleming]] (1981), and [[Joseph Greenberg]] (1981) all agree that Omotic was the first branch to split from the rest. Otherwise, 
*Ehret groups Egyptian, Berber, and Semitic together in a North Afro-Asiatic subgroup; 
*[[Paul Newman (professor)|Paul Newman]] (1980) groups Berber with Chadic and Egyptian with Semitic, while questioning the inclusion of Omotic; 
*Fleming (1981) divided non-Omotic Afroasiatic, or &quot;Erythraean&quot;, into three groups, Cushitic, Semitic, and Chadic-Berber-Egyptian; he later added Semitic and Beja to the latter, and proposed [[Ongota language|Ongotá]] as a tentative new third branch of Erythraean;  
*[[Lionel Bender]] (1997) advocates a &quot;Macro-Cushitic&quot; consisting of Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic, while regarding Chadic and Omotic as the most remote branches;
*[[Vladimir Orel]] and [[Olga Stolbova]] (1995) group Berber with Semitic, Chadic with Egyptian, and split Cushitic into five or more independent branches of Afro-Asiatic, seeing Cushitic as a [[Sprachbund]] rather than a valid family;
*[[Alexander Militarev]] (2000), on the basis of [[lexicostatistics]], groups Berber with Chadic and both, more distantly, with Semitic, as against Cushitic and Omotic.

The '''Principality of Andorra''' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Principat d'Andorra'', [[French language|French]]: ''Principauté d'Andorre'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Principado de Andorra'') is a small, [[landlocked country|landlocked]] [[principality]] in south-western [[Europe]], located in the eastern [[Pyrenees]] mountains and bordered by [[France]] and [[Spain]]. Once isolated, it is currently a prosperous country mainly because of [[tourism]] and its status as a [[tax haven]].  Andorra is not to be confused with the [[Andora|Comune di Andora]].

== Origin and history of the name ==

The name &quot;Andorra&quot; probably originates from a [[Navarre|Navarrese]] word ''andurrial'', which translates as ''shrub-covered land''.

== History ==
{{main|History of Andorra}}

Tradition holds that [[Charlemagne]] granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for their fighting the [[Moors]]. Overlordship of the territory passed to the local [[count of Urgell]] and eventually to the [[bishop]] of the [[diocese]] of Urgell. In the [[11th century]] a dispute arose between the bishop and his northern French neighbour over Andorra.

In 1278, the conflict was resolved by the signing of a [[parage]], which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the French [[count of Foix]] (whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state) and the bishop of [[La Seu d'Urgell]], in  [[Catalonia]]. This gave the small [[principality]] its territory and political form.

Over the years the title passed to the kings of [[Navarre]].  After Henry of Navarre became King [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] of France, he issued an edict (1607) that established the head of the French state and the Bishop of Urgell as co-princes of Andorra.

In the period 1812–13, the French Empire annexed Catalonia and divided it in four departments. Andorra was also annexed and made part of the district of Puigcerdà (département of Sègre).

In 1933 France occupied Andorra as a result of social unrest before elections. On [[July 12]], [[1934]], an adventurer named [[Boris Skossyreff]] issued a proclamation in Urgel, declaring himself Boris I, sovereign prince of Andorra, simultaneously declaring war on the bishop of Urgel. He was arrested by Spanish authorities on [[July 20]] and ultimately expelled from Spain. From 1936 to 1940, a French detachment was garrisoned in Andorra to prevent influences of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and Franco's Spain.
The Franco troops reached the Andorran border in the later stages of the war.

During the [[Second World War]], Andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between [[Vichy France]] and Spain.

In 1958 Andorra declared peace with [[Germany]], having been forgotten on the [[Treaty of Versailles]] that ended the [[First World War]] and remaining legally at war.

Given its relative isolation, Andorra has existed outside the mainstream of European history, with few ties to countries other than France and Spain. In recent times, however, its thriving [[tourism|tourist]] industry along with developments in transportation and communications have removed the country from its isolation and its political system was thoroughly modernized in 1993, the year in which it finally became a member of the United Nations.

== Politics ==
{{main articles|[[Politics of Andorra]] and [[Constitution of Andorra]]}}
{{seealso|List of Co-Princes of Andorra}}

Until very recently, Andorra's political system had no clear division of powers into [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[legislative]], and [[judicial]] branches. Ratified and approved in 1993, the [[Constitution of Andorra|constitution]] establishes Andorra as a sovereign parliamentary democracy that retains the co-princes as [[head of state|heads of state]], but the [[head of government]] retains executive power. The two co-princes serve coequally with limited powers that do not include veto over government acts. They are represented in Andorra by a delegate.

The way in which the two [[prince]]s are chosen makes Andorra one of the most politically distinct nations on earth. One co-Prince is the man or woman who is currently serving as [[President of France]], h (orthography)|digraph]]s and three-letter groups are called [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]]s. [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] uses a tesseragraph (four letters) for one of its phonemes.
* A language may represent the same phoneme with two different letters or combinations of letters.
* A language may spell some words with unpronounced letters that exist for historical or other reasons.
* Pronunciation of individual words may change according to the presence of surrounding words in a sentence.
* Different dialects of a language may use different phonemes for the same word.
* A language may use different sets of symbols or different rules for distinct sets of vocabulary items (such as the Japanese [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] syllabaries, or the various rules in English for spelling words from Latin and Greek, or the original [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] vocabulary.

National languages generally elect to address the problem of dialects by simply associating the alphabet with the national standard.  However, with an international language with wide variations in its dialects, such as [[English language|English]], it would be impossible to represent the language in all its variations with a single phonetic alphabet.

Some national languages like [[Finnish language|Finnish]] have a very regular spelling system with a nearly one-to-one correspondence between letters and phonemes.  The [[Italian language|Italian]] verb corresponding to 'spell', ''compitare'', is unknown to many Italians because the act of spelling itself is almost never needed: each phoneme of Standard Italian is represented in only one way. However, pronunciation cannot always be predicted from spelling because certain letters are pronounced in more than one way. In standard Spanish, it is possible to tell the pronunciation of a word from its spelling, but not vice versa; this is because certain phonemes can be represented in more than one way, but a given letter is consistently pronounced. [[French language|French]], with its [[silent letter]]s and its heavy use of [[nasal vowel]]s and [[elision]], may seem to lack much correspondence between spelling and pronunciation, but its rules on pronunciation are actually consistent and predictable with a fair degree of accuracy.  At the other extreme, however, are languages such as English and [[Irish language|Irish]], where the spelling of many words simply has to be memorized as they do not correspond to sounds in a consistent way. For English, this is because the [[Great Vowel Shift]] occurred after the orthography was established, and because English has acquired a large number of loanwords at different times retaining their original spelling at varying levels.  However, even English has general rules that predict pronunciation from spelling, and these rules are successful most of the time.

The sounds of speech of all languages of the world can be written by a rather small universal phonetic alphabet. A standard for this is the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]].

==Collation==
{{details|Collation}}

An alphabet also serves to establish an ''order'' among letters that can be used for sorting entries in lists, called collating. Note that the order does not have to be constant among different languages using this alphabet; for examples see [[Latin alphabet#Collating in other languages|Latin alphabet: Collating in other languages]].

In recent years the [[Unicode]] initiative has attempted to collate most of the world's known writing systems into a single [[character encoding]]. As well as its primary purpose of standardising computer processing of non-Roman scripts, the Unicode project has provided a focus for script-related scholarship.

==The Alphabet effect==

Some communication theorists (notably those associated with the so-called &quot;Toronto school of communications&quot;, such as [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Harold Innis]] and more recently [[Robert K. Logan]]) have advanced hypotheses to the effect that alphabetic scripts in particular have served to promote and encourage the skills of analysis, coding, decoding, and classification. This set of hypotheses may be known as &quot;the Alphabet effect&quot;, after the title of Logan's [[1986]] work. 

The theory claims that a greater level of abstraction is required due to the greater economy of symbols in alphabetic systems; and this abstraction needed to interpret phonemic symbols in turn has contributed in some way to the development of the societies which use it. Proponents of this theory hold that the development of alphabetic (as distinct to other types of) writing systems has made a significant impact on &quot;Western&quot; thinking and development because it introduced a new level of abstraction, analysis, and classification. McLuhan and Logan (1977) postulates that, as a result of these skills, the use of the alphabet created an environment conducive to the development of codified law, monotheism, abstract science, deductive logic, objective history, and individualism. According to Logan, &quot;All of these innovations, including the alphabet, arose within the very narrow geographic zone between the Tigris-Euphrates river system and the Aegean Sea, and within the very narrow time frame between 2000 B.C. and 500 B.C.&quot; (Logan 2004). 

However, many of these abstractions first occurred in societies which did not use an alphabet, such as the codified law of [[Hammurabi]] in [[Babylonia]], which predated similar codes in societies with the alphabet. Since the alphabet quickly spread to become nearly ubiquitous, it is difficult to trace cause and effect in this matter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], the '''atomic number''' ('''Z''') is the number of [[proton]]s found in the nucleus of an [[atom]]. In an atom of [[neutral|neutral charge]], the number of [[electrons]] ''also'' equals the atomic number.

The atomic number originally meant the number of an element's place in the [[periodic table]]. When [[Dmitriy Mendeleyev|Mendeleyev]] arranged the known [[chemical element]]s grouped by their similarities in chemistry, it was noticeable that placing them in strict order of [[atomic weight|atomic mass]] resulted in some mismatches. [[Iodine]] and [[tellurium]], if listed by atomic mass, appeared to be in the wrong order, and would fit better if their places in the table were swapped. Placing them in the order which fit chemical properties most closely, their number in the table was their atomic number. This number appeared to be approximately proportional to the mass of the atom, but, as the discrepancy showed, reflected some other property than mass. 

The anomalies in this sequence were finally explained after research by [[Henry Moseley|Henry Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley]] in [[1913]]. Moseley discovered a strict relationship between the [[x-ray diffraction]] spectra of elements, and their correct location in the periodic table. It was later shown that the atomic number corresponds to the [[electric charge]] of the nucleus &amp;mdash; in other words the number of protons. It is the charge which gives elements their chemical properties, rather than the atomic mass.

The atomic number is closely related to the [[mass number]] (although they should not be confused) which is the number of protons and [[neutron|neutrons]] in the nucleus of an atom. The mass number often comes after the name of the element, e.g. [[carbon-14]] (used in [[carbon dating]]).

'''Anatomy''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{polytonic|ἀνατομία}} anatomia'', from '' {{polytonic|ἀνατέμνειν}} anatemnein'', to cut up, cut open), is the branch of [[biology]] that deals with the structure and organization of living things. It can be divided into animal anatomy ([[zootomy]]) and plant anatomy ([[phytonomy]]).  Furthermore, anatomy can be covered either regionally or systemically, that is, studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest for the former, or studying by specific systems, such as the nervous or respiratory systmes for the latter. Major branches of anatomy include [[comparative anatomy]], [[histology]], and [[human anatomy]]. 

==Animal anatomy==
Animal anatomy may include the study of the structure of different animals, when it is called [[comparative anatomy]] or [[animal morphology]], or it may be limited to one animal only, in which case it is spoken of as ''special anatomy''.

==Human anatomy==
From a utilitarian point of view the study of [[human]]s is the most important division of special anatomy, and this human anatomy may be approached from different points of view. 

From that of Medicine it consists of a knowledge of the exact form, position, size and relationship of the various structures of the healthy human body, and to this study the term descriptive or topographical human anatomy is given, though it is often, less happily, spoken of as ''anthropotomy''.

So intricate is the [[human body]] that only a small number of professional human anatomists, after years of patient observation, are complete masters of all its details; most of them specialize on certain parts, such as the brain or viscera, contenting themselves with a good working knowledge of the rest.

''Topographical anatomy'' must be learned by repeated dissection and inspection of dead human bodies.  
It is no more a [[science]] than a pilot's knowledge is, and, like that knowledge, must be exact and available in moments of emergency. 

From the morphological point of view, however, human anatomy is a scientific and fascinating study, having for its object the discovery of the [[morphogenesis|causes]] which have brought about the existing structure of humans, and needing a knowledge of the allied sciences of [[embryology]] or [[developmental biology]], [[phylogeny]], and [[histology]]. 

''[[Anatomical pathology|Pathological anatomy]]'' (or ''morbid anatomy'') is the study of [[disease]]d [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s, while sections of normal anatomy, applied to various purposes, receive special names such as medical, surgical, gynaecological, artistic and superficial anatomy.  
The comparison of the anatomy of different [[race]]s of humans is part of the science of physical anthropology or anthropological anatomy.  
In the present edition of this work the subject of anatomy is treated systematically rather than topographically.  
Each anatomical article contains first a description of the structures of an organ or system (such as [[nerve]]s, [[Artery|arteries]], [[heart]], and so forth), as it is found in humans; this is followed by an account of the development (embryology) and comparative anatomy (morphology), as far as [[Vertebrate|vertebrate animals]] are concerned; but only those parts of the lower animals which are of interest in explaining human body structure are here dealt with.  
The articles have a twofold purpose; first, to give enough details of structure to make the articles on physiology, surgery, medicine and pathology intelligible; and, secondly, to give the non-expert inquirer, or the worker in some other branch of science, the chief theories on which the modern scientific groundwork of anatomy is built.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Affirming the consequent''' is a [[logical fallacy]] in the form of a hypothetical proposition.  Propositionally speaking, Affirming the Consequent is the logical equivalent of assuming the converse of a statement to be true.  The fallacy of affirming the consequent occurs when a hypothetical proposition comprising an [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and a [[consequent]] asserts that the truthhood of the consequent implies the truthhood of the antecedent.  This is fallacious because it assumes a bidirectionality when it does not necessarily exist.

This fallacy has the following [[argument form]]:
:If P, then Q.
:Q.
:Therefore, P.

This logical error is called the fallacy of affirming the consequent because it is mistakenly concluded from the second premise that the affirmation of the consequent entails the truthhood of the antecedent. One way to demonstrate the invalidity is to use a counterexample. Here is an argument that is obviously incorrect:

:If [[Stephen King]] wrote the [[Bible]] (P), then Stephen King is a good writer (Q).
:Stephen King is a good writer (Q).
:Therefore, Stephen King wrote the Bible (P).

The previous argument was obviously incorrect, but the next argument may be more deceiving:

:If someone is human (P), then she is mortal (Q).
:Anna is mortal (Q).
:Therefore Anna is human (P).

But in fact Anna can be a cat; very much a mortal, but not a human one.

However, be aware that a similar [[argument form]] is [[validity|valid]] in which the first premise asserts &quot;[[if and only if]]&quot; rather than &quot;if&quot;.  Similarly, the converse of a statement can be validly assumed to be true so long as the &quot;[[if and only if]]&quot; phrase is attached.

'''Andrei Arsenyevich Tarkovsky''' (Андре́й Арсе́ньевич Тарко́вский) ([[April 4]], [[1932]] - [[December 28]], [[1986]]) was a [[Russia]]n movie director, writer, and actor. He is regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era in Russia and one of the greatest in the [[history of film|history of cinema]]. 

==Biography==
Tarkovskty of Middle Eastern&amp;mdash;especially Egyptian&amp;mdash;films and other media).

One factor in the differentiation of the dialects is influence from the languages previously spoken in the areas, which have typically provided a significant number of new words, and have sometimes also influenced pronunciation or word order; however, a much more significant factor for most dialects is, as among [[Romance languages]], retention (or change of meaning) of different classical forms. Thus Iraqi ''aku'', Levantine ''fiih'', and North African ''kayen'' all mean &quot;there is&quot;, and all come from Arabic (''yakuun'', ''fiihi'', ''kaa'in'' respectively), but now sound very different.

The major groups are:

*[[Egyptian Arabic]]
*[[Maghreb Arabic]] ([[Algerian Arabic]], [[Moroccan Arabic]], [[Tunisian Arabic]] and western Libyan)
*[[Levantine Arabic]] (Western Syrian, Lebanese, Palestinian, and western Jordanian, [[Cypriot Maronite Arabic]])
*[[Iraqi Arabic]] ([[Khuzestani Arabic]]), which has significant [[Persian language|Persian]] influence and is not understood by most other Arabic speakers
*[[Gulf Arabic]]   (Eastern Syrian, Kuwaiti, Saudi Arabian, Persian Gulf coast from Iraq to Oman including much of Saudi Arabia's [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]], and minorities on the other side)

Other varieties include:

* {{unicode|[[Hassaniya|Ḥassānīya]]}} (in Mauritania and western Sahara)
* [[Andalusi Arabic]] (extinct, but important role in literary history)

{{IPA notice}}
The phonemes below reflect the pronunciation of Standard Arabic.

===Vowels===

Arabic has three vowels, with their long forms, plus two diphthongs: ''a'' {{IPA|[ɛ̈]}} (open ''e'' as in English ''bed'', but centralised), ''i'' {{IPA|[ɪ]}}, ''u'' {{IPA|[ʊ]}}; ''ā'' {{IPA|[æː]}}, ''ī'' {{IPA|[iː]}}, ''ū'' {{IPA|[uː]}}; ''ai'' (''ay'') {{IPA|[ɛ̈ɪ]}}, ''au'' (''aw'') {{IPA|[ɛ̈ʊ]}}. [[Allophone|Allophonically]], after velarized consonants (see following), the vowel ''a'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ɑ]}}, ''ā'' as {{IPA|[ɑː]}} (thus also after ''r''), ''ai'' as {{IPA|[ɑɪ]}} and ''au'' as {{IPA|[ɑʊ]}}.

See [[Arabic alphabet]] for explanations on the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] phonetic symbols found in this chart.

# {{IPA|[dʒ]}} is pronounced as {{IPA|[ɡ]}} by some speakers. This is especially characteristic of the Egyptian and southern Yemeni dialects. In many parts of North Africa and in the Levant, it is pronounced as {{IPA|[ʒ]}}.
# {{IPA|/l/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[lˁ]}} only in {{IPA|/ʔalˁːɑːh/}}, the name of God, i.e. [[Allah]], when the word follows ''a'', ''ā'', ''u'' or ''ū'' (after ''i'' or ''ī'' it is unvelarised: ''bismi l-lāh'' {{IPA|/bɪsmɪlːæːh/}}).
# {{IPA|/ʕ/}} is usually a phonetic [[approximant]].
# In many varieties (if not most), {{IPA|/ħ, ʕ/}} are actually [[epiglottal]] {{IPA|[ʜ, ʢ]}} (despite what is reported in many earlier works).

The consonants traditionally termed &quot;emphatic&quot; {{IPA|/tˁ, dˁ, sˁ, ðˁ/}} are either [[velarization|velarised]] {{IPA|[tˠ, dˠ, sˠ, ðˠ]}} or [[pharyngealization|pharyngealised]] {{IPA|[tˁ, dˁ, sˁ, ðˁ]}}.  In some transcription systems, emphasis is shown by capitalizing the letter e.g. {{IPA|/dˁ/}}  is written ‹D›; in others the letter is underlined or has a dot below it e.g. ‹ḍ›.

Vowels and consonants can be (phonologically) short or long.  Long (geminate) consonants are normally written doubled in Latin transcription (i.e. bb, dd, etc.), reflecting the presence of the Arabic diacritic mark [[shaddah]], which marks lengthened consonants.  Such consonants are held twice as long as short consonants.  This consonant lengthening is phonemically contrastive: e.g.  ''qabala'' &quot;he received&quot; and  ''qabbala'' &quot;he kissed&quot;.

===Syllable structure===
Arabic has two kinds of syllable: open syllables (CV) and (CVV) - and closed syllables (CVC), (CVVC) and (CVCC).  Every syllable begins with a consonant - or else a consonant is borrowed from a previous word through elision – especially in the case of the definite article THE, ''al'' (used when starting an utterance) or ''_l'' (when following a word), e.g. ''baytu –l mudiir'' “house (of) the director”, which becomes ''bay-tul-mu-diir'' when divided syllabically.  By itself, definite ''mudiir'' would be pronounced {{IPA|/al mudiːr/}}.

===Stress===
Although word stress is not phonemically contrastive in Standard Arabic, it does bear a strong relationship to vowel length and syllable shape, and correct word stress aids intelligibility.  In general, &quot;heavy&quot; syllables attract stress (i.e. syllables of longer duration - a closed syllable or a syllable with a long vowel).  In a word with a syllable with one long vowel, the long vowel attracts the stress (e.g. ''ki-'taab'' and ''  ‘kaa-tib'').  In a word with two long vowels, the second long vowel attracts stress (e.g.''ma-kaa-'tiib''). In a word with a &quot;heavy&quot; syllable where two consonants occur together or the same consonant is doubled, the (last) heavy syllable attracts stress (e.g. ''ya-ma-’niyy'', ''ka-'tabt'', ''ka-‘tab-na'', ma-‘jal-lah,'' ‘mad-ra-sah'', ''yur-‘sil-na'').  This last rule trumps the first two: ''ja-zaa-{{unicode|ʔ}}i-‘riyy''.  Otherwise, word stress typically falls on the first syllable: '' ‘ya-man'', ''  ‘ka-ta-bat'', etc.  The Cairo ([[Egyptian Arabic]]) dialect, however, has some idiosyncrasies in that a heavy syllable may not carry stress more than two syllables from the end of a word, so that ''mad-‘ra-sah'' carries the stress on the second-to-last syllable, as does ''qaa-‘hi-rah''.

===Dialectal variations===
In some dialects, there may be more or fewer phonemes than those listed in the chart above.  For example, non-Arabic {{IPA|[v]}} is used in the Maghreb dialects as well in the written language mostly for foreign names.  Semitic {{IPA|[p]}} became {{IPA|[f]}} extremely early on in Arabic before it was written down; a few modern Arabic dialects, such as Iraqi (influenced by [[Persian language|Persian]]) distinguish between {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[b]}}.  Interdental fricatives ({{IPA|[θ]}} and {{IPA|[ð]}}) are rendered as stops {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[d]}} in some dialects (principally Levantine and Egyptian) and as {{IPA|[s]}} and {{IPA|[z]}} in &quot;learned&quot; words from the Standard language.  Early in the expansion of Arabic, the separate emphatic phonemes {{IPA|[dˁ]}} and {{IPA|[ðˁ]}} coallesced into a single phoneme, becoming one or the other.  Predictably, dialects without interdental fricatives use {{IPA|[dˁ]}} exclusively, while those with such fricatives use {{IPA|[ðˁ]}}.  Again, in &quot;learned&quot; words from the Standard language, {{IPA|[ðˁ]}} is rendered as {{IPA|[zˁ]}} in dialects without interdental fricatives.  Another key distinguishing mark of Arabic dialects is how they render Standard {{IPA|[q]}} (a voiceless uvular stop): it retains its original pronunciation in widely scattered regions such as Yemen and Morocco (and among the [[Druze]]), while it is rendered {{IPA|[ɡ]}} in Gulf Arabic, Iraqi Arabic, Upper Egypt and less urban parts of the Levant (e.g. Jordan) and as a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[ʔ]}} in many prestige dialects, such as those spoken in Cairo, Beirut and Damascus.  Thus, Arabs instantly give away their geographical (and class) origin by their pronunciation of a word such as ''qamar'' &quot;moon&quot;:  {{IPA|[qamar]}}, {{IPA|[ɡamar]}} or {{IPA|[ʔamar]}}.

== Grammar ==
''See [[Arabic grammar]]''


== Writing system ==
''Main article: [[Arabic alphabet]]''

The Arabic alphabet derives from the [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]] script (which variety - [[Nabataean]] or [[Syriac]] - is a matter of scholarly dispute), to which it bears a loose resemblance like that of [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] or [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic script]] to [[Greek alphabet|Greek script]]. Traditionally, there were several differences between the Western (Maghrebi) and Eastern version of the alphabet&amp;mdash;in particular, the ''fa'' and ''qaf'' had a dot underneath and a single dot above respectively in the [[Maghreb]], and the order of the letters was slightly different (at least when they were used as numerals). However, the old Maghrebi variant has been abandoned except for calligraphic purposes in the Maghreb itself, and remains in use mainly in the Quranic schools ([[zaouia]]s) of West Africa. Arabic, like other [[Semitic]] languages, is written from right to left.

===Calligraphy===

''See [[Arabic calligraphy]] for a fuller overview.''

After the definitive fixing of the Arabic script around [[786]], by [[Khalil ibn Ahmad al Farahidi]], many styles were developed, both for the writing down of the Qur'an and other books, and for inscriptions on monuments as decoration.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Kufi.png|Kufic font]] --&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Arabic calligraphy has not fallen out of use as in the Western world, and is still considered by Arabs as a major art form; calligraphers are held in great esteem. Being cursive by nature, unlike the [[Latin alphabet]], Arabic script is used to write down a [[ayah|verse]] of the Qur'an, a [[Hadith]], or simply a [[proverb]], in a spectacular composition. The composition is often abstract, but sometimes the writing is shaped into an actual form such as that of an animal. Two of the current masters of the genre are [[Hassan Massoudy]] and [http://arabworld.nitle.org/gallery.php?module_id=7 Khaled Al Saa’i].

===Transliteration===

''See [[Arabic transliteration]] and [[Arabic Chat Alphabet]] for more information.''

There are a number of different standards of [[Arabic transliteration]]: methods of accurately and efficiently representing Arabic with the [[Latin alphabet]]. The more scientific standards allow the reader to recreate the exact word using the [[Arabic alphabet]]. However, these systems are heavily reliant on [[diacritic]]al marks such as &quot;š&quot; for the English ''sh'' sound.  At first sight, this may be difficult to recognize.  Less scientific, systems often use [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s (like ''sh'' and ''kh''), which are usually more simple to read, but sacrifice the definiteness of the scientific systems.  In some cases, the ''sh'' or ''kh'' sounds can be represented by italicizing or underlining them -- that way, they can be distinguished from separate ''s'' and ''h'' sounds or ''k'' and ''h'' sounds, respectively.  (Compare ''gashouse'' to ''gash''.)

During the last few decades and especially since the 1990s, Western-invented text communication technologies have become prevalent in the [[Arab world]], such as [[personal computers]], the [[World Wide Web]], [[email]], [[Bulletin board system]]s, [[IRC]], [[instant messaging]] and [[mobile phone text messaging]]. Most of these technologies originally had the ability to communicate using the [[Latin alphabet]] only, and some of them still do not have the [[Arabic alphabet]] as an optional feature. As a result, Arabic speaking users communicated in these technologies by transliterating the Arabic text using the Latin script, sometime known as [[IM_Arabic]].

To handle those Arabic letters that cannot be accurately represented using the Latin script, numerals and other characters were appropriated. For example, the numeral &quot;3&quot; may be used to represent the Arabic letter &quot;ع&quot;, ''ayn''. There is no universal name for this type of transliteration, but some have named it [[Arabic Chat Alphabet]].  Other systems of transliteration exist, such as using dots or capitalization to represent the &quot;emphatic&quot; counterparts of certain consonants.  For instance, using capitalization, the letter &quot;د&quot;, or ''daal'', may be represented by '''d'''.  Its emphatic counterpart, &quot;ض&quot;, may be written as '''D'''.

'''''Apocalypse Now''''' is a [[1979 in film|1979]] [[United States|American]] [[film]] directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]] from a script by [[John Milius]] (rewritten by Coppola) which was inspired by [[Joseph Conrad]]'s classic [[novella]] ''[[Heart of Darkness]]''. Set during the [[Vietnam War]], the film tells the story of a taciturn American soldier who is sent to &quot;terminate with extreme prejudice&quot; the command of a rogue [[United States Army Special Forces]] [[colonel]]. The narrative of his journey and its culmination are studded with events which, while bizarre, are based on real Vietnam stories. The soldier's journey becomes increasingly nonlinear and hallucinatory. Coppola's agenda clearly involves larger themes; the film's subtext concerns a journey into the darkness of the human [[psyche]].

The film features performances by [[Martin Sheen]] as Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Marlow in Conrad's novel), [[Marlon Brando]] as Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, [[Dennis Hopper]] as a fast-talking [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogen]]-using photojournalist, and [[Robert Duvall]] in an [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated turn as the borderline-[[psychosis|psychotic]] [[Lt. Colonel]] Kilgore. Several other actors who were (or later became) prominent stars had minor or supporting roles in the movie including [[Harrison Ford]], [[R. Lee Ermey]] and [[Laurence Fishburne]] (who, only fourteen years old when shooting began in March 1976, was credited as 'Larry Fishburne').

The movie poster art for ''Apocalypse Now'' is one of the more famous paintings by [[Bob Peak]], who is considered an influential artist in the world of film when it comes to [[movie poster]]s.

==Background==
Filmed in the [[Philippines]] (most notably the [[Pagsanjan River]] and [[Hidden Valley Springs]]), the film went far over budget and schedule: a [[typhoon]] destroyed many of the sets, the Philippine Air Force helicopters used for shooting were constantly called back by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] to be used in actual combat, the lead role was recast (Martin Sheen replaced [[Harvey Keitel]] after shooting had begun), Sheen then had a near-fatal [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], Brando was intractable and out of shape, and Coppola himself was mentally fragivaria]]. The [[Central Austro-Bavarian]] dialects are more intelligible to speakers of Standard German than the [[Southern Austro-Bavarian]] dialects of [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]]. [[Viennese language|Viennese]], the Austro-Bavarian dialect of [[Vienna]], is most frequently used in [[Germany]] for impersonations of the typical inhabitant of Austria. The people of [[Graz]], the capital of [[Styria (state)|Styria]], speak yet another dialect which is not very Styrian and more easily understood by people from other parts of Austria than other Styrian dialects, for example from western [[Styria (state)|Styria]].

Simple words in the various dialects are very similar, but pronunciation is distinct for each and it is very easy for an Austrian after a few spoken words to judge which  Austrian dialect someone speaks. However, if it goes into the dialects of the deeper valleys of [[Tyrol]], sometimes even other Tyroleans are helpless to understand the dialect. Speakers from the different [[States of Austria|states]] of Austria can usually easily be distinguished from each other by their particular accents (probably more so than Bavarians), with those of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Styria (state)|Styria]], [[Vienna]], [[Upper Austria]], and the Tyrol being very characteristic. Speakers from those regions, even those speaking [[Standard German]], can usually be easily identified by their accent, even by an untrained listener. 

Several of the dialects have been influenced by contact with non-Germanic linguistic groups, such as the dialect of Carinthia, where in the past many speakers were bilingual with [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], and the dialect of Vienna, which has been influenced by immigration during the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] period, particularly from what is today the [[Czech Republic]]. 

Interestingly, the geographic borderlines between the different accents coincide strongly with the borders of the states and also with the border to [[Bavaria]], with Bavarians having a markedly different rhythm of speech in spite of the similarities in the language as such.

==Standard German in Austria==
With German being a [[pluricentric language]], Austrian dialects should not be confused with the variety of [[Standard German]] spoken by most Austrians, which is distinct from that of [[Germany]] or [[Switzerland]]. Distinctions in vocabulary persist, for example, in [[culinary]] terms, where communication with Germans is frequently difficult, and [[administration|administrative]] and [[law|legal]] language, which is due to Austria's exclusion from the development of a German [[nation-state]] in the late [[19th century]] and its manifold particular traditions.

Austrians speaking Standard German can almost always be recognised by their accent, much more so than speakers from most regions of [[Germany]].

When Austria became a member of the European Union, the Austrian variety of the German language (limited to 23 agricultural terms) was “protected” in the so-called Protocol no. 10 regarding the use of specific Austrian terms of the German language in the framework of the European Union, which forms part of the Austrian EU accession treaty. Austrian German is the only variety of a pluricentric language recognised under international law / EU primary law.

Dialects are receding in Austria as they are in some other areas of [[Europe]], but it can safely be said that they are more persistent than in most of Germany. Dialects are frequently used in TV series or movies in situation where it is appropriate for the particular character and situation. A classic example of a strong form of Viennese working-class dialect, for example, would be ''[[Ein echter Wiener geht nicht unter]]''. However, strong varieties of dialect are not used quite as much as, for example, in Switzerland. For example, educated people in Vienna usually speak a very slight form of dialect or simply Standard German, but with the characteristic Viennese accent and, where it exists, particular Austrian and Viennese vocabulary.

A good reference for the Austrian, Bavarian and other German dialects are the dialect (&quot;Mundart&quot;) editions of [[Asterix]] and [[Obelix]] comic books which are available in [[Viennese language|Viennese]] (three editions with different dialects from inside [[Vienna]]) and at least one for the common Tyrolean dialect and one for a deep Styrian dialect.

      <comment>/* Results requiring ¬AC */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], the '''axiom of choice''', or '''AC''', is an [[axiom]] of [[set theory]]. It was formulated in [[1904]] by [[Ernst Zermelo]].  While it was originally controversial, it is now used without embarrassment by most mathematicians.  However, there are still schools of mathematical thought, primarily within set theory, that either reject the axiom of choice, or even investigate consequences of axioms inconsistent with AC.

Intuitively speaking, AC says that given a collection of bins, each containing at least one object, then exactly one object from each bin can be picked and gathered in another bin - even if there are [[infinite]]ly many bins, and there is no &quot;rule&quot; for which object to pick from each.

== Statement ==

The axiom of choice states:
:Let ''X'' be a [[set]] of [[non-empty]] sets. Then we can [[choice function|choose]] a member from each set in ''X''.
Stated more formally:
:Let ''X'' be a set of non-empty sets. Then there exists a [[choice function]] ''f'' defined on ''X''. In other words, there exists a function ''f'' defined on ''X'', such that for each set ''s'' in ''X'', ''f''(''s'') is an element of ''s''.
Another formulation of the axiom of choice states:
:Given any set of mutually disjoint non-empty sets, there exists at least one set that contains exactly one element in common with each of the non-empty sets.

== Usage ==

Until the late 19th century, the axiom of choice was often used implicitly. For example, after having established that the set ''X'' contains only non-empty sets, a mathematician might have said &quot;let ''F(s)'' be one of the members of ''s'' for all ''s'' in ''X''.&quot;  In general, it is impossible to prove that ''F'' exists without the axiom of choice, but this seems to have gone unnoticed until Zermelo.

Not every situation requires the axiom of choice.  For finite sets ''X'', the axiom of choice follows from the other axioms of set theory.  In that case it is equivalent to saying that if we have several (a finite number of) boxes, each containing at least one item, then we can choose exactly one item from each box.  Clearly we can do this: We start at the first box, choose an item; go to the second box, choose an item; and so on.  There are only finitely many boxes, so eventually our choice procedure comes to an end.  The result is an explicit choice function: a function that takes the first box to the first element we chose, the second box to the second element we chose, and so on.  (A formal proof for all finite sets would use the principle of [[mathematical induction]].)

For certain infinite sets ''X'', it is also possible to avoid the axiom of choice.  For example, suppose that the elements of ''X'' are sets of natural numbers.  Every nonempty set of natural numbers has a least element, so to specify our choice function we can simply say that it takes each set to the least element of that set.  This gives us a definite choice of an element from each set and we can write down an explicit expression that tells us what value our choice function takes.  Any time it is possible to specify such an explicit choice, the axiom of choice is unnecessary.

The difficulty appears when there is no natural choice of elements from each set.  If we cannot make explicit choices, how do we know that our set exists?  For example, suppose that ''X'' is the set of all non-empty subsets of the [[real number]]s.  First we might try to proceed as if ''X'' were finite.  If we try to choose an element from each set, then, because ''X'' is infinite, our choice procedure will never come to an end, and consequently, we will never be able to produce a choice function for all of ''X''.  So that won't work.  Next we might try the trick of specifying the least element from each set.  But some subsets of the real numbers don't have least elements.  For example, the open interval (0,1) does not have a least element: If ''x'' is in (0,1), then so is ''x''/2, and ''x''/2 is always strictly smaller than ''x''.  So taking least elements doesn't work, either.

The reason that we are able to choose least elements from subsets of the natural numbers is the fact that the natural numbers are [[well-order]]ed: Every subset of the natural numbers has a unique least element.  Perhaps if we were clever we might say, &quot;Even though the usual ordering of the real numbers does not work, it may be possible to find a different ordering of the real numbers which is a well-ordering.  Then our choice function can choose the least element of every set under our unusual ordering.&quot;  The problem then becomes constructing such an ordering, and it turns out that every set can be well-ordered if and only if the axiom of choice is true.

A proof requiring the axiom of choice is always [[nonconstructive proof|nonconstructive]]: even if the proof produces an object then it is impossible to say exactly what that object is.  Consequently, while the axiom of choice asserts that there is a well-ordering of the real numbers, it does not give us an example of one.  Yet the reason why we chose above to well-order the real numbers was so that for each set in ''X'', we could explicitly choose an element of that set.  If we cannot write down the well-ordering we are using, then our choice is not very explicit.  This is one of the reasons why some mathematicians dislike the axiom of choice.  For example, [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivists]] posit that all existence proofs should be totally explicit; it should be possible to construct anything that exists.  They reject the axiom of choice because it asserts the existence of an object without telling what it is.

== Independence of AC ==

By work of [[Kurt Gödel]] and [[Paul Cohen]], the axiom of choice is [[logically independent]] of the other axioms of [[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF).  This means that neither it nor its negation can be proven to be true in ZF.  Consequently, assuming the axiom of choice, or its negation, will never lead to a contradiction that could not be obtained without that assumption.

So the decision whether or not it is appropriate to make use of the axiom of choice in a proof cannot be made by appeal to other axioms of set theory.  The decision must be made on other grounds.

One argument given in favor of using the axiom of choice is that it is convenient to use it: using it cannot hurt (cannot result in contradiction) and makes it possible to prove some propositions that otherwise could not be proved.

The axiom of choice is not the only significant statement which is independent of ZF.  For example, the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] (GCH) is not only independent of ZF, but also independent of ZF plus the axiom of choice (ZFC).  However, ZF plus GCH implies AC, making GCH a strictly stronger claim than AC, even though they are both independent of ZF.

One reason that some mathematicians dislike the axiom of choice is that it implies the existence of some bizarre counter-intuitive objects.  An example of this is the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]] which says in effect that it is possible to &quot;carve up&quot; the 3-dimensional solid unit ball into finitely many pieces and, using only rotation and translation, reassemble the pieces into two balls each with the same volume as the original.  Note that the proof, like all proofs involving the axiom of choice, is an existence proof only: it does not tell us how to carve up the unit sphere to make this happen, it simply tells us that it can be done.

On the other hand, the [[negation]] of the axiom of choice is also bizarre.  For example, the statement that for any two sets ''S'' and ''T'', the [[cardinality]] of ''S'' is less than or equal to the cardinality of ''T'' or the cardinality of ''T'' is less than or equal to the cardinality of ''S'' is equivalent to the axiom of choice.  Put differently, if the axiom of choice is false, then there are sets ''S'' and ''T'' of incomparable size: neither can be mapped in a one-to-one fashion onto a subset of the other.

A third possibility is to prove theorems using neither the axiom of choice nor its negation, a tactic preferred in constructive mathematics.  Such statements will be true in any [[model theory|model]] of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, regardless of the truth or falsity of the axiom of choice in that particular model.  This renders any claim that relies on either the axiom of choice or its negation undecidable.  For example, under such an assumption, the Banach–Tarski paradox is neither true nor false: It is impossible to construct a decomposition of the unit ball which can be reassembled into two unit balls, and it is also impossible to prove that it can't be done.  However, the Banach–Tarski paradox can be rephrased as a statement about models of ZF by saying, &quot;In any model of ZF in which AC is true, the Banach–Tarski paradox is true.&quot;  Similarly, all the statements listed below under [[#Results requiring AC|Results requiring AC]] are undecidable in ZF, but since each is provable in any model of ZFC, there are models of ZF in which each statement is true.

== Weaker forms of AC ==

There are several weaker statements which are not equivalent to the axiom of choice, but which are closely related.  A simple one is the [[axiom of countable choice]], which states that a choice function exists for any countable set ''X''.  This usually suffices when trying to make statements about the real numbers, for example, because the rational numbers, which are countable, form a dense subset of the reals.  See also the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]], the [[ultrafilter lemma]], the [[axiom of dependent choice]], and the [[Uniformization (set theory)|axiom of uniformization]].

== Results requiring AC (or weaker forms) ==

One of the most interesting aspects of the axiom of choice is the large number of places in mathematics that it shows up. There are also a remarkable number of important statements that, assuming the axioms of ZF but neither AC nor ¬AC, are equivalent to the axiom of choice.  The most important among them are [[Zorn's lemma]] and the [[well-ordering theorem]]: every set can be well-ordered.  In fact, Zermelo initially introduced the axiom of choice in order to formalize his proof of the well-ordering principle.  Here are some statements that require the axiom of choice in the sense that they are not provable from ZF but are provable from ZFC (ZF plus AC).  Equivalently, these statements are true in all models of ZFC but false in some models of ZF.

== Results requiring ¬AC ==

There are models of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory in which the axiom of choice is false.  We will abbreviate &quot;Zermelo-Fraenkr the [[Lepcha language]] goes further than other abugidas in that each akshara is a full syllable: Not only the vowel, but any final consonant is indicated by a diacritic. For example, the syllable [sok] would written as something like {{IPA|s̥̽}}, here with an underring representing /o/ and an overcross representing the diacritic for final /k/. There are several abugidas of Indonesia which also indicate final consonants with diacritics, but usually these are restricted to one or two [[nasal consonant|nasals]] such as /ŋ/. 

The [[Pahawh Hmong]] script represents both consonants and vowels with full letters. However, the graphic order is vowel-consonant even though they are pronounced as consonant-vowel. This is rather like the /o/ vowel in the Indic abugidas. Pahawh Hmong is unusual in that, while the inherent vowel /au/ is unwritten, so is the inherent consonant /k/. For the syllable /kau/, which requires one or the other of the inherent sounds to be overt, it is /au/ that is written. That is, a Pahawh akshara appears to be a vowel with an inherent consonant rather than the other way around. 

It is difficult to draw a dividing line between abugidas and other [[segment (linguistics)|segmental]] scrips. For example, the [[Meroitic script]] of ancient [[Sudan]] did not indicate an inherent ''a'' (one symbol stood for both ''m'' and ''ma,'' for example), and is thus similar to Brahmic family abugidas. However, the other vowels were indicated with full letters, not diacritics or modification, so the system was essentially an alphabet that did not bother to write the most common vowel. 

[[Thaana]] is also like an abugida in that vowels are marked with diacritics. However, all vowels are marked, as is the absence of a vowel; there is no inherent vowel. Normally no letter may occur without a diacritic. That is, it is equivalent to an [[abjad]] with obligatory vowel marking, like the [[Arabic alphabet]] as used for [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] in Iraq, as is thus essentially alphabetic. Note that it developed among a population that was already literate with an abugida for their language. 

Several systems of [[shorthand]] use diacritics for vowels, but they do not have an inherent vowel, and are thus more similar to Thaana and Kurdish than to the Brahmic scripts. The [[Sam Pollard|Pollard]] script, which was based on shorthand, also uses diacritics for vowels; the placements of the vowel relative to the consonant indicates [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. 

As the term ''alphasyllabary'' suggests, abugidas have been considered an intermediate step between [[alphabet]]s and [[syllabary|syllabaries]]. Historically, abugidas appear to have evolved from [[abjad|abjads]] (vowelless alphabets).  They contrast with syllabaries, where there is a distinct symbol for each syllable or consonant-vowel combination, and where these have no systematic similarity to each other. Compare the Devanagari examples above to sets of syllables in the Japanese [[hiragana]] syllabary: か ''ka'', き ''ki'', く ''ku'', け ''ke'', こ ''ko'' have nothing in common to indicate ''k;'' while ら ''ra'', り ''ri'', る ''ru'', れ ''re'', ろ ''ro'' have neither anything in common for ''r'', nor anything do indicate that they have the same vowels as the ''k'' set. 

The term ''abugida'' is taken from a conventional name for the Ge'ez script, derived from its first four letters (አቡጊዳ) as ordered 
in some religious contexts.  This order corresponds to the ancestral [[Semitic]] character order, ''aleph, beth, gimel, daleth,'' or A B C D.

Historically, abugidas appear to have first evolved from abjads (perhaps [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]]) with the [[Kharoṣṭhī]] and [[Brāhmī]] scripts. The Kharosthi family does not survive today, but Brahmi's descendents include most of the modern scripts of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Canadian Syllabics was derived from Devanagari, and is thus in the Brahmic family, or was at least influenced by Devanagari in its creation. Although Ge’ez derived from a different abjad, its evolution into an abugida may have been due to the influence of Christian missionaries from India.

'''Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome''', or '''acquired immune deficiency syndrome''' (or [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] '''AIDS''' or '''Aids'''), is a [[syndrome|collection of symptoms and infections]] resulting from the specific damage to the [[immune system]] caused by [[infection]] with the [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV).&lt;ref name=Marx&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It results from the latter stages of advanced HIV infection in [[human]]s, thereby leaving compromised individuals prone to [[opportunistic infection]]s and [[tumor]]s.  Although treatments for both AIDS and HIV exist to slow the virus' progression in a human patient, there is no known cure.

Most researchers believe that HIV originated in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] &lt;ref name=Gao&gt;{{

[[UNAIDS]] and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimate that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized on [[December 1]], [[1981]], making it one of the most destructive pandemics in recorded history.

==Infection by HIV==
[[Image:HIV-budding.jpg|right|thumbnail|300px|[[Scanning electron microscope|Scanning electron micrograph]] of HIV-1 budding from cultured [[lymphocyte]].]]
AIDS is the most severe manifestation of infection with HIV. HIV is a [[retrovirus]] that primarily infects vital components of the human [[immune system]] such as CD4+ [[T cell]]s, [[macrophage]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. It also directly and indirectly destroys CD4+ T cells. As CD4+ T cells are required for the proper functioning of the immune system, when enough CD4+ cells have been destroyed by HIV, the immune system barely works, leading to AIDS. Acute HIV infection progresses over time to clinical latent HIV infection and then to early symptomatic HIV infection and later, to AIDS, which is identified on the basis of the amount of [[CD4]] positive cells in the blood and the presence of certain infections. 
{{details|HIV}}
In the absence of antiretroviral therapy, progression from HIV infection to AIDS occurs at a [[median]] of between nine to ten years and the median survival time after developing AIDS is only 9.2 months &lt;ref name=Morgan2&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the rate of clinical disease progression varies widely between individuals, from two weeks up to 20 years. Many factors affect the rate of progression.

==Diagnosis==
===AIDS and HIV case definitions===
Since June 18, 1981, many different definitions have been developed for epidemiological surveillance such as the [[Bangui definition]] and the [[1994 expanded World Health Organization AIDS case definition]]. However, these were never intended to be used for clinical staging of patients, for which they are neither sensitive nor specific. The [[World Health Organization]]s (WHO) staging system for HIV infection and disease, using clinical and laboratory data, can be used in developing countries and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) Classification System can be used in developed nations. 

====WHO Disease Staging System for HIV Infection and Disease====
{{main|WHO Disease Staging System for HIV Infection and Disease}}
In 1990, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) grouped these infections and conditions together by introducing a staging system for patients infected with HIV-1 &lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{

  cite journal
  | author=World Health Organisation 
  | title=Interim proposal for a WHO staging system for HIV infection and disease
  | journal=WHO Wkly Epidem. Rec. | year=1990 | pages=221-228 | volume=65 | issue=29
  | id={{PMID |1974812}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This was updated in September 2005. Most of these conditions are [[opportunistic infections]] that can be easily treated in healthy people.

: ''Stage I:'' HIV disease is asymptomatic and not categorized as AIDS
: ''Stage II:'' include minor mucocutaneous manifestations and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections
: ''Stage III:'' includes unexplained chronic diarrhea for longer than a month, severe bacterial infections and pulmonary tuberculosis or
: ''Stage IV'' includes [[toxoplasmosis]] of the brain, [[candidiasis]] of the esophagus, trachea, bronchi or lungs and [[Kaposi's sarcoma]]; these diseases are used as indicators of AIDS.

====CDC Classification System for HIV Infection====
{{main|CDC Classification System for HIV Infection}}
In the [[USA]], the definition of AIDS is governed by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC). In 1993, the CDC expanded their definition of AIDS to include healthy HIV positive people with a CD4 positive T cell count of less than 200 per µl of blood. The majority of new AIDS cases in the United States are reported on the basis of a low [[T cell]] count in the presence of HIV infection &lt;ref name=MMWR&gt;{{

===HIV test===
{{main|HIV test}}
Approximately half of those infected with HIV don't know that they are infected until they are diagnosed with AIDS. HIV test kits are used to screen donor blood and blood products, and to diagnose HIV in individuals. Typical HIV tests, including the HIV enzyme immunoassay and the Western blot assay, detect HIV antibodies in serum, plasma, oral fluid, dried blood spot or urine of patients.  Other tests to look for HIV antigens, HIV-RNA, and HIV-DNA are also commercially available and can be used to detect HIV infection prior to the development of detectable antibodies.  However, these assays are not specifically approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the diagnosis of HIV infection.

==Symptoms and Complications==
[[Image:Hiv-timecourse.png|400px|thumb|right|A generalized graph of the relationship between HIV copies (viral load) and CD4 counts over the average course of untreated HIV infection; any particular individuals' disease course may vary considerably.]]
The symptoms of AIDS are primarily the result of conditions that do not normally develop in individuals with healthy [[immune system]]s. Most of these conditions are infections caused by [[bacteria]], [[virus|viruses]], [[fungus|fungi]] and [[parasite]]s that are normally controlled by the elements of the immune system that HIV damages. [[Opportunistic infection]]s are common in people with AIDS &lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Nearly every [[organ system]] is affected. People with AIDS also have an increased risk of developing various cancers such as [[Kaposi sarcoma]], [[cervical cancer]] and cancers of the immune system known as [[lymphoma]]s. 

Additionally, people with AIDS often have systemic symptoms of infection like [[fever]]s, [[sweat]]s (particularly at night), swollen glands, chills, weakness, and weight loss &lt;ref name=Guss&gt;{{

The earliest inscriptions in the [[Aramaic language]] use the [[Phoenician alphabet]]. In time, the alphabet developed into the form shown below. The use of Aramaic as a [[lingua franca]] throughout the [[Middle East]] from the [[8th century BCE]] led to the gradual adoption of the Aramaic alphabet for writing [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Formerly, Hebrew had been written using an alphabet closer in form to that of [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] (the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]]).

The [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] and [[Nabataean alphabet|Nabataean]] alphabets are little changed in style from the Aramaic alphabet. The development of [[cursive]] versions of Aramaic led to the creation of the [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], [[Palmyrenean alphabet|Palmyrenean]] and [[Mandaic alphabet|Mandaic]] alphabets. These scripts formed the basis of the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Sogdian alphabet|Sogdian]], [[Orkhon script|Orkhon]] and [[Mongolian alphabet|Mongolian]] alphabets. Controversially, it is claimed that the Aramaic alphabet may be the forebear of the [[Indic alphabets]].

Today, [[Biblical Aramaic]], Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialects and the [[Aramaic language]] of the [[Talmud]] are written in the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and Christian Neo-Aramaic dialects are written in the [[Syriac alphabet]]. [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]] is written in the [[Mandaic alphabet]].

Redrawn from ''A Grammar of Biblical Aramaic'', Franz Rosenthal; forms are as used in Egypt, [[5th century BCE]].  Names are as in [[Biblical Aramaic]].

[[Vannevar Bush]]'s essay '''''As We May Think''''', first published in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' in July [[1945]], argued that as humans turned from war, scientific efforts should shift from increasing physical abilities to making all previous collected [[human]] [[knowledge]] more accessible.

The article was a reworked and expanded version of his 1939 ''Mechanization and the Record''. The system, which he called [[memex]], was described as based on what was thought, at the time, to be the wave of the future: Ultra high resolution [[microfilm]] reels, coupled to multiple screen viewers and cameras, by electromechanical controls. The ''Atlantic Monthly'' article was followed, in November [[1945]], by a [[Life magazine]] article which showed illustrations of the proposed memex desk and automatic typewriter.

''As We May Think'' predicted many kinds of technology invented after its publication, including [[hypertext]], [[personal computers]], the [[Internet]], the [[World Wide Web]], [[speech recognition]], and [[online encyclopedia]]s such as Wikipedia: &quot;Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;'''American shot'''&quot; is a translation of a phrase from [[France|French]] [[film criticism]], &quot;''plan Americain''&quot; and refers to a medium-long (&quot;knee&quot;) [[Shot (film)|film shot]] of a group of characters, who are arranged so that all are visible to the camera. The usual arrangement is for the actors to stand in an irregular line from one side of the screen to the other, with the actors at the end coming forward a little and standing more in profile than the others. The purpose of the composition is to allow complex [[dialogue]] scenes to be played out without changes in camera position. In some literature, this is simply referred to as a 3/4 shot.

The French critics thought it was characteristic of [[Cinema of the United States|American film]]s of the [[1930s]] or [[1940s]]; however, it was mostly characteristic of ''cheaper'' American movies, such as [[Charlie Chan]] mysteries where people collected in front of a fireplace or at the foot of the stairs in order to explain what happened a few minutes ago.

'''Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis''' ('''ADEM''') is an immune mediated [[disease]] of [[human brain|brain]]. It usually occurs following a [[virus (biology)|viral]] [[infection]] or [[vaccination]], but it may also appear spontaneously.

There are multiple inflammatory cell deposits in the brain, particularly in the section 
called [[white matter]]. Although it occurs in all ages, most reported cases are in children and [[Adolescence|adolescents]].

It has an abrupt onset and a monophasic course. Symptoms usually begins 1-3 weeks after infection or vaccination. Major symptoms are [[fever]], [[headache]], drowsiness, [[seizure]]s and [[coma]]. Although initially the symptoms are usually mild, later in the course of the disease patients may even die, if they are not treated properly. Some patients recover completely, while others have permanent neurological impairments.

The first treatment is usually [[steroid]]s and [[intensive care]] is often required.

'''Ataxia''' (from [[Greek (language)|Greek]] ''ataxiā'', meaning failure to put in order) is unsteady and clumsy motion of the [[limb]]s or [[torso|trunk]] due to a failure of the gross coordination of [[muscle]] movements.

Ataxia often occurs when parts of the nervous system that control movement are damaged. People with ataxia experience a failure of muscle control in their arms and legs, resulting in a lack of balance and coordination or a disturbance of gait. While the term ataxia is primarily used to describe this set of symptoms, it is sometimes also used to refer to a family of disorders. It is not, however, a specific diagnosis. 

Most disorders that result in ataxia cause cells in the part of the brain called the [[cerebellum]] to degenerate, or atrophy. Sometimes the spine is also affected. The phrases ''cerebellar degeneration'' and ''spinocerebellar degeneration'' are used to describe changes that have taken place in a person’s nervous system; neither term constitutes a specific diagnosis. Cerebellar and spinocerebellar degeneration have many different causes. The age of onset of the resulting ataxia varies depending on the underlying cause of the degeneration. 

Many ataxias are hereditary and are classified by chromosomal location and pattern of inheritance: autosomal dominant, in which the affected person inherits a normal gene from one parent and a faulty gene from the other parent; and autosomal recessive, in which both parents pass on a copy of the faulty gene. Among the more common inherited ataxias are [[Friedreich's ataxia]] and Machado-Joseph disease. Sporadic ataxias can also occur in families with no prior history. 

Ataxia can also be acquired. Conditions that can cause acquired ataxia include [[stroke]], [[multiple sclerosis]], tumors, [[lesion]]s of the [[central nervous system]] or spinal cord, alcoholism, peripheral neuropathy, metabolic disorders, and vitamin deficiencies. 

[[Dysdiadochokinesia]] is a sign of cerebellar ataxia.

[[University of Minnesota]] researchers suggested in 2006 that [[Abraham Lincoln]] may have suffered from spinocerebellar ataxia type 5, thus accounting for his clumsy gait.[http://www.startribune.com/1244/story/198437.html][http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/01/27/D8FD29HG0.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abdul Alhazred''', or the '''Mad Arab''', is a [[fictional character]] created by the horror writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. The term &quot;Mad Arab&quot; in reference to Alhazred is always capitalised and used in the manner of an official title such as another person would be called &quot;Prince&quot; or &quot;Sir&quot; and the term can actually be used in lieu of Alhazred's name as a synonym.

''Abdul Alhazred'' is not a real [[Arabic name]], and seems to contain the Arabic definite article morpheme twice in a row (rather anomalous in terms of Arabic grammar).  The more proper Arabic form might be ''Abd-el-Hazred'' or simply ''Abdul Hazred'' (with a single definite article), although these are still anomalous, as ''Hazred'' is not one of the [[99 Names of God]]. In [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translations, his name has appeared as ''Abdullah Alḥaẓred'' (عبدالله الحظرد). While this Arabic-alphabet spelling of ''Alhazred'' has no real meaning in the Arabic language, it is reminiscent of the verb [[triliteral|root]] ح ظ ر meaning &quot;to forbid.&quot;

According to Lovecraft's &quot;History of the [[Necronomicon]]&quot; (written [[1927]], first published [[1938]]), Alhazred was:

:[A] mad poet of [[Sanaá]], in [[Yemen]], who is said to have flourished during the period of the [[Umayyad | Ommiade]] caliphs, circa [[700]] A.D. He visited the ruins of [[Babylon]] and the subterranean secrets of [[Memphis, Egypt |Memphis]] and spent ten years alone in the great southern desert of [[Arabia]] &amp;mdash; the [[Rub' al Khali|Roba el Khaliyeh]] or &quot;Empty Space&quot; of the ancients &amp;mdash; and &quot;Dahna&quot; or &quot;Crimson&quot; desert of the modern Arabs, which is held to be inhabited by protective evil spirits and monsters of death. Of this desert many strange and unbelievable marvels are told by those who pretend to have penetrated it. In his last years Alhazred dwelt in [[Damascus]].

In [[730]], while still living in Damascus, Alhazred supposedly authored in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] a book of ultimate evil, ''al Azif'', which would later become known as the ''[[Necronomicon]]''.

{{spoiler}}

Those who have any dealings with the Necronomicon usually come to an unpleasant end, and Alhazred was no exception. Again according to Lovecraft:

:Of his final death or disappearance ([[738]] A.D.) many terrible and conflicting things are told. He is said by [[Ibn Khallikan]] ([[13th century]] biographer) to have been seized by an invisible monster in broad daylight and devoured horribly before a large number of fright-frozen witnesses. Of his madness many things are told. He claimed to have seen fabulous [[Irem of the Pillars|Irem]], or City of Pillars, and to have found beneath the ruins of a certain [[The Nameless City|nameless desert town]] the shocking annals and secrets of a race older than mankind. He was only an indifferent [[Muslim|Moslem]], worshipping unknown entities whom he called [[Yog-Sothoth]] and [[Cthulhu]].

[[August Derleth]] later made alterations to the biography of Alhazared. One change was redating Alhazared's death to [[731]]. Derleth further wrote on the final fate of Alhazred in his story &quot;[[The Keeper of the Key]]&quot;, first published in May, [[1951]]. In this story [[Dr. Laban Shrewsbury]] (a recurring Derleth character) and his assistant at the time, [[Naylan Colum]], discovered Alhazred's burial site. More specifically they were heading a caravan from [[Salalah]], [[Oman]], and crossed the border into [[Yemen]]. There they found the unexplored desert area the Necronomicon names as &quot;Roba el Ehaliyeh&quot; or &quot;Roba el Khaliyeh&quot; -- perhaps a form of &quot;Rabia al-Awliya&quot; which, again, is not proper Arabic, but could be an allusion to the Sufi Saint Rabia (pure conjecture). More likely it refers the [[Empty Quarter]] or &quot;Rub al Khali&quot;. At the center of the area they discovered [[The Nameless City|the Nameless City]], a domain of [[Hastur]]. Shrewsbury, as an old agent of Hastur and devoted enemy of his half-brother [[Cthulhu]], crossed its gates in search of Alhazred's burial site. He indeed found the gate of Alhazred's burial chamber and learned of his fate. Alhazred was kidnapped in Damascus and brought to the Nameless City, where he had earlier studied and learned some of Necronomicon's secrets. As punishment for his betrayal of their secrets, Alhazred was tortured. Then they blinded him and severed his tongue, and finally executed him. The entrance to the chamber warned against disturbing him. But Shrewbury proceeded in entering the chamber and opening the sarcophagus. Though only rugs, bones and dust remained of Alhazred, the sarcophagus also contained an incomplete personal copy of the Necronomicon, written in the [[Arabic alphabet]]. Then Shrewsbury used [[Necromancy]] to recall Alhazred's spirit and ordered it to draw a map of the world as he knew it. After obtaining the map, which revealed the location of [[R'lyeh]] and other secret places, Shrewsbury finally let Alhazred return to his eternal rest.

==Pop culture==

[[Roberta Williams]] used the name &quot;Abdul Alhazred&quot; as the name of the villain in [[King's Quest 6]].

Marvel comics has also used the name Abdul Alhazred as a supervillian working for Apocalypse.

'''Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace''' ([[December 10]], [[1815]] &amp;ndash; [[November 27]], [[1852]]) is mainly known for having written a description of 
[[Charles Babbage]]'s early mechanical general-purpose computer, the [[analytical engine]].

== Life ==
Ada was the only legitimate child of the poet [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and his wife, [[Anne Isabella Milbanke|Annabella Milbanke]]. Ada was named after Byron's [[half-sister]], [[Augusta Leigh]], by whom he was rumoured to have fathered a child. It was Augusta who encouraged Byron to marry to avoid scandal, and he reluctantly chose Annabella. On [[January 16]], [[1816]], Annabella left Byron, taking 1-month old Ada with her. On [[April 21]], Byron signed the Deed of Separation and left England for good a few days later. He was never allowed to see either again.

Ada lived with her mother, as is apparent in her father's correspondence concerning her. Lady Byron was also highly interested in mathematics (Lord Byron once called her &quot;the queen of parallelograms&quot;), which dominated her life, even after marriage. Her obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Lord Byron was one of the reasons why Annabella taught Ada [[mathematics]] at an early age. Ada was privately schooled in [[mathematics]] and [[science]], one of her tutors being [[Augustus De Morgan]]. An active member of [[London]] society, she was a member of the [[Bluestockings]] in her youth.

[[Image:Ada Lovelace.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Ada Lovelace]]
In 1835 she married [[William King, 1st Earl of Lovelace|William King, 8th Baron King]], later [[Earl of Lovelace|1st Earl of Lovelace]]. They had three children; Byron born [[12 MaySome two-word abbreviations, like &quot;United Nations&quot;, are abbreviated with uppercase letters and periods, and others, like &quot;personal computer&quot; (PC) and &quot;compact disc&quot; (CD), are not; rather, they are typically abbreviated without periods and in uppercase letters. A third variation is to use lowercase letters with periods; this is used by Time Magazine in abbreviating &quot;public relations&quot; (p.r.). Moreover, even three-word abbreviations (most U.S. publications use uppercase abbreviations without periods) are sometimes not consistently abbreviated, even within the same article. 
** ''[[The New York Times]]'' is unique in having a consistent style by always abbreviating with periods: P.C., I.B.M., P.R. This is in contrast with the trend of British publications to completely make do without periods for convenience.   

* Many British publications follow some of these guidelines in abbreviation:
** For the sake of convenience, many British publications, including the [[BBC]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'', have completely done away with the use of full stops or periods in all abbreviations. These include:
*** Social titles, like Ms or Mr (though these would not have had full stops in any case &amp;mdash; see above) Capt, Prof, ''etc.;''
*** Two-letter abbreviations for countries (US, not U.S.);
*** Words are seldom abbreviated with lower case letters (PR, instead of p.r., or pr) 
*** Abbreviations beyond three letters (full caps for all except initialisms); 
*** Names (''e.g.,'' FW de Klerk, GB Whiteley, Park JS). A notable exception is the ''Economist'' (''e.g.,'' Mr F. W. de Klerk) 
*** Scientific units. 
** [[Acronym]]s are referred to with only the first letter of the abbreviation capitalised. For instance, the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] can be abbreviated as Nato, and [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]] as Sars. [[Initialism]]s (which are similar to acronyms but which are not pronounced as words) are always written in capitals, for instance the British Broadcasting Corporation is abbreviated to BBC, never Bbc.
** When abbreviating scientific units, no space is added between the number and unit (''e.g.,'' 100mph, 100m, 10cm, 10ºC). 

Miscellaneous and general rules
* Plurals are often formed by doubling up the last letter of the abbreviation. Most of these deal with writing and publishing: MS=manuscript, MSS=manuscripts; l=line, ll=lines; p=page, pp=pages; s=section, ss=sections; op.=opus, opp.=opera). This form, derived from [[Latin]] is used in Europe in many places:  dd=[[didot]]s. &quot;The following (lines or pages)&quot; is denoted by ff. One example that does not concern printing is hh=[[hand (unit)|hand]]s. 
* A doubled letter also appears in abbreviations of some Welsh names, as in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] the double &quot;l&quot; is a separate sound: &quot;Ll. George&quot; for (British prime minister) [[Lloyd George]]. 
* Some titles, such as &quot;Reverend&quot; and &quot;Honourable&quot;, are spelt out when preceded by &quot;the&quot;, rather than as &quot;Rev.&quot; or &quot;Hon.&quot; respectively. This is true for most British publications, and some in the United States.
* It is usually advised to spell out the abbreviation where it is new or unfamiliar to the reader (''e.g.,'' UNESCO in a magazine about ''music,'' because it more frequently refers to another entity in another context, the &lt;u&gt;U&lt;/u&gt;nited &lt;u&gt;N&lt;/u&gt;ations &lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt;ducational, &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;cientific and &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;ultural &lt;u&gt;O&lt;/u&gt;rganization).

==History== 
After [[World War II]], the British greatly reduced their use of the full stop and other punctuations after abbreviations in at least semi-formal writing, while the Americans more readily kept its use until more recently, and still maintain it more than Britons. The classic example, considered by their American counterparts quite curious, was the maintenance of the internal comma in a British organization of secret agents called the &quot;Special Operations, Executive&quot; &amp;ndash; &quot;S.O.,E.&quot; &amp;ndash; which is not found in histories written after about 1960.  

But before that, many Britons were more scrupulous at maintaining the French form. In [[French language|French]], the period only follows an abbreviation if the last letter in the abbreviation is ''not'' the last letter of its antecedent:  &quot;M.&quot; is the abbreviation for &quot;''monsieur''&quot; while &quot;Mme&quot; is that for &quot;''Madame''&quot; and &quot;Mlle&quot; for &quot;''Mademoiselle''&quot;. Like many other cross-[[English Channel|channel]] linguistic acquisitions, many Britons readily took this up and followed this rule themselves, while the Americans took a simpler rule and applied it rigorously.

Over the years, however, the lack of convention in some style guides has made it difficult to determine which two-word abbreviations should be abbreviated with periods and which should not. The U.S. media tend to abbreviate two-word abbreviations like United States (U.S.), but surprisingly, not personal computer (PC) or television (TV), which is a source of confusion. Many British publications have gradually done away with the use of periods in abbreviations completely.

'''Abstract algebra''' is the field of [[mathematics]] concerned with the study of [[algebraic structure]]s such as [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[module (mathematics)|modules]], [[vector space]]s, and [[algebra over a field|algebras]]. Many of these structures were defined formally in the nineteenth century, and, indeed, the study of abstract algebra was motivated by the need for more rigor in mathematics.  The study of abstract algebra has brought into full view intricacies of the logical assumptions on which the whole of mathematics and the natural sciences are built, and today there is scarcely a branch of mathematics which doesn't utilize the results of algebra.  What's more, in the course of study, algebraists discovered that apparently diverse logical structures can very often be brought by analogy to a very small core of axioms.  This grants the mathematician who has learned algebra a deep sight, and empowers him broadly.

The term ''abstract algebra'' is used to distinguish the field from &quot;[[elementary algebra]]&quot; or &quot;high school algebra&quot;, which teach the correct rules for manipulating formulas and algebraic expressions involving [[real numbers|real]] and [[complex number]]s, and [[unknown]]s. Abstract algebra was at times in the first half of the [[twentieth century]] known as '''modern algebra'''.

The term '''abstract algebra''' is sometimes used in [[universal algebra]] where most authors use simply the term &quot;algebra&quot;. 

== History and examples ==

Historically, algebraic structures usually arose first in some other field of mathematics, were specified axiomatically, and were then studied in their own right in abstract algebra. Because of this, abstract algebra has numerous fruitful connections to all other branches of mathematics.

Examples of algebraic structures with a single [[binary operation]] are:

* [[magma (algebra)|magmas]],
* [[quasigroup]]s,
* [[monoid]]s, [[semigroup]]s and, most important, [[group (mathematics)|groups]].

More complicated examples include:

* [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]]
* [[module (mathematics)|modules]] and [[vector space]]s
* [[algebra over a field|algebras over fields]]
* [[associative algebra]]s and [[Lie algebra]]s
* [[lattice (order)|lattice]]s and [[Boolean algebra]]s

In [[universal algebra]], all those definitions and facts are collected that apply to all algebraic structures alike. All the above classes of objects, together with the proper notion of [[homomorphism]], form [[category theory|categories]], and category theory frequently provides the formalism for translating between and comparing different algebraic structures.

==An example==
The systematic study of algebra has allowed mathematicians to bring under a common logical description apparently disparate conceptions.  For example, consider two rather distinct operations: the composition of [[function composition|functions]], f(g(x)), and the multiplication of [[matrix multiplication|matrices]], AB.  These two operations are, in fact, the same.  To see this, think about multiplying two square matrices (AB) by a one-column vector, x.  This, in fact, defines a function that is equivalent to composing Ay with Bx:  Ay = A(Bx) = (AB)x.  Functions under composition and matrices under multiplication form sets called [[monoid]]s; a monoid under an operation is associative for all its elements ( (ab)c = a(bc) ) and contains an element e such that, for any a, ae = ea = a.

{{otheruses}}
'''Aphrodite''' ([[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (pronunciation)/IPA vs. other pronunciation symbols#Chart|World Book]] ''«AF roh DY tee»'') ( {{unicode|&amp;#x1F08;}}&amp;#966;&amp;#961;&amp;#959;&amp;#948;&amp;#943;&amp;#964;&amp;#951;, &quot;risen from sea-foam&quot;) is the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[goddess]] of [[love]] and [[beauty]].

== Worship ==
{{Greek myth (Olympian)}}
The epithet ''Aphrodite Acidalia'' was occasionally added to her name, after the spring she used to bathe in, located in [[Boeotia]] ([[Virgil]] I, 720).  She was also called ''Kypris'' or ''Cytherea'' after her alleged birth-places in [[Cyprus]] and [[Cythera]], respectively.  The island of Cythera was a center of her cult.  She was associated with [[Hesperia]] and frequently accompanied by the [[Oread]]s, [[nymph]]s of the mountains.

Aphrodite had a festival of her own, the Aphrodisiac, which was celebrated all over Greece but particularly in [[Athens, Greece|Athens]] and [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]].  In Corinth, intercourse with her priestesses was considered a method of worshipping Aphrodite.

Aphrodite was associated with, and often depicted with [[dolphin]]s, [[dove]]s, [[swan]]s, [[pomegranate]]s,[[apples]], [[myrtle]], [[rose]] and [[Lime (Citrus aurantifolia)|lime]] trees.

Her Roman analogue is [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].  Her [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian]] counterpart was [[Ishtar]]. Her Egyptian counterpart is [[Hathor]], and her Syro-Palestinian counterpart was [[`Ashtart|&amp;#8216;Ashtart]] (in standard Greek spelling ''Astarte''); her [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]] equivalent was [[Turan (mythology)|Turan]].

Venus was often referred to with epithet [[Venus Erycina]] (&quot;of the heather&quot;) after [[Mount Eryx]], [[Sicily]], one of the centers of her cult.

== Birth ==

[[Image:Bouguereau venus detail.jpg|115px|thumb|right|Aphrodite rising from the sea foam in birth, crowned with luxuriant tresses, as depicted in the [[19th century]] by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]] in his [[1879]] ''Birth of Venus'' (the [[Rome|Roman]] name for Aphrodite).]]

&quot;Foam-arisen&quot; Aphrodite was born of the sea foam near [[Paphos]], Cyprus after [[Cronus]] cut off [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]' genitals and Cronus threw the penis into the sea. [[Hesiod's Theogony]] described that the genitals &quot;were carried over the sea a long time, and white foam arose from the immortal flesh; with a girl grew&quot; to become Aphrodite.  Thus Aphrodite is of an older generation than Zeus. ''[[Iliad]]'' (Book V) expresses another version of her origin, by which she was considered a daughter of [[Dione (mythology)|Dione]], who was the original oracular goddess (&quot;Dione&quot; being simply &quot;the goddess,&quot; etymologically an equivalent of &quot;[[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]&quot;) at [[Dodona]]. In Homer, Aphrodite, venturing into battle to protect her son, [[Aeneas]], who has been wounded by [[Diomedes]] and returns to her mother, to sink down at her knee and be comforted.  &quot;Dione&quot; seems to be an equivalent of Rhea, the [[Earth Mother]], whom Homer has relocated to Olympus. After this story, Aphrodite herself was sometimes referred to as &quot;Dione&quot;. Once [[Zeus]] had usurped the oak-grove oracle at Dodona, some poets made him out to be the father of Aphrodite.

Aphrodite's chief center of worship remained at Paphos, on the south-western coast of Cyprus, where the goddess of desire had long been worshipped as [[Ishtar]] and [[Ashtaroth]].  It is said that she first tentatively came ashore at [[Cytherea]], a stopping place for trade and culture between [[Crete]] and the [[Peloponnese|Peloponesus]].  Thus perhaps we have hints of the track of Aphrodite's original cult from the [[Levant]] to mainland [[Greece]]. 

In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium]]'' the speech of Pausanias distinguishes two manifestations of Aphrodite, represented by the two stories: Aphrodite Ourania (&quot;heavenly&quot; Aphrodite), and Aphrodite Pandemos (&quot;Common&quot; Aphrodite). These two manifestations represented her role in homosexuality and heterosexuality, respectively. 

Alternatively, Aphrodite was a daughter of [[Thalassa]] (for she was born of the Sea) and [[Zeus]].

== Adulthood ==
Aphrodite, in many of the myths involving her, is characterized as vain, ill-tempered and easily offended. Though she is one of the few gods of the [[List of Greek mythological characters|Greek Pantheon]] to be actually married, she is frequently unfaithful to her husband. [[Hephaestus]], of course, is one of the most even-tempered of the Hellenic deities; Aphrodite seems to prefer [[Ares]], the volatile god of war. In [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]] she surges into battle to save her son, but abandons him (in fact, drops him as she flies through the air) when she herself is hurt (Ares does much the same thing&lt;!-- I doubt this tidbit, originally included really happened: , and [[Zeus]] eventually sends him to his room without supper --&gt;). And she is the original cause of the [[Trojan War]] itself: not only did she start the whole affair by offering [[Helen]] of [[Troy]] to [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], but the abduction was accomplished when Paris, seeing Helen for the first time, was inflamed with desire to have her&amp;mdash;which is Aphrodite's realm.  Her domain may involve love, but it does not involve [[Romantic_love|romance]]; rather, it tends more towards [[lust]], the human irrational longing.

=== Marriage with Hephaestus ===
Due to her immense beauty, Zeus was frightened she'd be the cause of violence between the other gods. He married her off to [[Hephaestus]], the dour, humorless god of smithing. Hephaestus was overjoyed at being married to the goddess of beauty and forged her beautiful jewelry, including the cestus, a [[girdle]] that made her even more irresistible to men. Her unhappiness with her marriage caused Aphrodite to seek out companionship from others, most frequently [[Ares]], but also [[Adonis]], [[Anchises]] and more. Hephaestus once cleverly caught Ares and Aphrodite in bed with finely wrought chains, and brought all the other Olympian gods together to mock the pair (however, the &quot;goddesses stayed at home, all of them for shame.&quot;) Hephaestus would not free them until [[Poseidon]] promised Hephaestus that Ares would pay reparations, but both escaped as soon as the chains were lifted and their promise was not kept.

=== Aphrodite and Psyche ===
Aphrodite was jealous of the beauty of a mortal woman named [[Psyche]]. She asked [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]] to use his golden arrows to cause Psyche to fall in love with the ugliest man on earth.  Eros agreed but then fell in love with Psyche on his own, or by accidentally pricking himself with a golden arrow.  Meanwhile, Psyche's parents were anxious that their daughter remained unmarried. They consulted an [[oracle]] who told them she was destined for no mortal lover, but a monster who lived on top of a particular mountain.  Psyche was resigned to her fate and climbed to the top of the mountain. There, [[Zephyrus]], the west wind, gently floated her downwards. She entered a cave on the appointed mountain, surprised to find it full of jewellery and finery. Eros visited her every night in the cave and they made love; he demanded only that she never light any lamps because he did not want her to know who he was (having wings made him distinctive).  Her two sisters, jealous of Psyche, convinced her to do so one night and she lit a lamp, recognizing him instantly.  A drop of hot lamp oil fell on Eros' chest and he awoke, then fled.  

When Psyche told her two jealous elder sisters what had happened; they rejoiced secretly and each separately walked to the top of the mountain and did as Psyche described her entry to the cave, hoping Eros would pick them instead.  Zephyrus did not pick them and they fell to their deaths at the base of the mountain.

Psyche searched for her lover across much of Greece, finally stumbling into a temple to [[Demeter]], where the floor was covered with piles of mixed grains. She started sorting the grains into organized piles and, when she finished, Demeter spoke to her, telling her that the best way to find Eros was to find his mother, Aphrodite, and earn her blessing. Psyche found a temple to Aphrodite and entered it. Aphrodite assigned her a similar task to Demeter's temple, but gave her an impossible deadline to finish it by. Eros intervened, for he still loved her, and caused some ants to organize the grains for her. Aphrodite was outraged at her success and told her to go to a field where golden sheep grazed and get some golden wool. Psyche went to the field and saw the sheep but was stopped by a river-god, whose river she had to cross to enter the field.  He told her the sheep were mean and vicious and would kill her, but if she waited until noontime, the sheep would go the shade on the other side of the field and sleep; she could pick the wool that stuck to the branches and bark of the trees.  Psyche did so and Aphrodite was even more outraged at her survival and success. Finally, Aphrodite claimed that the stress of caring for her son, depressed and ill as a result of Psyche's unfaithfulness, had caused her to lose some of her beauty.  Psyche was to go to [[Hades]] and ask [[Persephone]], the queen of the underworld, for a bit of her beauty in a black box that Aphrodite gave to Psyche. Psyche walked to a tower, deciding that the quickest way to the underworld would be to die.  A voice stopped her at the last moment and told her a route that would allow her to enter and return still living, as well as telling her how to pass [[Cerberus]], [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] and the other dangers of the route.  She pacified Cerberus, the three-headed dog, with a sweet honey-cake and paid Charon an [[obolus]] to take her into Hades. On the way there, she saw hands reaching out of the water. A voice told her to toss a honey cake to them. Once there, Persephone said she would be glad to do do Aphrodite a favor. She once more paid Charon, threw the cake out to the hands, and gave one to Cerberus.

Psyche left the underworld and decided to open the box and take a little bit of the beauty for herself, thinking that if she did so Eros would surely love her. Inside was a &quot;[[Wiktionary:stygian|Stygian]] sleep&quot; which overtook her.  Eros, who had forgiven her, flew to her body and wiped the sleep from her eyes, then begged Zeus and Aphrodite for their consent to his wedding of Psyche. They agreed and Zeus made her immortal. Aphrodite danced at the wedding of Eros and Psyche and their subsequent child was named Pleasure, or (in the Roman mythology) [[Volupta]].

=== Adonis ===
Aphrodite was [[Adonis]]' lover and had a part in his birth. She urged [[Myrrha]] or Smyrna to commit [[incest]] with her father, [[Theias]], the King of [[Assyria]].er than signed. Other words can be repeated or slowed down, emphasizing their importance or degree. Some signs may be enlarged, so that they take up more body space. This can also involve a back and forth scissoring motion of the arms to indicate that the sign ought to be larger, but one is physically incapable of stretching the arms any farther than they already are. Moving the whole body and adding facial expressions are also useful modifiers.

* Raised eyebrows can indicate a yes-or-no question, while lowered eyebrows indicate a 'wh-question' or one that requests more information such as those that would use the question words: who, what, when, where, or why.

* To ask a rhetorical question, the eyebrows are raised to give the cue not to reply. Such as, &quot;I don't like [what?] (raised eyebrows), garlic&quot;.

* Like some spoken languages, ASL does not use the linking verb &quot;to be&quot; (either as a '[[copula]]' or a [[auxiliary verb|helping verb]]). An example of a copula is the English phrase &quot;My hair is wet&quot;, which when translated into ASL would be transliterated as, &quot;MY HAIR, WET&quot;. (The comma indicates a short pause and raised eyebrow to topicalize &quot;my hair&quot;.) An example of a helping verb is translating the English phrase &quot;We are going to the store tomorrow&quot;, some possible ASL sentences, literally translated, could be
**&quot;TOMORROW, STORE WE GO.&quot; (Topicalization, TOMORROW is the focus) 
**&quot;STORE, WE GO TOMORROW.&quot; (Topicalization, STORE is the focus)

* In ASL, a signer might not use the word &quot;because&quot;, but instead break down the sentence into a [[rhetorical question]]. This is often used for clarity or emphasis. For instance, &quot;I love to eat [[pasta]] because I am [[Italian people|Italian]]&quot; would be translated into &quot;I LOVE EAT PASTA, WHY? I ITALIAN.&quot; Rhetorical questions do not replace the word &quot;because&quot;. Rather, they are used only when the speaker deems it necessary.

* Some signs can be executed in different locations for contextual reasons. The sign for &quot;PAIN&quot; - two pointed index fingers aimed at each other moved towards then away from each other - can be signed over one's leg to show that there is pain in the leg, or over the belly to indicate abdominal pain.

* Facial expression is also key in ASL. In signing &quot;ANGRY&quot;, a facial expression of anger should be put on. Without expressions like this, the effect would be similar to listening to someone who was speaking in extremely monotone spoken English, or it would be taken as an indication of sarcasm or some other departure from the usual meaning of the sign.

* ASL also makes use of mouth morphemes, certain sounds or mouth configurations that add meaning to a sign. For example, one could sign &quot;HE TALL&quot; and communicate that a man is reasonably tall, but by adding the mouth morpheme &quot;Cha,&quot; the sentence would then be understood as &quot;He's ENORMOUS!!!&quot;

==Writing systems==

ASL is often glossed with English words written in all capital letters. This is however a method used simply to teach the structure of the language. ASL is a visual language not a written language. There is no one-to-one correspondence between words in ASL and English, and much of the inflectional modulation of ASL signs is lost.

There are two true writing systems in use for ASL: a [[phoneme|phonemic]] [[Stokoe notation]], which has a separate symbol or diacritic mark for every phonemic hand shape, motion, and position (though it leaves something to be desired in the representation of facial expression), and a more popular iconic system called [[SignWriting]], which represents each sign with a rather abstract illustration of its salient features. SignWriting is commonly used for student newsletters and similar purposes.

==&quot;Baby Sign&quot;==
{{main|Baby Sign}}
In recent years, it has been shown that exposure to sign language has a positive impact on the socialization of hearing children.  When infants are taught to sign, parents are able to converse with them at a [[Child development|developmental stage]] when they are not yet capable of producing verbal speech, which requires fine control of both breathing and the vocal tract. The ability of a child to actively communicate earlier than would otherwise be possible appears to accelerate language development and to decrease the frustrations of communication.

Many parents use a collection of simplified or ''ad hoc'' signs called &quot;baby sign&quot;, as infants do not have the dexterity required for true ASL. However, parents can learn to recognize their baby's approximations of adult ASL signs, just as later on they will learn to recognize their approximations of verbal language, so teaching an infant ASL is also possible. Typically young children will make an ASL sign in the correct location and use the correct hand motion, but may be able only to approximate the handshape, for example, using one finger instead of three in signing ''water''.

==Primate usage==
ASL has allegedly been taught to both species of [[chimpanzee]], the [[bonobo]] and [[common chimpanzee]], as well as to [[gorilla]]s. Several of the animals have been said to have mastered more than one hundred signs, though not all agree with the ability of the [[primate]]s to sign. For example, when the [[washoe (chimpanzee)|Washoe]] research team asked the handlers of the chimp to write signs down whenever they witnessed them being produced by Washoe, the hearing people on the team turned in long lists of signs while the only deaf [[native speaker]] of ASL on the team turned in blank lists, explaining that what she saw were not signs at all, but simply gestures.  Further fomenting the controversy, the researchers in the studies of [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]] and Washoe refused to share their raw data with the [[scientific community]]. The theory that non-human primates have learned ASL, or that they are even capable of learning ASL or any other natural language, is not currently accepted by linguists&amp;mdash;including linguists who accept similar but better documented claims of rudimentary human language acquisition by birds. Despite this, however, research on the ability of primates to learn symbol systems continues and receives occasional publicity in the media.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''applet''' is a software component that runs in the context of another program, for example a [[web browser]]. An applet usually performs a very narrow function that has no independent use. Hence, it is an ''app''lication ''[[-let]]''. The term was introduced in [[AppleScript]] in 1993.  An applet is distinguished from &quot;subroutine&quot; by several features.  First, it executes only on the &quot;client&quot; platform environment of a system, as contrasted from &quot;servlet.&quot;  As such, an applet provides functionality or performance beyond the default capabilities of its container (the browser).  Also, in contrast with a subroutine, certain capabilities are restricted by the container. An applet is written in a language that is different from the scripting or [[HTML]] language which invokes it.  The applet is written in a compiled language, while the scripting language of the container is an interpreted language, hence, the greater performance or functionality of the applet.  Unlike a &quot;subroutine,&quot; a complete web component can be implemented as an applet.

== Attributes ==

Unlike a [[program]], an applet cannot run independently; an applet usually features display and graphics and often interacts with the human user. However, they are usually stateless and have restricted security privileges.  The applet must run in a [[container]], which is provided by a host program, through a [[plugin]], or a variety of other applications including mobile devices that support the applet programming model.

== Interfaces ==

Applets usually have some form of [[user interface]] or perform a particular piece of the overall user interface in a web page.  This distinguishes them from a program written in a [[scripting programming language]] (such as [[JavaScript]]) that also runs in the context of a larger, client program, but which would not be considered an applet.

Applets generally have the capability of interacting with and/or influencing their host program, through the restricted security privileges, although they are generally not required to do so.

== Examples ==

Common examples of applets are [[Java applet]]s and [[SWF|Flash movies]]. Another example is the [[Windows Media Player]] applet that is used to display embeded video files in [[Internet Explorer]] (and other [[Web browser|browsers]] that support the plugin). Some plugins also allow for displaying various 3D model formats in a web browser, via an applet that allow the view of the model to be rotated and zoomed. Many [[browser game]]s are applet-based, though some may develop into fully functional applications that require installation.

'''Alternate history''' or '''alternative history''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[speculative fiction]] (or some would say of [[science fiction]]), that is set in a world in which [[history]] has [[Point of divergence|diverged]] from history as it is generally known; more simply put, alternate history asks the question, &quot;What If history had developed differently?&quot; Most works that employ this rubric are set in factful historical contexts, yet feature several social, geopolitical or industrial circumstances that developed differently or at a different pace from our own, sometimes as a result of [[progress]] in [[technology|technological]] or [[society|social]] [[paradigms]] that were accomplished via the understanding already present in the given [[zeitgeist]]. While to some extent all [[fiction]] can be described as alternate history, the subgenre proper comprises fiction in which a change happens that causes history to diverge from our own. 

Since the 1950s this type of fiction has to a large extent merged with science fictional framings involving (a) cross-time, or paratime, travel between alternate histories/universes (or some kind of psychic awareness of the existence of &quot;our&quot; universe by the people in the other, as in Nabokov and Dick; see below); or (b) ordinary voyaging uptime or downtime that results in a world splitting into two or more new timelines.  So close have the cross-time, time-splitting and alternate history themes been interwoven that it is impossible to discuss them fully apart from one another. Thus, cross-time and time-splitting stories will be an important part of this article &lt;i&gt;insofar as they portray one or more alternate histories that diverged from a common past&lt;/i&gt;.

In [[French (language)|French]], alternate history novels are called ''uchronie''. This [[neologism]] is based on the word ''utopia'' (a place that doesn't exist) and the Greek for time, ''chronos''. An ''uchronie'', then, is defined as a time that doesn't exist.

== History of alternate history fiction ==

=== Antiquity ===
The earliest example of alternate history appears to be Book IX, sections 17-19, of [[Livy]]'s ''History of Rome from Its Foundation''. He contemplates the possibility of [[Alexander the Great]] expanding his father's empire westward instead of eastward and attacking Rome in the [[4th century BC]].

=== 19th century === 
The earliest alternate history published as a complete work, rather than an aside or digression in a longer work, is believed to be [[Louis Napoléon Geoffroy-Château]]'s French nationalist tale, ''Napoléon et la conquête du monde, 1812-1823'' ([[1836]]) &amp;ndash; in English ''Napoleon and the Conquest of the World''. In this book, Geoffroy-Château postulates that [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] turns away from [[Moscow]] before the disastrous winter of [[1812]]. Without the severe losses he suffered historically, Napoleon is able to conquer the world. Geoffroy-Château's book must have been popular in [[France]], for the subsequent years saw many similar novels published.

In the [[English language]], the first known complete alternate history is [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s [[short story]] &quot;P.'s Correspondence&quot;, published in [[1846]] and which recounts the tale of an apparent madman and his purported encounters with various literary and political figures of the 1840s. At novel length, the first alternate history in English would seem to be [[Castello Holford]]'s ''Aristopia'' ([[1895]]). While not as nationalistic as ''Napoléon et la conquête du monde, 1812-1823'', ''Aristopia'' is another attempt to portray a utopian society which never existed. In ''Aristopia'', the earliest settlers in [[Virginia]] discover a reef made of solid [[gold]] and are able to build a [[Utopia|utopian]] society in [[North America]].

=== Early 20th century and the era of the pulps=== 

Although a number of alternate history stories and novels appeared in the late 1800s and early 1900s, the next major work is perhaps the strongest anthology of alternate history ever assembled. In [[1932]], British historian [[Sir John Squire]] collected a series of essays, many of which could be considered stories, in ''If It Had Happened Otherwise'' from some of the leading historians of the period. In this work, scholars from major universities as well as important non-university-based authors turned their attention to such questions as &quot;If the Moors in Spain Had Won&quot; and &quot;If [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] Had Had an Atom of Firmness.&quot;
The essays range from serious scholarly efforts through [[Henrik Van Loon]]'s fanciful and satiric portrayal of an independent 20th century Dutch city state on the island of Manhattan.

Four of the fourteen pieces examined the two most popular themes in alternate history prior to the [[World War II|Second World War]]: Napoleon's victory and the [[American Civil War]]. One of the entries in Squire's volume was [[Winston Churchill]]'s &quot;If Lee Had Not Won the Battle of Gettysburg&quot;, written from the viewpoint of a historian in a world where the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] had won the [[American Civil War]], considering what would have happened if the North &lt;!-- Please do not change this, North is correct --&gt; had been victorious. (This kind of speculative work which posts from the point of view of an alternate history is variously known as a &quot;recursive alternate history&quot;, a &quot;double-blind what-if&quot; or an &quot;alternate-alternate history&quot;.) Other authors appearing in Squire's book included [[Hilaire Belloc]] and [[André Maurois]].

Another example of alternate history from this period (and arguably the first to explicitly posit cross-time travel from one universe to another as anything more than a visionary experience) was [[H.G. Wells]]' ''[[Men Like Gods]]'' (1923) in which several British politicians are transferred via an accidental encounter with a cross-time machine into an alternate universe in which Britain had changed course in earlier centuries and developed into a seemingly pacifistic and utopian society. When the politicians from our world try to seize power, the utopians simply point a ray gun at them and send them on to someone else's universe. Wells works out the entire multiverse-pancake framing complete with paratime travel machines that would become popular with U.S. pulp writers (see below), but since his hero experiences only a single alternate world this story is not very different from conventional alternate history (the intruders from our world cause no significant change in the world they enter and are really just a device for examining the results of a past divergence between Wells' utopia and our own world). 

The 1930s would see alternate history move into a new arena. The December [[1933]] issue of ''[[Astounding (magazine)|Astounding]]'' published [[Nat Schachner]]'s &quot;Ancestral Voices&quot;. This was quickly followed by [[Murray Leinster]]'s &quot;Sidewise in Time&quot;. While earlier alternate histories examined reasonably straight-forward divergences, Leinster attempted something completely different. In his &quot;world gone mad&quot;, pieces of Earth traded places with their analogs from different timelines. The story follows [[Robinson College (fictitious)|Robinson College]] Professor Minott as he wanders through these analogs, each of which features remnants of worlds which followed a different history.

=== Time travel as a means of creating historical divergences ===

This period also saw the publication of the [[time travel]] novel ''[[Lest Darkness Fall]]'' by [[L. Sprague de Camp]], which was similar to [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'' but sent an American academic to the [[Italy]] of the [[Ostrogoths]] at the time of the Byzantine invasion led by [[Belisarius]].  De Camp's work is concerned with the historical changes wrought by his time traveler, Martin Padway, thereby making the work an alternate history. Padway is depicted as making permament changes and implicitly forming a new time branch (in contrast to Twain's hero, who ultimately fails, with the result that history reverts to its &quot;normal&quot; course).

Time travel as the cause of a point of divergence (creating two histories where before there was one, or simply replacing the future that existed before the time traveling event) has continued to be a popular theme over the decades. In [[Bring the Jubilee]], by [[Ward Moore]], the hero, who lives in a backward world in which the South won the Civil War, travels through time and brings about an alternate history in which the North won at Gettysburg. [[Ray Bradbury]]'s [[A Sound of Thunder]] creates a scenario in which the time travelers inadvertently destroy all history as we know it.

When a story's assumptions about the nature of time necessitate, as in the Bradbury tale, a replacement of the visited historical time's future rather than just the creation of a new time line, the next step is obviously the founding of a time patrol (a device that is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to be confused with the paratime police, see below). Such an agency has the grim task of saving civilization every day, every hour, with patrol members--depicted most notably in [[Poul_Anderson#Time_Patrol|Poul Anderson's Time Patrol]]--racing uptime and downtime to preserve the &quot;correct&quot; history.

Of course not all time travel stories involve alternate histories.  The writer may ignore the possibility of change, or have the cause-and-effect work out so that the time traveler's actions cause the future he remembers, as in [[Harry Harrison]]'s [[Technicolor Time Machine]].

=== The Connecticut Yankee wins at last! ===

A recent time travelling splitter variant involves entire communities (and not just individuals like Twain's [[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court|Connecticut Yankee]]) being shifted uptime to be the founding fathers of new time branches. These communities are transported either from the present or the near-future to the past via a natural disaster, the action of technologically advanced aliens, or a human experiment gone wrong.

[[S.M. Stirling]] has written the ''[[Island in the Sea of Time]]'' trilogy, in which [[Nantucket]] Island and all its modern inhabitants are transported to [[Bronze Age]] times to become the world's first superpower. In [[Eric Flint]]'s [[1632 series]], a small town in [[West Virginia]] is transported to 17th century Earding words is an error.  Lexicographers tell how people use the word; they do not issue edicts that say &quot;America&quot; can only refer to geographical continents rather than a country.  Every major dictionary makes clear that &quot;American&quot; applied to residents of the U.S. is standard usage, and has been for over 200 years in every Anglophone country.

In [[Canada]], the term &quot;American&quot; is widely understood to refer exclusively to citizens of the U.S., and Canadians do not refer to themselves as Americans.  On the other hand, in [[Spain]], people who have lived in the Western Hemisphere but now live in Spain may be called, in Spanish, ''americanos'' (translated into English as &quot;Americans&quot;). 

In discussions of geography, one might specify North America, Central America, or South America when the reference is to a continent or region.  Residents of the Western Hemisphere rarely call themselves &quot;North American&quot; or &quot;South American&quot;; the term &quot;Central American&quot; is more common.  Many alternative [[neologism]]s to ''American'' have been proposed to refer to the United States of America, but they have failed to garner widespread acceptance.   

This has given rise to terms like &quot;[[Mexican-American]]&quot; or &quot;Canadian-American&quot; to refer to people of Mexican or Canadian origin living in the United States—either as first-generation immigrants or their descendants. These terms are never used to refer to natives of Mexico or Canada. Geo-politically speaking, such terms are redundant.

[[Canadian identity|Canadians]] in particular have devoted a great deal of attention to proclaiming that they are not-Americans -meaning US citizens-, both in their own cultural products and when they travel outside the region and are frequently mistaken as coming from the United States.

===American in the US Census===
[[Image:American1346.gif|thumb|&quot;American&quot; ancestry in US counties.]]

In the United States census, millions of people describe their (main) [[ethnic origin]] as &quot;American&quot;, particularly those belonging in southern states. This region has a high percentage of people who trace their descent to the colonial origins of the United States and often lack records of the particular, but generally, British countries of their ancestor's origins.

==''American'' in cultural usages==
'''American''', culturally, generally refers to things which originated within the United States of America.

Some foods, such as hamburgers, are seen as [[American cuisine]].

Some sports, such as [[baseball]] or [[American football]], are seen as American, even though they may be played in other countries.

Some music, such as [[jazz]], [[country music]], or [[American folk music]] are seen as American, even though they may be popular in other countries.

==''American'' in other languages==
[[English language|English]] speakers commonly use ''American'' to refer to the United States only. In the [[United Kingdom]], the use of 'US' as an adjective is preferred where it can be comfortably used, and is prevalent in media and government house-styles.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''americano'' tends to refer to any resident of the Americas and not from the United States; English spoken in Latin America often makes this distinction as well.  

''US-American'' is another option, and is the dominant demonym in German (''US-Amerikaner'').  Latin Americans also have the [[euphemism]] ''norteamericano'' (''North American'', which itself conflates the USA and Canada and possibly Mexico).  

''United Statian'' is awkward in English, but it exists in Spanish (''estadounidense'') and occasionally in German (''Vereinigten Staatler''), and in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (both in [[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]]), where the term ''estadunidense'' is growing and it is considered more appropriate than the common term ''norte-americano''.

The word [[Gringo]] is widely used in all of [[Latin America]], particularly in Mexico, to make a reference to U.S. residents, not necessarily in a pejorative way. ''Yanqui'' (''[[Yankee]]'') is also very common in some regions.

There have been a number of attempts to [[neologism|coin]] an alternative to &quot;[[American (disambiguation)|American]]&quot; as an adjective (a [[demonym]]) for a citizen of the [[United States]], that would not simultaneously mean a citizen of the Americas.

With the [[1994]] passage of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], the following words were used to label the ''United States Section'' of that organization: in [[Canadian French]], ''étatsunien''; in Spanish, ''estadounidense''.

==Seeking alternate names==
Many people use the word &quot;American&quot; to indicate any inhabitant of [[the Americas]] (which many people in other parts of the world tend to consider a single continent, called America) rather than specifically a citizen of the United States; and perceive the latter usage of &quot;American&quot; to be potentially ambiguous, and perhaps aggressive in tone or imperialistic, a rather widespread view in Latin America. 

However, many in the US assert that the word &quot;America&quot; in &quot;United States of America&quot; denotes the country's proper name, and is not a geographical indicator. They argue that the interpretation of ''United States '''of''' America'' to mean a country named ''United States'' located in the continent of ''America'' is mistaken. Instead, they argue that the preposition ''of'' is equivalent to the ''of'' in ''Federative Republic '''of''' Brazil'', ''Commonwealth '''of''' Australia'', ''Federal Republic '''of''' Germany''. That is, the ''of'' indicates the name of the state.  In addition, other countries use &quot;United&quot; or &quot;States&quot; in their names as well.  Indeed, the formal name of [[Mexico]] is ''Estados Unidos Mexicanos'', currently officially translated as &quot;United Mexican States&quot; had in the past been translated as &quot;United States of Mexico.&quot;

Regardless, many question a nation's right to formally appropriate the name of a continent for itself, citing the fact that America existed long before the United States ''of'' America. Indeed, [[Amerigo Vespucci]] (who travelled extensively throughout the Caribbean basin) never set foot on present US territory.

Some U.S. citizens and Latin Americans alike have no problem with the simultaneous usage of &quot;American&quot; as an adjective for all inhabitants of the Americas, and make the distinction between the demonym for a country and the demonym for a continent (or continents). They argue that there is no reason the two cannot share the term if it is used in distinct but equally legitimate contexts.

In other cases, the motivation is not so much political as it is academic, to avoid a perceived ambiguity. For instance, in legal circles a citizen of the United States is usually referred to as a 'U.S. citizen,' not an 'American citizen,' which could arguably apply to citizens of other American nation states as well.

A modern alternative term used by Latin speakers to reffer the people from the United Sates in their language is &quot;USen,&quot; situable short for &quot;United States Citizen.&quot;

==The alternatives==
Attempts to create such a name have failed to gain widespread use. Proposals have included:
*Americanite
*Appalacian (now only considered an accurate term for the people of [[Appalachia]])
*Colonican
*Columbard
*[[Historical Columbia|Columbia]]n (hence the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]])
*Frede or Fredonian 
*[[Nacirema]]
*Statesider
*Uesican (pronounced {{IPA|[juˈɛsɪkən]}}) or Uessian (pronounced {{IPA|[juˈɛsiən]}})
*Unisan or Unisian
*United States American, United Stater, United Stateser, United Statian, United Statesian, or United Statesman
*USAian, U.S. American, Usan, USAn, Usanian, Usian (pronounced {{IPA|[ˈjuʒən]}}), U-S-ian, or [[Usonia]]n (pronounced {{IPA|[juˈsoʊniən]}})
*USen
*Vespuccino
*Washingtonian.

References to these words have been around since the early days of the republic, but ''American'' has become by far the most common term. ''[[Usonia]]n'' is used in architectural circles, and ''Washingtonian'' remains as the adjective for the state of [[Washington]] and the city of [[Washington, D.C.]].

Several of these terms have direct parallels in languages other than [[English language|English]]. Many languages have already created their own distinct word for a citizen of the United States:
*''United Statian'' directly parallels the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term ''estadounidense''.
*''Norteamericano'' (North American) is common in [[Latin America]], but suffers from the same kind of ambiguity as ''American'', since Canadians and Mexicans, amongst others, are also North Americans.
* In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''norte-americano'' is the most commonly used term. ''Estadunidense'' is gaining some popularity, specifically in [[Brazil]], where its usage traditionally rises during times of tension with the USA.
*''Amerikan'' is a derogatory spelling, after the Eastern European spelling made popular in the West by Franz Kafka's 1946 novel.
*''Usonian'', from [[Usonia]], a term [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] used to describe his vision for American [[architecture]], homes, and cities, and used by [[John Dos Passos]] in his [[U.S.A. trilogy]].
* The [[Esperanto]] term for the [[United States|United States of America]] is ''Usono''.  This is generally thought to come from &quot;[[Usonia]].&quot;  In Esperanto, one forms the word for a citizen of a given country using the suffix &quot;-an&quot; which means &quot;member of.&quot; Therefore a citizen of the United States is ''usonano''.  (Such derived words are not capitalized.)  Esperanto terms for the American geographic regions and their people are ''Ameriko/amerikano'', ''Norda Ameriko/nordamerikano'', ''Meza Ameriko/mezamerikano'', and ''Suda Ameriko/sudamerikano''.
*''Usanian'' is derived from the [[Ido]] word ''Usana''.
*''[[Yankee]]'', often shortened to ''Yank'', is used all over the world in an informal manner similar to the use of the Mexican word ''[[Gringo]]''. Both terms may occasionally be used in an affectionate or pejorative sense. On occasion some U.S. citizens will take offense at the term ''Yankee'', particularly Southerners (residents of the [[Southeastern United States]]), who use ''Yankee'' to refer to Northerners (residents of the [[Northeastern United States]]), sometimes in a derogatory way. (Some people from [[Scotland]] or [[Wales]] may use ''Yankee'' as a deliberate riposte to people from the US who refer to them as English, from the enduring misconception that [[England]] is coterminous with the [[United Kingdom]].) 
**The colloquial term ''Yank'' for a U.S citizen, used in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Australia]], is a derivative of ''Yankee''. In Australia, the [[Cockney]] [[Cockney rhyming slang|rhyming slang]] term ''Sepo'' survives, derived from ''septic tank''.
* In [[French language|French]], ''États-Unien(ne)'', ''Étatsunien(ne)'', or ''Étasunien(ne)'' are gaining some popularity.
* In [[Italian language|Italian]] the term ''Statunitense'' (from 'Stati Uniti' = 'United States') is quite widespread, especially referring to sporting events.
* In [[German language|German]], ''US-Amerikaner'' may be used to avoid ambiguity or to be [[politically correct]], but it may come across as pedantic if used conversationally. ''Amerikaner'' is in general usage in German, and is widely accepted to refer to the United States. ''Ami'' is a colloquialism which unambiguously refers to US citizens. The German usage of ''Ami'' is akin to the Mexican usage of ''[[Gringo]]'', in that it can be neutral, patronizing, or perhaps even affectionate.
* In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] the term ''Bandaríkjamenn'' is quite widespread, Bandaríkin (United States) and menn for (people/persons)

==Less serious alternatives==
Less serious terms that have been popular on the Internet at various times include
*Leftpondian - from the fact that the USA is on the left side of the Atlantic Ocean (the &quot;pond&quot;) as seen on a map with north at the top.  This term is often used to include Canadians as well.
*Merkin - from the way some Americans pronounce the word &quot;American&quot;, but also playing on the word's [[merkin|other meaning]].

'''Ada''' is a [[Structured programming|structured]], [[statically typed]] [[Imperative programming|imperative]] [[computer programming|computer]] [[programming language]] designed by a team led by [[Jean Ichbiah]] of [[Groupe Bull|CII Honeywell Bull]] during [[1977]]&amp;ndash;[[1983]]. It addresses many of the same tasks as [[C programming language|C]] or [[C++]], but with one of the best [[Type safety|type-safety]] systems available in a [[statically typed]] programming language. Ada was named after [[Ada Lovelace]], often credited as the first computer programmer.

== Features ==

Ada was originally targeted at [[embedded system|embedded]] and [[real-time]] systems, and is still commonly used for those purposes. The Ada&amp;nbsp;95 revision, designed by [[Tucker Taft|S. Tucker Taft]] of [[Intermetrics]] between [[1992]] and [[1995]], improved support for systems, numerical, and financial programming.

Notable features of Ada include [[strongly typed languages|strong typing]], [[modularity (programming)|modularity mechanisms]] (packages), [[run-time checking]], [[parallel processing]] (tasks), [[exception handling]], and [[generic programming|generic]]s. Ada&amp;nbsp;95 added support for [[object-oriented programming]], including [[dynamic dispatch]].

Ada supports run-time checks in order to protect against access to unallocated memory, [[buffer overflow]] errors, [[off by one errors]], array access errors, and other avoidable bugs. These checks can be disabled in the interest of efficiency, but can often be compiled efficiently. It also includes facilities to help program verification. For these reasons, it is very widely used in critical systems like [[avionics]], weapons and spacecraft.

It also supports a large number of compile-time checks to help avoid bugs that would not be detectable until run-time in some other languages or would require explicit checks to be added to the source code.

Ada's dynamic [[memory management]] is safe and high-level, like Java and unlike C.  The specification does not require any particular implementation.  Though the semantics of the language allow automatic [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] of inaccessible objects, most implementations do not support it. Ada does support a limited form of [[region-based storage management]].  Invalid accesses can always be detected at run time (unless of course the check is turned off) and sometimes at compile time.

The Ada language definition is unusual among [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards in that it is [[free content]]. One result of this is that the standard document (known as the ''Ada Reference Manual'' or ''ARM'') is the usual reference Ada programmers resort to for technical details, in the same way as a particular standard textbook serves other programming languages.

== History ==

In the [[1970s]], the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] (DoD) was concerned by the number of different programming languages being used for its projects, many of which were obsolete or hardware-dependent, and none of which supported safe modular programming. In [[1975]] the [[Higher Order Language Working Group]] (HOLWG) was formed with the intent of reducing this number by finding or creating a programming language generally suitable for the department's requirements; the result was Ada. The total number of high-level programming languages in use for such projects fell from over 450 in [[1983]] to 37 by [[1996]].

{{Wikisource|Steelman language requirements}} The [[working group]] created a series of language requirements documents&amp;mdash;the Strawman, Woodenman, Tinman, Ironman and [[Steelman language requirements|Steelman]] documents. Many existing languages were formally reviewed, but the team concluded in [[1977]] that no existing language met the specifications.

Requests for proposals for a new programming language were issued and four contractors were hired to develop their proposals under the names of Red ([[Intermetrics]] led by [[Benjamin Brosgol]]), Green ([[CII Honeywell Bull]], led by [[Jean Ichbiah]]), Blue ([[SofTech]], led by [[John Goodenough]]), and Yellow ([[SRI International]], led by [[Jay Spitzen ]]).&lt;!-- Though Intermetrics and Bull have previous links, I am including them for parallelism. --&gt; In April 1978, after public scrutiny, the Red and Green proposals passed to the next phase. In May of [[1979]], the Green proposal, designed by Jean Ichbiah at CII Honeywell Bull, was chosen and given the name Ada&amp;mdash;after [[Ada Lovelace|Augusta Ada, Countess of Lovelace]]. This proposal was influenced by the programming language [[LIS programming language|LIS]] that Ichbiah and his group had developed in the [[1970s]]. The preliminary Ada reference manual
was published in ACM SIGPLAN Notices in June 1979. The Military Standard reference manual was approved on [[December 10]], [[1980]] ([[Ada Lovelace]]'s birthday), and
given the number MIL-STD-1815 in honor of Ada Lovelace's birth year.

[[Image:Ada Lovelace 1838.jpg|right|caption|thumbnail|157px|[[Ada Lovelace|Augusta Ada King]], Countess of Lovelace.]] 
In [[1987]], the US Department of Defense began to require the use of Ada (the ''Ada mandate'') for every software project where new code was more than 30% of result, though exceptions to this rule were often granted. This requirement was effectively removed in [[1997]], as the DoD began to embrace COTS ([[commercial off-the-shelf]]) technology. Similar requirements existed in other [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] countries.

Because Ada is a strongly-typed language, it has been used outside the military in commercial aviation projects, where a software bug can mean fatalities. The fly-by-wire system in the [[Boeing 777]] runs software written in Ada.

The language became an [[ANSI]] standard in [[1983]] ([http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/Welcome.html ANSI/MIL-STD 1815A], and 
without any further changes became
an [[International standard|ISO standard]] in [[1987]] (ISO-8652:1987). This version of the language is commonly known as Ada&amp;nbsp;83, from the date of its adoption by ANSI, but is sometimes referred to also as Ada&amp;nbsp;87, from the date of its adoption by ISO.

Ada&amp;nbsp;95, the joint ISO/ANSI standard ([http://www.adaic.org/standards/95lrm/html/RM-TTL.html ISO-8652:1995]) is the latest standard for Ada. It was published in February [[1995]] (making Ada&amp;nbsp;95 the first ISO standard object-oriented programming language). To help with the standard revision and future acceptance, the [[US Air Force]] funded the development of the [[GNAT]] [[Compiler]]. Nowadays the GNAT Compiler is part of the [[GNU Compiler Collection]].

Work continues on improving and updating the technical content of the Ada programming language. A Technical Corrigendum to Ada&amp;nbsp;95 was published in October [[2001]]. Presently, more work is being done to produce the roughly once-a-decade major update
to Ada, expected in [[2007]] (see [http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG9/projects.htm#AMD official schedule]). This new version is commonly known as Ada&amp;nbsp;2005, just as Ada&amp;nbsp;95 was commonly known as Ada&amp;nbsp;94 prior to its publication.

== &quot;Hello, world!&quot; in Ada ==
A common example of a language's [[syntax]] is the [[Hello world program]]:

 '''with''' Ada.Text_IO; 
 
 '''procedure''' Hello '''is'''
 '''begin'''
    Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
 '''end''' Hello;

== The Ariane 5 failure ==
A commonly encountered myth blames the loss of [[Ariane 5 Flight 501]], a [[European Space Agency]] [[Ariane 5]] rocket, on a bug in an Ada program or on disabling Ada's runtime checks. For the [[Ariane 4]] it had been proven that those runtime checks weren't needed. Although range checks and appropriate exception handlers on all type conversions might have trapped the problem, the problem itself was a design decision to reuse a part and its software from the [[Ariane 4]] rocket without adequate analysis of its suitability or tests on [[Ariane 5]] data.

Thus [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] announced his discovery that [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] had [[Moon phase|phase]]s like the [[Moon]] in the form &quot;Haec immatura a me iam frustra leguntur&amp;mdash;oy&quot; (Latin: ''This immature (feminine) one has already been read in vain by me&amp;mdash;oy'' (with a subject-verb number agreement error)), that is, &quot;Cynthiae figuras aemulatur Mater Amorum&quot; (Latin: ''The Mother of Loves [= Venus] imitates the figures of [[Cynthia]] [= the moon]'').  Similarly, when [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[Hooke's law]] in 1660, he first published it in anagram form.  One might think of this as a primitive example of a [[zero-knowledge proof]].

There are also a few &quot;natural&quot; anagrams, English words unconsciously created by switching letters around. The French ''chaise longue'' (&quot;long chair&quot;) became the American &quot;[[chaise lounge]]&quot; by metathesis (transposition of letters and/or sounds). This is an example of [[folk etymology]]. It has also been speculated that the English &quot;curd&quot; comes from the Latin ''crudus'' (&quot;raw&quot;).

==Methods==
Before the computer age, anagrams were constructed using a pen and paper or lettered tiles, by playing with letter combinations and experimenting with variations.  (Some individuals with prodigious talent have also been known to ‘see’ anagrams in words, unaided by tools.)

Computers have enabled a new method of creating anagrams, the anagram server. An anagram server utilizes an exhaustive database of words. The anagrammist (one who creates anagrams) enters a word or phrase into the server’s search engine, and the server produces a list containing every possible combination of words or phrases from the input word or phrase. Anagram servers use advanced features to control the search results, by excluding or including certain words, limiting the number or length of words in each anagram, or limiting the number of results.

When sharing their newly discovered anagrams with other enthusiasts, some anagrammists indicate the method they used.  Anagrams constructed without aid of a computer are noted as having been done ‘manually’ or ‘by hand’; those made by utilizing a computer may be noted ‘by machine’ or ‘by computer’, or may indicate the name of the computer program (using ‘Anagram Genius’).

Anagram servers are available on the Internet.  Some examples are

There is also software to download and run locally, such as

==Crosswords==
[[Cryptic crossword]] puzzles frequently use anagrammatic clues, usually indicating that they are anagrams by the inclusion of a word like &quot;confused&quot; or &quot;in disarray&quot;. An example would be '''Businessman burst into tears (9 letters)'''; the solution, '''Stationer''' is an anagram of '''into tears''', the letters of which have '''burst''' out of their original arrangement to form the name of a type of '''businessman'''.

What is the most anagrammable name on record? There must be few names as deliciously workable as that of &quot;[[Augustus de Morgan]]&quot; who tells that a friend had constructed about 800 on his name (specimens of which are given in his ''Budget of Paradoxes'', p. 82)!

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anadyr''' (''Ана́дырь'') is a [[river]] in the extreme northeast of [[Siberia]], [[Russia]].

The river, taking its rise in the [[Stanovoi Mountains]] as the Ivashki or Ivachno, about 67°N latitude and 173°E longitude, flows through the [[Chukotka]], at first southwest and then east, and enters the Gulf of Anadyr after a course of about 500 miles. The country through which it passes is thinly populated, and is dominated by [[tundra]], which is rich with a variety of plant life. Much of the region is folded in rugged mountains, and is a beautiful landscape. For nine months of the year the ground is covered with snow, and the frozen rivers become navigable roads. [[Reindeer]], upon which the inhabitants subsist, were once found in considerable numbers, but the domestic reindeer population has collapsed dramatically since the reorganization and privatization of state-run collective farms beginning in [[1992]]. As herds of domestic reindeer have declined, herds of wild [[caribou]] have increased.

'''André-Marie Ampère''' ([[January 20]] [[1775]] &amp;ndash; [[June 10]] [[1836]]), was a French [[physicist]] who is generally credited as one of the main discoverers of [[electromagnetism]]. The [[ampere]] unit of measurement of [[Current (electricity)|electric current]] is named after him.

==Early days==
Ampère was born in [[Lyon]], near his father's country house in [[Poleymieux]] and, as a [[child prodigy]], took a passionate delight in the pursuit of knowledge from his very infancy, and is reported to have worked out long arithmetical sums by means of pebbles and biscuit crumbs before he knew the figures. His father began to teach him [[Latin]], but ceased on discovering the boy's greater inclination and aptitude for mathematical studies. The young Ampère, however, soon resumed his Latin lessons, to enable him to master the works of [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] and [[Daniel Bernoulli|Bernoulli]]. 

In later life he was accustomed to say that he knew as much about mathematics when he was eighteen as ever he knew; but, a [[polymath]], his reading embraced nearly the whole round of knowledge &amp;mdash; history, travels, poetry, philosophy and the natural sciences.  

In [[1796]] he met Julie Carron, and an attachment sprang up between them. In [[1799]] they were married. From about 1796 Ampère gave private lessons at Lyons in [[mathematics]], [[chemistry]] and languages; and in [[1801]] he removed to Bourg, as professor of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], leaving his ailing wife and infant son ([[Jean Jacques Ampère]]) at Lyon. She died in 1804, and he never recovered from her death. In the same year he was appointed professor of mathematics at the ''[[lycée]]'' of Lyon.

==Contributions to physics and further studies==
[[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre]]'s recommendation obtained for him the Lyon appointment, and afterwards ([[1804]]) a subordinate position in the polytechnic school at Paris, where he was appointed professor of mathematics in 1809. Here he continued to pursue his scientific research and his diverse studies with unabated diligence.  He was admitted as a member of the Institute in [[1814]].  

Ampère's fame mainly rests on the service that he rendered to science in establishing the relations between electricity and magnetism, and in developing the science of electromagnetism, or, as he called it, electrodynamics.  On [[September 11]], [[1820]] he heard of [[Hans Christian Ørsted|H. C. Ørsted's]] discovery that a magnetic needle is acted on by a voltaic current.  Only a week later, on [[September 18]], he presented a paper to the Academy containing a far more complete exposition of that and kindred phenomena.

==Legacy and final days==
The whole field thus opened up he explored with characteristic industry and care, and developed a mathematical theory which not only explained the electromagnetic phenomena already observed but also predicted many new ones.  

He died at [[Marseille]] and is buried in the [[Cimetière de Montmartre]], Paris. The great amiability and childlike simplicity of Ampère's character are well brought out in his ''Journal et correspondance'' (Paris, [[1872]]). Forty-five years later, mathematicians recognized him.

'''''Amoeba''''' (also spelled '''''ameba''''') is a genus of [[protozoa]] that moves by means of temporary projections called [[pseudopods]], and is well-known as a representative unicellular organism.  The word amoeba is variously used to refer to it and its close relatives, now grouped as the [[Amoebozoa]], or to all protozoa that move using pseudopods, otherwise termed [[amoeboid]]s.  See those pages for further information.

''Amoeba'' itself is found in freshwater, typically on decaying vegetation from streams, but is not especially common in nature.  However, because of the ease with which they may be obtained and kept in the lab, they are common objects of study, both as representative protozoa and to demonstrate cell structure and function.  The cells have several lobose pseudopods, with one large tubular pseudopod at the anterior and several secondary ones branching to the sides. The most famous species, ''A. proteus'', is 700-800 &amp;mu;m in length, but many others are much smaller.  Each has a single [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], and a simple contractile [[vacuole]] which maintains its [[osmosis|osmotic]] pressure, as its most recognizable features.

Early naturalists referred to ''Amoeba'' as the [[Proteus]] [[animalcule]], after a Greek god who could change his shape.  The name &quot;amibe&quot; was given to it by Bery St. Vincent, from the Greek ''amoibe'', meaning change.

A good method of collecting amoeba is to lower a jar upside down until it is just above the sediment surface. Then slowly let air escape so the top layer will be sucked into the jar. Try not to allow deeper sediment get sucked in. You can slowly move the jar when tilting it so you collect from a larger area. If no amoeba are found, one can try introducing some rice grains into the jar and waiting for them to start to rot. The bacteria eating the rice will be eaten by the amoeba, thus increasing the population and making them easier to find. 

==''Amoeba'' in popular culture==

* The North American writer [[Tom Robbins]] states, in the [[preface]] to his book [[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues]], that amoebas are [[cool]] because they [[reproduce]] by [[binary fission]], so the first amoeba is still alive to this day.
* In the [[1984]] computer game [[Boulder Dash]], Rockford, the main character, is chased all the time by a constantly-growing amoeba.
* In certain places of [[Brazil]], the term amoeba (in its [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] form: ''ameba'') is used as a [[derogatory]] [[slang]] for &quot;slow, [[obtuse]] person&quot;.

'''Ammonia''' is a [[chemical compound|compound]] of [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. At [[standard temperature and pressure]] ammonia is a [[gas]]. It is [[toxic]] and [[corrosive]] to some materials, and has a characteristic pungent [[odor]]. 

An ammonia molecule has a [[Trigonal pyramid (chemistry)|trigonal pyramid]] shape, as would be expected from [[VSEPR theory]]. This shape gives the molecule an overall [[dipole]] moment and makes it [[Polar molecule|polar]] so that ammonia very readily dissolves in [[Water (molecule)|water]]. The nitrogen atom in the molecule has a [[Lone pair|lone electron pair]], and ammonia acts as a [[Base (chemistry)|base]]. That means that, when in aqueous solution, it can take a [[proton]] from water; this produces a [[hydroxide]] [[anion]] and an [[ammonium]] [[cation]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), which has the shape of a regular tetrahedron. The degree to which ammonia forms the ammonium ion depends on the [[pH]] of the [[solution]]—at &quot;physiological&quot; pH (~7), about 99% of the ammonia molecules are protonated.

The main uses of ammonia are in the production of [[fertilizer]]s, [[explosive]]s and [[polymer]]s. It is also an ingredient in certain household glass cleaners. Ammonia is found in small quantities in the atmosphere, being produced from the [[putrefaction]] of nitrogenous animal and vegetable matter. Ammonia and ammonium salts are also found in small quantities in rainwater, while [[ammonium chloride]] (sal-ammoniac) and ammonium sulfate are found in volcanic districts; crystals of [[ammonium bicarbonate]] have been found in [[Patagonia]]n [[guano]]. Ammonium salts also are found distributed through all fertile soil and in seawater. Substances containing ammonia or that are similar to it are called ammoniacal.

== History ==

Salts of ammonia have been known from very early times; thus the term ''Hammoniacus sal'' appears in the writings of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], although it is not known whether the term is identical with the more modern ''sal-ammoniac''. 

In the form of sal-ammoniac, ammonia was known to the [[alchemy|alchemists]] as early as the [[13th century]], being mentioned by [[Albertus Magnus]]. It was also used by [[dyer]]s in the [[Middle Ages]] in the form of fermented [[urine]] to alter the colour of vegetable dyes. In the [[15th century]], [[Basilius Valentinus]] showed that ammonia could be obtained by the action of alkalis on sal-ammoniac. At a later period, when sal-ammoniac was obtained by distilling the hoofs and horns of oxen and neutralizing the resulting carbonate with [[hydrochloric acid]], the name '''Spirit of hartshorn''' was applied to ammonia. 

Gaseous ammonia was first isolated by [[Joseph Priestley]] in [[1774]] and was termed by him ''alkaline air''. In [[1777]] [[Karl Wilhelm Scheele]] showed that it contained [[nitrogen]], and [[Claude Louis Berthollet]], in about [[1785]], ascertained its composition.

The [[Haber process]] to produce ammonia from the nitrogen contained in the air was developed by [[Fritz Haber]] and [[Carl Bosch]] in [[1909]] and patented in [[1910]]. It was first used on an industrial scale by the Germans during [[World War I]]. The ammonia was used to produce explosives to sustain their war effort.

== Synthesis and production ==
Because of its mananing &quot;top gold&quot;. However, scholars give greater credence to the notion that it originated with a now-extinct dialect word from the [[East Midlands]] in England, where dinkum (or dincum) meant &quot;hard work&quot; or &quot;fair work&quot;, which was also the original meaning in Australian English.[http://www.anu.edu.au/andc/ozwords/November_98/7._dinkum.htm] The derivation ''dinky-di'' means a native-born Australian.

Similarly, ''g'day'', a stereotypical Australian greeting, is no longer synonymous with &quot;good day&quot; in other varieties of English and is never used as an expression for &quot;farewell&quot;, as &quot;good day&quot; is in other countries.

Some elements of [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal languages]] have been incorporated into Australian English, mainly as names for places, flora and fauna (for example [[dingo]], [[kangaroo]]).  Beyond that, some terms have been adopted into the wider language, except for some localised terms, or slang. Some examples are ''cooee'', ''yarn'' and ''Hard yakka''.  The former is a high-pitched call (pronounced {{IPA|/kʉː.iː/}}) which travels long distances and is used to attract attention. ''Cooee'' has also become a notional distance: ''if he's within cooee, we'll spot him''. ''Yarn'' means to chat or tell a story. This has further evolved into ''spin a yarn'' for telling a long and engaging tale. ''Hard yakka'' means ''hard work'' and is derived from ''yakka'', from the [[Yagara]]/[[Jagara]] language once spoken in the Brisbane region. Also from the Brisbane region comes the word ''bung'' meaning broken. A failed piece of equipment might be described as having ''gone bung''.

Though often thought of as an Aboriginal word, [[didgeridoo]] (a well known wooden musical instrument) is probably an [[onomatopoeia|onomatopaoeic]] word of Western invention.  It has also been suggested that it may have an [[Irish language|Irish]] derivation.[http://www.flinders.edu.au/news/articles/?fj09v13s02]

==Varieties of Australian English==
Most linguists consider that there are three main varieties of Australian English: &quot;'''Broad'''&quot;, &quot;'''General'''&quot; and &quot;'''Cultivated'''&quot;. These three main varieties are actually part of a continuum and are based on variations in accent. They often, but not always, reflect the [[social class]] and/or [[education]]al background of the speaker.

====Broad Australian English====
Broad Australian English is the [[archetype|archetypal]] and most recognisable variety and is familiar to English speakers around the world, because of its use in identifying Australian characters in non-Australian [[film]]s and [[television]] programs. In reality it is less common than General Australian English. Broad Australian English is recognisable by a certain nasal [[drawl]] and the prevalence of long [[diphthong]]s.
Broad Australian English is more likely to be encountered when travelling farther away from the capital cities.

====General Australian English====
General Australian English is the [[stereotype|stereotypical]] variety of Australian English. It is the variety of English used by the majority of Australians and it dominates the accents found in contemporary Australian-made films and television programs, such as ''[[Neighbours]]''. This variety has noticeably shorter vowel sounds than Broad Australian English, among other differences. There is perhaps a trend towards General Australian away from the extremes.

====Cultivated Australian English====
Cultivated Australian English (CAE) has many similarities to [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Received Pronunciation]], and is often mistaken for it. CAE is now spoken by less than 10% of the population. An overwhelmingly large and growing majority of Australians now have either General or Broad accents. One effect of this is that the speech of people like [[Alexander Downer]], the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] is mocked as sounding &quot;[[wiktionary:affected|affected]]&quot;, &quot;[[wiktionary:snobby|snobby]]&quot; or &quot;[[wiktionary:aloof|aloof]]&quot;, when his accent is simply an example of CAE, reinforced by the fact that he completed his secondary schooling at a [[public school]] in England and went to university there. CAE was once common among public figures in Australia.

====Examples of Broad, General and Cultivated Australian accents====
Examples of each include the normal speaking voices of the following identities:

'''Broad'''
*Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]]
*actor [[Bryan Brown]]
*actor [[Paul Hogan (actor)|Paul Hogan]] 
*television personality [[Steve Irwin]]
*television/stage character [[Dame Edna Everage]] &lt;!-- Note: Edna may believe that she has a cultivated or general Australian accent, but listen to her vowels. --&gt;

'''General''' 
*Prime Minister [[John Howard]]
*actress [[Nicole Kidman]]
*actor [[Hugh Jackman]]
*actor [[Russell Crowe]]
*actor [[Jesse Spencer]]

'''Cultivated'''
*actress [[Judy Davis]]
*Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]]
*actor [[Geoffrey Rush]]
*opera singer [[Dame Joan Sutherland]]
*comedian/actor [[Barry Humphries]]

===Regional variation===
It is sometimes claimed that regional variations in pronunciation and accent exist, but if present at all they are very small compared to those of British and American English &amp;ndash; sufficiently so that linguists are divided on the question. Overall, pronunciation is determined less by region than by social and educational influences.

====Regional vocabulary====
There is, however, some variation in Australian English vocabulary between different regions. An example often cited by linguists is the variety of names given by Australians to bland, processed [[pork]] products &amp;ndash; known in other countries as pork [[luncheon meat]] or [[baloney]] &amp;ndash; is so great, that these words are used by linguists to ascertain not only which Australian state or territory a person is from, but also regional origin within states in some cases. For example, in [[South Australia]] (SA) this product is known as ''fritz'', for most people in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (Vic) it is ''stras'', in most of [[New South Wales]] (NSW) it is ''devon'', in [[Western Australia]] (WA) ''polony'', in [[Queensland]] (Qld) ''windsor'' (''&quot;devon&quot;'' is also used), in [[Tasmania]] (Tas) ''belgium'', and so on. (See [[Australian_words#Processed_pork|Australian words for processed pork]], for more details.)

Regional variation does not respect [[States and territories of Australia|state borders]], and this is shown, for example, by the fact that both Queenslanders and people from northern New South Wales say ''port'' (short for [[Portmanteau (travelling case)|portmanteau]]) while people in the other states say ''case'', ''school bag'', ''backpack'' and/or ''knapsack''. In the past variation was so strong that the residents of the NSW town of [[Maitland, New South Wales|Maitland]] would use the word port where [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], some 20 kilometres away, would prefer the latter term. 

There is also great variety in the names of beer glasses from one area to another. For example, a standard 285ml (10 fl.oz.) glass, in different states or regions, is known as a ''middy'' (NSW/WA/[[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]]), ''pot'' (Vic/Qld/Tas), ''handle'' (NT/SA), ''ten'' (SA/Tas)  or ''schooner'' (SA). Such variation causes great confusion, especially since a schooner is a 425 ml
(15 fl.oz.) glass in every state that uses the word except SA. (See [[Australian_words#Beer_glasses|Australian words for beer glasses]] for a full list.)

Although swimwear is known as ''bathers'' in most areas, people in NSW and Queensland do not conform, preferring terms such as ''swimmers'', ''cossie'' or ''togs'' (see [[Australian_words#Swimwear|Australian words for swimwear]]).

Another example is the word ''tuckshop'' which is used in Queensland and northern NSW to describe a food outlet on school premises; the word ''canteen'' is now more common in other areas of Australia, although tuckshop may occasionally be used in those areas as well.

There are many regional variations for describing [[social class]]es or [[subculture]]s.  The best example is probably ''[[bogan]]'' (fairly universal), which is also referred to as ''bevan'' in Queensland&lt;!---removed &quot;, ''westie'' around Sydney,&quot; &quot;westie&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;bogan&quot; ---&gt; and ''booner'' in the ACT.

The differences are not restricted to words. For example, it is often said that people from some parts of [[Queensland]] end sentences with the interrogative &quot;''eh''?&quot; (or &quot;''hay?''&quot;, &quot;''hey''&quot;, and so on), although this is also common in both [[New Zealand English]] and [[Canadian English]]. 

The steadily increasing centralisation of film, TV and radio production, however, may be spreading new words more rapidly and blurring such distinctions.

{{see also|South Australian English|Western Australian English}}

=====Sport variations=====
Many regional variations are as a result of the Australian passion for sport and the differences in non-linguistic traditions from one state to another: the word ''[[football]]'' refers to the most popular code of football in different States or regions, or even ethnic groups within them. [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorians]] start a game of [[Australian rules football]] with a ''ball up'', [[Western Australia]]ns with a ''bounce down''; [[New South Wales|New South Welsh]] people and [[Queensland]]ers start a game of [[Rugby League]] or [[Rugby Union]] with a ''kick off'', as do [[football (soccer)|soccer]] fans across Australia.

In the early 21st century the [[Football Federation Australia| 
national governing body for football (soccer)]] attempted to foster use of &quot;football&quot; to mean soccer, in accordance with general international usage.  It is yet to be seen whether this will spead into the mainstream, however it is important to note that several media outlets have adopted the use of the word football in accordance with this.

The Australian slang word ''footy'' has been traditionally associated with the native code of Australian rules football.  The word has also been adopted to a lesser degree by rugby league followers, following directly from the association of the word to describe the most popular football code.  Examples in popular culture includes the [[The Footy Show]]. More recently it has been adopted in other countries in reference to other codes, such as the UK (soccer) and New Zealand (rugby union).

For many Australian rules followers, the verb ''barrack'' (or the accompanying noun form ''barracker''), is used to describe following a team or club. (In New South Wales and Queensland the term ''support'' or ''supporter'' is generally used instead.) Barrack has its origins in British English, although in the UK it now usually means to jeer or denigrate an opposing team or players. The expression &quot;root (or rooting) for a team&quot;, as used in the United States, is not generally used in Australia as ''root'' (or rooting) is slang for [[sexual intercourse]].

==Phonology==
{{main|Australian English phonology}}
Australian English is a [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]] variety. It is unique in its remarkable homogeneity over a vast area. Unlike most varieties of English, it has a [[vowel length|phonemic length distinction]]. It has a reasonably standard consonant inventory.
{{see also|Phonemic differentiation}}

===Myths about Australian accents===
Australian English is sometimes described as high-pitched, nasal, lazy or drawling. The claims of high pitch and nasality are not entirely true, as many Australian English speakers perceive much of American English to be nasal, while laziness and drawling are impossible to test objectively.

Similarly, stereotypes of Australian speech as having a &quot;rising tone&quot; or &quot;questioning intonation&quot;, known in linguistics as [[high rising terminal]], are not entirely justified by the empirical evidence. Many Australians' speech patterns do not conform to this stereotype, and the &quot;questioning intonation&quot; can be found in many regional speech patterns, such as those in the south of England, Northern Ireland, and even North America.

==Use of words by Australians==
Perception has it that a common trait is the frequent use of long-winded [[simile|similes]], such as &quot;slow as a wet week&quot;, &quot;built like a brick shit-house&quot;, &quot;mad as a cut snake&quot;, &quot;up and down like a bride's nightie&quot;, &quot;dry as a dead dingo's donger&quot;, &quot;off like prawns in the sun&quot;, &quot;sweating like a pig on fire&quot;, or &quot;flat out like a lizard drinking&quot;.  Moreover, several such expressions are common in many parts of the English-speaking world and are only perceived as uniquely Australian by Australians.

Many Australians believe themselves to be direct in manner, and this is typified by statements such as &quot;why call a spade a spade, when you can call it a bloody shovel&quot;. Such sentiments can lead to misunderstandings and offence being caused to people from cultures where an emphasis is placed on avoiding conflict, such as people from [[East Asia]]. 

Spoken Australian English is generally more tolerant of offensive and/or abusive language than other variants. A famous exponent was the former [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Paul Keating]], who referred in [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]] to various political opponents as a &quot;mangy maggot&quot;, a &quot;stupid foul-mouthed grub&quot;, and so on.  He drew ire from then Malaysian leader [[Mahathir Mohammed]] for calling him a &quot;recalcitrant&quot;. This tradition was continued by fellow [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] [[Member_of_parliament|MP]] [[Mark Latham]] who, in 2002, unapologetically described a visit by Prime Minister [[John Howard]] to [[George W. Bush]] as &quot;an arse-licking effort&quot;.  The widespread  desire among Australians to avoid pomposity, leading to a rejection of even formal or dignified speech, is sometimes seen as reflecting a suspicion of success in general, a phenomenon sometimes known as the [[tall poppy syndrome]], another term widely used in the English speaking world but perceived by many Australians to be a local coinage.

===Humour===
An important aspect of Australian English usage, inherited in small part from Britain and Ireland, is the use of [[deadpan humour]], in which a person will make extravagant, outrageous and/or ridiculous statements in a neutral tone, and without explicitly indicating they are joking. Tourists seen to be gullible and/or lacking a sense of humour may be subjected to tales of kangaroos hopping across the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] and similar tall tales. (See also [[Drop Bear]].)

===Diminutives===
Australian English makes far more frequent use of [[diminutive]]s than other varieties of English.  These which can be formed in a number of ways such as adding ''-o'' or ''-ie'' to the ends of abbreviated words. They can be used to indicate familiarity, although in many [[speech community|speech communities]] the diminutive form is more common than the original word or phrase.

Examples with the -o ending include ''abo'' (aborigine, now considered offensive), ''arvo'' (afternoon), ''doco'' (documentary), ''servo'' (service station, known in other countries as a &quot;petrol station&quot; or &quot;gas station&quot;), ''bottle-o'' (bottle-shop or liquor store), ''rego'' (still pronounced with a {{IPA|/&amp;#676;/}}) (annual motor vehicle registration), ''compo'' (compensation), ''leso'' or ''lesbo'' (lesbian, also offensive, pronounced with a {{IPA|/z/}}), ''ambo'' (ambulance officer). [[The Salvation Army]] is often referred to as &quot;The Salvos&quot;. The city of [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] is known by many of its inhabitants as ''Freo''. [[Filipino people|Filipino]] youth in Australia refer to themselves as being a ''Filo'', a word not used by [[Filipino American]]s.

Examples of the -ie ending include ''barbie'' (barbecue), ''bikkie'' (biscuit), ''bikie'' (member of a motorcycle club), ''brekkie'' (breakfast), ''blowie'' (blowfly), ''brickie'' (brick layer), ''mozzie'' (mosquito), and ''pollie'' (politician).  The city of [[Brisbane]] is often called ''Brissie'' (pronounced with a {{IPA|/z/}}).  

Occasionally, a ''-za'' diminutive is used, usually for personal names where the first of multiple syllables ends in an &quot;r&quot;. Karen becomes ''Kazza'' and Jeremy becomes ''Jezza''. Also popular and common is the ''-z'' diminutive form (also found in British English) whereby Karen becomes ''Kaz'' and so on.

Other diminutive forms include:
* last one or two syllables, prefaced with a [[definite article]]: for example, ''The Gabba'' for the [[Brisbane Cricket Ground]] at [[Woolloongabba, Queensland|Woolloongabba]]; ''The Gong'' for [[Wollongong]].
* first syllable plus &quot;-s&quot;: ''turps'' [[turpentine]] (usually referring to drinking alcohol, e.g. &quot;a night on the turps&quot;) or [[Ian Turpie]]; Gabs, pet form of [[List of English given names|Gabrielle]].
* first syllable plus &quot;-ers&quot;: ''Honkers'' ([[Hong Kong]]).

===Rarely Used Phrases===
Because of the caricaturised over-use, or &quot;Hollywoodisation&quot;, of some phrases attributed to Australians, some of these have dropped out of common conversation (at least in most urban areas). Words being used less often are ''strewth'' and ''crikey'', and archetypal phrases like ''Flat out like a lizard drinking'' are rarely heard without a sense of irony.

Other terms were never used in the first place. The much-quoted line &quot;''[[Shrimp_on_the_barbie|Throw another shrimp on the barbie]]''&quot; was a phrase that has never been used by Australians, but was a concoction of the Australian Tourist Commission for a US advertisement for tourism to Australia. &quot;[[Shrimp]]&quot; is an international English term — they are called [[prawns]] in Australia.

'''American Airlines Flight 11''' was an [[American Airlines]] flight aboard a [[Boeing 767-223ER]] [[aircraft]], registration number N334AA. Flight 11 regularly flew from [[Logan International Airport]] in [[East Boston, Massachusetts|East Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], to [[Los Angeles International Airport]]. On [[September 11]], [[2001]], the aircraft on this route was [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] in a [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terrorist attack]]; the hijackers crashed into the [[One World Trade Center tenants|North Tower]] of the [[World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]].

[[Image:911 commission AA11 path.png|thumb|left|AA 11 flight path from Boston to New York City.]]
The regularly scheduled flight took off from Logan International Airport at 7:59 a.m., and the plane is believed to have been hijacked at 8:14. At around that time, when the plane stopped responding to [[air traffic control]], the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] had thought the plane had been hijacked. By 8:25, there was no doubt.

There were five hijackers believed to have participated in the hijacking. [[Mohamed Atta al Sayed]], the ringleader and pilot, was in seat 8D. [[Satam al-Suqami]], who had paid in cash that day, sat in seat 10B. [[Waleed al-Shehri]] sat in seat 2B, while [[Wail al-Shehri]] sat next to him in seat 2A. [[Abdulaziz al-Omari]], who had earlier flown with Atta to Logan Airport from Portland, Maine, was also on this flight. 

Some information about what had happened on board was sent by flight attendants on the plane. According to [[Madeline Amy Sweeney]] and [[Betty Ong]], three people&amp;ndash;two attendants and a passenger&amp;ndash;were stabbed or had their throats slashed by the hijackers. The passenger, [[Daniel M. Lewin|Daniel Lewin]], a notable [[Internet]] [[entrepreneur]], had also previously served as an officer in the elite [[Sayeret Matkal]] unit of the [[Israeli Defense Forces|Israeli military]]. A 2002 [[FAA]] memo referenced Lewin as possibly being killed by [[Satam al-Suqami]] after he attempted to stop the hijacking.

The first-class area had been sequestered by the surviving crew, and the rest of the passengers had been led to believe that a medical emergency was taking place in the first class area. The hijackers also used [[mace (spray)|mace]], [[pepper spray]], or some other [[aerosol spray]]-based [[tear gas|irritant]] to discourage entry into the first class area and the cockpit. One reported that her eyes were burning and that she was having trouble breathing. The hijackers claimed to have a bomb, although there is no evidence they actually had an explosive device.

At  8:46:40 a.m., Flight 11 was del?&quot; / &quot;Did you clean your teeth?&quot;
** &quot;Have you done your homework yet?&quot; / &quot;Did you do your homework yet?&quot;
** &quot;I've just got home.&quot; / &quot;I just got home.&quot;
** &quot;I've already eaten.&quot; / &quot;I already ate.&quot;
* Similarly, the [[pluperfect tense|pluperfect]] is occasionally replaced by the [[preterite]] in the USA; this is generally regarded as sloppy usage by those Americans who consider themselves careful users of the language.
* In British English, ''have got'' or ''have'' can be used for possession and ''have got to'' and ''have to'' can be used for the modal of necessity. The forms which include ''got'' are usually used in informal contexts and the forms without ''got'' in more formal contexts. In American speech the form without ''got'' is used more than in the UK. American also informally uses ''got'' as a verb for these meanings, ''e.g.'' &quot;I got two cars,&quot; &quot;I got to go&quot;; but these are nonstandard and will be considered sloppy usage by many American speakers.
* The [[subjunctive mood]] is more common in American English in expressions such as: &quot;They suggested that he apply for the job&quot;. British English would have &quot;They suggested that he should apply for the job&quot; (or even &quot;They suggested that he applied for the job&quot;). However, the British usage (&quot;should apply&quot;) is also heard in the United States.

===Verb morphology===
: ''See also: [[wiktionary:Wiktionary_Appendix:Irregular_Verbs|the list of irregular verbs]]''

* Verb past tenses with ''-ed'': Americans tend to use ''dreamed'', ''leaped'', ''learned'', ''spelled''; Commonwealth more commonly uses ''dreamt'', ''leapt'', ''learnt'', ''spelt'', particularly if the speaker uses [[Received Pronunciation]]. As with the &quot;tre&quot; words, the ''t'' endings are often found in older American texts. The forms with ''-ed'' are also common in Commonwealth usage, and preferred by many careful writers of English since they are [[weak verb|regular verbs]]. (Note that the two-syllable form ''learnèd'' {{IPA|/'l&amp;#604;&amp;#720;n&amp;#618;d/}}, usually written simply as ''learned'', is still used as an adjective to mean &quot;educated&quot;, or to refer to academic institutions, in both British English and American English.)
* Other verb past tense forms: Americans more frequently use the irregular forms ''fit'', ''forecast'', ''knit'', ''lit'', ''wed''; the weak forms ''fitted'', ''forecasted'', ''knitted'', ''lighted'', ''wedded'' are more common in Commonwealth use. The distinction is, however, not rigorous as the Commonwealth forms are also found in American, and both ''lit'' and ''forecast'' are not only found in Commonwealth English, but are generally considered standard usage.
* Also, the past participle ''gotten'' is rarely used in modern British English (although it is used in some dialects), which generally uses ''got'' (as do some Americans), except in old expressions such as ''ill-gotten gains''. Commonwealth usage retains the form ''forgotten'', though. Furthermore, according to the Compact Oxford English Dictionary, &quot;The form ''gotten'' is not used in British English but is very common in North American English, though even there it is often regarded as non-standard.&quot;  In North America, most people who use ''gotten'' also use ''got'', with ''gotten'' emphasizing the action of acquiring, and ''got'' tending to indicate simple possession (''Have you gotten it?'', as an example).  
* The past participle ''proven'' is frequently used in American English, although some speakers avoid it, and it remains ''proved'' in British English (except in adjectival use; and usage is different in [[Scots law]]).
* American English further allows other irregular verbs, such as &lt;!--''thrive'' (''throve''&amp;ndash;''thriven'') or --&gt;''dive'' (''dove'') or ''sneak'' (''snuck''), which remain regular in Commonwealth English, and often mixes the preterite and past participle forms (''spring''&amp;ndash;''sprang'' (U.S. also ''sprung'')&amp;ndash;''sprung''), sometimes forcing verbs such as ''shrink'' (''shrank''&amp;ndash;''shrunk'') to have a further form, thus ''shrunk''&amp;ndash;''shrunken''. (These uses are often considered nonstandard; the [[Associated Press Stylebook]] in American English treats some irregular verbs as colloquialisms, insisting on the regular forms for the past tense of ''dive'', ''plead'' and ''sneak''.)

===Presence or absence of syntactic elements===
* Where a statement of intention involves two separate activities, it is acceptable for speakers of American English to use ''to go'' plus bare infinitive. Speakers of British English would instead use ''to go '''and''''' plus bare infinitive: thus where a speaker of American English might say &quot;I'll go take a bath&quot;, British English speakers would say &quot;I'll go ''and'' have a bath&quot;.  (Both can also use the form &quot;to go to&quot; instead to suggest that the action may fail, as in &quot;He went to take/have a bath, but the bath was full of children.&quot;)  Similarly, ''to come'' plus bare infinitive is acceptable to speakers of American English, where speakers of British English would instead use ''to come '''and''''' plus bare infinitive:  thus where a speaker of American English might say ''Come see what I bought'', British English speakers would say, ''Come and see what I've bought'' (notice the addition of &quot;have&quot;: a common British preference).
* Use of prepositions before days denoted by a single word. Where [[British]] people would say &quot;She resigned on Thursday&quot;, Americans often say &quot;She resigned Thursday&quot;, but both forms are common in American usage.  Occasionally, the preposition is also absent when referring to months: &quot;I'll be here December&quot; (although this usage is generally limited to colloquial speech).
* In the UK, ''from'' is used with single dates and times more often than in the United States. Where British speakers and writers may say &quot;the new museum will be open from Tuesday,&quot; Americans always say &quot;the new museum will be open starting Tuesday&quot;, and would probably be confused by the British saying. (This difference does not apply to phrases of the pattern ''from A to B'', which are used in both British and American English.) A variation or alternative of this is the American &quot;the play opens Tuesday&quot; and the British &quot;the play opens on Tuesday&quot;.
* Where an American will ''meet with'' someone, a British person can ''meet'' someone.  To a British person, the use of ''with'' seems to reinforce a notion of mutuality (in this case, the usage is similar to ''to have a meeting with someone''). 
* The verb ''visit'' is often used intransitively in American English, with possibly the additional meaning of &quot;to have a conversation&quot; (as in &quot;to visit with a friend&quot;, a construction that often sounds strange to British ears). 
* In British English, the indirect object of the verb &quot;to write&quot; usually requires the preposition &quot;to&quot;, e.g. &quot;I'll write '''to''' my MP&quot; or &quot;I'll write '''to''' her&quot; (although it is not required in some situations, for example when an indirect object pronoun comes before a direct object noun, e.g. &quot;I'll write '''her''' a letter&quot;). In American English, the &quot;to&quot; can be omitted in many circumstances, e.g. &quot;I'll write my congressman&quot; or &quot;I'll write him&quot;.
* Intransitive verbs often become transitive in American English; for example, British English: &quot;The workers protested against the decision.&quot; American English: &quot;The workers protested the decision.&quot;
* A few 'institutional' nouns take no [[definite article]] when a certain role is implied: for example, &quot;at sea&quot; (as a sailor), &quot;in prison&quot; (as a convict), and &quot;at university&quot; (for British students) or &quot;at/in college&quot; (for American students). Among this group, Commonwealth English has &quot;in [[hospital]]&quot; (as a patient), where American English requires ''in '''the''' hospital''. (A nurse, visitor, etc. would be &quot;in the hospital&quot; in both systems, as the implied role (of patient) does not apply.)
*American English distinguishes ''in back of'' [behind] from ''in '''the''' back of''; the former is unknown in the UK and liable to misinterpretation as the latter.  Both however distinguish ''in front of'' from ''in the front of''.
* American [[legislator]]s and [[lawyer]]s always use the preposition &quot;of&quot; between the name of a legislative act and the year it was passed, while their British equivalents do not.  Compare ''[[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]'' to ''[[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]]''.

===Different prepositions in certain contexts===
* In the United States, the word ''through'' can mean &quot;up to and including&quot; as in ''Monday through Friday''. In the UK ''Monday to Friday'', or ''Monday to Friday inclusive'' is used instead; ''Monday through to Friday'' is also sometimes used. (In some parts of Northern England the term ''while'' can be used in the same way, as in ''Monday while Friday'', whereas in Northern Ireland ''Monday till Friday'' would be more natural.)
* In American English, &quot;in&quot; is never used to describe which street one lives in, whereas in British English &quot;in&quot; is sometimes used when describing a certain place in the street. For example, in British usage one would always live &quot;on Churchill Road&quot;, but might also live &quot;in the middle of Churchill Road&quot;. Thus the lyric &quot;our house, in the middle of our street&quot; from &quot;Our House&quot; by the British band [[Madness (band)|Madness]] is confusing to many Americans. Note that the use of &quot;on&quot; and &quot;in&quot; in British English depends on where the house is; one doesn't live &quot;in the end of Churchill Road&quot;, nor lives &quot;in the corner&quot;
* After ''talk'' American can use the preposition ''with'' but British always uses ''to'' (i.e. &quot;I'll talk with Dave / I'll talk to Dave&quot;. The American form is sometimes seen as more [[politically correct]] in British organisations, inducing the ideal of discussing (with), as opposed to lecturing (to). This is, of course, unless talk is being used as a noun, for example: &quot;I'll have a talk with him&quot; in which case this is acceptable in both British and American English.
* In American English ''from'' is the preposition prescribed for use after the word ''different'': &quot;American English is different from British English in several respects.&quot;  While considered technically incorrect by prescriptionists, ''different than'' is also commonly heard in the US.  The British phrasing ''different to'', however, is almost entirely unknown in the US. When grammar is taught formally in the UK, both ''different than'' and ''different to'' are regarded as incorrect, whereas ''different from'' is considered correct by those who subscribe to grammatical [[Prescription and description|prescription]].
* It is common in British English to say ''opposite to''. American English uses ''opposite of''.

===Miscellaneous grammatical differences===
* In American English there is a normative rule which says that, for a non-human antecedent, ''which'' should not be used in [[Restrictive clause|restrictive relative clauses]]. According to ''[[The Elements of Style]]'' (p. 59), &quot;''That'' is the defining, or restrictive pronoun, ''which'' the nondefining, or nonrestrictive. See Rule 3.&quot;
* In names of American rivers, the word ''river'' usually comes after the name (for example, ''[[Colorado River]]''), whereas for British rivers it comes before (as in ''[[River Thames]]'').  One exception present in British English is the ''[[Fleet River]]'', which is rarely called the ''River Fleet'' by [[Londoner]]s outside of official documentation. An exception in the U.S. is the ''[[River Raisin]]'' in [[Michigan]] named by the French.
* In British English the word ''sat'' is often colloquially used to cover ''sat'', ''sitting'' and ''seated'': &quot;I've been sat here waiting for half an hour.&quot; &quot;The bride's family will be sat on the right side of the church.&quot; This construction is not often heard outside the UK. In the 1960s, its use would mark a speaker as coming from the north of England but by the turn of the 21st century this form had spread to the south. Its use often conveys lighthearted informality, as many speakers intentionally use an ungrammatical construction they would probably not use in [[Formal written English|formal written English]].  This colloquial usage is widely understood by British speakers. Similarly ''stood'' can be used instead of ''standing''.  To an American these usages may imply that the subject had been involuntarily forced to sit or stand.
* In most areas of the United States, the word ''with'' is also used as an adverb: &quot;I'll come with&quot; instead of &quot;I'll come along&quot;.  However, in some British Dialects, 'come with' is used as an abbreviation of 'come with me', as in &quot;I'm going to the office - come with&quot; instead of &quot;I'm going to the office - come with me&quot;.

==Word derivation and compounds==
* Directional suffix ''-ward(s)'': British ''forwards'', ''towards'', ''rightwards'', etc.; American ''forward'', ''toward'', ''rightward''.  The forms with ''-s'' are only used as adverbs or prepositions in American English, though ''-s'' forms are becoming less common save for ''afterwards''. In British English, there is a semantic difference in the usage of the two possible forms.  The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' states the following about ''forward'' and ''forwards'': &quot;/.../ the latter expresses a definite direction viewed in contrast with other directions. In some contexts either form may be used without perceptible difference of meaning; the following are examples in which only one of them can be used: 'The ratchet-wheel can move only ''forwards''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;; 'the right side of the paper has the maker's name reading ''forwards''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;; 'if you move at all it must be ''forwards''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;; 'my companion has gone ''forward''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;; 'to bring a matter ''forward''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;; 'from this time ''forward''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&quot;
* Commonwealth English allows agentive ''-er'' suffix for ''[[football]]'' (also ''[[cricket]]''; often ''[[netball]]''; occasionally ''[[basketball]]'').  American English always uses ''football player'' rather than ''footballer''.  Where the sport's name is usable as a verb, the suffixation is standard in both American English and British English: for example, ''[[golf]]er'', ''[[Ten-pin_bowling|bowler]]'', and ''[[Shooting_sports|shooter]]''.
* English writers everywhere occasionally make new compound words from common phrases; for example, ''health care'' is now being replaced by ''healthcare'' on both sides of the Atlantic.  However, American English has made certain words in this fashion which are still treated as phrases in most Commonwealth countries.  For example, Americans write &quot;trademarks,&quot; but some other countries write &quot;trade-marks&quot; or &quot;trade marks.&quot;
* In [[English_compound#Compound_nouns|compound noun]]s of the form &lt;verb&gt;&amp;lt;noun&gt;, sometimes American English favours the [[Infinitive#Bare_infinitive|bare infinitive]] where British English favours the [[gerund]].  Examples include: ''[[jump rope|jump&amp;nbsp;rope]]'' / ''skipping&amp;nbsp;rope''; ''racecar'' / ''racing&amp;nbsp;car''; ''rowboat'' / ''rowing&amp;nbsp;boat''; ''sailboat'' / ''sailing&amp;nbsp;boat''.  In each of these pairs, the former term is more common in America than the UK and the latter more common in the UK than America (although it is not necessarily the case that the former is more common than the latter within America or the latter more common than the former within the UK).
* Singular attributives in one country may be plural in the other, and ''vice versa''. For example, the UK has a ''drugs problem'' while the United States has a ''drug problem'' (although the singular usage is also commonly heard in the UK); Americans read the &quot;[[Sports]]&quot; section of a newspaper, while the British read the &quot;Sport&quot; section.

==Lexis==
Most of the differences are in connection with concepts originating from the [[nineteenth century]] to the mid [[twentieth century]], where new words were coined independently; almost the entire vocabularies of the [[automobile|car/automobile]] and [[railway|railway/railroad]] industries (see [[Rail terminology]]) are different between the UK and America, for example.  Other sources of difference are slang or vulgar terms, where frequent new coinage occurs, and idiomatic phrases, including phrasal verbs. The differences most likely to create confusion are those where the same word or phrase is used for two different concepts. Regional variations even within the U.S. or the UK can create the same problems.

Generally, American words can be freely interchanged with their British versions within the [[United Kingdom]] and English-speaking Commonwealth nations, without leading to confusion, though this may cause irritation. The reverse situation causes worse problems. However, there are some exceptions, such as  ''gas'' (as in ''gasoline''), and ''stroller'' (in the sense of ''pushchair'') which would be misunderstood by speakers of British English, as well as common trademark names unknown in the other country, such as ''Dumpster'' (U.S.) or ''Sellotape'' (UK). There are, however, many pitfalls that Americans can fall into without realising it; for example, referring to a woman's ''fanny'' in the UK, since the word indicates the buttocks in the U.S. but the vagina in the UK. Speakers of Commonwealth English should be cautious when asking for a ''[[fag]]'' (cigarette) in America, as it is a derogatory term referring to a homosexual in the U.S., although nowadays these alternate meanings are understood in the UK as their U.S. version, dependent on context. Residents of [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]] beaches should be wary of inviting their British guests to &quot;go out [[Carolina shag|shagging]],&quot; (a type of dance), for the term in British English refers to sexual intercourse. This meaning has become commonly known in the U.S., however, owing to its repeated usage in the popular [[Austin Powers]] films, so many or most Americans are not likely to approach with such an offer unless that is what is in mind. Similarly, avoid telling Australians or New Zealanders what team you ''root'' for, as the slang meaning of &quot;root&quot; in these countries is sexual intercourse.

===General trends===
While the use of American expressions in British English is often noted in the UK, movement in the opposite direction is less common. But recent examples exist, including the idiom &quot;to go missing,&quot; which had been a distinctively British expression but is used increasingly in American English, at least in journalism. The noun &quot;queue&quot; also seems to be making inroads in the U.S. as well. (The usual American equivalents of &quot;to go missing&quot; and &quot;queue&quot; are &quot;to disappear&quot; and &quot;line&quot;, respectively.) Also, the spelling of 'travelling' and 'traveller' and 'judgement' through observations appear to be creeping into American English.

===Words mainly used in British English===
:''See also: [[List of words mainly used in British English]]''

Speakers of American English are likely to be aware of some British English terms, such as ''lorry'', ''biscuit'', ''chap'', and ''shag'' although they would not generally use them, or may be confused as to whether one means the American or British meaning of some (such as ''biscuit''). They will be able to guess approximately what is meant by some others, such as ''driving licence''. However, use of many other British words, such as ''naff'' (unstylish) or ''busk'' (to play a musical instrument in public with the hope of getting donations from passers-by), risks rendering a sentence incomprehensible to most Americans.

===Words mainly used in American English===
: ''See also: [[List of words mainly used in American English]]''

Speakers of British English are likely to be aware of some American English terms, such as ''sidewalk'', ''gas'', ''cookie'', ''elevator'' although they would not generally use them. They will be able to guess approximately what is meant by some others, such as ''cotton candy''. However, use of some other American words risks rendering a sentence incomprehensible to most British people.

Note that, largely through the influence of [[Hollywood]], the chance of a given Americanism being understood by a British person is significantly greater than in the reverse case.  However, Americans who watch [[britcom|britcoms]] and other imported BBC programs and British news re-broadcasts on American public television ([[PBS]]) are more likely to be familiar with British usages than those who do not.

* ''Fitted'' is used in both conventions as an adjective (&quot;fitted sheets&quot; are the same size as the mattress) and as the past tense of ''fit'' (&quot;to suffer epilepsy&quot;, for example, &quot;Leavitt fitted&quot; in ''[[The Andromeda Strain]]''); however ''fit'' and ''fitting'' do not denote [[epileptic seizure]] in ordinary British use (though that usage is common within medical circles), as the same effect is achieved by ''to have a fit'' or ''to throw a fit''.

===Words with differing meanings===
: ''See: [[List of words having different meanings in British and American English]]''

===Words which have become archaic in one dialect===
* In Southern Britain the word ''whilst'' is used almost interchangeably with ''while'' and ''whilst'' is the more common term. ''Whilst'' is more often used in instruction manuals, legal documents, etc.  To Americans the word ''whilst'', in any context, seems very archaic or pretentious or both.  The words ''amidst'' (as opposed to ''amid''), and to a lesser extent ''amongst'' (as opposed to ''among'') are also rarer in American English. (&quot;In the midst&quot; is a standard idiom in both).

* In the UK generally the term &quot;fall&quot; used in the context of the seasons became obsolete and was replaced by the word &quot;Autumn&quot;. Although archaic, found often in [[Elizabethan]] and [[Charles Dickens|Dickensian]] literature, understanding of the word is usually ascribed to its continued use in America.

*In the UK the term &quot;period&quot; for a &quot;full stop&quot; is now obsolete, even when used as a phrase, such as &quot;Don't do that. Period.&quot; This in itself, though, is likely to be an American import. The phrase &quot;Don't do that. Full stop.&quot; is often preferred to &quot;period&quot;, as shown by the [[NSPCC]] Full Stop campaign.

===Numbers===
:''See also: [[Names of numbers in English]]''

When saying or writing out numbers, the British will insert an &quot;and&quot; before the tens and units, as in &quot;one hundred and sixty-two&quot; and &quot;two thousand and three&quot;, whereas Americans will typically drop the &quot;and&quot; as in &quot;two thousand three&quot;; however, &quot;two thousand and three&quot; is also common. The same rule applies when saying numbers in their thousands or millions: &quot;four hundred and thirteen thousand&quot; would be said by a British speaker, whereas the simpler &quot;four hundred thirteen thousand&quot; by an American speaker.

Some American schools teach that &quot;and&quot; indicates the [[decimal point]]: thus, numbers preceding &quot;and&quot; are [[integers]], while the numbers following &quot;and&quot; are [[fraction|fractional]] (e.g. five hundred thirteen and seven tenths for 513.7). Americans are more likely than the British to read numbers like 1,234 as &quot;twelve thirty-four&quot;, instead of &quot;one thousand, two hundred and thirty-four&quot; unless discussing the year 1234, when &quot;twelve thirty-four&quot; would be the norm on both sides of the Atlantic (note that British speakers do not say &quot;and&quot; before the tens or units when talking about a year, except for years &quot;two thousand and ...&quot;). The year 2000 and beyond are read as &quot;two thousand&quot; rather than &quot;twenty hundred&quot; by both British and American speakers, but years beyond 2100 may be read as &quot;twenty-one hundred&quot; or &quot;two thousand one hundred&quot;. 

Similarly, for the house number (or bus number, etc) &quot;272&quot; British people would tend to say &quot;two seven two&quot; while Americans would tend to say &quot;two seventy-two&quot;. Between 1100 and 1900 the British commonly read numbers ending in round hundreds as, for instance, &quot;sixteen hundred&quot; instead of &quot;one thousand six hundred&quot;, but from 2000 upwards usage like &quot;thirty-two hundred&quot; would be replaced by &quot;three thousand two hundred&quot;.

There was also a historical difference between [[billion]]s, [[trillion]]s, and so forth. Americans use &quot;billion&quot; to mean one thousand million (1,000,000,000), whereas in the UK, until the latter part of the 20th century, it was almost exclusively used to mean one million million (1,000,000,000,000), with one thousand million sometimes described as a &quot;[[milliard]]&quot;, the definition adopted by most other European languages. However, the &quot;American English&quot; version has since been adopted for all published writing, and the word &quot;milliard&quot; is obsolete in English, as are billiard (but not [[billiards]]), trilliard and so on.

Nevertheless, the majority of people have no direct experience with manipulating numbers this large, so a significant proportion of international readers will interpret &quot;billion&quot; as 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;, even if they are young enough to have been taught otherwise at school. For this reason, defining the word may be advisable when writing for the general public. However, all major British publications and broadcasters, including the [[BBC]], which long used &quot;thousand million&quot; to avoid ambiguity, now use &quot;billion&quot; to mean thousand million.

See [[long and short scales]] for a more detailed discussion of the evolution of these terms in English and other languages.

Finally, when referring to the numeral [[0 (number)|0]], British people would use &quot;zero&quot;, &quot;nought&quot;, or &quot;oh&quot; normally, or &quot;nil&quot; in instances such as sports scores and voting results. Americans use the term &quot;zero&quot; most frequently; &quot;oh&quot; is also often used, and occasionally slang terms such as &quot;zilch&quot; or &quot;zip&quot;. Phrases such as &quot;the team won two-zip&quot; or &quot;the team leads the series, two-nothing&quot; are heard when reporting sports scores. The digit 0, for example, when reading a phone or account number aloud, is nearly always pronounced &quot;oh&quot; in both languages for the sake of convenience.

When reading numbers in a sequence, such as a telephone or serial number, British people will use the terms ''double'' or ''triple/treble''. Hence 007 is &quot;double oh seven&quot;.  Exceptions are the emergency telephone number [[9-9-9|999]], which is always &quot;nine nine nine&quot; and the apocalyptic &quot;[[Number of the Beast]]&quot; which is always &quot;six six six&quot;. The [[directory enquiries]] prefix 118 is also &quot;one one eight&quot; due to its extensive advertising campaign with the slogan read out as &quot;One one eight, what's your number?&quot;. In the US, [[9-1-1|911]] (the US emergency telephone number) is almost always read &quot;nine-one-one&quot;, while 9-11 ([[September 11, 2001 attacks|September&amp;nbsp;11, 2001]]) is usually read &quot;nine-eleven&quot;.

===Levels of buildings===
There are also variations in [[floor numbering]] between the U.S. and U.K. &amp;mdash; in most countries, including the UK, the &quot;first floor&quot; is one above the entrance level while the entrance level is the &quot;ground floor&quot;; whereas normal American usage labels the entrance level as the &quot;first floor&quot; and does not use &quot;ground floor.&quot;  Some American buildings have a &quot;ground floor&quot; or another name for the entrance level, usually as part of a plan to cater to [[cosmopolitan]] persons.  (This may also be the case in buildings built on hillsides or uneven ground, where the basement on one side of the structure may be at street level on the other.) Nonetheless, the rest of the floors are numbered in the usual American manner.

===Figures of speech===
Both British English and American English use the expression &quot;I couldn't care less&quot; to mean the speaker does not care at all. In American English, the phrase &quot;I could care less&quot; (without the &quot;n't&quot;) is synonymous with this in casual usage. [[Intonation]] no longer reflects the originally [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] nature of this variant, which is not [[idiom]]atic in British English and might be interpreted as anything from nonsense to an indication that the speaker ''does'' care.

In both areas, saying &quot;I don't mind&quot; often means &quot;I'm not annoyed&quot; (for example, by someone's smoking), while &quot;I don't care&quot; often means &quot;the matter is trivial or boring&quot;.  However, in answering a question like &quot;Tea or coffee?&quot;, if either alternative is equally acceptable, an American may answer &quot;I don't care&quot;, while a British person may answer &quot;I don't mind&quot;.  Either sounds odd to the other.

===Business===
In his history of the Second World War, [[Winston Churchill]] records that differences in the interpretation of the verb &quot;to table&quot; caused an argument between British and American planners. The British wanted a matter ''tabled'' immediately because it was important, and the Americans insisted it should not be tabled at all because it was important. In British English, the term means &quot;to discuss now&quot; (the issue is ''brought to'' the table), whereas in American English it means &quot;to defer&quot; (the issue is ''left on'' the table).

In a similar vein, the verb &quot;to slate&quot; means &quot;to schedule&quot; in the U.S. but (informally) &quot;to disparage&quot; in the UK. Thus a headline such as &quot;Third Harry Potter Film Slated&quot; has two very different interpretations.

One usage of the word &quot;bomb&quot; causes similar confusion: in the U.S. &quot;the show bombed&quot; means it was a total failure; in the UK &quot;the show went down a bomb&quot; means it was a great success.  The American slang phrase &quot;the bomb,&quot; however (perhaps inspired by [[African American Vernacular English]]), almost always indicates positivity.  For example, the phrase, &quot;That show was the bomb,&quot; would mean that the show was outstanding.  In this usage, the article &quot;the&quot; will sometimes be pronounced &quot;da&quot;, and sometimes would be written &quot;That show was da bomb&quot;, indicating a dialect pronunciation of the word &quot;the&quot;.

===Education===
In the UK, a student is said to &quot;read&quot; or to &quot;study&quot; a subject, while in the U.S., a student either &quot;studies&quot; the subject or &quot;majors&quot; in it.  Unlike most of the world where university students pursue a single field of study, United States universities often require a variety of courses.  &quot;To major&quot; refers only to the student's principal course of study, while &quot;to study&quot; may be refer to any class being taken.

British English:

:&quot;She read history at Oxford&quot;.

American English:

:&quot;She majored in history at Yale.&quot;

In the UK, a student &quot;revises&quot; or &quot;does revision&quot; for an examination, while in American English, the student &quot;studies&quot; for it. When &quot;taking&quot; or &quot;writing&quot; the examination, a student in the UK would have that examination supervised by an &quot;invigilator&quot; whereas in American English it would be a &quot;proctor&quot; (or merely &quot;(exam) supervisor&quot;).

In the UK, a student is said to &quot;sit&quot; or &quot;take&quot; an exam, while in the U.S., a student &quot;takes&quot; an exam.  In the UK, a teacher &quot;sets&quot; an exam, while in the U.S., a teacher &quot;writes&quot; or &quot;gives&quot; an exam.  The expression &quot;he sits for&quot; an exam also arises in British English, but only rarely in American English; American lawyers-to-be &quot;sit for&quot; their bar exams, and American master's and doctoral students may &quot;sit for&quot; their comprehensive exams, but in nearly all other instances, Americans &quot;take&quot; their exams.

British English:

:&quot;I sat my Spanish exam yesterday.&quot;
:&quot;I plan to set a difficult exam for my students, but I haven't got it ready yet.&quot;

American English:

:&quot;I took my exams at Yale.&quot;
:&quot;I spent the entire day yesterday writing the exam.  At last, it's ready for my students.&quot;

Another source of confusion is the different usage of the word ''college''.  In the U.S., this refers to a post-high school institution such as a university, whilst in the UK and most Commonwealth countries it refers primarily to a tertiary institution between high school and university (normally referred to as a &quot;Sixth Form College&quot; after the old name in secondary education for Years 12 and 13, the &quot;6th form&quot;) where intermediary courses such as [[A Level]]s or [[NVQ]]s can be taken and [[GCSE]] courses can be retaken, with the interchangeability of college with high school being rare but not unknown.  Americans may be surprised to hear of a 14 year old attending college in the UK, mistakenly assuming it is at the university level. It should be noted however, that in the case of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] universities, all members are also members of a college. eg one is a member of [[St. Peter's College, Oxford]] and hence the University. 

In both the U.S. and UK, ''college'' can refer to some division within a university such as a &quot;college of mathematics and science&quot;. Institutions in the U.S. that offer two to four years of post-high school education often have the word ''college'' as part of their name, while those offering more advanced degrees are called a ''university''.  American students who pursue a ''bachelor's degree'' (four years of higher education) or an ''associate's degree'' (two years of higher education) are &quot;college students&quot; regardless of whether they attend a college or a university and refer to their educational institutions informally as ''colleges.''  However, a student who pursues a master's degree or a doctorate degree in the arts and sciences is a &quot;graduate student.&quot;  Students of advanced professional programmes are known by their field (business student, law student, journalism student).  

Among high school and college students in the United States, the words ''freshman'' (or the gender neutral term ''frosh''), ''sophomore'', ''junior'' and ''senior'' refer to the first, second, third, and fourth year respectively. It is important that the context of either high school or college first be established, or else it must be stated directly (that is, &quot;She is a high school freshman.&quot;  &quot;He is a college junior.&quot;).  Many institutions in both countries also use the term &quot;first-year&quot; as a gender-neutral replacement for &quot;freshman&quot;.  In the UK, first year university students are often called ''freshers''; however, there are no specific names for those in other years, nor for school pupils.  Graduate and professional students in the United States are known by their year of study (a &quot;second year medical student&quot; or a &quot;fifth year doctoral candidate&quot;).

In the UK, the US equivalent of a ''high school'' is often referred to as a ''secondary school'' regardless of whether it is public or private.  Secondary education in the United States also includes ''middle school'' or ''junior high school'', a two or three year transitional school between elementary school and high school.  A ''public school'' has opposite meanings in the two countries.  In the US this is a government owned institution supported by taxpayers.  In the UK it is an independent institution funded by tuition.  The United States uses several additional terms for specific types of secondary schools.  A ''prep school'' or ''preparatory school'' is an independent school funded by tuition.  A ''parochial school'' covers costs through tuition and has affiliation with a religious institution.  A ''magnet school'' receives government funding and has special admission requirements.  Students gain admission through superior performance on admission tests.

===Transport===
Americans refer to ''transportation,'' while British people refer to ''transport.''  

Differences in terminology are especially obvious in the context of [[road]]s.  The British term ''dual carriageway'', in American parlance, would be a ''divided highway''.  ''Central reservation'' on a ''motorway'' in the UK would be a ''median'' on a ''freeway'' or ''expressway'' in the U.S.  The one-way lanes that make it possible to enter and leave such roads at an intermediate point without disrupting the flow of traffic are generally known as ''slip roads'' in the UK, but U.S. civil engineers call them ''ramps,'' and further distinguish between ''on-ramps'' (for entering) or ''off-ramps'' (for leaving).  When American engineers speak of ''slip roads,'' or ''slip ramps,'' they are referring to on-ramps and off-ramps that have been rearranged (through use of a [[grade separation]]) to minimize weaving on a freeway segment between two interchanges that are too close together.  

In the UK, the term ''outside lane'' refers to the higher-speed passing lane closest to the centre of the road, while ''inside lane'' refers to the lane closer to the edge of the road; these terms have the opposite meanings in American English, with the ''outside lane'' being the one near the edge and the ''inside lane'' being the one closer to the median &amp;mdash; it is worth noting that Americans also drive on the opposite side to British people, so that the British inside lane is, like the American one, the leftmost one (going in any given direction).

In the UK, Australia, and New Zealand ''drink driving'' is against the law, while in the U.S. and Canada, the term is ''drunk driving''.

===Greetings===
In the US, when Christmas is explicitly mentioned in a greeting, the universal phrasing is ''[[Merry Christmas]]''.  A British alternative, ''Happy Christmas'', is unusual in America; while its meaning is obvious, it might still garner the speaker some odd looks.  However, Americans quite often say &quot;Happy Holidays&quot; in referring to the Christmas season.



==Writing==
===Spelling===
:''Main article: [[American and British English spelling differences]]''

Some words shared by all English speakers are ''spelled'' one way by Americans (and at times Canadians and Australians) but are ''spelt'' differently in some (or, at times, most) other English speaking countries.

* Traditionally, many English verbs have been spelled with both ''-ize'' and ''-ise''. The ''-ise'' is often used over ''-ize'' (e.g. organise, legalise) in British English, but ''-ize'' is always used in American English (''advertise'' being a rare exception). The American usage is the result of several reforms spearheaded by [[Noah Webster]] in the [[19th century]], while the British usage (where ''-ize'' was traditionally dominant) comes from 19th-century French influence. Perhaps because of this, ''-ize'' is preferred by Oxford University Press, is listed first in most British Dictionaries, and is preferred by many careful users of English in the UK; see [http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutspelling/ize?view=uk Oxford's rationale] on the matter for more information. The same is true of nouns and adjectives derived from such verbs: ''organisation'' vs. ''organization'', etc. One notable exception is the verb ''to analyse'', which although spelled ''to analyze'' in American English was never spelled that way in British English. Furthermore, not all such words are spelled with ''-ize'' even in American English: for example, ''incise,'' ''circumcise.'' These are not examples of the suffix -ize, but the element -cise, meaning &quot;to cut.&quot;

===Punctuation===
* '''Full stops/Periods in abbreviations''': Americans tend to write &quot;Mr.&quot;, &quot;Mrs.&quot;, &quot;St.&quot;, &quot;Dr.&quot; etc., while British will usually, but not always, write &quot;Mr&amp;quot;, &quot;Mrs&quot;, &quot;St&quot;, &quot;Dr&quot; (or even &quot;D'r&quot;), etc., following the rule that a full stop is used only when the last letter of the abbreviation is not the last letter of the complete word. However, many British writers would tend to write other abbreviations without a full stop, such as &quot;Prof&quot;, &quot;etc&quot;, &quot;eg&quot;, and so on (so recommended by some Oxford dictionaries). The rationale behind this usage is that it is typographically more elegant, and that the omitted full stops/periods are essentially superfluous, as the reader recognizes the abbreviation without them. It also removes ambiguity by reserving the period for ending sentences. However, the &quot;American&quot; usage of periods after most abbreviations is also widely used in the UK. Note that in either case it is incorrect to put a period after units such as kg for kilogram or Hz for hertz, as these are considered unit symbols, not abbreviations; however, the unit for &quot;inch&quot; is properly &quot;in.&quot;, as it would be ambiguous without the period.
* It is sometimes believed that British English does not hyphenate multiple-word adjectives, such as &quot;a first class ticket&quot;. This usage is rare, and often considered incorrect. The most common form is as in American English, such as &quot;a first-class ticket&quot;.
* '''[[Quotation mark|Quoting]]''': Americans start with double quotation marks (&quot;) and use single quotation marks (') for quotations within quotations.  In general this is also true of British English but can be the opposite when used in book publishing, for example. In journals and newspapers, quotation mark double/single use depends on the individual publication's [[house style]].
* '''Contents of quotations''': Americans are taught to put commas and periods inside quotation marks, whereas British people will put the punctuation inside if it belongs to the quote and outside otherwise. This means that direct speech retains punctuation inside inverted commas in British English also, with a full stop changing into a comma if followed by explanatory text.
** Carefree means &quot;free from care or anxiety.&quot; (American style)
** Carefree means &quot;free from care or anxiety&quot;. (British style)
** &quot;Hello world,&quot; I said. (both styles)
: The American style was established for typographical reasons, having to do with the aesthetics of commas and quotation marks in typeset text. It also usefully eliminates the need to decide whether a period or comma belongs to the quotation. However, many people find the usage counterintuitive. ''[[Hart's Rules]]'' and the ''[[Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors]]'' call the British style &quot;new&quot; or &quot;logical&quot; quoting; it is similar to the use of quotation marks in many other languages (including Spanish, French, Italian, Catalan, Dutch, and German). This &quot;logical&quot; style is increasingly popular in America, although [[Formal written English - regional differences|formal writing]] generally calls for the &quot;American&quot; style. In fact, the British style is often the ''de facto'' standard among Americans for whom formal or professional writing is not a part of their daily life; many are in fact unaware that the normative American usage is to place commas and periods within the quotation marks. (This rule of placing all punctuation inside quotation if and only if it belongs to the quotation is expressly prescribed by some American professional organisations such as the American Chemical Society; see ''ACS Style Guide''.) According to the [[Jargon File]], American [[Hacker|hackers]]  have switched to using &quot;logical&quot; British quotation system, because including extraneous punctuation in a quotation can sometimes change the fundamental meaning of the quotation. More generally, it is difficult for computer manuals, online instructions, and other textual media to accurately quote exactly what a computer user should see or type on their computer.
:The American rule was used worldwide up to around the Second World War, after which the more logical style of presenting quotation marks took hold everywhere except America.
* '''Letter-writing''': American students in some areas have been taught to write a colon after the greeting in business letters (&quot;Dear Sir:&quot;) while British people usually write a comma (&quot;Dear Sir,&quot;) or make use of the so-called ''open punctuation'' (&quot;Dear Sir&quot;).  However, this practice is not consistent throughout the United States, and it would be regarded as a highly formal usage by most Americans.

===Titles and headlines===
Use of [[capitalisation]] varies.

In American English, a capital letter is typically used after an exclamation point, as in: &quot;Good grief, Jim! Leave the man alone.&quot; In British English the expression could be rendered as 'Good grief, Jim! leave the man alone.' although the American capitalisation is typical.

Sometimes, the words in titles of publications, newspaper headlines, as well as chapter and section headings are capitalised in the same manner as in normal sentences ([[sentence case]]).  That is, only the first word is capitalised, along with [[proper noun]]s, [[acronym]]s, etc.

However, publishers sometimes require additional words in titles and headlines to be capitalised, for added [[emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], as it is often perceived as appearing more professional.  In American English, this is common in titles, but less so in newspaper headlines. The exact rules differ between publishers and are often ambiguous; a typical approach is to capitalise all words other than short [[Article (grammar)|article]]s, [[preposition]]s, and [[conjunction]]s.  This should probably be regarded as a common stylistic difference, rather than a linguistic difference, as neither form would be considered incorrect or unusual in either the UK or the U.S.  Many British newspapers use fully capitalised headlines for impact, as opposed to readability (examples include ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'', ''[[The Daily Sport]]'', ''[[News of the World]]'').

===Dates===
Date formats are usually written differently in the short (numerical) form. Christmas Day 2000, for example, is 25/12/00 in the UK and 12/25/00 in the U.S., although occasionally other formats are encountered, such as the [[ISO 8601]] 2000-12-25, popular among programmers and others seeking to avoid ambiguity. The difference in short-form date order can lead to misunderstanding. For example, 06/04/05 could mean either [[4 June]] [[2005]] (U.S.) or [[6 April]] [[2005]] (UK).

A consequence of the different short-form of dates is that in the UK many people would be reluctant to refer to &quot;9/11&quot; although its meaning would be instantly understood.  Apart from normally referring to 9th November, dates are not usually abbreviated in this manner in speech in the UK. Londoners would generally refer to the &quot;the seventh of July bombings&quot; and not 7/7.  On the BBC &quot;September the 11th&quot; is generally used in preference to 9/11.

When writing long-form dates, the format &quot;December&amp;nbsp;25, 2000&quot; is generally encountered in the U.S., and widely encountered in the UK. However, the British are more likely than Americans to use the format &quot;25&amp;nbsp;December 2000&quot; although it is acceptable in the U.S., and the American grammarians [[Strunk and White]], among others, recommend it. American military usage follows the British model: &quot;25&amp;nbsp;December 2005&quot; and &quot;25/12/05.&quot;  It is common in the UK, and somewhat less so in the U.S., to add a superscripted 'st, nd, rd' or 'th' to the day number in informal writing (thus &quot;25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;December 2000&quot; or &quot;December&amp;nbsp;25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000&quot;), but this is generally regarded as superfluous and avoided in formal use.

Similarly, in American speech, &quot;December twenty-fifth&quot; is the most likely form, though &quot;the twenty-fifth of December&quot; is also not uncommon.  In the UK the latter is more likely, and even when the month is presented first the definite article is usually inserted in speech, thus &quot;December ''the'' twenty-fifth&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Atomic Semantics''' is a term which describes the guarantees provided by a [[data register]] shared by several [[central processing unit|processor]]s in a [[parallel machine]] or in a network of computers working together.

Atomic semantics are defined for a variable with a single writer but multiple readers. These
semantics are very strong: they guarantee that the read and write operations to the variable behave exactly as if they happened instantaneously in some point in time which is within the actual time where the operation took place.

==Reference==

Atomic semantics are defined formally in Lamport's &quot;On Interprocess Communication&quot; Distributed Computing 1, 2 (1986), 77-101. (Also appeared as SRC Research Report 8).

      <comment>/* Dynamics of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current */ ncrease -&gt; increase</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Antarctic Circumpolar Current''' (ACC) is an [[ocean current]] that flows from west to east around [[Antarctica]]. An alternate name for the ACC is the West Wind Drift. The ACC is the dominant circulation feature of the [[Southern Ocean]]. The ACC has been known to sailors for many years, the author [[Jack London]]'s story &quot;Make Westing&quot; poignantly illustrated the difficulty it caused for mariners seeking to round [[Cape Horn]] on the clipper ship route between New York and California.

==Structure of the Circumpolar Current==

The ACC connects the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Indian Ocean]] basins and as such serves as a principal pathway of exchange between these basins. The current is strongly constrained by [[topography|topographic]] features. Starting at [[South America]], it flows through the [[Drake Passage]] between South America and the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] and then is split by the [[Scotia Arc]] to the east, with a shallow warm branch flowing to the north in the [[Falklands Current]] and a deeper branch passing through the Arc more to the east before also turning to the north. Passing through the Indian Ocean, the current is split by the [[Kerguelen Plateau]] in the Indian Ocean, with most of the transport passing to the north.  South of [[New Zealand]], it follows the contours of the [[Campbell Plateau]] first deflecting far to the south and then moving northward again. Deflection is also seen as it passes over the [[mid-ocean ridge]] in the Southeast Pacific.

The current consists of a number of fronts. The northern boundary of the ACC is defined by the Subtropical Front. This marks the boundary between warm, salty subtropical waters (generally with a [[salinity]] of greater than 34.9 parts per thousand) and fresher, cooler subpolar waters. Moving southward we find the Subantarctic Front, along which much of the ACC transport is carried. Further south still lies the Polar Front, which is marked by a transition to very cold, relatively fresh, Antarctic Surface Water at the surface. Further south still we find Southern Boundary front, which is determined as the point where very dense abyssal waters upwell to within a few hundred meters of the surface. The bulk of the transport is carried in the middle two fronts. The total transport of the ACC at Drake Passage is estimated to be around 135 [[Sverdrup]], or about 135 times the transport of all the world's rivers combined. There is a relatively small addition of flow in the Indian Ocean, with the transport south of [[Tasmania]] reaching around 147 Sv, at which point the current is probably the largest on the planet.

==Dynamics of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current ==

There is general agreement that the large transport of the Circumpolar Current is linked to the strong westerly winds which are found in the Southern Ocean and to the fact that these winds blow over a band of open latitudes. In latitudes where there are continents, winds blowing on light surface water can simply pile up light water against these continents. But in the Southern Ocean, the momentum imparted to the surface waters cannot be balanced in this way.

Different theories of the Circumpolar Current balance the momentum imparted by the winds in different ways. The increasing eastward momentum imparted by the winds causes water parcels to drift outwards from the axis of the earth's rotation (in other words, northward) as a result of the [[Coriolis force]]. This northward transport is balanced by a southward, pressure-driven flow below the depths of the major ridge systems. Some theories connect these flows, implying that there is significant upwelling of dense deep waters within the Southern Ocean, transformation of these waters into light surface waters, and a transformation of waters in the opposite direction to the north. This theory links the magnitude of the Circumpolar Current with the global [[thermohaline circulation]], particularly the properties of the [[North Atlantic]]. A contrary view, however, suggests that eddies, the oceanic equivalent of atmospheric storms, transport momentum downwards in the water column, so that while the deep waters are set into motion, this motion simply involves southward flow in troughs and northward flow over ridges with no transformation into light surface waters required.

Recently much attention has been paid to the fact that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current may vary with time.  One aspect of this variability is the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Wave]], a periodic oscillation that affects the climate of much of the southern hemisphere. Another is the [[Antarctic Oscillation]], which involves changes in the location and strength of Antarctic winds. Trends in the Antarctic Oscillation have been hypothesized to account for an increase in the transport of the Circumpolar Current over the past two decades.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Arbor Day''' is an [[United States|American]] [[holiday]] that encourages the planting and care of [[tree]]s. In China, it also commemorates the passing of Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]].

==Observance==
Arbor Day occurs in the [[United States]] every year on the last Friday in April. The customary observance is to plant a tree, but it is not a public holiday and is no longer widely observed in [[United States|America]] (except in [[Nebraska]], where it is a public holiday); in other states, it has been displaced by the emphasis on [[Earth Day]].

Similar holidays exist worldwide, some going by the same name, as in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]], and spelt '''Arbour Day'''.

==Quotes==
:''Other holidays repose upon the past; Arbor Day proposes for the future.'' 
:::&amp;mdash; J. Sterling Morton.

:''Each generation takes the Earth as trustees. We ought to bequeath to posterity as many forests and orchards as we have exhausted and consumed.''
:::&amp;mdash; J. Sterling Morton, 1887.

==History==
Arbor Day was established by [[J. Sterling Morton]] of [[Nebraska City, Nebraska]] in [[1872]].

J. Sterling Morton and his wife moved from [[Detroit, Michigan]] to the [[Nebraska Territory]] in [[1854]], where he was the editor of Nebraska's first newspaper. His influence as a journalist led to his involvement in politics, and he became a promoter of the settlement of Nebraska. The lack of trees, however, was an obstacle.

The [[Great Plains]] had been described as the ''&quot;[[Great American Desert]].&quot;'' The [[tallgrass prairie]] that covered much of Nebraska at that time could provide rich farmland, but without wood for building houses or for fuel to heat homes, few found it convenient to settle there. Even the allotment of free land by the [[Homestead Act]] failed to entice sufficient numbers of families to relocate to [[Nebraska]].

[[J. Sterling Morton|Morton]] proposed Arbor Day as a tree planting holiday in 1872 at a meeting of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture. On the first Arbor Day, prizes were offered to counties and to individuals for properly planting the largest number of trees. It was claimed that more than 1 million trees were planted in Nebraska on that day.

During the course of the 1870s, several other states passed legislation to observe Arbor Day. Schools began to adopt the tradition beginning in 1882. By 1894, Arbor Day was celebrated in each state of the [[United States]].

==Memorial parks==
Morton's home in Nebraska City, [[Arbor Lodge]], is a state historical park, which includes an [[arboretum]] and extensive landscaped grounds. Adjacent to the public park, Morton's farm, now called '''Arbor Day Farm''', is run for the benefit of the '''National Arbor Day Foundation'''. 

==Arbor Day in China==
Arbor Day (植樹節) is a [[Holidays in the Republic of China|public holiday]] in the [[Republic of China]] on [[March 12]]. It commemorates the passing of Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]], the [[Father of the Nation]], in [[1925]].

'''Sir Alfred Jules Ayer''' ([[October 29]], [[1910]] &amp;ndash; [[June 27]], [[1989]]), better known as '''A. J. Ayer''' (or Freddie by his friends), was a British philosopher known for his promotion of [[logical positivism]], particularly in his books ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'' (1936) and  ''The Problem of Knowledge'' (1956).

Ayer was the Grote Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic at the [[University College London]] from 1946 until 1959, when he became [[Wykeham Professor]] of Logic at the [[University of Oxford]]. He was knighted in 1970. 

==Life==
Ayer received an education in the humanities at [[Eton College]], and served in the British military during [[World War II]], working in military intelligence for a time.  He was a noted social mixer and womanizer, and was married four times, including to Dee Wells and Vanessa Lawson (nee Salmon).   Reputedly he liked dancing and attending the clubs in [[London]].

He was a friend of [[Isaiah Berlin]].

Ayer was an avowed atheist, and followed in the footsteps of [[Bertrand Russell]] by debating with the Jesuit scholar [[Frederick Copleston]] on the topic of religion.

Ayer was closely associated with the British [[secular humanism|humanist]] movement. He was an Honorary Associate of the [[Rationalist Press Association]] from 1947 until his death.  In 1965, he became the first president of the Agnostics' Adoption Society and in the same year succeeded [[Julian Huxley]] as president of the [[British Humanist Association]], a post he held until 1970. In 1968 he edited &quot;The Humanist Outlook&quot;, a collection of essays on the meaning of humanism. 

He taught or lectured several times in the [[United States]], including serving as a visiting professor at [[Bard College]] in the fall of 1987. At a party that same year held by fashion designer [[Fernando Sanchez]], Ayer, then 77, confronted [[Mike Tyson]] harassing [[Naomi Campbell]]. When Ayer demanded that Tyson stop, the boxer said: &quot;Do you know who the fuck I am? I'm the heavyweight champion of the world,&quot; to which Ayer replied: &quot;And I am the former Wykeham Professor of Logic. We are both pre-eminent in our field. I suggest that we talk about this like rational men&quot; (Rogers 1999:344).

Shortly before his death in 1989 he received publicity after having an unusual [[near-death experience]], which some erroneously interpreted as a move away from his lifelong and famous [[religious skepticism]].

==Works==
In some ways, Ayer was the philosophical successor to [[Bertrand Russell]], and he wrote two books on the philosopher: ''Russell and Moore: The Analytic Heritage'' (1971) and ''Russell'' (1972).  He also wrote an introductory book on the philosophy of [[David Hume]].

Ayer is perhaps best known for his [[verification principle]], as presented in &quot;[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]&quot; (1936), according to which a sentence is meaningful only if it has verifiable empirical import.  He started work on the book at the age of 24 and it was published when he was 26.   Ayer's philosophical ideas were deeply influenced by those of the [[Vienna Circle]].  His clear, vibrant and polemical exposition of them makes [[Language, Truth and Logic]] essential reading on the tenets of [[logical positivism]] -- the book is regarded as a classic of 20th century philosophy, and is widely read in philosophy courses around the world.  

In 1972-73 Ayer gave the [[Gifford Lectures]] at [[St. Andrews University]], later published as ''The Central Questions of Philosophy''.  He still believed in the viewpoint he shared with the logical positivists: that large parts of what was traditionally called &quot;philosophy&quot; - including the whole of [[metaphysics]], [[theology]] and [[aesthetics]] - were not matters that could be judged as being true or false and that it was thus meaningless to discuss them.  Unsurprisingly, this made him unpopular with several other philosophy departments in this country and his name is still reviled by many British professors to this day.

In &quot;The Concept of a Person and Other Essays&quot; (1963), Ayer made several striking criticisms of [[Wittgenstein]]'s private language theory.

Ayer's sense-data theory in ''Foundations of Empirical Knowledge'' was famously criticised by fellow Oxonian [[J. L. Austin]] in ''[[Sense and sensibilia]]'', a landmark 1950's work of common language philosophy.  Ayer responded to this in the essay &quot;Has Austin refuted the sense-date theory?&quot;, which can be found in his ''Metaphysics and Common Sense'' (1969).

        <username>Avraham< [[J. A. Heese]] indicates that until [[1807]], 36.8% of the ancestors of the White Afrikaans speaking population were Dutch, 35% were German, 14.6% were French and 7.2% non-white (of African and/or Asian origins). Heese's figures are questioned by other researchers, however, and especially the non-white component quoted by Heese is very much in doubt.

The linguist Paul Roberge suggests that the earliest 'truly &quot;Afrikaans&quot;' texts are doggerel verse from 1795 and a dialogue transcribed by a Dutch traveller in 1825. Printed material among the Afrikaners at first used only proper European Dutch. By the mid-19th century, more and more was appearing in Afrikaans, which was very much still regarded as a set of spoken regional dialects. The first Afrikaans grammars and dictionaries were published in [[1875]] by the ''[[Genootskap vir Regte Afrikaners]]'' (Society for Real Afrikaners) in [[Cape Town]]. The [[Boer Wars]] further strengthened the position of the new Dutch-like language. The [[official language]]s of the Union of South Africa were English and Dutch until 1925 when Afrikaans replaced Dutch.

Besides vocabulary, the most striking difference from Dutch is its much more regular grammar, which is likely the result of extensive contact with one or more [[Creole language|creole languages]] based on the Dutch language spoken by the relatively large number of non-Dutch speakers ([[Khoikhoi language|Khoikhoi]], German, French, [[Cape Malays|Cape Malay]], and speakers of different African languages) during the formation period of the language in the second half of the 17th century. In 1710, slaves outnumbered free settlers, and the language was developing among speakers who had little occasion to write or analyse their new dialect.

There are many different theories about how Afrikaans came to be. The Afrikaans School has long seen Afrikaans as a natural development from the South-Hollandic Dutch dialect, but has also only considered the Afrikaans as spoken by the Whites. The Afrikaans School has also rejected all alternative ideas.

Most linguistics scholars today are certain that Afrikaans has been influenced by [[Creole language|creole languages]] based on the South-Holland Dutch dialect. It is very hard to find out how this influence took place, since there is almost no material written in the Dutch-based creole languages: only a few sentences found in unrelated books often written by non-speakers.

Although much of the vocabulary of Afrikaans reflects its origins in 17th century South-Hollandic Dutch, it also contains words borrowed from Asian [[Malay language|Malay]] (the oldest known written Afrikaans uses Arabic script and was intended for use among Cape Town's Muslims), [[Malagasy language|Malagasy Malay]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[French language|French]], [[Khoisan languages|Khoi and San dialects]], [[English language|English]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and many other languages. Consequently, many words in Afrikaans are very different from Dutch, as demonstrated by the names of different fruits: 
{| cellspacing=&quot;7px&quot;

| '''AFRIKAANS''' || '''DUTCH''' || '''ENGLISH'''
|-
| piesang* || banaan || banana
|-
| lemoen || sinaasappel || orange
|-
| suurlemoen** || citroen || lemon
|}

&lt;br /&gt;* from Malay ''pisang'' (a word that is known to the Dutch through their [[Dutch East Indies]] history)
&lt;br /&gt;** suur = sour (which is essentially the same as the Dutch word 'zuur').&lt;br&gt;
(''Pisang'' is also a lesser used Dutch word for ''banana'')

== Grammar ==

''See separate article on [[Afrikaans grammar]]''.

==Orthography==
Written Afrikaans differs from Dutch in that the spelling reflects a phonetically simplified language, and so many consonants are dropped (see also the grammar section  for a description of how consonant dropping affects the morphology of Afrikaans adjectives and nouns). The spelling is also considerably more phonetical than the Dutch counterpart. A notable feature is the indefinite article, which, as noted in the grammar section, is &quot;'n&quot;, not &quot;een&quot; as in Dutch. &quot;A book&quot; is &quot;'n Boek&quot;, whereas in Dutch it would be &quot;Een boek&quot;. (Note that &quot;'n&quot; is still allowed in Dutch; Afrikaans uses only &quot;'n&quot; where Dutch uses it next to &quot;een&quot;. When letters are dropped an apostrophe is mandatory.)  Other features include the use of 's' instead of 'z', hence South Africa in Afrikaans is written as ''Suid-Afrika'', whereas in Dutch it is ''Zuid-Afrika''. (This accounts for [[.za]] being used as South Africa's [[List of Internet TLDs|internet top level domain]].) The Dutch letter 'IJ' is written as 'Y', except where it replaces the Dutch [[suffix]] ''-lijk'', as in ''waarschijnlijk = waarskynlik''. Interesting to note that the use of the hard &quot;k&quot; is analogous to the pronunciation in parts of Flanders, which was once part of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], and from whence many an [[Afrikaner]] came. Also surprising for many Dutch is the double negative, which could possibly be attributed to the French origins of many Afrikaners: ''Nie rook nie'' - No smoking; compare to the French &quot;Ne pas fumer&quot;.

== Sociolinguistics ==
Afrikaans is the first language of approximately 60% of South Africa's [[Whites]], and over 90% of the &quot;[[Coloured]]&quot; (mixed-race) population. Large numbers of blacks, [[Asians in South Africa|Indians]], and English-speaking whites also speak it as a second language. 

It is also widely spoken in [[Namibia]], where it has had constitutional recognition as a national, not official, language since independence in [[1990]]. Prior to independence, Afrikaans, along with German, had equal status as an official language. There is a much smaller number of Afrikaans speakers among [[Zimbabwe]]'s white minority, but most left the country in [[1980]]. 

Many South Africans living and working in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] are also Afrikaans speakers. 

Afrikaans has been influential in the development of [[South African English]]. Many Afrikaans loanwords have found their way into South African English, such as  &quot;veld&quot;, &quot;[[braai]]&quot;, &quot;boomslang&quot;, and &quot;lekker&quot;. A few words in standard English are derived from Afrikaans, such as &quot;[[trek]]&quot;, &quot;spoor&quot;, and, of course, [[apartheid]]. 

In [[1976]], high school students in [[Soweto]] began the rebellion that contributed to the end of [[apartheid]] and the whites-only government of [[South Africa]].  This has been credited to that government's decision that Afrikaans rather than English be used as the language of instruction in non-White schools. However, many historians argue that the language issue was a catalyst for the rebellion rather than the major underlying cause (which was racial oppression). Afrikaans is more widely spoken than English (and is, in fact, spoken by a majority of residents in two of South Africa's nine provinces), so most children may not have objected to the use of Afrikaans per se. Rather, it was the further directive, within the instructional language directive, that non-White (i.e., Black, Coloured and Indian) South African children be denied instruction in all but the most basic topics of mathematics, sciences, fine arts, etc., on the theory they would never need to know those subjects because they would never have the occasion to use such an education. ''See [[History of South Africa]].''

Under South Africa's multiracial [[Constitution]] of [[1994]], Afrikaans remains an official language, but there are now nine other official languages, in addition to English, with which it has equal status. The new dispensation means that Afrikaans is often downgraded in favour of English, or to accommodate the other official languages.  In [[1996]], for example, the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] reduced the amount of [[television]] airtime in Afrikaans, while  [[South African Airways]] dropped its Afrikaans name ''Suid-Afrikaanse Lugdiens'' from its livery. Similarly, South Africa's [[diplomatic mission]]s overseas now only display the name of the country in English and their host country's language, but not in Afrikaans.  

Although these moves have angered many Afrikaans speakers, the language has remained strong, with Afrikaans newspapers and magazines continuing to have large circulation figures. Indeed the [[Huisgenoot]], an Afrikaans language general interest family magazine, is the magazine with the largest readership in the country. In addition, a pay-TV channel in Afrikaans called [[KykNet]] was launched in [[1999]] and an Afrikaans music channel, [[MK89]], in [[2005]]. A large number of Afrikaans books also continue to be published every year.

Although Afrikaans has diverged from Dutch over the past three centuries, it still shares 85 per cent of its vocabulary with that language, and Afrikaans speakers are able to learn Dutch within a comparatively short period of time. Native Dutch speakers pick up Afrikaans even more quickly, due to its simplified grammar. This has enabled Dutch companies to outsource their [[call centre]] operations to South Africa, thereby taking advantage of lower labour costs.

Outside of South Africa, the Afrikaans language is sometimes regarded with contempt. However, when the British design magazine [[Wallpaper*]] described Afrikaans as 'the ugliest language in the world', South African [[billionaire]] [[Johann Rupert]], responded by withdrawing advertising for brands such as  [[Cartier SA|Cartier]], [[Van Cleef &amp; Arpels]], [[Montblanc (pens)|Montblanc]] and [[Alfred Dunhill, Ltd.|Alfred Dunhill]] from the magazine [http://business.iafrica.com/news/657706.htm]. The author of the article, Bronwyn Davies, was in fact a South African.

== Afrikaans phrases ==
{{IPA notice}}

Afrikaans is a very centralised language, meaning that most of the vowels are pronounced in a very centralised (i.e. very schwa-like) way. There are a lot of different dialects and different pronunciations — but the transcription should be fairly standard.

* '''Hallo! Hoe gaan dit?'''  {{IPA|[&amp;#614;al&amp;#601;u &amp;#614;u xa&amp;#721;n d&amp;#601;t]}} Hello! How are you? 
* '''Baie goed, dankie.'''  {{IPA|[baj&amp;#601; xu&amp;#721;t danki]}} Very good, thanks.
* '''Praat jy Afrikaans?''' {{IPA|[pr&amp;#593;&amp;#721;t j&amp;#601;i afrik&amp;#593;&amp;#721;ns]}} Do you speak Afrikaans?
* '''Praat jy Engels?''' {{IPA|[pr&amp;#593;&amp;#721;t j&amp;#601;i &amp;#603;&amp;#331;&amp;#601;ls]}} Do you speak English?
* '''Ja.''' {{IPA|[j&amp;#593;&amp;#721;]}} Yes.
* '''Nee.''' {{IPA|[ne&amp;#721;&amp;#601;]}} No.
* ''''n Bietjie.''' {{IPA|[&amp;#601; biki]}} A little.
* '''Wat is jou naam?''' {{IPA|[vat &amp;#601;s j&amp;#601;u n&amp;#593;&amp;#721;m]}} What is your name?
* '''Die kinders praat Afrikaans''' {{IPA|[di k&amp;#601;n&amp;#601;rs pr&amp;#593;&amp;#721;t afrik&amp;#593;&amp;#721;ns]}} The children speak Afrikaans.

Two interesting sentences having the same meaning and written (but not pronounced) identically in Afrikaans and English are:
*'''My pen was in my hand''' ({{IPA|[m&amp;#601;i p&amp;#603;n vas &amp;#601;n m&amp;#601;i h&amp;#593;nt]}})
*'''My hand is in warm water.''' ({{IPA|[m&amp;#601;i h&amp;#593;nt &amp;#601;s &amp;#601;n var&amp;#601;m v&amp;#593;&amp;#721;t&amp;#601;r]}})

== Additional information ==

* Afrikaans has a monument erected in its honour.  The [[Afrikaans Language Monument]] (''Afrikaanse Taalmonument'') is located near the Western Cape Province town of [[Paarl]].
* The letters ''c, q'' and ''x'' are rarely seen in Afrikaans, and words containing them are almost exclusively borrowings from English, Greek or Latin. This is usually because words with ''c'' or ''ch'' in Dutch are [[transliteration|transliterated]] as ''k'' or ''g'' in Afrikaans. Similarly ''q'' and ''x'' are usually transliterated as ''kw'' and ''ks'', for example &quot;equatorial&quot; becomes ''ekwatoriaal'' and &quot;excuse&quot; becomes ''ekskuus''.
* Special letters used are ''è, é, ê, ë, î, ï, ô, û''. Sometimes ''ŉ'' is considered a single character.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aiolos''' ({{polytonic|&amp;Alpha;&amp;#7988;&amp;omicron;&amp;lambda;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf;}}), [[Latin]]ized as '''Aeolus''', '''Eolus''', '''Aeolos''', or '''Aiolus''', was the name of three personages in [[Greek Mythology]].  These three personages are often difficult to tell apart, and even the ancient mythographers appear to have been perplexed about which Aeolus was which.  Diodorus made an attempt to define each of these three (although it is clear he also became muddled), and his opinion is followed here.  Briefly, the first Aeolus was a son of [[Hellen]] and founder of the Aeolian race; the second was a son of [[Poseidon]], who led a colony to the Tyrrhenian sea; and the third Aeolus was a son of [[Hippotes]] who is mentioned in the ''[[Odyssey]]'' as Keeper of the [[Anemoi|Winds]] in [[Greek Mythology]].  All three men named Aeolus appear to be connected genealogically, although the precise relationship is often ambiguous.  The traditions regarding the second and third Aeolus are especially entangled.

==Aeolus (son of Hellen)==

This '''Aeolus''' was son of Hellen and the nymph Orseis, and a brother of [[Dorus]], [[Xuthus]] and [[Amphictyon]].  He is described as the ruler of [[Aeolia]] (later called [[Thessaly]]) and held to be the founder of the [[Aeolic]] branch of the Greek/Hellenic nation.  Aeolus married [[Enarete]], daughter of Deimachus (otherwise unknown).  Aeolus and Enarete had many children, although the precise number and identities of these children vary from author to author in the ancient sources.  Those listed as the sons of Aeolus and Enarate include [[Cretheus]], [[Sisyphus]], [[Deioneus]], [[Salmoneus]], [[Athamas]], [[Perieres]], [[Cercaphas]] and perhaps [[Magnes]] (who is usually regarded as a brother of [[Macedon]]).  Another son is named [[Mimas]], who provides a link to the third Aeolus (see below) in a genealogy that seems very contrived.  [[Calyce]], [[Peisidice]], [[Perimele]] and [[Alcyone]] were counted among the daughters of Aeolus and Enarate.  This [[Aeolus]] also had an illegitimate daughter named [[Arne]], begotten on [[Melanippe]], daughter of the Centaur [[Cheiron]].  This Arne became the mother of the second Aeolus, by the god Poseidon.

==Aeolus (son of Poseidon)==

This '''Aeolus''' was a son of Poseidon by Arne, daughter of Aeolus.  He had a twin brother named [[Boeotus]].  Arne confessed to her father that she was with child by the god Poseidon; Aeolus, however, did not believe her, and handed her over to a man named [[Metapontus]], King of Icaria.  When Boeotus and Aeo­lus were born, they were raised by Meta­pontus; but their stepmother ([[Autolyte]], wife of Metapontus) quarrelled with their mother Arne, prompting Boeotus and Aeolus to kill Autolyte and flee from Icaria.  Boeotus (accompanied by Arne) went to southern Thessaly, and founded [[Boeotia]]; but Aeolus went to a group of islands in the Tyrrhenian sea, which received from him the name of the [[Aeolian Islands]]; accord­ing to some accounts this Aeolus founded the town of Lipara.  Although his home has been traditionally identified as one of the Aeolian Islands (there is little consensus as to which), near [[Sicily]], an alternative location has been suggested at [[Gramvousa]] off the northwest coast of [[Crete]].  Aeolus had six sons and six daughters, and the family lived happily together - that is until the day Aeolus learned that one of his sons, named [[Macareus]], had committed incest with his sister [[Canace]].  Horrified, Aeolus expelled Macareus (Canace killed herself in shame) and threw the child borne of this incestuous union to the dogs.  (Other accounts claim that the child, a daughter named [[Amphissa]]) was rescued and later beloved by [[Apollo]]).

==Aeolus (son of Hippotes)==

This '''Aeolus''' is most frequently conflated with Aeolus, the son of Poseidon.  It is difficult to delineate this Aeolus from the second Aeolus, as their identities seem to have been merged by many ancient writers.  The father of this third Aeolus is given as Mimas, a son of the first Aeolus (son of Hellen).  According to some accounts, Mimas married the same Melanippe who was the mother of Arne!  This Aeolus lived on the floating island of [[Aeolia]] and was visited by [[Odysseus]] and his crew in the ''Odyssey.'' He gave hospitality for a month and provided for a west wind to carry them home.  Unfortunately he also provided a gift of a bag containing each of the four winds, which Odysseus's crew members opened just before their home was reached.  They were blown back to [[Aeolia]], where Aeolus refused to provide any further help. (''[[Odyssey]]'' X, 2; [[Virgil]] I, 52).  This Aeolus was perceived by later authors (i.e., after Homer) as a god, rather than as a mortal and simple Keeper of the Winds (as in the ''Odyssey'').

Letters lacking an initial or medial version are never tied to the following letter, even within a word. As to '''{{Ar|ﺀ}}''' ''hamza'', it has only a single graphic, since it is never tied to a preceding or following letter.  However, it is sometimes 'seated' on a waw, ya or alif, and in that case the seat behaves like an ordinary waw, ya or alif.

====Modified letters====
The following are not actual letters, but rather different orthographical shapes for letters.

;Notes:
The {{ArabDIN|ʼalif maqṣūra}}, commonly using Unicode 0x0649 ({{Ar|ى}}) in Arabic, is sometimes replaced in [[Persian language|Persian]] or Urdu, with Unicode 0x06CC (ی), called &quot;Farsi Yeh&quot;.  This is appropriate to its pronunciation in those languages.  The glyphs are identical in isolated and final form (ﻯ ﻰ), but not in initial and medial form, in which the Farsi Yeh gains two dots below (ﻳ ﻴ) while the {{ArabDIN|ʼalif maqṣūra}} has neither an initial nor a medial form.

====Ligatures====
The only compulsory ligature is ''{{ArabDIN|lām}}'' + ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}''. All other ligatures (''{{ArabDIN|yāʼ}}''+''{{ArabDIN|mīm}}'', etc.) are optional.
* (isolated) ''{{ArabDIN|lām}}'' + ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'' (''{{ArabDIN|lā}}'' {{IPA|[læː]}}) :
*: &lt;span style=&quot;line-height:180%;padding:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Ar|&amp;#xFEFB;}}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
* (final) ''{{ArabDIN|lām}}'' + ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'' (''{{ArabDIN|lā}}'' {{IPA|[læː]}}) :
*: &lt;span style=&quot;line-height:180%;padding:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Ar|&amp;#xFEFC;}}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

[[Unicode]] has a special glyph for the ligature ''{{ArabDIN|llāh}}'', the post-vocalic form of ''{{ArabDIN|[[Allāh]]}}'' (“God”).
* U+FDF2 ARABIC LIGATURE ALLAH ISOLATED FORM:
*: &lt;span style=&quot;line-height:180%;padding:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Ar|&amp;#xFDF2;}} (image: [[Image:Allah_glyph.png|28px]])&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Combined with an initial ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'', this becomes full ''{{ArabDIN|allāh}}'' :
*: &lt;span style=&quot;line-height:180%;padding:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Ar|&amp;#x0627;&amp;#xFDF2;}}&lt;/div&gt;

The latter is a work-around for the shortcomings of most text processors, which are incapable of displaying the correct [[harakat|vowel marks]] for the word ''{{ArabDIN|[[Allāh]]}}'', because it should compose a small ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'' sign above a gemination ''{{ArabDIN|šadda}}'' sign). Compare the display of the composed equivalents below (the exact outcome will depend on your browser and font configuration):
* ''{{ArabDIN|lām}}'', (geminated) ''{{ArabDIN|lām}}'' (with implied short-a vowel), (vowel reversed) ''{{ArabDIN|hāʼ}}'' :
*: &lt;span style=&quot;line-height:180%;padding:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Ar|&amp;#x0644;&amp;#x0644;&amp;#x0647;}}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
* ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'', ''{{ArabDIN|lām}}'', (geminated) ''{{ArabDIN|lām}}'' (with implied short-a vowel), (vowel reversed) ''{{ArabDIN|hāʼ}}'' :
*: &lt;span style=&quot;line-height:180%;padding:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Ar|&amp;#x0627;&amp;#x0644;&amp;#x0644;&amp;#x0647;}}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

=== Hamza ===
{{main|hamza}}
Initially, the letter ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'' indicated an occlusive glottal, or glottal stop, transcribed by {{IPA|[ʔ]}}, confirming the alphabet came from the same [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] origin. Now it is used in the same manner as in other [[abjad]]s, with ''{{ArabDIN|yāʼ}}'' and ''{{ArabDIN|wāw}}'', as a ''mater lectionis'', that is to say, a consonant standing in for a long vowel (see below). In fact, over the course of time its original consonantal value has been obscured, since ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'' now serves either as a long vowel or as graphic support for certain diacritics (madda or hamza).*****

The Arabic alphabet now uses the ''[[hamza]]'' to indicate a [[glottal stop]], which can appear anywhere in a word.  This letter, however, does not function like the others: it can be written alone or on a support in which case it becomes a diacritic:

* alone: {{Ar|ء}} ; 
* with a support: {{Ar|إ, أ}} (above and under a ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}''), {{Ar|ؤ}} (above a ''{{ArabDIN|wāw}}''), {{Ar|ئ}} (above a dotless ''{{ArabDIN|yāʼ}}''  or ''{{ArabDIN|yāʼ hamza}}'').

=== Diacritics ===

====Shadda====
{{main|shadda}}
''{{ArabDIN|šadda}}'' ( {{Ar|&amp;#x0651;}}&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small style=&quot;color:#CCCCCC&quot;&gt;&amp;#x25CC;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ) marks the [[gemination]] (doubling) of a consonant; an {{ArabDIN|kasra}} ( {{Ar|&amp;#x0650;}}&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small style=&quot;color:#CCCCCC&quot;&gt;&amp;#x25CC;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ) vowel sign (when present) moves to between the geminate (doubled) consonant and ''{{ArabDIN|šadda}}''.

The w-shaped ''{{ArabDIN|šadda}}'' glyph above the second consonnant that it geminates, is in fact the begining of a small ''{{ArabDIN|šīn}}'' letter.

====''Sukūn'' and ''ʼalif'' above====
An Arabic syllable can be open (ended by a vowel) or closed (ended by a consonant).
* open: CV[consonant-vowel] (long or short vowel)
* closed: CVC (short vowel only)

When the syllable is closed, we can indicate that the consonant that closes it does not carry a vowel by marking it with a sign called ''{{ArabDIN|sukūn}}'' ({{ar|ْ}}) to remove any ambiguity, especially when the text is not vocalised: it's necessary to remember that a standard text is only composed of series of consonants; thus, the word ''{{ArabDIN|qalb}}'', &quot;heart&quot;, is written ''{{ArabDIN|qlb}}''.

''{{ArabDIN|Sukūn}}'' allows us to know where not to place a vowel: ''{{ArabDIN|qlb}}'' could, in effect, be read ''/qVlVbV/'', but written with a ''sukūn'' over the ''{{ArabDIN|l}}'' and the ''{{ArabDIN|b}}'', it can only be interpreted as the form ''/qVlb/''; we write this {{Ar|قلْبْ}}. This is one stage from full vocalization, where the ''a'' vowel would also be indicated by a {{ArabDIN|fatḥa}}: {{Ar|قَلْبْ}}, 

The ''{{ArabDIN|[[Qur’an]]}}'' is traditionaly written in full vocalization. Outside of the ''{{ArabDIN|[[Qur’an]]}}'', putting a ''{{ArabDIN|sukūn}}'' above a ''{{ArabDIN|yāʼ}}'' which indicates {{IPA|[i:]}}, or above a ''{{ArabDIN|wāw}}'' which stands for {{IPA|[u:]}} is extremely rare, to the point that ''{{ArabDIN|yāʼ}}'' with sukūn will be unambiguously read as the diphthong {{IPA|[ai]}}, and ''{{ArabDIN|wāw}}'' with ''{{ArabDIN|sukūn}}'' will be read {{IPA|[au]}}.

The letters ''{{ArabDIN|m-w-s-y-q-ā}}'' ({{Ar|موسيقى}} with an ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif maqṣūra}}'' at the end of the word)
will be read most naturally as the word ''{{ArabDIN|mūsīqā}}'' (“music”).  If you were to write ''{{ArabDIN|sukūns}}'' above the ''{{ArabDIN|wāw}}'', ''{{ArabDIN|yāʼ}}'' and ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'', you’d get {{Ar|وْسيْقىْ}}, which would be read as  ''{{ArabDIN|*mawsaykāy}}'' (note however that the final ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif maqṣūra}}'' is an ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'' and never takes ''{{ArabDIN|sukūn}}'').  The word, entirely vocalised, would be written {{Ar|مُوْسِيْقَى}} in the ''{{ArabDIN|[[Qur’an]]}}'' (if it happened to appear there!), or {{Ar|مُوسِيقَى}} elsewhere.  (The Quranic spelling would have no ''{{ArabDIN|sukūn}}'' sign above the final ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif maqṣūra}}'', but instead a miniature ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'' above the preceding ''{{ArabDIN|qaf}}'' consonant, which is a valid [[Unicode]] character but most Arabic computer fonts cannot in fact display this miniature ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'' as of 2006.)

A ''{{ArabDIN|sukūn}}'' is not placed on word-final consonants, even if no vowel is pronounced, because fully vocalised texts are always written as if  the ''[[i`rab]]'' vowels were in fact pronounced.  For example, ''{{ArabDIN|ʼaḥmad zawǧ šarr}}'', meaning “Ahmed is a bad husband”, for the purposes of Arabic grammar and orthography, is treated as if it was still pronounced with full ''i`rab'', i.e. ''{{ArabDIN|ʼaḥmadu zawǧun šarrun}}'' with the complete [[desinence]]s.

Arabic short vowels are generally ''not'' written, except sometimes in sacred texts (such as the Qurʼan) and didactics, which are known as vocalised texts.  Occasionally short vowels are marked where the word would otherwise be ambiguous and cannot be resolved simply from context.

Short vowels may be written with [[diacritic|diacritics]] placed above or below the consonant that precedes them in the syllable. (All Arabic vowels, long and short, follow a consonant; contrary to appearances: there ''is'' a consonant at the start of a name like Ali  in Arabic ''{{ArabDIN|ʻAliyy}}''  or a word like ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}''.)

Note that when the acute-shaped {{ArabDIN|fatḥa}} which denotes a short a is added on top of a geminated consonnant (i.e. after a {{ArabDIN|šadda}}), the fatha accent takes a vertical shape to make the composition more distinctable from the tanwiin vowel sign {{ArabDIN|fatḥatan}} (which marks a /-an/ ending with indeterminate nunation in fully vocalized texts, see below). For an example, see the encoded ligature for ''ʻAllah'' above.

Long &quot;a&quot; following a consonant other than hamzah is written with a short-&quot;a&quot; mark on the consonant plus an alif after it (''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}''). Long &quot;i&quot; is a mark for short &quot;i&quot; plus a yaa ''yāʼ'', and long u is mark for short u plus waaw, so aā = ā, iy = ī and uw = ū); long &quot;a&quot; following a hamzah sound may be represented by an alif-madda or by a floating hamzah followed by an alif.

In the table below, vowels will be placed above or below a dotted circle replacing a primary consonnant letter or shadda. Please note, that most consonnants (except 6 of them) do join to the left with ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'', ''{{ArabDIN|wāw}}'' and ''{{ArabDIN|yāʼ}}'' written then with their medial or final form. Additionally, the ''{{ArabDIN|yāʼ}}'' letter in the last row may connect to the letter on its left, and then will use a medial or initial form. For clarity in the table below, the primary letter on the left used to mark these long vowels are shown only in their isolated form. Use the tableof primary letters to look at their actual glyph and joining types.

In an un-vocalised text (one in which the short vowels are not marked), the long vowels are represented by the consonnant in question : {{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}, {{ArabDIN|ʼalif maqṣūra}} (or {{ArabDIN|yeh}}), {{ArabDIN|wāw}}, {{ArabDIN|yāʼ}}. Long vowels written in the middle of a word of un-vocalized text are treated like consonants taking ''sukūn'' (see below) in a text that has full diacritics. Here also, the table shows long vowel letters only in isolated form for clarity.

==  Numerals  == 
{{main|Eastern Arabic numerals}}
There are two kinds of numerals used in Arabic writing; standard numerals and &quot;East Arab&quot; numerals, used in [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]] and [[India]].  In Arabic, these numbers are referred to as &quot;Indian numbers&quot; ({{Ar|أرقام هندية}} ''{{ArabDIN|arqām hindiyyah}}'').  In most of present-day North Africa, the usual Western numerals are used; in medieval times, a slightly different set (from which, via Italy, Western &quot;Arabic numerals&quot; derive) was used. Unlike Arabic alphabetic characters, Arabic numerals are written from left to right.

In addition, the Arabic alphabet can be used to represent numbers ([[Abjad numerals]]), a usage rare today. This usage is based on the [[#Abjadi order|Abjadi order]] of the alphabet. ''{{Semxlit|ʼalif}}'' is 1, {{Arabiyyah|ب}} ''{{Semxlit|bāʼ}}'' is 2, {{Arabiyyah|ج}} ''{{Semxlit|ǧīm}}'' is 3, and so on until {{Arabiyyah|ي}} ''{{Semxlit|yāʼ}}'' = 10, {{Arabiyyah|ك}} ''{{Semxlit|kāf}}'' = 20, {{Arabiyyah|ل}} ''{{Semxlit|lām}}'' = 30, ... {{Arabiyyah|ر}} ''{{Semxlit|rāʼ}}'' = 200, ..., {{Arabiyyah|غ}} ''{{Semxlit|ġayn}}'' = 1000.  This is sometimes used to produce [[chronogram]]s. *Standard form of number 2 in Egypt is slightly different

== History ==
{{main|History of the Arabic alphabet}}

The Arabic alphabet can be traced back to the [[Nabatean alphabet]] used to write the [[Nabataean]] dialect of [[Aramaic]], itself descended from Phoenician. The first known text in the Arabic alphabet is a late fourth-century inscription from [[Jabal Ram]] (50 km east of [[Aqaba]]), but the first dated one is a trilingual inscription at [[Zebed]] in [[Syria]] from 512.  However, the [[epigraph]]ic record is extremely sparse, with only five certainly [[pre-Islamic Arabic inscriptions]] surviving, though some others may be pre-Islamic. Later, dots were added above and below the letters to differentiate them (the Aramaic model had fewer phonemes than the Arabic, and some originally distinct Aramaic letters had become indistinguishable in shape, so in the early writings 15 distinct letter-shapes had to do duty for 28 sounds!)  The first surviving document that definitely uses these dots is also the first surviving Arabic [[papyrus]] ([[PERF 558]]), dated April 643, although they did not become obligatory until much later. Important texts like the [[Qur'an|Qurʼan]] were frequently [[memorization|memorized]]; this practice, which survives even today, probably arose partially from a desire to avoid the great ambiguity of the script.

Yet later, vowel signs and [[hamza]]s were added, beginning sometime in the last half of the [[seventh century]], roughly contemporaneous with the first invention of Syriac and Hebrew [[vocalization]].  Initially, this was done by a system of red dots, said to have been commissioned by an [[Umayyad]] governor of [[Iraq]], [[Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]]: a dot above = ''{{Semxlit|a}}'', a dot below = ''{{Semxlit|i}}'', a dot on the line = ''{{Semxlit|u}}'', and doubled dots gave ''tanwin''.  However, this was cumbersome and easily confusable with the letter-distinguishing dots, so about 100 years later, the modern system was adopted.  The system was finalized around 786 by [[al-Farahidi]].

==Arabic alphabets of other languages==
Arabic script has been adopted for use in a wide variety of languages other than Arabic, including [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]].  Such adaptations may feature altered or new characters to represent [[phoneme]]s that do not appear in Arabic [[phonology]]. For example, the Arabic language lacks a {{IPA|[p]}} phoneme, so many languages add their own letter to represent {{IPA|[p]}} in the script, though the specific letter used varies from language to language.  These modifications tend to fall into groups: all the [[India]]n and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] languages written in Arabic script tend to use the [[Persian alphabet|Persian modified letters]]]); whereas [[West Africa]]n languages tend to imitate those of [[Ajami script|Ajami]], and [[Indonesia]]n ones those of [[Jawi]]. The modified version of the Arabic script originally devised for use with Persian is known as the '''[[Perso-Arabic script]]''' by scholars.

=== Current uses of the alphabet for other languages ===

The Arabic alphabet is currently used for:  

* [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] in Northern [[Iraq]].  (In [[Turkey]], the [[Latin alphabet]] is now used for Kurdish);
* [[Official language]] [[Persian language|Persian]] and regional languages including [[Azeri language|Azeri]], [[Sorani|Sorani-Kurdish]] and [[Baluchi]] in [[Iran]];
* Official languages [[Dari (Afghanistan)|Dari]] and [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and regional languages including [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] in [[Afghanistan]];
* Official language [[Urdu language|Urdu]] and regional languages including [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] (where the script is known as [[Shahmukhi]]), [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], and [[Baluchi language|Baluchi]] in [[Pakistan]];
* [[Urdu language|Urdu]] and [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] in [[India]] (see [[List of national languages of India]]);
* [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] (changed to Roman script in 1969 and back to a simplified, fully voweled, Arabic script in 1983), [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] and [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] by a minority of Kyrgyz in the [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] in northwest [[China]];
* [[Malay language|Malay]] in the Arabic script known as [[Jawi]] is co-official in [[Brunei]], and used for religious purposes in [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Singapore]];
* [[Comorian language|Comorian]] (Comorian) in the [[Comoros]], currently side by side with the [[Latin alphabet]] (neither is official);
* [[Hausa language|Hausa]] for many purposes, especially religious (known as ''[[Ajami script|Ajami]]'');
* [[Mandinka language|Mandinka]], widely but unofficially; (another alphabet used is [[N'Ko]])
* [[Wolof language|Wolof]] (at [[zaouia]]s), known as ''[[Wolofal]]''.
* [[Tamazight]] and other [[Berber languages]] were traditionally written in Arabic in the [[Maghreb]]. There is now a competing 'revival' of neo-[[Tifinagh]].

=== Former uses of the alphabet for other languages ===

In the past, Arabic script has also been used to represent some languages now written with a different script, such as the [[Latin alphabet]]. Most education was once religious instead of governmental and uniform within a state, so choice of script was determined by the user's religion and Muslims would use Arabic script to write any language they used. See also [[Languages of Muslim countries]].

* [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] (as it was first written among the &quot;[[Cape Malay]]s&quot;);
* [[Albanian language|Albanian]];
* [[Azeri language|Azeri]] in [[Azerbaijan]] (now written in the [[Latin alphabet]] and [[Cyrillic alphabet]] scripts in [[Azerbaijan]]);
* [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] (among ethnic [[Tatars]]);
* [[Berber languages|Berber]] in North Africa, particularly [[Tachelhit language|Tachelhit]] in [[Morocco]] (still being considered, along with [[Tifinagh]] and Latin for [[Tamazight]]);
* [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]] (for some years: from [[October Revolution]] (1917) until 1928);
* [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] (only for literary purposes); (presently written in the [[Latin alphabet]] and [[Cyrillic alphabet]] scripts)
* [[Chagatai language|Chaghatai]] across [[Central Asia]];
* [[Chechen language|Chechen]] (for some years: from [[October Revolution]] (1917) until 1928);
* [[Chinese languages|Chinese]] and [[Dungan language|Dungan]], among the Chinese [[Hui people|Hui]] [[Muslim]]s[http://www.aa.tufs.ac.jp/~kmach/xiaoerjin/xiaoerjin-e.htm];
* [[Fulani language|Fulani]], where the script is known as [[Ajami script]];
* [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] in [[Kazakhstan]];
* [[Kyrgyz]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]];
* [[Malay language|Malay]] in [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]];
* [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]], when the Moors ruled Spain (and later [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] proper; see [[aljamiado]]);
* [[Nubian languages|Nubian]];
* [[Polish language|Polish]] (among ethnic [[Tatars]]);
* [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] has also been written in Arabic script, though it is more well known as using [[Devanagari]] - the script also known for being currently used for writing the [[Hindi language]].
* [[Swahili language|Swahili]];
* [[Somali language|Somali]] (has used the [[Latin alphabet]] since 1972);
* [[Songhay languages|Songhay]] in West Africa, particularly in [[Timbuktu]];
* [[Tatar language|Tatar]] ([[iske imlâ]]) before 1928 (changed to Latin), reformed in 1880's, 1918 (deletion of some letters);
* [[Turkish language|Turkish]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]] was written in Arabic script until [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] declared the change to [[Roman script]] in 1928. This form of Turkish is now known as [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] and is held by many to be a different language, due to its much higher percentage of Persian and Arabic [[loanword]]s;
* [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] in [[Turkmenistan]];
* [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] in [[Uzbekistan]];
* All the Muslim peoples of the [[USSR]] between 1918-1928 (many also earlier), including [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]], [[Chechen language|Chechen]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Tajik language|Tajik]] etc.  After 1928 their script became Latin, then later Cyrillic.

== Computers and the Arabic alphabet ==

The Arabic alphabet can be encoded using several [[character set]]s, including [[ISO-8859-6]] and [[Unicode]], in the latter thanks to the &quot;Arabic segment&quot;, entries U+0600 to U+06FF. However, neither of these sets indicate the form each character should take in context. It is left to the [[rendering engine]] to select the proper [[glyph]] to display for each character.

When one wants to encode a particular written form of a character, there are extra code points provided in Unicode which can be used to express the exact written form desired. The ''Arabic presentation forms A'' (U+FB50 to U+FDFF) and ''Arabic presentation forms B'' (U+FE70 to U+FEFF) contain most of the characters with contextual variation as well as the extended characters appropriate for other languages. These effects are better achieved in Unicode  by using the ''zero width joiner'' and ''non-joiner'', as these presentation forms are deprecated in Unicode, and should generally only be used within the internals of text-rendering software, when using Unicode as an intermediate form for conversion between character encodings, or for backwards compatibility with implementations that rely on the hard-coding of glyph forms.

Finally, the Unicode encoding of Arabic is in ''logical order'', that is, the characters are entered, and stored in computer memory, in the order that they are written and pronounced without worrying about the direction in which they will be displayed on paper or on the screen. Again, it is left to the rendering engine to present the characters in the correct direction, using Unicode's [[bi-directional text]] features. In this regard, if the Arabic words on this page are written left to right, it is an indication that the Unicode rendering engine used to display them is out-of-date. For more information about encoding Arabic, consult the Unicode manual available at http://www.unicode.org/

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[angel|Angels]] have appeared in works of [[art]] for millennia.
Angel-shaped beings appear in ancient [[Mesopotamian]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] art and were probably the inspiration for the popular [[Christianity|Christian]] image of angels.

Angels remained a popular subject for [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[European]] paintings and sculpture.

Several famous examples are:

* ''The Ecstasy of [[Teresa of Avila|S. Teresa di Avila]]'' by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini]] (http://www.boglewood.com/cornaro/xteresa.html)

* ''The Annunciation'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (http://www.lairweb.org.nz/leonardo/annunciation.html)

Angels have also become an intregal part of [[Anime]] culture, particularly in [[fan art]] and [[web comics]]. 

==Contemporary works of art with angels:==

===Books===
*''[[Good Omens]]''
*''[[His dark materials]]''

===Anime and Manga===

The '''Arctic Fox''' (''Alopex lagopus'' or ''Vulpes lagopus'') is a small [[fox]] native to cold [[Arctic]] regions of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. It is common to see an arctic fox in all three tundra biomes. Although some authorities have suggested placing them in the [[genus]] ''[[Vulpes]]'', they have long been considered the sole member of the genus ''Alopex''. Smaller, more rounded ears than red fox; braincase more rounded and muzzle slightly shorter and broader than Vulpes vulpes (Clutton-Brock et al. 1976). Occurs in two distinct colour morphs, &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;white&quot;. Each colour phase also changes seasonally &quot;blue&quot; moults from chocolate brown in summer to lighter brown tinged with blue sheen in winter. In winter, &quot;white&quot; is almost pure white, while in summer it is grey to brownish-grey dorsally, and light grey to white below. Colour morphs are determined genetically at a single locus, white being recessive. The &quot;blue&quot; morph comprises less than 1% of the population through most of its continental range, but this proportion increases westwards in Alaska, and on islands. Head-and-body length: 55 cm (male); 53 cm (female). Tail length: 31 cm (male); 3O cm (female). Shoulder height: 25-30 cm. Weight: 3.8 kg (male); 3.1 kg (female)


==Habits==
[[Image:Arcticfox-3.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Arctic Fox at Bird cliff]]
Arctic Foxes eat a wide variety of things, including [[lemming]]s, [[Arctic Hare]], [[bird]]s and their [[egg (biology)|egg]]s and [[carrions]]. The most important of these foods is lemming. A family of foxes can eat dozens of lemmings each day. During April and May, Arctic Foxes also prey on [[Ringed Seal]] pups when the young animals are confined to a snow den and are relatively helpless.Sometimes they follow polar bears and eat the left over prey.  When their normal prey is scarce, Arctic Foxes scavenge the leftovers of larger predators, such as [[Polar Bear]]s, even though Polar Bears' prey includes the Arctic Fox itself.    

The foxes tend to form [[monogamy|monogamous]] pairs in the breeding season. Litters of about half a dozen to a dozen [[whelp]]s are born in the early summer, a very large litter size for [[mammal]]s. The parents raise the young in a large [[den]].

Arctic foxes habitats are tundra and coastal areas. The white morph is generally associated with true tundra habitat, the blue more with coastal habitat.

==Population and distribution==
[[Image:Distribution arctic fox.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Distribution of the Arctic Fox]]
[[Image:Arctic fox.jpg|thumb|200px|left|An Arctic Fox]]
Arctic Foxes have a [[circumpolar]] range, meaning that they are found throughout the entire Arctic, including [[Russia]], [[Canada]], [[Nunavut]], [[Alaska]], [[Greenland]] and [[Svalbard]], as well as in sub-Arctic and alpine areas, such as [[Iceland]] and mainland alpine [[Scandinavia]]. The conservation status of the species is good, except for the Scandinavian mainland population. It is acutely endangered, despite decades of legal protection from hunting and persecution. The total population estimate in Norway, Sweden and Finland is a mere 120 adult individuals.

The abundance of Arctic Foxes tends to fluctuate in a cycle along with the population of lemmings. Because the foxes reproduce very quickly and often die young, population levels are not seriously impacted by [[trapping]]. They have, nonetheless, been eradicated from many areas where humans are settled.

The Arctic Fox is losing ground to the larger [[Red Fox]]. Historically, the [[Grey Wolf]] has kept the number of Red Foxes down, but as wolves have been hunted to near [[extinction]], the Red Fox population has grown larger, taking over the niche of top predator. In areas of northern [[Europe]] there are programs to hunt Red Foxes in the Arctic Fox's previous range.

The '''folklore of the United States''', or '''American folklore''', is the folk tradition which has evolved on the [[North America|North American]] continent since [[Europe|Europeans]] arrived in the [[16th century]]. While it contains much in the way of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tradition, it should not be confused with the actual tribal beliefs of any real band, nation or community of native people. American folklore, rather, is a fusion of European ideals of &quot;civilization&quot; with a European obsession with the &quot;exotic&quot; and the &quot;savage.&quot; American folklore is essentially about immigrants and their misunderstanding of each other, and of the new landscape they found themselves conquering, and of the people that had already been there when the first European colonists arrived. 

== Founding Myths ==
The founding of the [[United States]] is often translated as myth. A [[mythology]] is simply a story of some sort which has emotional, cultural, moral or ethical value to a nation.  Taken broadly, then, American mythology can include any narrative which has contributed to the shaping of [[American values]] and belief systems.  These narratives may be true and may be false; the veracity of the stories is not a determining factor. Three founding myths include: Christopher Columbus, the Pilgrims, and George Washington.

=== Christopher Columbus ===
Though [[Christopher Columbus]] did not participate in the founding of the American government, he has been interpreted as a &quot;founder&quot; of the American nation, in that it is descended from the [[Europe]]an immigrants that would not have moved to the New World if Columbus had not found where it was.  Indeed, one particularly pervasive myth is that Columbus discovered America, as it is far easier to heroify a man than a complex series of waves of immigrants from multiple conditions and walks of life.  According to some stories, Columbus sailed across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in order to prove that the world was round, because he expected to reach the Far East by sailing west.  Like most mythological &quot;founders&quot; Columbus' mission is then rendered entirely noble, intellectual and rational.  He helped dispel the inaccurate myths of his time, and, so, it is concluded, the nation he founded must be a nation of intellect and logic.  [[Washington Irving]] is the first citation for this myth.

=== Pilgrims ===
The holiday of [[Thanksgiving]] is said to have begun with the [[Pilgrims]] in [[1619]].  They had come to America to escape religious persecution, but then nearly starved to death due to the unfamiliar land.  Some friendly [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s (including [[Squanto]]) helped the Pilgrims survive through the first winter.  The perseverance of the Pilgrims is celebrated during the annual Thanksgiving festival.  As a myth, this story relates to the founding of the culture.  The Pilgrims' dedication to their cause in spite of the hardships renders the foundation of the country, and therefore the country itself, seem stronger and more resilient.  It is also a fertility festival, similar in some ways to other harvest-time celebrations in other cultures, celebrating the nourishment that comes from the earth.  It was also said that the Pilgrims were the first colony in the New World, but before that, there were some [[France|French]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] colonies, as well as other [[England|English]] colonies.  Some English colonies in America that predated Plymouth Rock include [[Roanoke settlement]], which was later overtaken by or integrated with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes, and the [[Jamestown Settlement]], which was successful and predated the Pilgrims' settlement by 20 years.

=== George Washington ===
[[George Washington]], the country's first president, is often said to be the founder of the United States.  Since his death, Washington has been mythologized, with many anecdotes and stories about his life told, in general, to present the founder of the modern American nation as a just and wise [[culture hero|cultural hero]].  For example, it is said that Washington, as a young child, chopped down his father's cherry tree.  His angry father confronted the young Washington, who proclaimed &quot;I can not tell a lie&quot; and admitted to the transgression, thus illuminating his honesty.  Parson [[Mason Locke Weems]] is the first citation of the myth, in his [[1850]] book, ''The Life of George Washington: With Curious Anecdotes, Equally Honorable to Himself and Exemplary to His Young Countrymen''.  [[Samuel Clemens]] (Mark Twain) is also known to ha:8–6:18 and 7:12–26 — documents from the Achaemenid period ([[5th century BC|fifth century BCE]]) concerning the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem.
* [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 2:4b–7:28 — five subversive tales and an apocalyptic vision.
* [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 10:11 — a single sentence in the middle of a Hebrew text denouncing idolatry.
* [[Genesis]] 31:47 — translation of a Hebrew place-name.
Biblical Aramaic is a somewhat hybrid dialect. Some Biblical Aramaic material probably originated in both Babylonia and Judaea before the fall of the Achaemenid dynasty. During [[Seleucid]] rule, defiant Jewish propaganda shaped Aramaic [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]]. These stories probably existed as oral traditions at their earliest stage. This might be one factor that led to differing collections of Daniel in the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Septuagint]] and the [[Masoretic Text]], which presents a lightly [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]-influenced Aramaic.

Under the category of post-Achaemenid is Hasmonaean Aramaic, the official language of [[Hasmonean|Hasmonaean]] Judaea ([[142 BC|142]]–[[37 BC|37]] BCE). It influenced the Biblical Aramaic of the [[Qumran]] texts, and was the main language of non-biblical theological texts of that community. The major [[Targum]]s, translations of the Hebrew Bible into Aramaic, were originally composed in Hasmonaean. Hasmonaean also appears in quotations in the [[Mishnah]] and [[Tosefta]], although smoothed into its later context. It is written quite differently from Achaemenid Aramaic; there is an emphasis on writing as words are pronounced rather than using etymological forms.

Babylonian [[Targum]]ic is the later post-Achaemenid dialect found in the [[Targum Onkelos|Targum Onqelos]] and [[Targum Jonathan]], the 'official' targums. The original, Hasmonaean targum had reached Babylon sometime in the [[2nd century|second]] or [[3rd century|third]] centuries CE. They were then reworked according to the contemporary dialect of Babylon to create the language of the standard targums. This combination formed the basis of Babylonian Jewish literature for centuries to follow.

[[Image:Targum.jpg|right|thumb|320px|11th century [[Targum]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]].]]

Galilean Targumic is similar to Babylonian Targumic. It is the mixing of literary Hasmonaean with the dialect of [[Galilee]]. The Hasmonaean targum reached Galilee in the second century CE, and were reworked into this Galilean dialect for local use. The Galilean Targum was never considered an authoritative work, and documentary evidence shows that its text was amended wherever and whenever 'improvement' was needed. From the [[11th century|eleventh century CE]] onwards, once the Babylonian Targum had become normative, the Galilean version became heavily influenced by it.

Babylonian Documentary Aramaic is a dialect in use from the third century CE onwards. It is the dialect of Babylonian private documents, and, from the [[12th century|twelfth century]], all Jewish private documents in Aramaic. It is based on Hasmonaean with very few changes. This was perhaps due to the fact that many of the documents in BDA are legal documents, the language in them had to be sensible throughout the Jewish community from the start, and Hasmonaean was the old standard.

[[Nabataean]] Aramaic is the language of the Arab kingdom of [[Petra]]. The kingdom (''c.'' [[200 BC|200 BCE]]–[[106|106 CE]] covered the east bank of the [[Jordan River]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northern Arabia. Perhaps because of the importance of the caravan trade, the Nabataeans began to use Aramaic in preference to [[Old North Arabic]]. The dialect is based on Achaemenid with a little influence from Arabic: 'l' is often turned into 'n', and there are a few Arabic loan words. Some Nabataean Aramaic inscriptions exist from the early days of the kingdom, but most are from the first four centuries CE. The language is written in a [[cursive]] script that is the precursor to the modern [[Arabic alphabet]]. The number of Arabic loan words increases through the centuries, until, in the [[4th century|fourth century]], Nabataean merges seamlessly with [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

Palmyrene Aramaic is the dialect that was in use in the city of [[Palmyra]] in the Syrian Desert from [[44 BC|44 BCE]] to 274 CE. It was written in a rounded script, which later gave way to cursive [[Estrangela]]. Like Nabataean, Palmyrene was influenced by Arabic, but to a lesser degree.

[[Arsacid]] Aramaic was the official language of the [[Parthian Empire]] ([[247 BC|247 BCE]]–224 CE). It, more than any other post-Achaemenid dialect, continues the tradition of [[Darius I]]. Over time, however, it came under the influence of contemporary, spoken Aramaic, [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. After the conquest of the Parthians by the Persian-speaking [[Sassanids]], Arsacid exerted considerable influence on the new official language.

===Late Old Eastern Aramaic===
[[Image:Mandaic.jpg|left|thumb|320px|[[Mandaic language|Mandaic]] magical 'demon trap']]

The dialects mentioned in the last section were all descended from Achaemenid Imperial Aramaic. However, the diverse regional dialects of Late Ancient Aramaic continued alongside these, often as simple, spoken languages. Early evidence for these spoken dialects is known only through their influence on words and names in a more standard dialect. However, these regional dialects became written languages in the [[2nd century BC|second century BCE]]. These dialects reflect a stream of Aramaic that is not dependent on Imperial Aramaic, and shows a clear division between the regions of Mesopotamia, Babylon and the east, and Judah, Syria, and the west.

In the east, the dialects of Palmyrene and Arsacid Aramaic merged with the regional languages to create languages with a foot in Imperial and a foot in regional Aramaic. Much later, Arsacid became the liturgical language of the [[Mandaean]] religion, [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]].

In the kingdom of [[Osrhoene]], centred on [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] and founded in [[132 BC|132 BCE]], the regional dialect became the official language: Old [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. On the upper reaches of the [[Tigris]], East Mesopotamian Aramaic flourished, with evidence from [[Hatra]], [[Assur]] and the [[Tur Abdin]]. [[Tatian]], the author of the gospel harmony the [[Diatessaron]] came from Assyria, and perhaps wrote his work (172 CE) in East Mesopotamian rather than Syriac or Greek. In Babylonia, the regional dialect was used by the Jewish community, Jewish Old Babylonian (from ''c.'' [[70]] CE). This everyday language increasingly came under the influence of Biblical Aramaic and Babylonian Targumic.

===Late Old Western Aramaic===
The western regional dialects of Aramaic followed a similar course to those of the east. They are quite distinct from the eastern dialects and Imperial Aramaic. Colloquial Hebrew, and kindred Semitic languages in the Canaanite family, gave way to Aramaic during [[4th century BC|fourth century BCE]]; [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]], however, continued into the [[1st century BC|first century BCE]].

The form of Late Old Western Aramaic used by the Jewish community is best attested, and is usually referred to as Jewish Old Palestinian. Its oldest form is Old East Jordanian, which probably comes from the region of [[Caesarea Philippi]]. This is the language of the oldest manuscript of [[Enoch]] (''c.'' [[170 BC|170 BCE]]). The next distinct phase of the language is called Old Judaean (into the second century CE). Old Judaean literature can be found in various inscriptions and personal letters, preserved quotations in the [[Talmud]] and receipts from [[Qumran]]. [[Josephus]]' first, non-extant edition of his ''[[Jewish War]]'' was written in Old Judaean.

The Old East Jordanian dialect continued to be used into the first century CE by pagan communities living to the east of the Jordan. Their dialect is often then called Pagan Old Palestinian, and it was written in a cursive script somewhat similar to that used for Old Syriac. A Christian Old Palestinian dialect may have arisen from the pagan one, and this dialect may be behind some of the Western Aramaic tendencies found in the otherwise eastern Old Syriac gospels (see [[Peshitta]]).

====The spoken dialects of Jesus' time====
: ''See the [[Aramaic of Jesus]] for more information''. 
Seven dialects of Western Aramaic were spoken in [[Jesus]]' time. They were probably distinctive yet mutually intelligible. Old Judaean was the prominent dialect of [[Jerusalem]] and Judaea. The region of [[Ein Gedi|Engedi]] had the South-east Judaean dialect. [[Samaria]] had its distinctive Samaritan Aramaic, where the consonants 'he', 'heth' and '`ayin' all became pronounced as 'aleph'. Galilean Aramaic, the language of Jesus' home region, is only known from a few place names, the influences on Galilean Targumic, some rabbinic literature and a few private letters. It seems to have a number of distinctive features: [[diphthong]]s are never simplified into monophthongs. East of the Jordan, the various dialects of East Jordanian were spoken. In the region of [[Damascus]] and the [[Anti-Lebanon]], Damascene Aramaic was spoken (deduced mostly from Modern Western Aramaic). Finally, as far north as [[Aleppo]], the western dialect of Orontes Aramaic was spoken.

Besides these dialects of Aramaic, Greek was used extensively in urban centres. There is little evidence for the use of Hebrew during this period. Some Hebrew words continued as part of Jewish Aramaic vocabulary (mostly technical religious words, but also some everyday words like `ēṣ, ''tree''), and the written language of the [[Tanakh]] was read and understood by the educated classes. However, the Hebrew language had ceased to be the language of everyday life. In addition, the various words in the Greek context of the [[New Testament]] that are untranslated are clearly Aramaic rather than Hebrew. From the little evidence there is, this Aramaic is not Galilean Aramaic but Old Judaean. This suggests that the words of Jesus were transmitted in the dialect of [[Judaea]] and [[Jerusalem]] rather than that of his hometown.

The 2004 film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' is notable for its use of much dialogue in an Aramaic  specially reconstructed by a lone scholar, [[William Fulco]]. However, modern Aramaic speakers found the language stilted and unfamiliar.

==Middle Aramaic==
The [[3rd century|third century CE]] is taken as the threshold between Old and Middle Aramaic. During that century, the nature of the various Aramaic languages and dialects begins to change. The descendents of Imperial Aramaic ceased to be living languages, and the eastern and western regional languages began to form vital, new literatures. Unlike many of the dialects of Old Aramaic, much is known about the vocabulary and grammar of Middle Aramaic.

===Eastern Middle Aramaic===
Only two of the Old Eastern Aramaic languages continued into this period. In the north of the region, Old Syriac moved into Middle Syriac. In the south, Jewish Old Babylonian became Jewish Middle Babylonian. The post-Achaemenid, Arsacid dialect became the background of the new [[Mandaic language]].

====Middle Syriac====
[[Image:Estrangela.jpg|right|thumb|320px|9th century [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[Syriac alphabet|Estrangela]] manuscript of [[John Chrysostom]]'s ''Homily on the [[Gospel of John]]'']]

: ''See [[Syriac language]] for more information''.
Middle Syriac is the classical, literary and liturgical language of [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]] to this day. Its golden age was the [[4th century|fourth]] to [[6th century|sixth]] centuries. This period began with the translation of the Bible into the language: the [[Peshitta]] and the masterful prose and poetry of [[Ephrem the Syrian]]. Middle Syriac, unlike its forebear, is a thoroughly Christian language, although in time it became the language of those opposed to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] leadership of the church in the east. Missionary activity led to the spread of Syriac through [[Iran|Persia]] and into [[India]] and [[China]].
{{listen|filename=aboun.ogg|title=Abun dbashmayo|description=The [[Lord's Prayer]], ''Abun dbashmayo'',  sung in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]}}

====Jewish Middle Babylonian Aramaic====
Jewish Middle Babylonian is the language employed by Jewish writers in Babylonia between the 4th century and the 11th century CE. It is most commonly identified with the language of the Babylonian [[Talmud]] (which was completed in the [[7th century|seventh century]]) and of post-Talmudic (Geonic) literarure, which are the most important cultural products Babylonian Jewry. The most important epigraphic sources for the dialect are the hundreds of Aramaic magic bowls written in the Jewish script.

====Mandaic====
: ''See [[Mandaic language]] for more information''.
Mandaic is a sister dialect to Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, though it is both linguistically and culturally distinct. Classical Mandaic is the language in which the Mandaean's religious literature was composed. It is characterized by a highly phonetic orthography.

===Western Middle Aramaic===
The dialects of Old Western Aramaic continued with Jewish Middle Palestinian (in [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew 'square script']]), Samaritan Aramaic (in the [[Phoenician alphabet|old Hebrew script]]) and Christian Palestinian (in cursive [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac script]]). Of these three, only Jewish Middle Palestinian continued as a written language.

====Jewish Middle Palestinian Aramaic====
In 135, after [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]], many [[Jew]]ish leaders, expelled from [[Jerusalem]], moved to [[Galilee]]. The Galilean dialect thus rose from obscurity to become the standard among Jews in the west. This dialect was spoken not only in Galilee, but also in the surrounding parts. It is the linguistic setting for the [[Jerusalem Talmud|Palestinian Talmud]] (completed in the [[5th century|fifth century]]) and [[midrash]]im (biblical commentaries and teaching). The modern standard of vowel pointing for the [[Hebrew Bible]], the Tiberian system ([[10th century|tenth century]]), was most probably based on the pronunciation of the Galilean dialect of Jewish Middle Palestinian. The inscription in the synagogue at [[Dura-Europos]] are either in Middle East Jordanian or Middle Judaean.

Middle Judaean, the descendent of Old Judaean, is no longer the dominant dialect, and was used only in southern Judaea (the variant Engedi dialect continued throughout this period). Likewise, Middle East Jordanian continues as a minor dialect from Old East Jordanian.

====Samaritan Aramaic====
The Aramaic dialect of the [[Samaritan]] community is earliest attested by a documentary tradition that can be dated back to the fourth century. Its modern pronunciation is based on the form used in the tenth century.

====Christian Palestinian Aramaic====
The language of Western-Aramaic-speaking Christians is evidenced from the sixth century, but probably existed two centuries earlier. The language itself comes from Christian Old Palestinian, but its writing conventions were based on early Middle Syriac, and it was heavily influenced by Greek. The name Jesus, although ''Yešû`'' in Aramaic, is written ''Yesûs'' in Christian Palestinian.

==Modern Aramaic==
{{main|Neo-Aramaic languages}}
Over four hundred thousand people speak Aramaic to this day. They are Jews, Christians, Muslims and Mandaeans, living in remote areas and preserving their traditions with printing presses, and now electronic media. The Modern Aramaic (or ''Neo-Aramaic'') languages are now farther apart in their comprehension of one another than perhaps they have ever been. The last two-hundred years have not been good to Aramaic speakers. Instability throughout the Middle East has lead to a worldwide diaspora of Aramaic speakers. The year 1915 is especially prominent for Aramaic-speaking Christians: called ''[[Syriac genocide|Sayfo/Saypā]]'' (''sword'' in Syriac), all Christian groups ([[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Armenians]] and others) living in eastern [[Turkey]] were the subject of the persecutions that marked the end of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. For Aramaic-speaking Jews 1950 is a watershed year: the newly founded state of [[Israel]] led most Aramaic-speaking Jews to emigrate there. However, removal to Israel has led to Jewish Neo-Aramaic being swamped in a sea of Modern Hebrew, and the practical extinction of many Jewish dialects is imminent.

===Modern Eastern Aramaic===
Modern Eastern Aramaic exists in a wide variety of dialects and languages. There is significant difference between the Aramaic spoken by Jews, Christians and Mandaeans.

The Christian languages are often called Modern [[Syriac language|Syriac]] (or Neo-Syriac, particularly when referring to their literature), being deeply influenced by the literary and liturgical language of Middle Syriac. However, they also have roots in numerous, previously unwritten, local Aramaic dialects, and are not purely the direct descendants of the language of [[Ephrem the Syrian]].

Modern Western Syriac (also called Central Neo-Aramaic, being in between Western Neo-Aramaic and Eastern Neo-Syriac) is generally represented by [[Turoyo language|Turoyo]], the language of the [[Tur Abdin]]. A related language, [[Mlahso language|Mlahsö]], has recently become extinct.

The eastern Christian languages (Modern Eastern Syriac or Eastern Neo-Aramaic) are often called ''Sureth'' or ''Suret'', from a native name. They are also sometimes called ''[[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Assyrian]]'' or ''[[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic|Chaldean]]'', but these names are not accepted by all speakers. The dialects are not all mutually intelligible. East Syriac communities are usually either [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean Catholics]] or [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrians]].

The [[Judeo-Aramaic language|Jewish Modern Aramaic languages]] are now mostly spoken in [[Israel]], and most are facing extinction (older speakers are not passing the language to younger generations). The Jewish dialects that have come from communities that once lived between [[Lake Urmia]] and [[Mosul]] are not all mutually intelligible. In some places, for example [[Urmia]], Christians and Jews speak unintelligible dialects of Modern Eastern Aramaic in the same place. In others, the plain of Mosul for example, the dialects of the two faith communities are similar enough to allow conversation.

A few Mandaeans living in the province of [[Khuzestan]] in [[Iran]] speak Modern [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]]. It is quite distinct from any other Aramaic dialect.

===Modern Western Aramaic===
{{main|Western Neo-Aramaic}}
Very little remains of Western Aramaic. It is still spoken in the Christian village of [[Ma'loula|Ma`loula]] in Syria and the Muslim villages of [[Bakh`a]] and [[Jubb`adin]] in [[Syria]]'s [[Anti-Lebanon]], as well as by some people who migrated from these villages to [[Damascus]] and other larger towns of Syria. All these speakers of Modern Western Aramaic are fluent in Arabic, which has now become the main language in these villages.

==Sounds==
Each dialect of Aramaic has its own distinctive pronunciation, and it would not be possible here to go into all these properties. Aramaic has a phonological palette of 25 to 40 distinct phonemes. In general, older dialects tended to have a richer phonology than more modern ones. In particular, some modern Jewish Aramaic pronunciations lack the series of 'emphatic' consonants. Other dialects have borrowed from the inventories of surrounding languages, particularly [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Azeri language|Azeri]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

===Vowels===
As with most Semitic languages, Aramaic can be thought of as having three basic sets of vowels:
* Open ''a''-vowels
* Close front ''i''-vowels
* Close back ''u''-vowels
These vowel groups are relatively stable, but the exact articulation of any individual is most dependent on its consonantal setting.

The cardinal open vowel is an open near-front unrounded vowel ('short' ''a'', like the first vowel in the English 'batter', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/a/}}). It usually has a back counterpart ('long' ''a'', like the ''a'' in 'father', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, or even tending to the vowel in 'caught', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/ɔ/}}), and a front counterpart ('short' ''e'', like the vowel in 'head', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/ɛ/}}). There is much correspondence between these vowels between dialects.  There is some evidence that Middle Babylonian dialects did not distinguish between the short ''a'' and short ''e''. In West Syriac dialects, and possibly Middle Galilean, the long ''a'' became the ''o'' sound. The open ''e'' and back ''a'' are often indicated in writing by the use of the letters 'alaph' (a [[glottal stop]]) or 'he' (like the English ''h'').

The cardinal close front vowel is the 'long' ''i'' (like the vowel in 'need', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/i/}}). It has a slightly more open counterpart, the 'long' ''e'', as in the final vowel of 'café' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/e/}}). Both of these have shorter counterparts, which tend to be pronounced slightly more open. Thus, the short close ''e'' corresponds with the open ''e'' in some dialects. The close front vowels usually use the consonant ''y'' as a [[matres lectionis|mater lectionis]].

The cardinal close back vowel is the 'long' ''u'' (like the vowel in 'school', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/u/}}). It has a more open counterpart, the 'long' ''o'', like the vowel in 'low' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/o/}}). There are shorter, and thus more open, counterparts to each of these, with the short close ''o'' sometimes corresponding with the long open ''a''. The close back vowels often use the consonant ''w'' to indicate their quality.

Two basic [[diphthong]]s exist: an open vowel followed by ''y'' (''ay''), and an open vowel followed by ''w'' (''aw''). These were originally full diphthongs, but many dialects have converted them to ''e'' and ''o'' respectively.

The so-called 'emphatic' consonants (see the next section) cause all vowels to become mid-centralised.

===Consonants===
The various alphabets used for writing Aramaic languages have twenty-two letters (all of which are consonants). Some of these letters, though, can stand for two or three different sounds (usually a [[Stop consonant|plosive]] and a [[fricative]] at the same point of articulation). Aramaic classically uses a series of lightly contrasted plosives and fricatives:
* Labial set: ''p''/''f'' and ''b''/''v'',
* Dental set: ''t''/''θ'' and ''d''/''ð'',
* Velar set: ''k''/''x'' and ''g''/''ɣ''.
Each member of a certain pair is written with the same letter of the alphabet in most writing systems (that is, ''p'' and ''f'' are written with the same letter), and are near [[allophone]]s.

A distinguishing feature of Aramaic phonology (and that of Semitic languages in general) is the presence of 'emphatic' consonants. These are consonants that are pronounced with the root of the tongue retracted, with varying degrees of [[pharyngealization]] and [[velar|velarisation]]. Using their alphabetic names, these emphatics are:
* {{unicode|Ḥêṯ}}, a [[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]], [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: /ħ/ (like the sound made breathing on glass),
* {{unicode|Ṭêṯ}}, a pharyngealized ''t'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: /{{IPA|tˁ}}/,
* {{unicode|ʽAyn}}, a pharyngealized [[glottal stop]] (sometimes considered to be a [[voiced pharyngeal fricative]]), [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: /{{IPA|ʕ}}/ or /{{IPA|ʔˁ}}/,
* {{unicode|Ṣāḏê}}, a pharyngealized ''s'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: /{{IPA|sˁ}}/,
* {{unicode|Qôp̄}}, an [[uvular]] ''k'' (a [[voiceless uvular plosive]]), [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: /q/.{{listen|filename=Aramaic_emphatics.ogg|title=The emphatic consonants of Aramaic|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Ancient Aramaic may have had a larger series of emphatics. Not all dialects of Aramaic give these consonants their historic values.

Overlapping with the set of emphatics are the 'guttural' consonants. They include {{unicode|Ḥêṯ}} and {{unicode|ʽAyn}} from the emphatic set, and add {{unicode|ʼĀlap̄}} (a [[glottal stop]]) and {{unicode|Hê}} (as the English 'h').

Aramaic classically has a set of four [[sibilant consonant|sibilants]] (Ancient Aramaic may have had six):
* /s/ (as in English 'sea'),
* /z/ (as in English 'zero'),
* /{{IPA|ʃ}}/ (as in English 'ship'),
* /{{IPA|sˁ}}/ (the emphatic {{unicode|Ṣāḏê}} listed above).

In addition to these sets, Aramaic has the [[nasal consonant]]s ''m'' and ''n'', and the [[approximant consonant|approximants]] ''r'' (usually an [[alveolar trill]]), ''l'', ''y'' and ''w''.

===Historical sound changes===
Six broad features of sound change can be seen as dialect differentials:
# Vowel change — This occurs almost too frequently to document fully, but is a major distinctive feature of different dialects.
# Plosive/fricative pair reduction — Originally, Aramaic, like [[Tiberian Hebrew]], had fricatives as conditioned [[allophone]]s for each plosive.  In the wake of vowel changes, the distinction eventually became phonemic; still later, it was often lost in certain dialects.  For example, [[Turoyo language|Turoyo]] has mostly lost /p/, using /f/ instead; other dialects (for instance, standard [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]]) have lost /θ/ and /ð/ and replaced them with /t/ and /d/. In most dialects of Modern Syriac, /f/ and /v/ become /w/ after a vowel.
# Loss of emphatics — Some dialects have replaced emphatic consonants with non-emphatic counterparts, while those spoken in the [[Caucasus]] often have [[glottal consonant|glottalized]] rather than [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] emphatics.
# Guttural assimilation — This is the main feature of Samaritan pronunciation, also found in [[Samaritan Hebrew]]: all the gutturals are reduced to a simple glottal stop. Some Modern Aramaic dialects do not pronounce ''h'' in all words (the third person masculine pronoun 'hu' becomes 'ow').
# Proto-Semitic */θ/ */ð/ are reflected in Aramaic as */t/, */d/, whereas they became sibilants in Hebrew (the number three in Hebrew is 'šālôš', but '{{unicode|tlāṯ}}' in Aramaic). Dental/sibilant shifts are still happening in the modern dialects.
# New phonetic inventory — Modern dialects have borrowed sounds from the surrounding, dominant languages. The usual inventory is /{{IPA|ʒ}}/ (as the first consonant in 'azure'), /{{IPA|ʤ}}/ (as in 'jam') and /{{IPA|ʧ}}/ (as in 'church'). The [[Syriac alphabet]] has been adapted for writing these new sounds.

==Grammar==
As with other Semitic languages, Aramaic [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the way words are put together) is based on the [[triliteral]] root. The root consists of three consonants and has a basic meaning, for example, ''k-t-b'' has the meaning of 'writing'. This is then modified by the addition of vowels and other consonants to create different nuances of the basic meaning:
* ''{{unicode|Kṯāḇâ}}'', handwriting, inscription, script, book.
* ''{{unicode|Kṯāḇê}}'', the Scriptures.
* ''{{unicode|Kāṯûḇâ}}'', secretary, scribe.
* ''{{unicode|Kṯāḇeṯ}}'', I wrote.
* ''{{unicode|Eḵtûḇ}}'', I shall write.{{listen|filename=kthovo.ogg|title=Aramaic words based on the triliteral root ''k-t-b''|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Aramaic has two grammatical genders, masculine and feminine. Nouns can be either singular or plural, but an additional 'dual' number exists for nouns that usually come in pairs. The dual number gradually disappeared from Aramaic over time and has little influence in Middle and Modern Aramaic.

Aramaic nouns and adjectives can exist in one of three states; these states correspond in part to the role of cases in other languages. The 'absolute' state is the basic form of a noun (for example, ''{{unicode|kṯâḇâ}}'', 'handwriting'). The 'construct' state is a truncated form of the noun used to make possessive phrases (for example, ''{{unicode|kṯāḇaṯ malkṯâ}}'', 'the handwriting of the queen). The 'emphatic' or 'determined' state is an extended form of the noun that functions a bit like a definite article (which Aramaic lacks; for example, ''{{unicode|kṯāḇtâ}}'', 'the handwriting'). In time, the construct state began to be replaced by other possessive phrases, and the emphatic state became the norm in most dialects. Most dialects of Modern Aramaic use only the emphatic state.

The various forms of possessive phrases (for 'the handwriting of the queen') are:
# ''{{unicode|Kṯāḇaṯ malkṯâ}}'' — The oldest construction: the possessed object is in the construct state.
# ''{{unicode|Kṯāḇtâ d(î)-malkṯâ}}'' — Both words are in the emphatic state and the relative particle ''d(î)-'' is used to mark the relationship.
# ''{{unicode|Kṯāḇtāh d(î)-malkṯâ}}'' — Both words are in the emphatic state, and the relative particle is used, but the possessed is given an anticipatory, pronominal ending (literally, 'her writing, that (of) the queen').
In Modern Aramaic, the last form is by far the most common. In Biblical Aramaic, the last form is virtually absent.{{listen|filename=kthovath malktho.ogg|title=Different variations of the possessive construction in Aramaic|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}

The Aramaic verb has six 'conjugations' or stems: alterations to the verbal root that can mark the [[passive voice]] (''{{unicode|eṯkṯeḇ}}'', 'it was written'), intensive (''{{unicode|katteḇ}}'', 'he decreed (in writing)'), the extensive (''{{unicode|aḵteḇ}}'', 'he composed') or a combination of these. Aramaic also has two proper [[grammatical tense|tenses]]: the perfect and the imperfect. In Imperial Aramaic, the [[participle]] began to be used for a [[historic present]]. Perhaps under influence from other languages, Middle Aramaic developed a system of composite tenses (combinations of forms of the verb with pronouns or an [[auxiliary verb]]), allowing for narrative that is more vivid.

The syntax of Aramaic (the way sentences are put together) usually follows the order verb-subject-object (VSO).

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[New Testament]], '''Titus''', (a common Roman name, meaning ''honourable'') was a companion of [[Paul of Tarsus]], mentioned in several of [[Epistle|Paul's Epistles]]. Titus was with Paul and [[Barnabas]] at [[Antioch]] and accompanied them to the [[Council of Jerusalem]] ([[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 2:1-3; Acts 15:2), although his name nowhere occurs in the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]''. 

He appears to have been a [[Gentile]]&amp;mdash; for Paul sternly refused to have him [[History_of_male_circumcision#Male_Circumcision_in_the_Greco-Roman_World|circumcised]], perhaps because Paul possibly believed his gospel freed believers from the requirements of the [[Mosaic Law]]&amp;mdash; and to have been chiefly engaged in ministering to Gentiles. 

At a later period, Paul's Epistles place him with Paul and [[Timothy]] at [[Ephesus]], whence he was sent by Paul to [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]] for the purpose of getting the contributions of the church there in behalf of the poor  Christians at Jerusalem sent forward ([[2 Corinthians]] 8:6; 12:18). 

He rejoined the apostle when he was in [[Macedon]]ia, and cheered him with the tidings he brought from Corinth (7:6-15). After this his name is not mentioned till after Paul's first imprisonment, when we find him engaged in the organization of the church in [[Crete]], where the apostle had left him for this purpose (Paul's ''[[Epistle to Titus|Titus]]'' 1:5). 

The last notice of him is in [[2 Timothy]] 4:10, where we find him with Paul at Rome during his second imprisonment. From Rome he was sent into [[Dalmatia]], no doubt on some important missionary errand. The New Testament does not record his death.  

According to church tradition, Paul ordained Titus Bishop of [[Gortyn]] in Crete.  He died in AD [[107]] at about 95 years of age.

'''Americanization''' (or '''Americanisation''') is the term used for the influence the [[United States|United States of America]] has on the culture of other [[country|countries]], substituting their [[culture]] with [[American culture]]. When encountered unwillingly or perforce, it has a negative connotation; when sought voluntarily, it has a positive connotation. 

Americanization can also refer to the process of [[Immigration|immigrants]] to the United States becoming [[Assimilation (sociology)#Immigration|assimilated]] into American society.  This process often involves learning [[American English]] and adjusting to American culture, customs, and dress.

==Media==
In American media, the term is used negatively to describe the [[censoring]] and [[editing]] of a foreign show or movie that is brought over to U.S. stations. This editing is done to make the work more understandable to American audiences. The changes are often so drastic that very little - if any - evidence of the media's true origin remains.

In [[Hollywood]], many foreign film productions (most of them from [[Europe]] and [[Far East]]) were remade into U.S.-produced versions for American viewers, readapting the story according to the American culture. Most of the Americanized versions were filmed in American places, and with English speaking actors. Examples include ''[[Godzilla]]'', ''[[The Assassin]]'' (aka ''[[Nikita]]'') and ''[[The Ring]]''.

The song [[Amerika (single)|Amerika]] by the German rock band [[Rammstein]] is often seen as a [[satire]] of Americanization. It has received mixed reviews: some perceive it as anti-American, others as being opposed to [[globalization]]. The band views it as a satirical commentary on &quot;[[cocacolonization]]&quot;.

===Anime===
Companies that deal with Japanese [[Anime]] may Americanize the animation in order to appeal to a larger audience beyond the established fanbases made via importation of DVD's, obtaining bootlegs, or downloading [[fansubs]] from the internet. American Cartoon companies like [[4Kids Entertainment]], [[Nelvana]], [[FUNimation]], and [[TOKYOPOP]], are the more notorious examples of companies that undertake edits.  In these cases, Americanization due to translation of Japanese [[Anime]] may be minor or may result in a complete change to the piece.  

Examples of minor Americanization include simple name changes (Riceballs turned into Cookies and Doughnuts, or the name of the character Itsuki changed to Iggy).  Extreme edits include dismantling entire episodes for content and time constraints; for example, ''[[One Piece]]'' has undergone changes in the theme song and entire re-writes of story arcs. 

In many cases, Anime is Americanized because the content, which would be considered acceptable for Japanese children to view, would not be allowed for children in the USA under [[FCC]] rules.

==Trivia==
In [[Sweden]], there is a humourous expression stating that it is the most Americanized country in the world, and the USA is number two.

[[Arthur Koestler]] described Americanization as &quot;[[cocacolonization]]&quot; in his book ''[[The Lotus and the Robot]]'', referring to [[Coca-Cola]], a symbol of American culture.

The '''actinide''' series encompasses the 15 [[chemical element]]s that lie between [[actinium]] and [[lawrencium]] on the [[periodic table]] with [[atomic number]]s 89 - 103. The actinide series is named after actinium. All actinides are [[f-block]] elements except lawrencium. There are also alternative arrangements which do not include either actinium or lawrencium in the actinide series.

The actinides  display less similarity in their chemical properties than the [[lanthanide]] series, for instance exhibiting a wider range of oxidation states, which initially led to confusion as to whether actinium, thorium and uranium should be consider d-block elements. All actinides are radioactive.

Only actinium, thorium and uranium occur naturally in the earth's crust. The remaining actinides were synthesized in the 20th cenutry by techniques such as neutron bombardment. The latter half of the series possess exceedingly short  [[half-life|half-lives]]. 

The actinides are typically placed below the main body of the periodic table, in the manner of a footnote. The [[Periodic table (wide)|full-width version of the periodic table]] shows the position of the actinides more clearly.

Note that the [[IUPAC|International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)]] are currently recommending the name '''actinoid''' rather than actinide, as the suffix &quot;-ide&quot; is generally used to indicate [[anions]].

'''Arthur Asher Miller''' ([[October 17]], [[1915]] – [[February 10]], [[2005]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[playwright]], [[essayist]] and [[author]]. He was a prominent figure in [[American literature]] and [[film|cinema]] for over 61 years, writing a wide variety of [[play]]s. Miller's best-known works were ''[[The Crucible]]'', After the Fall (which won the 1947 Tony Award for best play),  and ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'', which are still widely studied and performed worldwide . He was also known for his short-lived marriage to [[Marilyn Monroe]] (1956-1961), who converted to [[Judaism]] for him. 

==Biography==
Miller was born into a moderately-wealthy [[Jewish]] family in New York. His father was a clothing manufacturer. His mother was a housewife. His sister, Joan became an actress known as [[Joan Copeland]] and has appeared in some of her brother's plays. 

Miller attended P.S. 24 in Harlem from 1920 to 1928, and saw his first play (a [[melodrama]]) in 1923 at the Shubert Theatre. At Abraham Lincoln High School near [[Coney Island]], in [[Brooklyn, New York]], Miller was a talented athlete and mediocre student. He was rejected by both the [[University of Michigan]] and suffered a great deal of [[anti-Semitism]], which would influence his later works. Miller put $13 of every $15 pay check he earned into a college fund and reapplied to the University of Michigan, where he was accepted in 1934.

At Michigan, Miller studied journalism and drama, becoming particularly interested in [[Greek theater|ancient Greek drama]] and the dramas of [[Henrik Ibsen]]. During [[spring break]] in 1936 (his sophomore year), he wrote his first work, ''[[No Villain]]'' (reportedly because of a contest offering a $250 prize, which [[Hopwood Award|Avery Hopwood Award]], the first of two he received. Miller retained strong ties to his alma mater throughout the rest of his life, establishing the Arthur Miller Award in 1985 and Arthur Miller Award for Dramatic Writing in 1999, and lending his name to the Arthur Miller Theatre in the forthcoming In 1938, Miller received his [[bachelor's degree]] in English. In 1940, he married his college sweetheart, Mary Slattery (with whom he had two children, Jane and Robert). He was exempted from military service during [[World War II]] because of a [[American football|football]] injury.

Miller rose to prominence with ''[[All My Sons]]'' in 1947.  His 1949 play ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] and three [[Tony Awards]], as well as the [[New York Drama Critics Circle Award]]. It was the first play ever to win all three.  ''[[The Crucible]]'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on [[January 22]], [[1953]]. In 1956, he divorced his wife. In June of the same year, he appeared before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], and at the end of the month on [[June 29]], he married [[Marilyn Monroe]], whom he had met eight years earlier through [[Elia Kazan]]. Monroe [[List of converts to Judaism|converted to Judaism]] .

On [[May 31]], [[1957]], Miller was found guilty of [[contempt of Congress]] for refusing to reveal the names of members of a literary circle suspected of Communist affiliation. His conviction was reversed [[August 7]], [[1958]], by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The same year, he published ''Collected Plays''.

On [[January 24]], [[1961]], Monroe was granted a divorce two months after Miller left her for  [[Inge Morath]], whom he married on [[February 17]], [[1962]]. They had met when she and other photographers from the [[Magnum Photos]] agency documented the making of ''The Misfits''. They had two children, Rebecca, born that September, and Daniel. According to biographer [[Martin Gottfried]], Daniel was born with [[Down syndrome|Down Syndrome]]. Miller placed Daniel in an institution in [[Roxbury, Connecticut]], and never visited him. Miller doesn't mention Daniel in ''Timebends'', his 1987 autobiography, and the issue was ignored in the ''[[New York Times] language|Italian]]''' || mese || nuovo || madre || notte || naso || tre || nero || rosso || giallo || verde

Note: How close &quot;red&quot; and &quot;black&quot; are to Welsh, a Celtic language.

Note: The roots for &quot;yellow&quot; and &quot;green&quot; are very similar to the Romanian for &quot;green&quot; and &quot;yellow&quot;. Does this show a similarity with Latin or with other languages of the [[Balkans]] such as [[Dacian language|Dacian]]? The separation must have occured when &quot;green&quot; and &quot;yellow&quot; were not considered distinct colours much as we consider both &quot;turquoise&quot; (cyan) and &quot;indigo&quot; (primary blue) to be &quot;blue&quot;.

==Geographic distribution==
[[Image:Albanian language map.jpg|thumb|300px|Albanian distribution and dialects]]
Albanian is spoken by about 6 million people mainly in [[Albania]] and [[Kosovo]] but also in many other countries, including the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Belgium]], [[Egypt]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Sweden]], [[Turkey]] ([[Europe]]), [[Ukraine]], the [[UK]] and USA.

===Official status===
Albanian in the [[Tosk]] dialect is the [[official language]] of the [[Republic of Albania]]. Albanian is also one of the official languages of [[Kosovo]], Montenegro, and the [[Republic of Macedonia]]

===Dialects===
There are two principal [[dialects]], [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]] (Toskërishte) and [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]] (Gegërishte), which have been diverging for at least a millennium, and their less extreme forms are mutually intelligible. A subgroup of dialects deriving from Tosk are spoken by descendants of [[15th century|15th]] and [[16th century]] immigrants in southeastern [[Italy]], in small communities in the provinces of [[Sicily]], [[Calabria]], [[Basilicata]], [[Campania]], [[Molise]], [[Abruzzi]], and [[Puglia]], is called [[Arbëreshë]], and a further group of varying intelligibility dialects, are spoken in [[Greece]], by descendents of [[Orthodox Christian]] [[13th century|13th]] and [[15th century]] immigrants in [[Attica]], [[Boeotia]], southern [[Evia]], the island of [[Salamina]], in the [[Epirus]] region and in [[Athens]]. The geographical border between the two dialect groups spoken within Albania proper, has traditionally been the [[Shkumbin River]] in Albania, with Gheg being spoken north of the river, and Tosk south of the river. The two dialects have [[phonology|phonological]] as well as [[lexicon|lexicological]] differences.

Tosk is furthermore divided into many mutually intelligible sub-dialects, which either belong to the ''Labërishte'' sub-group or the ''Çamërishte'' sub-group, including north-western Greece, but not to be confused with the [[Arvanites]]. This dialect is spoken by most members of the large Albanian immigrant communities that have recently arrived in these two countries, and in smaller Albanian communities in [[Ukraine]], [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]], and [[United States]].

Gheg (or Geg) is divided into many mutually intelligible sub-dialects, which either belong to the Northern Gheg sub-group or the Southern-Gheg sub-group, the traditional border between the two being the [[Mati River]] in northern [[Albania]]. This dialect is spoken in northern Albania and by the Albanians of [[Serbia and Montenegro]] (Southern Montenegro and Southern Serbia), the UN protectorate of [[Kosovo]], as well as those of the [[Republic of Macedonia]].

Since after [[World War II]] there have been efforts to create a ''Standard'' or ''Literary'' Albanian that borrows most heavily from the Tosk dialect (at the behest of the dictator [[Enver Hoxha]], himself a Tosk speaker). The Congress on the Orthography of Albanian, held in 1972 with the additional participation of delegates from the Yugoslav territories of Kosovo, Macedonia and Montenegro and Calabria (Italy), established a unified literary language. The resulting orthographic rules were codified in such tomes as ''Drejtshkrimi i gjuhës shqipe (1973)'' (The Orthography of the Albanian Language) and ''Fjalori drejtshkrimor i gjuhës shqipe (1976)'' (The Orthographic Dictionary of the Albanian Language).

(ˆ) denotes [[nasal vowel]]s, which are a common feature of Gheg.

==Sounds==
Albanian has 7 [[vowel]]s and 29 [[consonant]]s. [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]] has a set of [[nasal vowel]]s which are absent in [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]]. Another peculiarity is the mid-central vowel &quot;ë&quot; reduced at the end of the word. Two dental fricatives exist (/{{IPA|ð}}/ and /{{IPA|θ}}/) and the sounds r and l can be weak or strong. The original [[Indo-European]] phonetic system was destroyed in Albanian after diphthongs disappeared, and unstressed vowels were dropped. The stress is fixed mainly on the penultimate syllable.

'''Notes:'''
*The affricates are pronounced as one sound (a stop and a fricative at the same point).
*The palatal stops ''q'' and ''gj'' are completely unknown to English, so the pronunciation guide is approximate. Palatal stops can be found in other European languages, for example, in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (where these sounds are spelt ''ty'' and ''gy'' respectively).
*The palatal nasal ''nj'' corresponds to the sound of the Spanish ''ñ'' or the French or Italian digraph ''gn'' (as in ''gnocchi''). It is pronounced as one sound, not a nasal plus a glide.
*The ''ll'' sound is a velarised lateral, close to English &quot;[[dark L]]&quot;.
*The contrast between flapped ''r'' and trilled ''rr'' is the same as in Spanish. English does not have any of the two sounds phonemically (but ''tt'' in ''butter'' is pronounced as a flap ''r'' in  most American dialects).
*(1) The letter ''ç'' can be spelt ''ch'' on American English keyboards, both due to its English sound, but more importantly, due to analogy with Albanian ''xh, sh, zh.'' (Usually, however, it's spelt simply ''c'', which may cause confusion; however, meanings are usually understood).

==Grammar==
Albanian [[noun]]s are [[inflection|inflected]] by [[Grammatical gender|gender]] ([[masculine]], [[feminine]] and [[neuter]]) and [[Grammatical number|number]] ([[singular]] and [[plural]]). There are 4 [[declension]]s with 5 cases ([[nominative]], [[dative]], [[accusative]], [[ablative]] and [[vocative]]), although the vocative only occurs with a limited number of words. The cases apply to both definite and indefinite nouns and there are numerous cases of [[syncretism]]. The equivalent of a [[genitive]] is formed by using the prepositions ''i/e/të/së'' with the dative. 

The following shows the declension of the masculine noun ''mal'' (mountain):

The article can be posited either before or after the noun as in many other [[Balkan languages]], for example [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]].

* The definite article can be in the form of noun suffixes, which vary with gender and case. 
** For example in singular nominative, masculine nouns add ''-i'' or ''-u'': 
*** ''mal'' (mountain) / ''mali'' (the mountain); 
*** ''libër'' (book) / ''libri'' (the book); 
*** ''zog'' (bird) / ''zogu'' (the bird). 
** Feminine nouns take the suffix ''-(j)a'': 
*** ''veturë'' (car) / ''vetura'' (the car); 
*** ''shtëpi'' (house) / ''shtëpia'' (the house); 
*** ''lule'' (flower) / ''lulja'' (the flower). 
* Neuter nouns take ''-t''.

Albanian develops an analytical structure of the [[verb]]. Its complex system of [[mood]]s (6 types) and [[tense]]s (3 simple and 5 complex constructions) is distinguishing among other [[Balkan languages]]. There are two general types of [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]]. In Albanian the Constituent Order is [[Subject Verb Object]] and negation is expressed by the particles ''nuk'' or ''s''' in front of the verb, for example: 
* ''Toni nuk flet anglisht'' &quot;Tony doesn't speak English&quot;; 
* ''s'di'' &quot;don't know&quot;. 
In imperative sentences, the particle ''mos'' is used: 
* ''mos harro'' &quot;do not forget!&quot;.

==Vocabulary==
There are Albanian words which have cognates (of non-Latin origin) in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and there is a theory that the language spoken by the [[Dacia]]ns before the Romanization was a language related to proto-Albanian.

Although there's no documentation on the Albanian language prior to the 15th century AD, it is widely assumed that [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Balkan Latin]] (which was the ancestor of Romanian and other Balkan Romance languages), would exert a great influence on Albanian. Examples of words borrowed from Latin: ''qytet &lt; civitas'' (city), ''qiell &lt; caelum'' (sky), ''mik &lt; amicus'' (friend).

After the [[Slavs]] arrived in the [[Balkans]], another source of Albanian vocabulary were the [[Slavic languages]], especially [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]. The rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]] meant an influx of [[Turkish language|Turkish]] words; this also entailed the borrowing of Persian and Arabic words through Turkish. Some loanwords from Modern Greek also exist especially in the south of Albania. Also due to the large population of [[Roma people|Roma Gypsies]] in Albania words such as &quot;jaan&quot; or &quot;xhan&quot;  in Albanian and [[Hindi]] mean the same thing which literally translates as &quot;my life&quot; or &quot;my soul&quot; but is also used to refer to a beloved one as &quot;darling&quot;

==Writing system==
:''Full article: [[Albanian alphabet]]''
Albanian has been written with many different alphabets since the 15th century. Originally, the Tosk dialect was written with the [[Greek alphabet]] and the Gheg dialect was written with the [[Latin alphabet]]. They have both also been written with the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] version of the [[Arabic alphabet]], the [[Cyrillic alphabet]], and some local alphabets.

The modern [[Albanian alphabet]] was standardised in [[1909]], and is based on the [[Latin alphabet]], with the addition of the letters ''ë'', ''ç'', and nine [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s.

==History==
The place where the ancestors of today's Albanians lived in ancient Balkans is still uncertain, but they are usually identified with the ancient [[Illyrians]] or [[Thracians]]. The common vocabulary with Romanian suggests that the ancestors of the Albanians and Romanians lived close to each other in ancient times. Some scholars support a &quot;theory of continuity&quot;, which says that the Albanians lived in the territory of current Albania. However, the low number of [[Doric Greek]] words and the high number of Latin borrowings suggests that the Albanians have lived well north of the [[Jirecek Line]], which divided the spheres of influence of Latin and Greek languages.

The oldest surviving document written in Albanian is &quot;Formula e Pagëzimit&quot; (Baptismal formula), written in [[1462]] in the Gheg dialect, and some [[New Testament]] verses from that period.

The oldest known Albanian printed book, ''[[Meshari]]'' [http://www.albanianliterature.com/html/authors/prose/buzuku.html] or missal, was written by [[Gjon Buzuku]], a [[Catholic]] cleric, in [[1555]]. The first Albanian school is believed to have been opened by [[Franciscan]]s in [[1638]] in [[Pdhanë]]. In [[1635]], [[Frang Bardhi]] wrote the first Latin-Albanian dictionary.

{{Linguistic typology topics}}
An '''agglutinative language''' is a [[language]] in which the [[word]]s are formed by joining [[morpheme]]s together. This term was introduced by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] in [[1836]] to classify languages from a [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] point of view. It was derived from the [[Latin]] verb ''agglutinare'', which means &quot;to glue together.&quot;

An agglutinative language is a form of [[synthetic language]] where each [[affix]] typically represents one unit of meaning (such as &quot;diminutive&quot;, &quot;past tense&quot;, &quot;plural&quot;, etc.), and bound morphemes are expressed by affixes (and not by internal changes of the root of the word, or changes in stress or tone). Besides, and most importantly, in an agglutinative language affixes do not become fused with others, and do not change form conditioned by others. 

Synthetic languages which are not agglutinative are called [[fusional language]]s; they sometimes combine affixes by &quot;squeezing&quot; them together, often changing them drastically in the process, and joining several meanings in one affix (for example, in the Spanish word '''comí''' ''I ate'', the suffix -'''í''' carries the meanings of indicative [[grammatical mood|mood]], past [[grammatical tense|tense]], first person singular [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and perfect [[grammatical aspect|aspect]]).

''Agglutinative'' is sometimes used as a synonym for [[synthetic language|synthetic]], although it technically is not. When used in this way, the word embraces [[fusional language]]s and [[inflected language]]s in general. The distinction between an agglutinative and a fusional language is often not sharp. Rather, one should think of these as two ends of a continuum, with various languages falling more toward one end or the other. In fact, a synthetic language may present agglutinative features in its open lexicon but not in its case system: for example, [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]].

Agglutinative languages tend to have a high rate of affixes/morphemes per word, and to be very regular. For example, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] has only three irregular verbs (and not ''very'' irregular), [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] only two. [[Georgian language|Georgian]] is an exception; not only is it highly agglutinative (there can be simultaneously up to 8 morphemes per word), but there are also significant number of irregular verbs, varying in degrees of irregularity.

==Examples of agglutinative languages==
Examples of agglutinative languages are the [[Altaic languages]] (see [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), [[Basque language|Basque]], the [[Dravidian languages]], the [[Uralic languages]], [[Inuktitut]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Malay language|Malay]], the [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast]], [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest]] and [[South Caucasian languages|South Caucasian]] languages, and some [[Mesoamerican languages|Mesoamerican]] and native North American languages including [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]], [[Huastec#Huastec language|Huastec]], and [[Salishan languages|Salish]]. In the past, most of the [[Ancient Near East]] and what is now [[Iran]] also spoke such languages, like [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Elamite language|Elamite]], [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]], [[Urartian language|Urartian]], [[Hattic language|Hattic]], [[Gutian]], [[Lullubi]], [[Punjabi]] and [[Kassites#Kassite language|Kassite]]. An example of an agglutinative [[constructed language]] is [[Klingon (language)|Klingon]].

Agglutinative languages are not entirely grouped by the family (although [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] are definitely related, as are, it is often posited, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]]). It is possible that [[convergent evolution]] had many separate languages develop this property, but there seems to exist a preferred evolutionary direction from agglutinative synthetic languages to fusional synthetic languages, and then to non-synthetic languages, which in their turn evolve again into agglutinative synthetic languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Athanasius of Alexandria''' (also spelled &quot;Athanasios&quot;) ([[298]]&amp;ndash;[[May 2]], [[373]]) was a [[Christianity|Christian]] bishop, the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], in the fourth century. He is revered as a [[saint]] by both the [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], and regarded as a great leader and doctor of the Church by [[Protestantism|Protestants]].  Roman Catholics have declared him one of 33 [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]]. His feast day is [[January 18]].


==Historical significance==
===Opposition to Arianism===
[[Image:Stathanasius.jpg|thumb|[[Copt|Coptic]] Icon of St Athanasius]] In about [[319]], when Athanasius was a [[deacon]], a [[presbyter]] named [[Arius]] began teaching that there was a time before [[God]] the Father begat [[Jesus]] when the latter did not exist. Athanasius accompanied [[Alexander of Alexandria|Alexander]] to the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in [[325]], which council produced the [[Nicene Creed]] and anathematized Arius and his followers. On [[May 9]], [[328]], he succeeded [[Alexander of Alexandria|Alexander]] as bishop of [[Alexandria]]. As a result of rises and falls in Arianism's influence, he was banished from Alexandria only to be later restored on at least five separate occasions, perhaps as many as seven. This gave rise to the expression &quot;Athanasius contra mundum&quot; or &quot;Athanasius against the world&quot;. During some of his exiles, he spent time with the [[Desert Father]]s, monks and hermits who lived in remote areas of Egypt. Despite his doctrinal firmness, he showed diplomatic flair in rallying the Orthodox at the Council of Alexandria in 362.

===Writings===
Possibly during his first exile at Trier in 335-7, although probably between 318 and 323, Athanasius wrote a double treatise entitled ''Against the Gentiles -- On the Incarnation'', affirming and explaining that [[Jesus]] was both God and Man. In his major theological opus, the ''Three Discourses Against the Arians'', Athanasius stressed that the Father's begetting of the Son, or uttering of the Word, was an eternal relationship between them, not an event that took place within time. He makes very sparing use of the key-word of Nicea, [[ousios|homoousios]] (consubstantial). These writings lay the foundation of catholic [[Christianity]]'s fight against the [[heresy]] of [[Arianism]], which Athanasius opposed all his life. He also wrote a defence of the divinity of the [[Holy Spirit]] (''Letters to Serapion'') in the 360s, and wrote a polemic (''On the Holy Spirit'') against the [[Macedonians (religious group)|Macedonian heresy]].

Athanasius also wrote a biography of [[Anthony the Great]] entitled ''Vita Antonii'', or ''Life of Antony'', that later served as an inspiration to Christian [[monasticism|monastics]] in both the East and the West. The [[Athanasian Creed]] is traditionally ascribed to him.

===New Testament canon===
Athanasius is also the first person to identify the same 27 books of the [[New Testament]] that are in use today.  Up until then, various similar lists of works to be read in churches were in use. A milestone in the evolution of the [[Biblical canon|canon of New Testament books]] is his Easter letter from Alexandria, written in [[367]], usually referred to as his ''39th Festal Letter''.  [[Pope Damasus]], the [[Bishop of Rome]] in [[382]], promulgated a list of books which contained a New Testament canon identical to that of Athanasius.  A synod in [[Hippone]] in [[393]] repeated Athansius' and Damasus' New Testament list (without the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]]), and a synod in [[Carthage]] in [[397]] repeated Athanasius' and Damasus' complete New Testament list.

Scholars have debated whether Athanasius' list in 367 was the basis for the later lists.  Because Athanasius' canon is the closest canon of any of the Church Fathers to the canon used by Protestant churches today many Protestants point to Athanasius as the father of the canon. They are identical except that Athanasius excludes the [[Book of Esther]] which is placed in a [[Deuterocanonical books|deuterocanon]] along with the [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom of Solomon]], [[Ben Sira|Sirach (Ecclesiasticus)]], [[Book of Judith|Judith]], [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]], the [[Didache]], and the [[The Shepherd of Hermas|Shepherd of Hermas]]. On the other hand, Catholics tend to point to Damasus or the Council of Carthage, since these councils endorsed an Old Testament identical to that used by Catholics today.  Regardless of this question, the New Testament canon endorsed by Athanasius has been used by almost all Christians since his day.

===Relics and veneration===
[[Image:StAthanasiusShrineinStMarkCathedralCairo.jpg|thumb|St. Athanasius Shrine (where the saint's relics are preserved) under St. Mark's Cathedral, Cairo]] The saint was originally buried in Alexandria. His holy body was later transferred to Italy. H.H. [[Pope]] [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria|Shenouda III]] restored the relics of St. Athanasius back to Egypt on 15 May 1973 [http://www.avarewase.org/en/map/athanas.htm], after his historical visit to the Vatican and meeting with H.H. [[Pope Paul VI]]. The relics of St. Athanasius the Great of Alexandria are currently preserved under the new St. [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]] [[Copt|Coptic]] Orthodox Cathedral in Deir El-Anba Rowais, Abbassiya, Cairo, Egypt.

The following is a [[troparion]] (hymn) to St. Athanasius sung in some Orthodox churches.
: ''O holy father Athanasius,'' 
: ''like a pillar of orthodoxy'' 
: ''you refuted the heretical nonsense of Arius''
: ''by insisting that the Father and the Son are equal in essence.''
: ''O venerable father, beg Christ our God to save our souls.''

==Criticism of Athanasius==
The tactics of Athanasius, while often downplayed by church historians, were a significant factor in his success. He did not hesitate to back up his theological views with the use of force. In Alexandria, he assembled an &quot;ecclesiastical mafia&quot; that could instigate a riot in the city if needed.  It was an arrangement &quot;built up and perpetuated by violence.&quot; (Barnes, 230). Along with the standard method of excommunication he used beatings, intimidation, kidnapping and imprisonment to silence his  theological opponents. Unsurprisingly, these tactics caused widespread distrust and led him to being tried many times for &quot;bribery, theft, extortion, [[sacrilege]], treason and murder. (Rubenstein, 6) While the charges rarely stuck, his reputation was a major factor in his multiple exiles from Alexandria.

He justified these tactics with the argument that he was saving all future Christians from hell. Athanasius stubbornly refused to compromise his theological views by stating, &quot;What is at stake is not just a theological theory but people's salvation.&quot;  (Olson, 172).  In this assertion that violence was justified in defense of theology and the church, Athanasius, some hold, laid the foundation for theological concepts such as [[just war]] and [[inquisition|the inquisition]]. He played a clear role in making [[constantinian shift]] a part of the theology of the church.

The '''Azores''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: '''''Açores''''', [[Pronunciation|pron.]] [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] /{{IPA|ɐ.'so.ɾɨʃ}}/ or /{{IPA|ɐ.'so.ɾʃ}}/) are an [[archipelago]] of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[island]]s in the middle of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], about 1,500 km from [[Lisbon]] and about 3,900 km from the east coast of [[North America]].

The nine Azorean Islands extend for more than 600 km, and lie in a northwest-southeast direction. The vast extension of the islands defines an immense [[Exclusive Economic Zone|exclusive economic zone]] of 1.1 million km². The westernmost point of this area is 3,380 km from the North American continent. All of the islands have volcanic origins, though Santa Maria also has some reef contribution. The mountain of Pico on [[Pico Island]], at 2,351 m in altitude, is the highest in all of Portugal.  The Azores are actually the tops of some of the tallest mountains on the planet, as measured from their base at the bottom of the ocean. The islands are an [[autonomous region]] of [[Portugal]]. 

Though it is commonly said that the archipelago is named after the [[goshawk]] (''Açor'' in Portuguese), because it was supposed to be a common bird at the time of the discovery, it actually never existed on the islands. Some historians indicate the archaic Portuguese word &quot;azures&quot; (the plural of blue) because of the colour of the islands when seen from afar. Most, however, insist that the name is derived from birds, pointing to a local subspecies of the [[common buzzard|buzzard]] (''Buteo buteo''), as the animal the first explorers erroneously identified as goshawks.

== History ==
[[image:Azores old map.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Old map of Azores Islands]]
In [[1427]], one of the captains sailing for [[Henry the Navigator]] discovered the Azores, p'''ossibl'''y [[Gonçalo Velho]], but this is not certain. The [[colonization]] of the then-unoccupied islands started in [[1439]] with people mainly from the continental provinces of [[Algarve]] and [[Alentejo]]; in the following centuries settlers from other European countries arrived, most notably from Northern [[France]] and the [[Flanders]]. In [[1583]], [[Philip II of Spain]] as king of Portugal, sent his combined Iberian fleet to clear the French traders from the Azores, decisively hanging his [[prisoners-of-war]] from the yardarms and contributing to the &quot;[[Black Legend]]&quot;. The Azores were the second-to-last part of the Portuguese empire to resist Philip's reign over Portugal ([[Macau]] being the last).

The [[1820]] civil war, in Portugal, had strong repercussion in the Azores. In [[1829]], in [[Vila da Praia]], the [[liberalism|liberal]]s won over the [[Political absolutism|absolutists]], making [[Terceira Island]] the main headquarters of the new Portuguese regime and also where the Council of Regency (''Conselho de Regência'') of [[Mary II of Portugal]] was established.

Beginning in [[1868]], [[Portugal]] issued its stamps overprinted with &quot;AÇORES&quot; for use in the islands. Between [[1892]] and [[1906]], it also issued separate stamps for the three administrative districts of the time.

From [[1938]] to [[1978]], the archipelago was divided into three districts, quite equivalent (except in area) to those in the Portuguese mainland. The division was quite arbitrary, and didn’t follow the natural island groups, rather reflecting the location of each district capital on the three main cities (neither of each on the western group).

'''Angra''' consisted of Terceira, São Jorge, and Graciosa, with the capital at [[Angra do Heroísmo]] on Terceira.

'''Horta''' consisted of Pico, Faial, Flores, and Corvo, with the capital at [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]] on Faial.

'''Ponta Delgada''' consisted of São Miguel and Santa Maria, with the capital at [[Ponta Delgada]] on São Miguel.

In [[1976]] the Azores became an Autonomous Region (Região Autónoma dos Açores) and the Azorean districts were suppressed.

== Politics ==
Since becoming a Portuguese Autonomous Region, the executive section of the local authority has been located in Ponta Delgada, the legislative in Horta and the judicial in Angra do Heroísmo. The President of the Regional Government is [[Carlos César]].  The Azores is considered to have one of the most uncorrupt government bodies in the world today.

== Municipalities  ==
[[Image:Pasture fields in The Azores.jpg|thumb|Pasture fields in The Azores]]
The Azores are divided into 19 municipalities (''concelhos''); each municipality is further divided into parishes (''freguesias''). The Azores have a total of 156 parishes.

There are also 5 cities: [[Ponta Delgada]] and [[Ribeira Grande]] on São Miguel Island; [[Angra do Heroísmo]] and [[Praia da Vitória]] on Terceira, and [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]] on Faial.

The [[archipelago]] is spread out in the area of the [[Circle of latitude|parallel]] that passes through Lisbon (39º, 43'/39º, 55' North Latitude), giving it a moderate climate, with mild annual oscillation. The Azores lie in the [[Palearctic ecozone]], forming a unique [[biome]] among the world's [[Temperate broadl language, known only from loan-words found in the [[Mitanni]] language.

To prevent confusion because of its several meanings, the term is often avoided today in the Western World. It has been replaced by the well-defined ''Proto-Indo-European'', ''Proto-Indo-Iranian'', ''Indo-Iranian'', ''Iranian'' or ''Indo-Aryan'' terms. 

==Proto-Indo-European==

[[Max Müller]] and other [[19th century]] linguists (see also [[Indo-European studies]]) theorised that the term ''*arya'' was used as the self-description of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]].

The nomadic Iranians of the north western steppes, however, especially those settled in Europe, are extensively covered by the classical writers; they are also attested in a very large number of archaeological excavations in Eastern Europe; these Iranian peoples are known in the West as Cimmerians, Scythians, Sarmatians, Alans, and finally Ossets; it must be emphasised that all these names refer to the successive migratory waves of the same people, who probably called themselves by a name derived from the word Airya, as the Alans did, and the Ossets still do.

==Indo-European==

In the 19th century the term &quot;Aryan&quot; was used as shorthand for &quot;Indo-European&quot;, even though many of the writers who adopted this usage accepted that it was not strictly accurate, given that the term was unattested in western branches of the languages. Because of [[ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] arguments about connections between peoples and cultural values, &quot;Aryan&quot; peoples were often considered to be distinct from [[Semitic]] peoples. By the end of the nineteenth century this usage was so common that &quot;Aryan&quot; was often used as a [[synonym]] for &quot;[[gentile]]&quot;. This usage was particularly common in Germany. Among [[White supremacists]] the term still sometimes functions as a synonym for non-Jewish &quot;white person&quot;.

==Racist connotations==
{{main|Aryan race}}

The '''Aryan race''' was a term used in the nineteenth century by European racial theorists who believed strongly in the division of humanity into biologically distinct races with differing characteristics. Such writers took the view that the Proto-Indo-Europeans consituted a specific race that had expanded across Europe, Iran and India. This meaning was, and still is, common in theories of racial superiority which were embraced by [[Nazi]] Germany. This usage tends to merge the Avestan/Sanskrit meaning of &quot;noble&quot; or &quot;elevated&quot; with the idea of distinctive ancestral ethnicity marked by language distribution. In this interpretation, the Aryan Race is ''both'' the highest representative of mankind and the purest descendent of the Proto-Indo-European population.

From the 1880s a number of writers had argued that the Proto-Indo-Europeans had been of &quot;Nordic&quot; race. This idea was taken up by the Nazis. According to [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s ideology the &quot;[[Nordic theory|Aryan-Nordic&quot;]] (''arisch-nordisch'') or &quot;Nordic-Atlantean&quot; (''nordisch-atlantisch'') race was thus a [[master race]], at the top of a racial hierarchy, pitted against a &quot;[[Jewish]]-[[Semitic]]&quot; (''jüdisch-semitisch'') race, deemed to be a racial threat to Germany's homogeneous Aryan civilization, thus rationalizing Nazi [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]]. Nazism portrayed their interpretation of an &quot;Aryan race&quot; as the only race capable of, or with an interest in, creating and maintaining culture and civilizations, while other races are merely capable of conversion, or destruction of culture. These arguments derived from late nineteenth century racial hierarchies. Some Nazis were also influenced by [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]]'s ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' ([[1888]]) where she postulates &quot;Aryans&quot; as the fifth of her &quot;[[Root Race]]s&quot;, dating them to about a million years ago, tracing them to [[Atlantis]], an idea also repeated by Rosenberg, and held as doctrine by the [[Thule Society]]. Such theories were used to justify the introduction of the so-called [[Nuremberg laws|&quot;Aryan laws&quot;]] by the Nazis, depriving &quot;non-Aryans&quot; of citizenship and employment rights, and prohibiting marriage between Aryans and non-Aryans. Though [[Mussolini]]'s [[fascism]] was not originally characterised by explicit anti-Semitism, he too eventually introduced laws pressed upon him by Hitler, prohibiting mixed-race marriages between &quot;Aryans&quot; and Jews.

Because of historical [[racism|racist]] use of ''Aryan'', and especially use of ''Aryan race'' in connection with the [[mythology|myths]] and [[propaganda]] of [[Nazism]], the word is sometimes avoided in the West as being tainted, in the same manner as the [[swastika]] symbol.
In the English language, the use of the word &quot;Aryan&quot; when referring to an ethnic group or race (or even a linguistic group) is no longer in technical use and is sometimes considered unacceptable because of the Nazi associations. In India the term continues to be used. [http://www.bartleby.com/61/99/A0449900.html] 

According to Michael Witzel in his paper ''Autochthonous Aryans? The Evidence from Old Indian and Iranian Texts'', &quot;the use of the word Arya or Aryan to designate the speakers of all Indo-European (IE) languages or as the designation of a particular ''race'' is an aberration of many writers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries and should be avoided.&quot; [http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/EJVS-7-3.pdf]

'''Agar''' is a [[galactose]] [[polymer]] (or [[agarose]]) obtained from the [[cell wall]]s of some species of [[red alga]]e or [[seaweed]] ([[Sphaerococcus euchema]]) and species of [[Gelidium]] and [[Gracilaria]], chiefly from eastern [[Asia]], [[Chile]] and [[California]]. It is also known as Kanten, Agar-Agar, or Agal-Agal (Ceylon Agar).

Chemically, agar is a polymer made up of subunits of the sugar [[galactose]]; it is a component of the algae's cell walls. Dissolved in hot water and cooled, agar becomes [[gelatin]]ous; its chief use is as a culture medium for [[microbiology|microbiological]] work. Other uses are as a [[laxative]], a [[vegetarian]] [[gelatin]] substitute &amp;mdash; a thickener for soups, in [[jelly|jellies]], [[ice cream]] and [[Japan|Japanese]] desserts such as [[anmitsu]], as a clarifying agent in [[brewing]], and for [[sizing|paper sizing]] fabrics.

==Uses in cooking==
Agar-agar is typically sold as packaged strips of washed and dried seaweed, or in powdered form. Raw agar is white and semi-translucent. For making jelly, it is boiled in water at a concentration of about 0.7-1% [[Concentrations#Mass-volume_percentage|w/v]] (e.g. a 7 [[gram]] packet of powder into 1 [[litre]] of water would be 0.7%) until the solids dissolve, after which sweeteners, flavouring, colouring, and pieces of fruit may be added. The agar-agar may then be poured into [[molding (process)|molds]] or incorporated into other desserts, such as a jelly layer on a [[cake]].

One of the latest fad diets in Asia is the Kanten Diet.  Once ingested, kanten triples in size and absorbs water.  This results in the consumer feeling more full.  Recently this diet has received some press coverage in the United States as well.  The diet has shown promise in obesity studies, but it should be noted that agar/kanten has virtually no nutritional value.  It is approximately 80% fiber, so part of the diet's effectiveness may be a result of it working as a laxative.

==Uses in microbiology==
:''Main article: [[Agar plate]]''

Nutrient agar is used throughout the world as a medium for the growth of [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]], but not [[virus]]es (however, viruses are often grown in bacteria that are growing on agar). Though less than 1% of all existing bacteria can be grown successfully, the basic agar formula can be used to grow most of the [[microbe]]s, whose needs are known. More specific nutrient agars are available, because microbes can be picky. For example, blood agar, which is generally combined with horse blood, can be used to detect the presence of haemorrhagic micro-organisms such as E.coli O:157 H:7. The bacteria digest the blood, turning the plate clear.

Agarose is also used in Agarose [[gel electrophoresis]].

===Selective Media===
Selective media is agar specially treated to apply a selective pressure to organisms growing on it -- for example, to select for salt-tolerant, gram-positive, or gram-negative bacteria.

===Differential Media===
Differential media includes an indicator that causes visible, easily detectable changes in the appearance of the agar gel or bacterial colonies in a specific group of bacteria.  For example, EMB (Eosin Methylene Blue) agar causes E. Coli colonies to have a metallic green sheen, and MSA (Mannitol Salt Agar) turns yellow in the presence of mannitol fermenting bacteria.

A famous scientist once used agar in world war II to cure infected wounds in battle.

==Hysteresis==
[[Hysteresis]] describes the phenomenon of the differing liquid-solid state [[melting temperature|transition temperatures]] that agar exhibits.  Agar melts at 85 °C and solidifies from 32-40 °C.

Dissolved carbon dioxide dissociates to form weak [[carbonic acid]] giving a pH of approximately 5.6 at typical atmospheric concentrations of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Seinfeld and Pandis, 1998). Therefore a pH of &lt;5.6 has sometimes been used as a definition of acid rain [http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/glossary.php]. However, natural sources of acidity mean that in remote areas rain has a pH which is between 4.5 and 5.6 with an average value of 5.0 and so rain with a pH &lt;5 is a more appropriate definition [http://www.enviroliteracy.org/article.php/2.html]. 

Acid rain is formed by the [[oxidation]] of [[sulfur]] and [[nitrogen]] containing compounds which have emissions of both natural and human origin. This oxidation occurs in both the [[Gas_phase#Example_1:_Solid.2C_liquid.2C_and_gas_phases|gas phase]] and in [[rain]]drops to produce [[sulfuric acid]] and [[nitric acid]].

The resulting increased acidity in [[soil]] and [[waterway]]s has proven to be harmful to [[fish]] and [[vegetation]]. Acid rain also accelerates [[weathering]] in [[carbonate rocks]] and accelerates [[building weathering]]. It also contributes to acidic [[rivers]], [[streams]], and damage to [[trees]] at high elevation. Efforts to combat this phenomenon are ongoing.

&quot;Acid rain&quot; is sometimes used more generally to include all forms of acid deposition - both wet deposition, where acidic gases and particles are removed by rain or other [[precipitation]], and the deposition of gases and particles to the Earth's surface in the absence of precipitation.

==History and trends==

Acid rain was first reported in [[Manchester]], [[England]], which was an important city during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. In 1852, [[Robert Angus Smith]] found the relationship between acid rain and atmospheric pollution. The term &quot;acid rain&quot; was used for the first time by him in 1872 (Seinfeld and Pandis, 1998).

Though acid rain was discovered in 1852, it wasn't until the late 1960s that scientists began widely observing and studying the phenomenon.  Canadian Harold Harvey was among the first to research a &quot;dead&quot; lake. Public awareness of acid rain in the U.S  increased in the 1990s after the [[New York Times]] promulgated reports from the [[Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest]] in [[New Hampshire]] of the myriad deleterious environmental effects demonstrated to result from it.

Evidence for an increase in the levels of acid rain comes from analysing layers of glacial ice. These show a sudden decrease in pH from the start of the industrial revolution of 6 to 4.5 or 4. Other information has been gathered from studying organisms known as [[diatoms]] which inhabit ponds. Over the years these die and are deposited in layers of [[sediment]] on the bottoms of the ponds. Diatoms thrive in certain pHs, so the numbers of diatoms found in layers of increasing depth give an indication of the change in pH over the years.

Since the industrial revolution, emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere have increased. Industrial and energy-generating facilities that burn fossil fuels, primarily coal, are the principal sources of increased sulfur oxides. Occasional pH readings of well below 2.4 (the acidity of vinegar) have been reported in industrialized areas. These sources, plus the transportation sector, are the major originators of increased nitrogen oxides. 

The problem of acid rain not only has increased with population and industrial growth, but has become more widespread. The use of tall smokestacks to reduce local [[pollution]] has contributed to the spread of acid rain by releasing gases into regional atmospheric circulation. Often deposition occurs a considerable distance from its formation, with mountainous regions tending to receive the most (simply because of their higher rainfall). An example of this effect is the frequent low pH of rain which falls in [[Scandinavia]] compared to the local emissions.

Industrial acid rain is a substantial problem in [[China]], [[Eastern Europe]], [[Russia]] and areas down-wind from them. Acid rain from power plants in the midwest United States  has also harmed the forests of upstate New York and New England. These areas all burn sulfur-containing coal to generate heat and electricity.

==Origin==

===Emissions of chemicals leading to acidification===
====Natural emissions====
[[Image:Volcanic injection.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Volcanic injection]]
The principal natural [[phenomena]] that contribute acid-producing gases to the [[atmosphere]] are emissions from [[volcano]]es and those from [[biology|biological]] processes that occur on the land, in [[wetland]]s, and in the [[ocean]]s. The major biological source of sulfur containing compounds is [[Dimethyl sulfide]].

The effects of acidic deposits have been detected in [[glacier|glacial ice]] thousands of years old in remote parts of the globe.

====Human emissions====

The principal cause of acid rain is sulfur and nitrogen compounds from human sources, such as [[electricity generation]] and [[motor vehicle]]s. The gases can be carried hundreds of miles in the atmosphere before they are converted to acids and deposited.

The most important gas which leads to acidification is [[sulfur dioxide]]. 70 Tg(S) per year in the form of SO2 comes from fossil fuel combustion and industry, 2.8 Tg(S) from [[wildfires]], and 7-8 Tg(S) per year from [[volcanoes]]. (Berresheim et al, 1995). Emissions of [[nitrogen oxide]]s which are oxidised to form [[Nitric acid]] are of increasing importance due to stricter controls on emissions of sulfur containing compounds.

===Gas phase chemistry===

In the [[gas phase]] sulfur dioxide is oxidised by reaction with the [[hydroxyl]] radical via a [[termolecular]] reaction:
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + OH· + M→ HOSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;· + M
which is followed by:
:HOSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;· + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;· + SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
In the presence of water [[sulfur trioxide]] is converted rapidly to sulfuric acid:
:SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + M → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + M

Nitric acid is formed by the reaction of OH with [[Nitrogen dioxide]]:
:NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + OH· + M → HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + M

For more information see Seinfeld and Pandis (1998).

===Chemistry in cloud droplets===
When clouds are present the loss rate of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is faster than can be explained by gas phase chemistry alone. This is due to reactions in the liquid water droplets
; Hydrolysis
Sulfur dioxide dissolves in water and then, like carbon dioxide, [[hydrolysis|hydrolyses]] in a series of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] reactions:

:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g)+ H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{unicode|&amp;#8652;}} SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{unicode|&amp;#8652;}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;+HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
: HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; {{unicode|&amp;#8652;}}  H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;+SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;

; Oxidation

There are a large number of aqueous reactions of sulfur which oxidise it from S(IV) to S(VI) leading to the formation of sulfuric acid. The most important oxidation reactions are with [[ozone]], [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[oxygen]] catalysed by Iron and Manganese.

For more information see Seinfeld and Pandis (1998).

==Aerosol formation==

In the gas phase sulfuric and nitric can condense on existing [[particulate|aerosols]] or nucleate to form new aerosols. The nucleation process is an important source of new particles in the atmosphere and so emissions of sulfur containing compounds, as well as causing acidification also have a climate effect.

==Acid deposition==

===Wet deposition===

Wet deposition of acids occurs when any form of precipitation (rain, snow etc) removes acids from the atmosphere and delivers it to the the Earth's surface. This can result from the deposition of acids produced in the raindrops (see aqueous phase chemistry above) or by the precipitation removing the acids either in clouds or below clouds. Wet removal of both gases and aerosol are both of importance for wet deposition.

===Dry deposition===

Acid deposition also occurs via dry deposition in the absence of precipitation. This can be responsible for as much as 20 to 60% of total acid deposition [http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/glossary.php]. This occurs when particles and gases stick to the ground, plants or other surfaces.

==Adverse effects==
===Effects on lake ecology===

There is a strong relationship between lower pH values and the loss of populations of [[fish]] in lakes. Below 4.5 virtually no fish survive, whereas levels of 6 or higher promote healthy populations. Acid in water inhibits the production of [[enzyme]]s which enable fish's [[larvae]] to escape their eggs. It also mobilizes toxic metals such as [[aluminium]] in lakes. [[Aluminium]] causes some fish to produce an excess of [[mucus]] around their [[gill]]s, preventing proper ventilation. [[Phytoplankton]] growth is inhibited by high acid levels, and animals which feed on it suffer.

Many lakes are subject to natural acid runoff from acid soils, and this can be triggered by particular rainfall patterns that concentrate the acid.  An acid lake with newly-dead fish is not necessarily evidence of severe air-pollution.

=== Effects of acid rain on soil biology ===

[[Soil#Biological processes in soil|Soil biology]] can be seriously damaged by acid rain. Some tropical [[microbes]] can quickly consume acids (Rodhe, 2005) but other types of microbe are unable to tolerate low pHs and are killed. The [[enzymes]] of these microbes are [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] (changed in shape so they no longer function) by the acid.

The [[hydronium]] ions of acid rain also mobilize [[toxin]]s and [[Leaching|leache]] away essential nutrients.  

Forest soils tend to be inhabited by [[fungi]], but acid rain shifts forest soils to be more bacterially dominated.In order to [[Nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]] many trees rely on fungi in a [[symbiotic]] relationship with their roots. If acidity inhibits the growth of these [[mycorrhizae]] associations this could lead to trees struggling to fix nitrogen without their symbiotic partners.

===Other adverse effects===

Trees are harmed by acid rain in a variety of ways. The waxy surface of leaves is broken down and nutrients are lost, making trees more susceptible to frost, fungi, and insects. Root growth slows and as a result fewer nutrients are taken up. Toxic ions are mobilized in the soil, and valuable minerals are leached away or (as in the case of [[phosphate]]) become bound to clay.

The toxic ions released due to acid rain form the greatest threat to humans. Mobilized [[copper]] has been implicated in outbreaks of [[diarrhea|diarrhea/diarrhoea]] in young children and it is thought that water supplies contaminated with aluminium cause [[Alzheimer's disease]].

Acid rain can cause erosion on ancient and valuable statues and has caused considerable damage. This is because the sulfuric acid in the rain chemically reacts with the calcium in the stones (lime stone, sandstone, marble and granite) to create gypsum, which then flakes off. This is also commonly seen on old gravestones where the acid rain can cause the inscription to become completely illegible.

Acid rain also causes an increased rate of oxidation for iron.

==Prevention methods==
===Technical solutions===
In the United States, many coal-burning [[power plant]]s use [[Flue gas desulft xml:space="preserve">{{Infobox Language

'''Basque''' (in Basque: ''Euskara'') is the [[language]] spoken by the [[Basque people]] who inhabit the [[Pyrenees]] in North-Central [[Spain]] and the adjoining region of South-Western [[France]]. More specifically, the Basques occupy a Spanish [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] known as the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] (''Euskadi''), which has significant cultural and political autonomy. Basques also make up sizable parts of the population in what is known as the Northern Basque Country in France and the autonomous community of [[Navarre]] in Spain. The Standard Basque name for the language is '''euskara'''; other dialectal forms are ''euskera'', ''eskuara'' and ''üskara''. Although  geographically surrounded by [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] languages, Basque is believed to be a [[language isolate]]. It is not an Indo-European language. 

==History and classification==
The [[Basque_people|ancestors of Basques]] are among the oldest inhabitants of [[Europe]], and their origins are still unknown, as are the origins of their language itself. Most scholars see Basque as a [[language isolate]].

Latin inscriptions in [[Aquitania]] preserve a number of words with cognates in proto-Basque, for instance the personal name Nescato (''neskato'' means &quot;young girl&quot; in modern Basque). This proposed language is called &quot;Aquitanian&quot; and was presumably spoken before the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s brought Latin to the western Pyrenees. Roman neglect of this hinterland allowed Aquitanian Basque to survive while the Iberian and [[Tartessian language]]s died out. Basque did come to acquire some Latin vocabulary, both before and after the Latin of the area developed into Gascon (a branch of Occitan) and [[Iberian Romance|Navarrese Romance]].

Given that the border between Basque and Gascon country is more diffuse than that of Basque and Castilian country, it is commonly assumed that the Basques' origin was in Aquitaine and that they migrated southward.

===Theories on connections with other languages===
Many scholars have tried to link Basque to [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], [[African languages]], [[Languages of the Caucasus|Caucasian languages]] and so on. A connection with the [[Iberian language]] gave some hope, but it is unclear whether similarities are due to genetic relations or [[Sprachbund|mere vicinity]].
The Caucasian hypothesis is widespread in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] as a link between Basques and Georgians; but there is little evidence to support it. (See &quot;[[Caucasian Iberia]]&quot;.) One of the few practical consequences is that the former mayor of [[Bilbao]] [[José María Gorordo]] made the city and the Georgian capital [[Tbilisi]] twin cities, and [[Euskal Telebista]] (Basque Television) co-produced a version of [[Don Quixote]] with the [[Georgian Television]].

Some adherents of the theory that Basque and the Caucasian languages are akin go as far as to propose a [[superfamily]], the [[Dene-Caucasian languages]]. This superfamily would also include the North American family of [[Na-Dené languages]].

==Geographic distribution==
The region in which Basque is spoken is smaller than what is known as the [[Basque Country]], or ''Euskal Herria'' in Basque.
Basque toponyms show that Basque was spoken further along the Pyrenees than today.
For example, the name of the [[Aran Valley]] (now a [[Gascon language|Gascon]]-speaking part of [[Catalonia]]) suggests Basque ''haran'', meaning &quot;valley&quot;. However, the growing influence of [[Latin language|Latin]] began to drive Basque out from  less mountainous areas of this region.

The [[Reconquista]] temporarily counteracted this tendency, when the Christian lords called on northern peoples &amp;mdash; Basques, [[Asturia]]ns and [[Frank]]s &amp;mdash; to colonize the new conquests. Later the Basque language came to be used mainly by peasants, while people in the cities preferred [[Castilian language|Castilian]], [[Gascon language|Gascon]], Navarrese Romance, [[French language|French]] or [[Latin language|Latin]] for high education. 

Basque experienced a rapid decline in Navarre during the 1800's. However, after [[Basque nationalism]] took the language as an identity sign, and with the establishment of autonomous governments, it has made a comeback. Basque-language schools have taken the language to areas like [[Encartaciones]] or the [[Navarrese Ribera]] where it may have never been natively spoken in historic times.

==Dialects and official status==
[[Image:Basque Dialects.svg|thumb|330px|Basque dialects|right]]
===Official status===
Historically, Latin or Romance has been the official language.
However, Basque was explicitly recognized in some areas, as the [[fuero|local charter]] of the Basque-[[Reconquista|colonized]] [[Ojacastro]] valley (now in [[Rioja (Spain)|Rioja]]) allowed the inhabitants to use Basque in legal processes in the 13th and 14th centuries.

Today Basque holds co-official language status in the Basque regions of Spain: the full [[Autonomous community of Spain|autonomous community]] of the [[Basque Country]] and some parts of [[Navarre]]. Basque has no official standing in the Northern Basque Country of France and  French citizens are barred from officially using Basque in a French court of law. Paradoxically, the use of Basque by Spanish nationals in French courts is allowed (with translation), as Basque is officially recognised on the other side of the frontier.

The positions of the various existing governments, in areas where Basque usage is common, differ with regard to the promotion of Basque. The language has official status in those territories which are within the Basque Autonomous Community where it is spoken and promoted heavily, but only partially in Navarre, which is divided by the law in three distinct language areas (this law is strongly rejected by the Basque-speaking people of Navarre).

===Dialects===
There are six main Basque dialects, comprising [[Biscayan]], [[Guipuzcoan]], and [[High Navarrese]] (in Spain), and [[Low Navarrese]], [[Labourdin]], and [[Souletin]] (in France). The dialect boundaries are not however congruent with political boundaries. 
One of the first scientific studies of Basque dialects, in particular the [[auxiliary verb]] forms, was made by [[Louis-Lucien Bonaparte]] (a nephew of [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]]).

===Standardized dialects===

The most widely used standardized dialect is [[Batua]] (&quot;unified&quot; in Basque), which is the language taught in most schools and used on TV. Batua is based largely on the [[Gipuzkoa]] regional dialect, where it is the most used, although it allows use of Northern and Navarrese vocabulary. It is also referred to as Standard Basque.

[[Azkue]]'s ''gipuzkera osotua'' was the first attempt to create a Basque standard in 1935. It did not succeed, not even in Gipuzkoa where Batua is always preferred.

Along with Batua, ''Classical Labourdin'', like [[Pierre Laffite]]'s ''Navarro-Labourdin'' is the standard form of Lapurtera taught in some schools of Lapurdi and used on radio, church and by the newspaper [[Herria]]. 

A group (''Jakintza Baitha'', &quot;Wisdom House&quot;) gathered around the academian [[Federico Krutwig]] preferred to base the standard on the Labourdin of [[Joannes Leyçarraga]]'s Protestant Bible and the first printed books in Basque.
However they got no official or popular support.

The most distinct dialects, Biscayan and Souletin also have a standard form.

===Derived languages===
 
In the 1500's, Basque sailors mixed many Basque words with a European Atlantic pidgin in their contacts with Iceland.

Several travelling professional groups of Castile used Basque words in their [[jargon]]s: examples are the ''[[gacería]]'', the ''[[mingaña]]'' and the Galician ''[[fala dos arxinas]]''.

==Grammar==
Basque is an [[ergative-absolutive language]]. The subject of an [[intransitive verb]] is in the [[absolutive case]] (which is unmarked), and the same case is used for the ''[[direct object]]'' of a [[transitive verb]]. The subject of the transitive verb (that is, the agent) is marked differently, with the [[ergative case]] (shown by the suffix ''-k''). This also triggers main and auxiliary verbal agreement.

The [[auxiliary verb]] which accompanies most main verbs agrees not only with the subject, but with the direct object and the indirect object, if present. Among European languages, this polypersonal system (multiple verb agreement) is only found in Basque and some Caucasian languages. The ergative-absolutive alignment is also unique among European languages, and rather rare worldwide.

Consider the phrase:

:''Martinek egunkariak erosten dizkit.''
:&quot;Martin buys the newspapers for me.&quot;

''Martin-ek'' is the agent (transitive subject), so it is marked with the ergative case ending ''-k'' (with an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] ''-e-''). ''Egunkariak'' has an ''-ak'' ending which marks plural object (plural absolutive, direct object case). The verb is ''erosten dizkit'', in which ''erosten'' is a kind of gerund (&quot;buying&quot;) and the auxiliary ''dizkit'' indicates: 

* ''di-'' marks a verb with both a direct object and an indirect one, in the present tense; 
* ''-zki-'' is the number of the direct object (in this case the newspapers; if it were singular there would be no suffix); and 
* ''-t'' is the indirect object mark: &quot;for me&quot;.

* in this instance an unmarked or &quot;null case&quot; equates to the &quot;nork&quot;, which in most European languages would be the subject.

The phrase:

:&quot;you buy the newspapers for me&quot; would translate as:

:''Zuek egunkariak erosten dizkidazue''

The auxiliary verb is composed as di-zki-da-zue 

( equivalent terms in European languages )

*''di-''   = direct object

*''-zki-'' = marks plural of direct object

*''-da-''  = indirect object ( to/for me ) {-t becomes -da- when intercalated.}

*''-zue''  = subject ( you pl. )

A Basque [[noun]] is inflected in 17 different ways for case, multiplied by 4 ways for its definiteness and number. These first 68 forms are further modified based on other parts of the sentence, which in turn are inflected for the noun again.  It's been estimated that at two levels of [[recursion]], a Basque noun may have 458,683 inflected forms ([http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/A/A92/A92-1016.pdf Agirre et al, 1992]).

==Phonology==
Basque has a distinction between [[laminal consonant|laminal]] and [[Apical consonant|apical]] articulation for the alveolar fricatives and affricates. In the laminal consonants the friction occurs across the blade of the tongue, while in apical ones, it occurs at the tip (apex).

The laminal alveolar fricative is made with the tongue tip pointing toward the lower teeth; its affricate counterpart is {{IPA|[ts]}}. These are written with an orthographic ''z'' (''z'', ''tz''). The apical fricative is written ''s'' and is pronounced like the normal ''s'' in Castillian Spanish; that is, the tongue tip points toward the upper teeth.  The corresponding affricate is ''ts''.   In the westernmost parts of the Basque country, only the apical ''s'' and the alveolar affricate ''tz'' are used.

Basque also features postalveolar sibilants ({{IPA|/&amp;#x0283;/}}, written ''x'', and {{IPA|/t&amp;#x0283;/}}, written ''tx''), sounding like English ''sh'' and ''ch''.

There are two palatal stops, voiced and unvoiced, as well as a palatal nasal and a palatal lateral (the palatal stops are not present in all dialects). These and the postalveolar sounds are typical of diminutives, which are used frequently in child language and [[motherese]] (mainly to show affection rather than size). For example, ''tanta'' &quot;drop&quot; vs. ''ttantta'' {{IPA|/&amp;#x025F;an&amp;#x025F;a/}} &quot;droplet&quot;. A few common words, such as ''txakur'' {{IPA|/t&amp;#x0283;akur/}} &quot;dog&quot;, use palatal sounds even though in current usage they have lost the diminutive sense; the corresponding non-palatal forms now acquiring an augmentative or pejorative sense: ''zakur'' &quot;big dog&quot;. Many dialects of Basque exhibit a derived palatalization effect in which coronal onset consonants are changed into the palatal counterpart after the high front vowel {{IPA|/i/}}. For example, the {{IPA|/n/}} in ''egin'' &quot;to act&quot; becomes palatal when the suffix ''-a'' is added: {{IPA|/egina/}} = {{IPA|[egi&amp;#x0272;a]}} &quot;the action&quot;.

The sound represented by ''j'' has a variety of realizations according to the regional dialect: {{IPA|[j, &amp;#x029D;, &amp;#x025F;, &amp;#x0292;, &amp;#x0283;, x]}} (the last one is typical of the Spanish Basque Country).

The vowel system is the same as Spanish for most speakers. It consists of five pure vowels, {{IPA|/i e a o u/}}. &lt;!-- It is thought that Spanish took this system from Basque. [References?] --&gt; Speakers of the Souletin dialect also have a sixth, front rounded vowel (represented in writing by ''ü'' but pronounced {{IPA|/ø/}}, much like a German ''ö''), as well as a set of contrasting nasalized vowels.

===Stress and pitch===
Basque features great dialectal variation in stress, from a weak pitch-accent in the central dialects to a marked stress in some outer dialects, with varying patterns of stress placement. Stress is in general not distinctive; there are, however, a few instances where stress is phonemic, serving to distinguish between a few pairs of stress-marked words and between some grammatical forms (mainly plurals from other forms). E.g., ''basóà'' (&quot;the forest&quot;, absolutive case) vs. ''básoà'' (&quot;the glass&quot;, absolutive case; a borrowing from Spanish ''vaso''); ''basóàk'' (&quot;the forest&quot;, ergative case) vs. ''básoàk'' (&quot;the glass&quot;, ergative case) vs. ''básoak'' (&quot;the forests&quot; or &quot;the glasses&quot;, absolutive case). Given its great deal of variation among dialects, stress is not marked in the standard orthography and [[Euskaltzaindia]] (the Royal Academy of the Basque Language) only provides general recommendations for a standard placement of stress, basically to place a high-pitched weak stress (weaker than that of Spanish, let alone that of English) on the second syllable of a syntagma, and a low-pitched even-weaker stress on its last syllable, except in plural forms where stress is moved to the first syllable. This scheme provides Basque with a distinct musicality which sets its sound apart from the prosodical patterns of Spanish (which tends to stress the second-to-last syllable). ''Euskaldun berriak'' (&quot;new Basque-speakers&quot;, i.e. second-language Basque-speakers) with Spanish as their first language tend to carry the prosodical patterns of Spanish into their pronunciation of Basque, giving rise to a much despised ''decaffeinated'' pronunciation; e.g., pronouncing ''nire ama'' (&quot;my mom&quot;) as ''nire áma'' (- - ´ -), instead of as ''niré amà'' (- ´ - `).

==Vocabulary==
By contact with neighbouring peoples, Basque has borrowed words from [[Latin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Gascon language|Gascon]], among others, but accepted relatively few compared to many [[Indo-European languages]]. Some claim that many of its words come from Latin, but phonetic evolution has made many of them appear nowadays as if they were native words, e.g. ''lore'' (&quot;flower&quot;, from ''florem''), ''errota'' (&quot;mill&quot;, from ''rotam'', &quot;[mill] wheel&quot;), ''gela'' (&quot;room&quot;, from ''cellam'').

==Writing system==
Basque is written using the [[Latin alphabet]]. The universal special letter is ''ñ''; sometimes ''ç'' and ''ü'' are also used. Basque does not use ''c, q, v, w, y'' except for loan words; they are not considered part of the alphabet.
: Aa Bb Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Ññ Oo Pp Rr Ss Tt Uu Xx Zz
''dd, ll, rr, ts, tt, tx, tz'' are not treated as [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]].

In [[Sabino Arana]]'s (1865..1903) orthography, ''ll'' and ''rr'' were replaced with ''[[ĺ]]'' and ''[[ŕ]]'', respectively.

'''Björn Kristian Ulvaeus''' (born [[April 25]], [[1945]]) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] musician and composer, most notable as a member of [[ABBA]].

Ulvaeus was born in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden, but as a child he moved with his family to [[Västervik]]. After being a member of ABBA he has, together with [[Benny Andersson]], created the musicals ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'', ''[[Kristina från Duvemåla]]'' (based on the Immigrant novels by Swedish writer [[Vilhelm Moberg]]), and ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'' (based on existing ABBA songs).

On [[July 6]], [[1971]], Björn married [[Agnetha Fältskog]]; the marriage resulted in two children, [[Christian Ulvaeus|Christian]] (born in 1977) and [[Linda Ulvaeus|Linda]] (born in 1973). In [[1979]], Björn and Agnetha [[divorce]]d, although they both agreed to remain in ABBA. Björn later married Lena Kallersjö on [[January 6]], [[1981]], and the marriage produced another two daughters.

Today he lives with his second wife in [[Stockholm]].  He is a co-owner of the Hotel Rival in Stockolm.

=== around 15-20 thousand people use Braille. Younger people are turning to electronic text on computers instead; a more portable communication method that they can also use with their friends. A debate has started on how to make braille more attractive and for more teachers to be available to teach it.

==Braille for other scripts==
There are many extensions of Braille for additional letters with [[diacritic]]s, such as ''ç, ô, é''. 

When braille is adapted to languages which do not use the [[Latin alphabet]], the blocks are generally assigned to the new alphabet according to how it is transliterated into the Latin alphabet, and the alphabetic order of the national script (and therefore the natural order of Latin braille) is disregarded. Such is the case with Russian, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, and Chinese. In Greek, for example, ''gamma'' is written as Latin ''g'', despite the fact that it has the alphabetic position of ''c''; Hebrew ''beth'', the second letter of the alphabet and [[cognate]] with the Latin letter ''b'', is instead written ''v'', as it is commonly pronounced; Russian ''ts'' is written as ''c'', which is the usual letter for /ts/ in those Slavic languages that use the Latin alphabet; and Arabic ''f'' is written as ''f'', despite being historically ''p'', and occurring in that part of the Arabic alphabet (between historic ''o'' and ''q''). [[Esperanto]] letters with circumflexes, ''ĉ'', ''ĝ'', ''ĥ'', ''ĵ'' and ''ŝ'', are written as those letters without circumflexes with a filled sixth dot. The ''ŭ'', used in Esperanto too, is as the u but the first dot is moved to the second place.

Greater differences occur in Chinese braille. In the case of [[Mandarin (linguistics)|Mandarin]] Braille, which is based on [[Zhuyin]] rather than the Latin [[Pinyin]] alphabet, the traditional Latin braille values are used for initial consonants and the simple vowels. However, there are additional blocks for the tones, diphthongs, and vowel + consonant combinations. [[Cantonese Braille]] is also based on Latin braille for many of the initial consonants and simple vowels (based on Romanizations of a century ago), but the blocks pull double duty, with different values depending on whether they're placed in syllable-initial or syllable-final position. For instance, the block for Latin ''k'' represents old-style Cantonese ''k'' (''g'' in [[Yale Romanization|Yale]] and other modern Romanizations) when initial, but ''aak'' when final, while Latin ''j'' represents Cantonese initial ''j'' but final ''oei''. 

However, at least two adaptations of Braille have completely reassigned the Latin sound values of the blocks. These are:
* [[Japanese Braille]]
* [[Korean Braille]]

In Japanese Braille, alphabetic signs for a consonant and vowel are combined into a single syllabic block; in Korean Braille, the consonants have different syllable-initial and syllable-final forms. These modifications made Braille much more compatible with Japanese [[kana]] and Korean [[hangul]], but meant that the Latin sound values could not be maintained.

==Braille in Pokemon==
Braille was incorporated into Pokemon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald for the [[Gameboy Advance]]. In this, the player had to read the braille and solve the requirements before encountering three legendary pokemon: [[Regirock]]; [[Registeel]]; and [[Regice]]. Out of all the modern games, this is the only one that uses the system effectively.

'''Bastille Day''' is the [[France|French]] [[national holiday]], celebrated on [[14 July]] each year. It is called ''Fête Nationale'' (National Holiday) in France. It commemorates the [[1790]] ''[[Fête de la Fédération]]'', held on the first anniversary of the [[storming of the Bastille]] on [[14 July]] [[1789]]; the ''Fête de la Fédération'' was seen as a symbol of the uprising of the modern French &quot;nation&quot;, and of the reconciliation of all the French inside the constitutional monarchy which preceded the [[First Republic (France)|First Republic]], during the [[French Revolution]].

==Current festivities==
[[Image:Chirac July 14 motorcade DSC00776.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jacques Chirac]] reviewing troops on the 2003 Bastille Day parade.]]

[[14 July]] is the French national day, simply called ''Fête nationale'' or ''14 juillet'' (though it is generally referred to as [[Bastille Day]] in English). Many cities hold fireworks during the night. It is also customary that [[firefighter]]s organise dancing parties (''bals du 14 juillet'').

The day officially celebrates the [[1790]] ''[[Fête de la Fédération]]'', though it is often associated, even in France, with the [[Storming of the Bastille]].

Military parades are held on the morning of [[14 July]], the largest of which takes place on the [[Champs-Élysées]] avenue in [[Paris]] in front of the [[President of France|President of the Republic]].

The parade opens with [[cadet]]s from certain schools ([[École Polytechnique]], [[École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]], [[École Navale]], and so forth), then other [[infantry]] troops, then motorised troops; [[aviation]] of the [[Patrouille de France]] flies above. In recent times, it has become customary to invite units from France's close allies into the parade; for instance, in [[2004]] during the centenary of the [[Entente Cordiale]], [[British Armed Forces|British troops]] (the band of the [[Royal Marines]], the [[Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment]], [[Grenadier Guards]] and [[King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery]]) led the Bastille Day parade in Paris for the first time, with the [[Red Arrows]] flying overhead.[http://www.entente-cordiale.org/en/6a_c.php?id=1].

The parade also involves the [[French Republican Guard]], and occasionally (non-military) [[police]] units; it always ends with the much-cheered and popular [[Paris Fire Brigade]] (which, exceptionally, has military status in France). Traditionally, the students of the École Polytechnique set up some form of joke.

The [[President of the French Republic|president]] then gives an [[interview]] to members of the press, discussing the situation of the country, recent events and projects for the future. He also holds a [[garden party]] at the [[Élysée Palace|Palais de l'Elysée]].

Bastille Day also falls during the running of the [[Tour de France]], and is traditionally the day upon which French riders will make a special effort to take a stage victory for France.

==History of the celebration==
[[Image:Monet-montorgueil.JPG|thumb|[[Claude Monet]], ''Rue Montorgueil, Paris, Festival of [[30 June]] [[1878]]''.]]

On [[30 June]] [[1878]], a feast had been set in Paris by official decision to honour the Republic (the event was immortalised by a painting by [[Claude Monet]]). On the [[14 July]] [[1879]], another feast took place, with a semi-official aspect; the events of the day included a military review in Longchamp, a reception in the Chambre of Deputies, organised and presided by [[Léon Gambetta]], and a Republican Feast in the pré Catelan with [[Louis Blanc]] and [[Victor Hugo]]. All through France, as ''[[Le Figaro]]'' wrote on the 16, &quot;people feasted a lot to honour the Bastille&quot;.

On the [[21 May]] [[1880]], [[Benjamin Raspail]] presented a law proposal to have &quot;the Republic choose the [[14 July]] as a yearly national holiday&quot;. The Assembly voted the text on [[21 May]] and [[8 June]]. The Senate approved on [[27 June|27]] and [[29 June]], favouring [[14 July]] against [[4 August]] (honouring the [[French_Revolution_from_the_abolition_of_feudalism_to_the_Civil_Constitution_of_the_Clergy#The_abolition_of_feudalism|end of the feudal system]] on [[4 August]] [[1789]]). The law was made official on [[6 July]] [[1880]], and the Ministry of the Interior recommended to the prefects that the day should be &quot;celebrated with all the brilliance that the local resources allow&quot;. Indeed, the celebrations of the new holiday in 1880 were particularly magnificent.

===Discourse by Henri Martin to the Senate===
Discourse by [[Henri Martin]], Chairman of the Senate, [[29 June]] [[1880]]

: (...) Do not forget that behind this 14&amp;nbsp;July, where victory of the new era over the ''[[ancien régime]]'' was bought by fighting, do not forget that after the day of 14&amp;nbsp;July 1789, there was the day of 14&amp;nbsp;July 1790.

: This [latter] day cannot be blamed for having shed a drop of blood, for having divided the country. It was the consecration of unity of France. Yes, it consecrated what the old monarchy had prepared.

: The old monarchy had, one could say, been the essence of France, and we did not forget it; Revolution, on this day of the 14&amp;nbsp;July 1790, made, I shall not say the soul of France&amp;mdash;None but God holds the soul of France&amp;mdash;but Revolution gave France the counsciousness of itself. It revealed its own soul to France. Remember then that on this day, the most beautiful and the purest of our history, from one end of the country to the other, from the [[Pyrenees]] to [[Alps]] and [[Rhine]], all the French were holding hands. Remember that, from all parts of the national territory, delegations of the [[French National Guard|National Guard]] and of the Army came to Paris to celebrate the deeds of '89. Remember what was in that Paris: a whole People, without distinctions of age nor sex, of rank not wealth, was associated from all its heart, had participated with its own hands to the fantastic preparations of the ''Fête de la Fédération''; Paris had worked to erect around the [[Champ-de-Mars]] this truly sacred amphitheatre which was razed by the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]].

: (...)

: If some of you might have scruples against the first 14&amp;nbsp;July, they certainly hold none aginst the second. Whatever difference which might part us, something hovers over them, it is the great images of national unity, which we all desire, for which we would all stand, willing to die if necessary.

==Historical background==
===The Storming of the Bastille===
: ''Main article: [[Storming of the Bastille]]''.
[[Image:Taking of the Bastille.jpg|thumb|''Prise de la Bastille'', by Jean-Pierre-Louis-Laurent Houel]]
On [[5 May]] [[1789]], [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] convened the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] to hear their grievances. The deputies of the [[Third Estate]] representing the common people (the two others were clergy and nobility) decided to break away and form a [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]].

On [[20 June]] the deputies of the Third Estate took the [[Tennis Court Oath]] (named after the place where they had gathered which was a place where an [[real tennis|ancestor of tennis]], the &quot;[[jeu de paume]]&quot; was played), swearing not to separate until a Constitution had been established. To show their support, the people of [[Paris]] stormed the [[Bastille]], a prison where people were jailed by arbitrary decision of the King (''[[lettre de cachet]]''). The Bastille was, in particular, known for holding political prisoners whose writings had displeased the royal government. Thus the Bastille was a symbol of the [[political absolutism|absolutism]] of the monarchy.

There were only 7 inmates housed at the time of the siege. The storming of the Bastille was more important as a rallying point and symbolic act of rebellion than a practical act of defiance.  No less important in the history of [[France]], it was ''not'' the image typically conjured up of courageous French patriots storming the Bastille and freeing hundreds of oppressed peasants.  However, it did immediately inspire preparations amongst the peasants for the very real threat of retaliation.

Shortly after the storming of the Bastille, on [[26 August]], the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] was proclaimed.

===The ''Fête de la Fédération''===
: ''Main article: [[Fête de la Fédération]]''
[[Image:Fete federation.jpg|thumb|The ''Fête de la Fédération'']]
The Fête de la Fédération of the [[14 July]] [[1790]] was a huge feast and official event to celebrate the uprising of the short-lived [[constitutional monarchy]] in France and what people of the time considered to be the happy conclusion of the [[French Revolution]].

The event took place on the [[Champ de Mars]], which was at the time far outside Paris. The place had been transformed on a voluntary basis by the population of Paris itself, in what was recalled as the ''Journée des brouettes'' (&quot;Wheelbarrow Day&quot;).

A mass was celebrated by Talleyrand, bishop of Autun. The very popular General La Fayette, as both captain of the National Guard of Paris and confident of the king, took his oath to the Constitution, followed by the King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]].

After the end of the official celebration, the day ended in a huge four day popular feast.

}}

In [[cryptography]], '''Blowfish''' is a [[key (cryptography)|key]]ed, [[symmetric key algorithm|symmetric]] [[block cipher]], designed in [[1993]] by [[Bruce Schneier]] and included in a large number of cipher suites and encryption products. While no effective cryptanalysis of Blowfish has been found to date, more attention is now given to block ciphers with a larger [[Block size (cryptography)|block size]], such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] or [[Twofish]].

Schneier designed Blowfish as a general-purpose algorithm, intended as a replacement for the aging [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] and free of the problems associated with other algorithms. At the time, many other designs were proprietary, encumbered by patents or kept as government secrets. Schneier has stated that, &quot;Blowfish is unpatented, and will remain so in all countries. The algorithm is hereby placed in the public domain, and can be freely used by anyone.&quot;

Notable features of the design include key-dependent [[S-box]]es and a highly complex [[key schedule]].

==The algorithm==
Blowfish has a 64-bit [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] and a [[key length]] of anywhere from 32 bits to 448 bits. It is a 16-round [[Feistel cipher]] and uses large key-dependent [[Substitution box|S-boxes]]. It is similar in structure to [[CAST-128]], which uses fixed S-boxes.

[[Image:BlowfishDiagram.png|left|thumbnail|216px|Diagram of Blowfish]]

The diagram to the left shows the action of Blowfish. Each line represents 32 bits. The algorithm keeps two subkey arrays: the 18-entry P-array and four 256-entry S-boxes. The S-boxes accept 8-bit input and produce 32-bit output. One entry of the P-array is used every round, and after the final round, each half of the data block is [[XOR]]ed with one of the two remaining unused P-entries.

[[Image:BlowfishFFunction.png|right|thumbnail|250px|Diagram of Blowfish's F function]]

The diagram to the right shows Blowfish's F-function. The function splits the 32-bit input into four eight-bit quarters, and uses the quarters as input to the S-boxes. The outputs are added [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; and XORed to produce the final 32-bit output.

Since Blowfish is a Feistel network, it can be inverted simply by XORing P&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; to the ciphertext block, then using the P-entries in reverse order.

Blowfish's [[key schedule]] starts by initializing the P-array and S-boxes with values derived from the [[hexadecimal]] digits of [[pi]], which contain no obvious pattern. The secret key is then XORed with the P-entries in order (cycling the key if necessary). A 64-bit all-zero block is then encrypted with the algorithm as it stands. The resultant ciphertext replaces P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The ciphertext is then encrypted again with the new subkeys, and P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are replaced by the new ciphertext. This continues, replacing the entire P-array and all the S-box entries. In all, the Blowfish encryption algorithm will run 521 times to generate all the subkeys - about 4KB of data is processed.

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;
==Cryptanalysis of Blowfish==
There is no effective [[cryptanalysis]] of Blowfish known publicly [[as of 2006]], although the 64-bit block size is now considered too short, because encrypting more than 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; data blocks can begin to leak information about the [[plaintext]] due to a [[birthday attack]].  Despite this, Blowfish seems thus far to be secure. While the short block size does not pose any serious concerns for routine consumer applications like e-mail, Blowfish may not be suitable in situations where large plaintexts must be encrypted, as in data archival.

In [[1996]], [[Serge Vaudenay]] found a known-plaintext attack requiring 2&lt;sup&gt;8''r'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt; known plaintexts to break, where ''r'' is the number of rounds. Moreover, he also found a class of [[weak key]]s that can be detected and broken by the same attack with only 2&lt;sup&gt;4''r'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt; known plaintexts. This attack cannot be used against the full 16-round Blowfish; Vaudenay used a reduced-round variant of Blowfish. [[Vincent Rijmen]], in his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] thesis, introduced a second-order differential attack that can break four rounds and no more. There remains no known way to break the full 16 rounds, apart from a [[brute-force search]].

In [[2005]], Dieter Schmidt investigated the Blowfish key schedule and noted that the subkeys for the third and fourth round are independent of the first 64 bits of the user key [http://eprint.iacr.org/2005/063].

==Blowfish in practice==
Blowfish is one of the fastest [[block cipher]]s in widespread use, except when changing keys. Each new [[key (cryptography)|key]] requires pre-processing equivalent to encrypting about 4 kilobytes of text, which is very slow compared to other block ciphers. This prevents its use in certain applications, but is not a problem in others. In one application, it is actually a benefit: the [[password]]-hashing method used in [[OpenBSD]] uses an algorithm derived from Blowfish that makes use of the slow key schedule; the idea is that the extra computational effort required gives protection against [[dictionary attack]]s.

In some implementations, Blowfish has a relatively large memory footprint of just over 4 kilobytes of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]]. This is not a problem even for older smaller desktop and laptop computers, but it does prevent use in the smallest [[embedded systems]] such as early [[smartcard]]s.

Blowfish is not subject to any patents and is therefore freely available for anyone to use.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; softens consonants before 'o'

Most letters in the Bulgarian alphabet stand for one specific sound and that sound only. Three letters stand for the single expression of combinations of sounds, namely [[Shcha|щ]] (sht), [[Yu|ю]] (yu), and [[Ya|я]] (ya). Two sounds do not have separate letters assigned to them, but are expressed by the combination of two letters, namely &lt;u&gt;дж&lt;/u&gt; (like j in Jack) and &lt;u&gt;дз&lt;/u&gt; (dz). The letter &lt;u&gt;ь&lt;/u&gt; is not pronounced, but it softens (palatalizes) any preceding consonant before the letter &lt;u&gt;о&lt;/u&gt;.

For questions regarding the transliteration of Bulgarian into the Latin alphabet ([[romanization]]), see [[romanization of Bulgarian]].

==Phonology==

===Vowels===

Bulgarian's six vowels may be grouped in three pairs according to their backness: front, central and back. All vowels are relatively lax, as in most other [[Slavic languages]], and unlike the tense vowels, for example, in the [[Germanic languages]]. Unstressed vowels tend to be shorter and weaker compared to their stressed counterparts, the corresponding pairs of open and closed vowels approaching each other with a tendency to merge, although the coalescence is not always complete. The vowels may be distinguished in emphatic or deliberately distinct pronunciation, and the variation of the norm is socially conditioned, too: on the one hand, the relative absence of reduction is intuitively associated with certain types of low-status (provincial, especially West Bulgarian, or [[Romani]]-influenced) speech; on the other hand the awareness of the distinctions is naturally perceived as a sign of literacy and education. The merger is, at least in nondialectal pronunciation, totally accomplished for {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/ɤ/}} in all positions (except, occasionally and for some speakers, in a syllable immediately preceding another {{IPA|/a/}}). Unstressed {{IPA|/ɔ/}} also tends to be pronounced like {{IPA|/u/}} (phonetically {{IPA|[o]}}?) (the difference is either minimal or nonexistent in pre-stress position and totally absent after stress), but the status of that coalescence is less clear, perhaps because post-stress {{IPA|/u/}} is not very common in the first place. The considerable reduction of {{IPA|/ɛ/}} notwithstanding, similar coalescence of {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} is not allowed in formal speech and is definitely regarded as a provincial (East Bulgarian) feature; rather, the acoustic impression of unstressed and above all post-stress {{IPA|/ɛ/}} might occasionally resemble a more front form of {{IPA|/ɤ/}}.

===Semivowels===
Bulgarian possesses one [[semivowel]]: {{IPA|/j/}}, equivalent to the English &lt;'''y'''&gt; in ''yes''. The {{IPA|/j/}} always immediately precedes or follows a vowel. The semivowel is most usually expressed graphically by the letter '''[[Short I|й]]''', as, for example, in &lt;u&gt;най&lt;/u&gt; /naj/ (&quot;most&quot;) and &lt;u&gt;тролей&lt;/u&gt; {{IPA|/trɔlɛj/}} (&quot;trolleybus&quot;). The letters &lt;u&gt;ю&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;я&lt;/u&gt; are, however, also used, for example, &lt;u&gt;ютия&lt;/u&gt; /jutija/ &quot;(flat) iron&quot;. After a consonant, &lt;u&gt;ю&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;я&lt;/u&gt; signify a palatalized consonant rather than a semivowel: &lt;u&gt;бял&lt;/u&gt; /{{IPA|bʲal/}} &quot;white&quot;.

===Consonants===
Bulgarian has a total of 33 consonant [[phonemes]] (see table below). Three additional phonemes can also be found ([{{IPA|x&amp;#690;}}], {{IPA|[&amp;#675;]}} and {{IPA|[&amp;#675;&amp;#690;]}}), but only in foreign [[proper names]] such as &lt;u&gt;Хюстън&lt;/u&gt; {{IPA|/xʲustɤn/}} (&quot;Houston&quot;), &lt;u&gt;Дзержински&lt;/u&gt; {{IPA|/dzɛrʒinski/}} (&quot;Dzerzhinsky&quot;), and &lt;u&gt;Ядзя&lt;/u&gt; /{{IPA|jaʣʲ}}a/, the Polish name &quot;Jadzia&quot;. They are, however, normally not considered part of the phonetic inventory of the Bulgarian language. According to the criterion of sonority, the Bulgarian consonants may be divided into 16 pairs (voiced&lt;&gt;voiceless). The only consonant without a counterpart is the [[voiceless velar fricative]] [x]. The contrast 'voiced vs. voiceless' is neutralized in word-final position, where all consonants are pronounced as voiceless (as in most Slavic languages, German, etc.); this neutralization is, however, not reflected in the spelling. 

====Hard and palatalized consonants====
The Bulgarian consonants '''б''' {{IPA|/b/}}, '''в''' {{IPA|/v/}}, '''г''' {{IPA|/g/}}, '''д''' {{IPA|/d/}}, '''з''' {{IPA|/z/}}, '''к''' {{IPA|/k/}}, '''л''' {{IPA|/l/}}, '''м''' {{IPA|/m/}}, '''н''' {{IPA|/n/}}, '''п''' {{IPA|/p/}}, '''р''' {{IPA|/r/}}, '''с''' {{IPA|/s/}}, '''т''' {{IPA|/t/}}, '''ф''' {{IPA|/f/}}, '''ц''' {{IPA|/ʦ/}} can have both a normal, &quot;hard&quot; pronunciation, as well as a &quot;soft&quot;, palatalized one. The hard and the palatalized consonants are considered separate [[phonemes]] in Bulgarian. The consonants '''ж''' {{IPA|/ʒ/}}, '''ш''' {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, '''ч''' {{IPA|/ʧ/}} and '''дж''' {{IPA|/ʤ/}} do not have palatalized variants, which is probably connected with the fact that they have arisen historically through palatalization in common Slavic. These consonants may be realized with different grades of hardness or softness, depending on speaker and dialect; a relatively neutral realization is perceived as standard.

The softness of the palatalized consonants is always indicated in writing in Bulgarian. A consonant is palatalized if:
*it is followed by the soft sign '''ь''';
*it is followed by the letters '''я''' {{IPA|/&amp;nbsp;ʲa/}} or '''ю''' {{IPA|/&amp;nbsp;ʲu/}};

('''я''' and '''ю''' are used in all other cases to represent the semivowel /j/ before /a/ and /u/.)

Even though palatalized consonants are phonemes in Bulgarian, they may in some cases be positionally conditioned, hence redundant. In Eastern Bulgarian dialects, consonants are always allophonically palatalized before the vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ/}}. This is not the case in correct Standard Bulgarian, but that form of the language does have similar allophonic alternations. Thus, '''к''' {{IPA|/k/}}, '''г''' {{IPA|/g/}} and '''х''' {{IPA|/x/}} tend to be palatalized before {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, and the realization of the phoneme '''л''' {{IPA|/l/}} varies along the same principles: it is [[velarization|velarized]] in all positions, except before the vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ/}}. The normal, non-velarized realization is traditionally (and incorrectly) called 'soft l', even though it is ''not'' palatalized (and thus ''isn’t'' identical to the {{IPA|/lʲ/}} signalled by the letters '''ь''', '''я''' and '''ю'''). In many Western Bulgarian dialects, as well as in the neighbouring [[Serbian language]], this 'pseudo-soft' realization does not exist and the nonpalatalized {{IPA|/l/}} is always velarized regardless of the quality of the following vowels.

====Palatalization====
During the [[palatalization]] of most hard consonants (the bilabial, labiodental and alveolar ones), the middle part of the tongue is lifted towards the palatum, resulting in the formation of a second articulatory centre whereby the specific palatal &quot;clang&quot; of the soft consonants is achieved. The articulation of alveolars {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/r/}}, however, usually does not follow that rule; the palatal clang is achieved by moving the place of articulation further back towards the palatum so that {{IPA|/ʎ/}}, {{IPA|/ɲ/}} and {{IPA|/rʲ/}} are actually alveopalatal (postalvelolar) consonants. Soft {{IPA|/g/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} ({{IPA|/gʲ/}} and {{IPA|/kʲ/}}, respectively) are articulated not on the velum but on the palatum and are considered [[palatal consonants]].

====Word stress====
Bulgarian [[lexical stress|word stress]] is '''dynamic'''. Stressed syllables are louder and longer than unstressed ones. Stress is also '''free''' and '''mobile''', it may fall on any syllable of a polysyllabic word and its position may vary in inflection and derivation, for example, &lt;u&gt;мъж&lt;/u&gt; /{{IPA|mɤʃ}}/ (&quot;man&quot;), &lt;u&gt;мъжът&lt;/u&gt; /{{IPA|mɤ'ʒɤt}}/ (&quot;the man&quot;). Bulgarian stress is also '''distinctive''': for example, &lt;u&gt;в'ълна&lt;/u&gt; /{{IPA|'vɤlna}}/ (&quot;wool&quot;) and &lt;u&gt;вълн'а&lt;/u&gt; /{{IPA|vɤl'na}}/ (&quot;wave&quot;) are only differentiated by stress.

== Grammar ==
There is some more information at [[Bulgarian grammar]]

The parts of speech in Bulgarian are divided in 10 different types, which are categorized in two broad classes: mutable and immutable. The difference is that mutable parts of speech vary grammatically, whereas the immutable ones do not change, regardless of their use. The five classes of mutables are: '''nouns''', '''adjectives''', '''numerals''', '''pronouns''' and '''verbs'''.  Syntactically, the first four of these form the group of the noun or the nominal group. The immutables are: '''adverbs''', '''prepositions''', '''conjunctions''', '''particles''' and '''interjections'''. Verbs and adverbs form the group of the verb or the verbal group.

===Nominal morphology===
Nouns, adjectives and pronouns are inflected for '''[[grammatical gender]]''', '''[[grammatical number|number]]''', '''[[grammatical case|case]]''' (to a very limited extent) and '''[[definite article|definiteness]]''' in Bulgarian. Adjectives and adjectival pronouns agree with nouns in number and gender.

====Nominal inflection====

=====Gender=====
There are three grammatical genders in Bulgarian: '''masculine''', '''feminine''' and '''neuter'''. The gender of the noun can largely be determined according to its ending. The vast majority of Bulgarian nouns ending in a consonant ('''zero ending''') are '''masculine''' (for example, &lt;u&gt;град&lt;/u&gt; “city”, &lt;u&gt;син&lt;/u&gt; “son”, &lt;u&gt;мъж&lt;/u&gt; “man”). '''Feminine''' nouns include almost all nouns that have the endings '''–а/–я''' (&lt;u&gt;жена&lt;/u&gt; “woman”, &lt;u&gt;дъщеря&lt;/u&gt; “daughter”, &lt;u&gt;улица&lt;/u&gt; “street”), a large group of nouns with zero ending expressing quality, degree or an abstraction, including all nouns ending on '''&lt;u&gt;–ост&lt;/u&gt;'''/'''&lt;u&gt;–ест&lt;/u&gt;''' (&lt;u&gt;мъдрост&lt;/u&gt; “wisdom”, &lt;u&gt;низост&lt;/u&gt; “vileness”, &lt;u&gt;прелест&lt;/u&gt; &quot;loveliness&quot;, &lt;u&gt;болест&lt;/u&gt; &quot;sickness&quot;, &lt;u&gt;любов&lt;/u&gt; “love”), and another, much smaller group of irregular nouns with zero ending which define tangible objects or concepts (&lt;u&gt;кръв&lt;/u&gt; “blood”, &lt;u&gt;кост&lt;/u&gt; “bone”, &lt;u&gt;вечер&lt;/u&gt; “evening”). Nouns ending in '''–е''', '''–о''' are almost exclusively '''neuter''' (&lt;u&gt;дете&lt;/u&gt; “child”, &lt;u&gt;езеро&lt;/u&gt; “lake”). The same regards a limited number of loan words ending in '''–и''', '''–у''', and '''–ю''' (&lt;u&gt;цунами&lt;/u&gt; &quot;tsunami&quot;, &lt;u&gt;табу&lt;/u&gt; &quot;taboo&quot;, &lt;u&gt;меню&lt;/u&gt; &quot;menu&quot;). Plural nouns do not have gender.

=====Number=====
Two numbers are distinguished in Bulgarian — '''[[singular]]''' and '''[[plural]]'''. The most typical plural ending for feminine nouns is '''–и''', which is appended to the word upon dropping the singular ending '''–а/–я'''. Plural forms of neutral and masculine nouns use a variety of suffixes, the most typical of which are '''–а''', '''–я''' (both require dropping of the singular endings  '''–е'''/'''–о''') and '''–та''' for neutral nouns and '''–е''', '''–и''' and '''–ове''' for masculine nouns. Exceptions, irregular declension and alternative plural forms are, however, very common for all three genders.

Masculine nouns use a separate count form with [[cardinal number]]s, which stems from the proto-Slavonic '''[[dual grammatical number|dual]]''': &lt;u&gt;двама/трима ученика&lt;/u&gt; (two/three students) versus &lt;u&gt;тези ученици&lt;/u&gt; (these students); cf. feminine &lt;u&gt;две/три/тези жени&lt;/u&gt; (two/three/these women) and neuter &lt;u&gt;две/три/тези деца&lt;/u&gt; (two/three/these children). However, a recently developed language norm requires that count forms should only be used with masculine nouns that do not denote persons. Thus, &lt;u&gt;двама/трима ученици&lt;/u&gt; is perceived as more correct than &lt;u&gt;двама/трима ученика&lt;/u&gt;, while the distinction is retained in cases such as &lt;u&gt;два/три молива&lt;/u&gt; (two/three pencils) versus &lt;u&gt;тези моливи&lt;/u&gt; (these pencils).

=====Case=====
The complex proto-Slavonic case system is almost completely dissolved in modern Bulgarian. Vestiges are well preserved only in the [[personal pronoun]]s and the masculine personal interrogative pronoun &lt;u&gt;кой&lt;/u&gt; (“who”), which have '''[[nominative]]''', '''[[accusative case|accusative]]''' and '''[[dative]]''' forms. '''[[Vocative]]''' forms are still in use for masculine and feminine nouns (however, not for neuter ones), but endings in masculine nouns are determined solely according to the stem-final consonant of the noun. In all other cases, except for a number of phraseological units and sayings, the proto-Slavonic case system has been replaced by prepositional and other syntactic constructions.

=====Definiteness (article)=====
The disappearance of the case declension might be connected with the development of the category of definiteness in Bulgarian. The postfixed definite article, which displaced Slavic case inflexions, may have been inherited from Old Bulgar and then spread to other Balkan languages such as Albanian and Romanian. In modern Bulgarian, definiteness is expressed by a '''[[definite article]]''' which is postfixed to the noun (indefinite: &lt;u&gt;човек&lt;/u&gt;, “man”; definite: &lt;u&gt;човек'''ът'''&lt;/u&gt;, “'''the''' man”) or the first nominal constituent of definite noun phrases (indefinite: &lt;u&gt;добър човек&lt;/u&gt;, “a good man”; definite: &lt;u&gt;добри'''ят''' човек&lt;/u&gt;, “'''the''' good man”), much like in the [[Scandinavian languages]] or [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. There are four singular definite articles: '''–ът'''/'''–ят''' for masculine nouns that are grammatical subjects, '''–а'''/'''–я''' for masculine nouns that are grammatical objects, '''–та''' for feminine nouns, and '''–то''' for neuter nouns. The two masculine definite articles may also be considered as two grammatical forms of the same article.
The plural definite articles are '''–те''' for masculine and feminine nouns, and '''–тa''' for neuter nouns. When postfixed to adjectives the definite articles are '''–ят'''/'''–я''' for masculine, '''–та''' for feminine, '''–то''' for neuter, and '''–те''' for plural nouns.

====Adjective and numeral inflection====
Both groups agree in gender and number with the noun they are appended to. They may also take up the definite article as explained above.

====Pronouns====
Pronouns may vary in gender, number, definiteness and are the only parts of speech that have retained case inflexions. Three cases are exhibited by some groups of pronouns, nominative, accusative and dative, although dative is often substituted by accusative constructions. The distinguishable types of pronouns include the following: personal, relative, reflexive, interrogative, negative, indefinitive, summative and possessive.

====Adverbs====
The most [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]] way to form adverbs is to derive them from the neuter singular form of the corresponding adjective (&lt;u&gt;бързо&lt;/u&gt; (fast), &lt;u&gt;силно&lt;/u&gt; (hard), &lt;u&gt;странно&lt;/u&gt; (strangely)), although adjectives ending in &lt;u&gt;-ки&lt;/u&gt; use the masculine singular form, also in &lt;u&gt;-ки&lt;/u&gt;, instead: &lt;u&gt;юнашки&lt;/u&gt; (heroically), &lt;u&gt;мъжки&lt;/u&gt; (bravely, like a man), &lt;u&gt;майсторски&lt;/u&gt; (skilfully): &lt;u&gt;юнашки&lt;/u&gt; (heroically), &lt;u&gt;мъжки&lt;/u&gt; (bravely, like a man), &lt;u&gt;майсторски&lt;/u&gt; (skilfully). The same pattern is used to form adverbs from the (adjective-like) ordinal numerals, e.g. &lt;u&gt;първо&lt;/u&gt; (firstly), &lt;u&gt;второ&lt;/u&gt; (secondly), &lt;u&gt;трето&lt;/u&gt; (thirdly), and in some cases from (adjective-like) cardinal numerals, e.g. &lt;u&gt;двойно&lt;/u&gt; (twice as/double), &lt;u&gt;тройно&lt;/u&gt; (three times as), &lt;u&gt;петорно&lt;/u&gt; (five times as).

The remaining adverbs are formed in ways that are no longer productive in the language. A small number are original (not derived from other words), for example: &lt;u&gt;тук&lt;/u&gt; (here), &lt;u&gt;там&lt;/u&gt; (there), &lt;u&gt;вътре&lt;/u&gt; (inside), &lt;u&gt;вън&lt;/u&gt; (outside), &lt;u&gt;много&lt;/u&gt; (very/much) etc. The rest are mostly fossilized declined forms, such as:
* archaic unchangeable locative forms of some adjectives, e.g. &lt;u&gt;добре&lt;/u&gt; (well), &lt;u&gt;зле&lt;/u&gt; (badly), &lt;u&gt;твърде&lt;/u&gt; (too, rather), and nouns &lt;u&gt;горе&lt;/u&gt; (up), &lt;u&gt;утре&lt;/u&gt; (tomorrow), &lt;u&gt;лете&lt;/u&gt; (in the summer);
* archaic unchangeable instrumental forms of some adjectives, e.g. &lt;u&gt;тихом&lt;/u&gt; (quietly), &lt;u&gt;скришом&lt;/u&gt; (furtively), &lt;u&gt;слепешком&lt;/u&gt; (blindly), and nouns, e.g. &lt;u&gt;денем&lt;/u&gt; (during the day), &lt;u&gt;нощем&lt;/u&gt; (during the night), &lt;u&gt;редом&lt;/u&gt; (one next to the other), &lt;u&gt;духом&lt;/u&gt; (spiritually), &lt;u&gt;цифром&lt;/u&gt; (in figures), &lt;u&gt;словом&lt;/u&gt; (with words). The same pattern has been used with verbs: &lt;u&gt;тичешком&lt;/u&gt; (while running), &lt;u&gt;лежешком&lt;/u&gt; (while lying), &lt;u&gt;стоешком&lt;/u&gt; (while standing).
* archaic unchangeable accusative forms of some nouns: &lt;u&gt;днес&lt;/u&gt; (today), &lt;u&gt;сутрин&lt;/u&gt; (in the morning), &lt;u&gt;зимъс&lt;/u&gt; (in winter);
* archaic unchangeable genitive forms of some nouns: &lt;u&gt;довечера&lt;/u&gt; (tonight), &lt;u&gt;снощи&lt;/u&gt; (last night), &lt;u&gt;вчера&lt;/u&gt; (yesterday);
* homonymous and etymologically identical to the feminine singular form of the corresponding adjective used with the definite article: &lt;u&gt;здравата&lt;/u&gt; (hard), &lt;u&gt;слепешката&lt;/u&gt; (gropingly); the same pattern has been applied to some verbs, e.g. &lt;u&gt;тичешката&lt;/u&gt; (while running), &lt;u&gt;лежешката&lt;/u&gt; (while lying), &lt;u&gt;стоешката&lt;/u&gt; (while standing).
* derived from cardinal numerals by means of a non-productive suffix: &lt;u&gt;веднъж&lt;/u&gt; (once), &lt;u&gt;дваж&lt;/u&gt; (twice), &lt;u&gt;триж&lt;/u&gt; (thrice);

All the adverbs are immutable. Verb forms, however, vary in aspect, mood, tense, person, number and sometimes gender and voice.

===Verbal morphology and grammar===

====Finite verbal forms====
Finite verbal forms are '''simple''' or '''compound''' and agree with subjects in '''person''' (first, second and third) and '''number''' (singular, plural) in Bulgarian. In addition to that, past compound forms using participles vary in '''gender''' (masculine, feminine, neuter) and '''voice''' (active and passive) as well as aspect (perfective/aorist and imperfective).

=====Aspect=====
Bulgarian verbs express '''[[lexical aspect]]''': perfective verbs signify the completion of the action of the verb and form past aorist tenses; imperfective ones are neutral with regard to it and form past imperfect tenses. Most Bulgarian verbs can be grouped in perfective-imperfective pairs ('''imperfective'''&lt;&gt;'''perfective''': &lt;u&gt;идвам&lt;/u&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;u&gt;дойда&lt;/u&gt; “come”, &lt;u&gt;пристигам&lt;/u&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;u&gt;пристигна&lt;/u&gt; “arrive”). Perfective verbs can be usually formed from imperfective ones by suffixation or prefixation, but the resultant verb often deviates in meaning from the original. In the pair examples above, aspect is stem-specific and therefore there is no difference in meaning.

In Bulgarian, there is also '''[[grammatical aspect]]'''. Three grammatical aspects are distinguishable: neutral, perfect and pluperfect. The neutral aspect comprises the three simple tenses and the future tense. The pluperfect aspect is manifest in tenses that use double or triple auxiliary &quot;be&quot; participles like the past pluperfect subjunctive. Perfect tenses use a single auxiliary &quot;be&quot;.

=====Mood=====
In addition to the four moods (&lt;u&gt;наклонения&lt;/u&gt;) shared by most other European languages - '''[[indicative mood|indicative]]''' (&lt;u&gt;изявително&lt;/u&gt;), '''[[imperative mood|imperative]]''' (&lt;u&gt;повелително&lt;/u&gt;), '''[[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]]''' (&lt;u&gt;подчинително&lt;/u&gt;) and '''[[conditional mood|conditional]]''' (&lt;u&gt;условно&lt;/u&gt;) - in Bulgarian there is one more to describe past unwitnessed events - the '''[[renarrative mood|renarrative]]''' (&lt;u&gt;преизказно&lt;/u&gt;) mood.

=====Tense=====
There are three grammatically distinctive positions in time — present, past and future — which combine with aspect and mood to produce a number of formations. Normally, in grammar books these formations are viewed as separate tenses — i. e. &quot;past imperfect tense&quot; would mean that the verb is in past tense, in the imperfective aspect, and in the indicative mood (since no other mood is shown). There are more than 30 different tenses across Bulgarian's two aspects and five moods.

In the '''indicative mood''', there are three '''simple tenses''':
*'''present tense''' is a temporally unmarked simple form made up of the verbal stem of and a complex suffix composed of the vowel /e/, /i/ or /a/ and the person/number ending (&lt;u&gt;пристигам&lt;/u&gt; &quot;I arrive/I am arriving&quot;); only imperfective verbs can stand in the present indicative tense independently;

*'''past imperfect tense''' is a simple verb form used to express an action which is contemporaneous or subordinate to other past actions; it is made up of an imperfective verbal stem and the person/number ending (&lt;u&gt;пристигаx&lt;/u&gt; &quot;I was arriving&quot;);

*'''past aorist tense''' is a simple form used to express a temporarily independent, specific past action; it is made up of a perfective verbal stem and the person/number ending (&lt;u&gt;пристигнах&lt;/u&gt; &quot;I arrived&quot;);

In the '''indicative''' there are also the following '''compound tenses''':
*'''future tense''' is a compound form made of the particle &lt;u&gt;ще&lt;/u&gt; and present tense (&lt;u&gt;ще уча&lt;/u&gt; &quot;I will study&quot;); negation is expressed by the construction &lt;u&gt;няма да&lt;/u&gt; and present tense (&lt;u&gt;няма да уча&lt;/u&gt; &quot;I will not study&quot;);

*'''past future tense''' is a compound form used to express an action which was to be completed in the past but was future as regards another past action; it is made up of the past imperfect tense of the verb &lt;u&gt;ща&lt;/u&gt; &quot;will, want&quot;, the particle &lt;u&gt;да&lt;/u&gt; &quot;to&quot; and the present tense of the verb (&lt;u&gt;щях да уча&lt;/u&gt; &quot;I was going to study&quot;);

*'''present perfect tense''' is a compound form used to express an action which was completed in the past but is relevant for or related to the present; it is made up of the present tense of the verb &lt;u&gt;съм&lt;/u&gt; &quot;be&quot; and the past participle (&lt;u&gt;съм учил&lt;/u&gt; &quot;I have studied&quot;);

*'''past perfect tense''' is a compound form used to express an action which was completed in the past and is relative to another past action; it is made up of the past tense of the verb &lt;u&gt;съм&lt;/u&gt; &quot;be&quot; and the past participle (&lt;u&gt;бях учил&lt;/u&gt; &quot;I had studied&quot;);

*'''future perfect tense''' is a compound form used to express an action which is to take place in the future before another future action; it is made up of the future tense of the verb &lt;u&gt;съм&lt;/u&gt; &quot;be&quot; and the past participle (&lt;u&gt;ще съм учил&lt;/u&gt; &quot;I will have studied&quot;);

*'''past future perfect tense''' is a compound form used to express a past action which is future with respect to a past action which itself is prior to another past action; it is made up of the past future of &lt;u&gt;ща&lt;/u&gt; &quot;will, want&quot;, the particle &lt;u&gt;да&lt;/u&gt; &quot;to&quot;, the present tense of the verb &lt;u&gt;съм&lt;/u&gt; &quot;be&quot; and the past participle of the verb (&lt;u&gt;щях да съм учил&lt;/u&gt; &quot;I would have studied&quot;).

The four perfect tenses above can all vary in aspect depending on the aspect of the main-verb participle; they are in fact pairs of imperfective and perfective tenses. Verbs in tenses using past participles also vary in voice and gender.

There is only one simple tense in the '''[[imperative mood]]''' - the '''present''' - and there are simple forms only for the second person using the suffixes '''-и'''/'''-й''' for singular and '''-ете'''/'''-йте''' for plural; e.g., &lt;u&gt;уча&lt;/u&gt; &quot;to study&quot;: &lt;u&gt;уч'''и'''&lt;/u&gt;, sg., &lt;u&gt;уч'''ете'''&lt;/u&gt;, pl.; играя &quot;to play&quot;: &lt;u&gt;игра'''й'''&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;игра'''йте'''&lt;/u&gt;. There are compound imperative forms for all persons and numbers in the '''present compound imperative''' (&lt;u&gt;да играе&lt;u&gt;) and the '''present perfect compound imperative''' (&lt;u&gt;да е играл&lt;u&gt;).

The '''[[conditional mood]]''' consists of five compound tenses, most of which are not grammatically distinguishable. The present, future and past conditional use a special past form of the stem &lt;u&gt;би-&lt;/u&gt; (“be”) and the past participle (&lt;u&gt;бих учил&lt;/u&gt;, “I would study”). The past future conditional and the past future perfect conditional coincide in form with the respective indicative tenses.

The '''[[subjunctive mood]]''' is rarely documented as a separate verb form in Bulgarian but nevertheless it is used regularly. The most common form, often mistaken for the present tense, is the '''present subjunctive''' (&lt;u&gt;(пo-добре) да отидa&lt;u&gt; &quot;I had better go&quot;). The difference between the present indicative and the present subjunctive tense is that the subjunctive can be formed by ''both'' perfective and imperfective verbs. It has completely replaced the infinitive and the supine from complex expressions (see below). It is also employed to express opinion about ''possible'' future events. The '''past perfect subjunctive''' (&lt;u&gt;(пo-добре) да бях отишъл&lt;u&gt;, &quot;I had better gone&quot;) refers to ''possible'' events in the past, which ''did not'' take place, and the '''present pluperfect subjunctive''' (&lt;u&gt;да съм бил отишъл&lt;u&gt;), which may be used about both past and future events arousing feelings of incontinence, suspicion, etc. and is impossible to translate in English. The '''past pluperfect subjunctive''' is by far the strangest form (&lt;u&gt;бил съм бил отишъл&lt;u&gt;) and the reason why the subjunctive in Bulgarian is sometimes also called the '''[[dubitative mood|dubitative]]'''.

The '''[[renarrative mood]]''' has five tenses. Two of them are simple - '''past aorist renarrative''' and '''past imperfect renarrative''' - and are formed by the '''past participles''' of perfective and imperfective verbs, respectively. There are also three compound tenses - '''past future renarrative''', '''past future perfect renarrative''' and '''past perfect renarrative'''. All these tenses' forms are gender-specific in the singular and exist only in the third person.

====Non-finite verbal forms====
The proto-Slavonic '''[[infinitive]]''' and '''[[supine]]''' have been replaced by phrases with &lt;u&gt;да&lt;/u&gt; (“to”) and present subjunctive tense (&lt;u&gt;искам да уча&lt;/u&gt;, “I want to study”).

Bulgarian has the following '''[[participle]]s''':

*the '''present active participle''' (&lt;u&gt;сегашно деятелно причастие&lt;u&gt;) is formed from imperfective stems with the addition of the suffixes '''–ащ'''/'''–ещ'''/'''–ящ''' (&lt;u&gt;укрив'''ащ'''&lt;/u&gt;, “concealing”) and is used only attributively;
*the '''present passive participle''' (&lt;u&gt;сегашно страдателно причастие&lt;u&gt;) is formed by the addition of the suffix '''-н''' to imperfective stems (&lt;u&gt;укрива'''н'''&lt;/u&gt;, “(being) concealed”);
*the '''past active aorist participle''' (&lt;u&gt;минало свършено деятелно причастие&lt;u&gt;) is formed by the addition of the suffix '''–л–''' to perfective stems (&lt;u&gt;укри'''л'''&lt;/u&gt;, “concealed”);
*the '''past active imperfect participle''' (&lt;u&gt;минало несвършено деятелно причастие&lt;u&gt;) is formed by the addition of the suffixes '''–ел'''/'''–ал'''/'''–ял''' to imperfective stems (&lt;u&gt;укрив'''ал'''&lt;/u&gt;, “(been) concealing”); it is used only in renarrative (renarrated) mood and is a Bulgarian innovation;
*the '''past passive participle''' (&lt;u&gt;минало страдателно причастие&lt;u&gt;)  is formed from aorist stems with the addition of the suffixes '''–(е)н–'''/'''–т–''' (&lt;u&gt;укр'''ит'''&lt;u&gt;, &quot;(been) concealed&quot;); it is used predicatively and attributively;
*the '''[[adverbial participle]]''' (&lt;u&gt;деепричастие&lt;u&gt;) is formed from imperfective present stems with the suffix '''–(е)йки'''  (&lt;u&gt;укрива'''йки'''&lt;/u&gt;, “while concealing”), relates an action contemporaneous with and subordinate to the main verb and is originally a Western Bulgarian form.

== Lexis ==
{{main|Bulgarian lexis}}

Most of the word-stock of modern Bulgarian consists of derivations of some 2,000 words inherited from proto-Slavonic through the mediation of Old and Middle Bulgarian. The influence of the old [[Bolgar language]] is relatively insignificant, and a negligible number of words of presumably Bulgar origin have survived in Modern Bulgarian (20 at best according to most estimates, though some scholars will have that number increased up to 200). Thus, the native lexical terms in Bulgarian (both from proto-Slavonic and from the Bulgar language) account for 70% to 75% of the lexicon.

The remaining 25% to 30% are loanwords from a number of languages, as well as derivations of such words. The languages which have contributed most to Bulgarian are [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] (mostly international terminology), and to a lesser extent [[French language|French]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. The numerous loanwords from [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (and, via Turkish, from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]) which were adopted into Bulgarian during the long period of [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] rule have, to a great extent, been substituted with native terms or borrowings from other languages. As in much of the rest of the world, [[English language|English]] has had the greatest influence over Bulgarian over recent decades.

==Syntax==

Colloquial Bulgarian employs [[clitic doubling]], mostly for emphatic purposes. For example:

:Аз го дадох подаръка на майка ми
: (lit. &quot;I gave ''it'' the present to my mother&quot;)

:Аз й го дадох подаръка на майка ми
: (lit. &quot;I gave ''her it'' the present to my mother&quot;)

The phenomenon is practically obligatory in the case of inversion signalling information structure:

:Подаръка (й) го дадох на майка ми
: (lit. &quot;The present (to her) ''it'' I-gave to my mother&quot;)

:На майка ми й (го) дадох подаръка
: (lit. &quot;To my mother ''to her'' (it) I-gave the present&quot;).

In a formal context, however, no clitic doubling is allowed. Bulgarian grammars usually do not treat this phenomenon extensively.

[[Image:Pentagonal dipyramid.png|thumb|right|[[Pentagonal dipyramid]] '''J13''']]
[[Image:octahedron.jpg|thumb|right|Regular [[octahedron]]]]
An ''n''-agonal '''bipyramid''' or '''dipyramid''' is a [[polyhedron]] formed by joining an ''n''-agonal [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]] and its [[mirror image]] base-to-base. 

The referenced n-agon in the name of the bipyramids is not an external face but a internal one, existing on the primary symmetry plane which connects the two pyramid halves.

The face-uniform bipyramids are the [[dual polyhedron|dual polyhedra]] of the [[Prism (geometry)|uniform prisms]] and will generally have [[isosceles triangle]] faces.

Three bipyramids can be made out of all [[equilateral triangle]]s, the [[octahedron]] (tetragonal bipyramid), which counts among the [[Platonic solid]]s, and the [[triangular dipyramid|triangular]] and [[pentagonal dipyramid|pentagonal]] bipyramids, which count among the [[Johnson solid]]s.

A bipyramid can be [[Perspective projection|projected]] on a sphere or [[globe]] as ''n'' equally spaced lines of [[longitude]] going from [[Geographical pole|pole]] to pole, and [[Bisection|bisected]] by a line around the [[equator]].

== Forms ==
# [[Triangular dipyramid]] - 6 faces - dual [[triangular prism]]
# ''Tetragonal dipyramid'' [[octahedron]] - 8 faces - dual [[cube]]
# [[Pentagonal dipyramid]] - 10 faces - dual [[pentagonal prism]]
# ''Hexagonal dipyramid'' - 12 faces - dual [[hexagonal prism]]
# ''Septagonal dipyramid'' - 14 faces - dual ''septagonal prism''
# ''Octagonal dipyramid'' - 16 faces - dual [[octagonal prism]]
# ''Enneagonal dipyramid'' - 18 faces - dual ''enneagonal prism''
# ''Decagonal dipyramid'' - 20 faces - dual ''decagonal prism''
* ...'''n-agonal dipyramid''' - 2n faces - dual '''n-agonal [[prism (geometry)|prism]]'''

== Symmetry groups ==
If the base is regular and the line through the apexes intersects the base at its center, the [[List of spherical symmetry groups|symmetry group]] of the ''n''-agonal bipyramid has [[dihedral symmetry]] ''D&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'' of order 4''n'', except in the case of a regular octahedron, which has the larger [[octahedral symmetry]] group '''O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''' of order 48, which has three versions of ''D&lt;sub&gt;4h&lt;/sub&gt;'' as subgroups.
The [[rotation group]] is ''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' of order 2''n'', except in the case of a regular octahedron, which has the larger symmetry group '''O''' of order 24, which has three versions of ''D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' as subgroups.

The Bangla spelling system is based on a much older version of the language, and thus does not take into acount some sound mergers that have occurred in the spoken language. For example, the alphabet has two letters for the sound [dʒ] and three for the sound [ʃ]. Conversely, a number of letters now have more than one pronunciation; the letter এ can represent either the low vowel [æ] or the high-mid vowel [e]. Furthermore, many letters and diacritics have become &quot;silent letters&quot; in the spoken language. The word for &quot;health&quot;, for example, is written 'swasthyô', but pronounced [ʃast̪ʰo]. With these minor inconsistencies and redundancies, the Bangla script cannot be described as entirely [[phonemic orthography|phonemic]].

This same script, with a few small modifications, is also used for writing [[Assamese]]. Other related languages in the region also make use of the Bangla alphabet. [[Meithei|Meithei (Manipuri)]], a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language used in the Indian state of [[Manipur]], was written in the Bangla alphasyllabary for centuries, until the 1980s, when Meetei Mayek (the Meithei alphasyllabary) returned to daily usage. For centuries, the [[Sylheti]] language used a different script, based on the Devanagari alphasyllabary. This script, called Sylheti Nagori, has now fallen out of use, as most speakers of Sylheti have adopted the Bangla script.

==Sounds==
The [[phoneme|phonemic]] inventory of Bangla consists of 29 consonants and 14 vowels, including the seven [[nasalization|nasalized vowels]]. An approximate [[phonetics|phonetic]] scheme is set out below in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]].

=== Stress ===
Bangla words are virtually all [[trochee|trochaic]]; the primary [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] falls on the initial [[syllable]] of the word, while secondary stress often falls on all odd-numbered syllables thereafter, giving strings such as ['''shô'''-ho-'''jo'''-gi-'''ta'''] &quot;cooperation&quot;, where the '''boldface''' represents primary and secondary stress. The first syllable carries the greatest stress, with the third carrying a somewhat weaker stress, and all following odd-numbered syllables carrying very weak stress.

Adding [[prefix|prefixes]] to a word typically shifts the stress to the left; for example, while the word ['''shob'''-bho] &quot;civilized&quot; carries the primary stress on the first syllable ['''shob'''], adding the [[negation|negative]] prefix [ô-] creates ['''ô'''-shob-bho] &quot;uncivilized&quot;, where the primary stress is now on the newly-added first syllable ['''ô'''].

=== Intonation ===
In a simple [[declarative sentence]], most words and/or phrases in Bangla carry a rising [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]], with the exception of the last word in the sentence, which only carries a low tone. This [[intonation|intonational]] pattern creates a musical tone to the typical Bangla sentence, with low and high tones alternating until the final drop in pitch to mark the end of the sentence.

In sentences involving [[Focus|focused]] words and/or phrases, the rising tones only last until the focused word; all following words carry a low tone. This intonation pattern extends to [[wh-questions]], as wh-words are normally considered to be focused. In [[yes-no questions]], the rising tones may be more exaggerated, and most importantly, the final syllable of the final word in the sentence takes a high falling tone instead of a flat low tone.

=== Vowel Length ===
[[Vowel length]] is not contrastive in Bangla; all else equal, there is no meaningful distinction between a &quot;[[short vowel]]&quot; and a &quot;[[long vowel]]&quot;, unlike the situation in many other Indic languages. However, when [[morpheme]] boundaries come into play, vowel length can sometimes distinguish otherwise [[homophonous]] words. This is due to the fact that [[open syllable|open]] [[monosyllabic|monosyllables]] (i.e. words that are made up of only one syllable, with that syllable ending in the main vowel and not a consonant) have somewhat longer vowels than other syllable types. For example, the vowel in '''cha:''' &quot;tea&quot; is somewhat longer than the first vowel in '''chaţa''' &quot;licking&quot;, as '''cha:''' is a word with only one syllable, and no final consonant. (The long vowel is marked with a colon : in these examples.) The [[suffix]] '''ţa''' &quot;the&quot; can be added to '''cha:''' to form '''cha:ţa''' &quot;the tea&quot;. Even when another morpheme is attached to '''cha:''', the long vowel is preserved. Knowing this fact, some interesting cases of apparent vowel length distinction can be found.

Furthermore, using a form of [[reduplication]] called &quot;echo reduplication&quot;, the long vowel in '''cha:''' can be copied into the reduplicant '''ţa:''', giving '''cha:ţa:''' &quot;tea and all that comes with it&quot;. Thus, in addition to '''cha:ţa''' &quot;the tea&quot; (long first vowel) and '''chaţa''' &quot;licking&quot; (no long vowels), we have '''cha:ţa:''' &quot;tea and all that comes with it&quot; (both long vowels).

=== Consonant Clusters ===
Native Bangla (''tôdbhôb'') words do not allow initial [[consonant cluster|consonant clusters]]; the maximum syllabic structure is CVC (i.e. one vowel flanked by a consonant on each side). Many speakers of Bangla restrict their phonology to this pattern, even when using Sanskrit or English borrowings, such as ''geram'' (CV.CVC) for ''gram'' (CCVC) &quot;village&quot; or ''iskul'' (VC.CVC) for ''skul'' (CCVC) &quot;school&quot;.

Sanskrit (''tôtshôm'') words borrowed into Bangla, however, possess a wide range of clusters, expanding the maximum syllable structure to CCCVC. Some of these clusters, such as the ''mr'' in ''mrittu'' &quot;death&quot; or the ''sp'' in ''spôshţo'' &quot;clear&quot;, have become extremely common, and can be considered legal consonant clusters in Bangla. Other commonly-heard clusters from Sanskrit include ''pr'' (''proshno'' &quot;question&quot;), ''br'' (''brishţi'' &quot;rain&quot;), ''bhr'' (''bhromon'' &quot;travel&quot;), ''tr'' (''trish'' &quot;thirty&quot;), ''dr'' (''druto'' &quot;rapid&quot;), ''kr'' (''krimi'' &quot;worm&quot;), ''gr'' (''gram'' &quot;village&quot;), ''sr'' (''sromik'' &quot;worker&quot;), ''str'' (''stri'' &quot;woman&quot;), ''sth'' (''sthanio'' &quot;local&quot;), and ''sn'' (''snan'' &quot;bath&quot;).

Less commonly-heard clusters from Sanskrit include ''dhr'' (''dhrubo'' &quot;fixed, permanent&quot;), ''ghr'' (''ghrina'' &quot;disgust&quot;), ''ml'' (''mlan'' &quot;melancholy&quot;), ''nr'' (''nritto'' &quot;dance&quot;), ''sph'' (''sphurti'' &quot;delight&quot;), ''st'' (''stômbho'' &quot;tower&quot;), and ''skh'' (''skhôlon'' &quot;slip&quot;).

English and other foreign (''bideshi'') borrowings add even more cluster types into the Bangla inventory, further increasing the syllable capacity to CCCVCCCC, as commonly-used loanwords such as ''ţren'' &quot;train&quot; and ''glash'' &quot;glass&quot; are now even included in leading Bangla dictionaries. Clusters from English borrowings include ''bl'' (''blauz'' &quot;blouse&quot;), ''thr'' (''thru'' or ''thrute'' &quot;through, via&quot;), ''ţr'' (''ţrak'' &quot;truck&quot;), ''đr'' (''đraivar'' &quot;driver&quot;), ''fr'' (''frans'' &quot;France&quot;), ''fl'' (''flaiţ'' &quot;flight&quot;), ''spl'' (''splêsh'' &quot;splash&quot;), ''sţ'' (''sţeshon'' &quot;station&quot;), ''sţr'' (''sţreiţ'' &quot;straight&quot;), ''skr'' (''skru'' &quot;screw&quot;), and ''sm'' (''smarţ'' &quot;smart&quot;). Furthermore, some clusters occasionally found in Sanskrit borrowings are now more commonly heard in English borrowings. These clusters include ''pl'' (''plen'' &quot;plane&quot;), ''kl'' (''klash'' &quot;class&quot;), ''gl'' (''glash'' &quot;glass&quot;), ''sl'' (''sloli'' &quot;slowly&quot;), ''spr'' (''spring'' &quot;spring&quot;), and ''sk'' (''skarţ'' &quot;skirt&quot;).

Most final consonant clusters were borrowed into Bangla from English, as in ''lifţ'' &quot;lift, elevator&quot; and ''bêņk'' &quot;bank&quot;. However, final clusters do exist in some native Bangla words, although rarely in standard pronunciation. One example of a final cluster in a standard Bangla word would be ''gônj'', which is found in names of hundreds of cities and towns across Bengal, including ''Nôbabgônj'' and ''Manikgônj''. Some nonstandard varieties of Bangla make use of final clusters quite often. For example, in some Purbo (eastern) dialects, final consonant clusters consisting of a nasal and its corresponding oral stop are common, as in ''chand'' &quot;moon&quot;. The Standard Bangla equivalent of ''chand'' would be ''chñad'', with a nasalized vowel instead of the final cluster.

==Grammar==
''Main article: [[Bengali grammar]]''

There is no [[gender (grammar)|grammatical gender]] in Bangla. Adjectival [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] is light, while nouns and verbs are highly [[inflection|inflected]]. 

===Nouns===
Nouns and pronouns are inflected for [[declension|case]], including [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Accusative case|objective]], [[genitive case|genitive (possessive)]], and [[locative case|locative]]. The case marking pattern for each noun being inflected depends on the noun's degree of [[animacy]].

&lt;TABLE border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;CAPTION&gt;'''Singular Noun Inflection'''&lt;/CAPTION&gt;

&lt;/TABLE&gt;

When a [[article (grammar)|definite article]] such as ''-ţa'' (singular) or ''-gula'' (plural) is added, as in the table above, nouns are also inflected for [[Grammatical number|number]]. Plural versions of the previous table can be found below:

&lt;/TR&gt;

&lt;TR&gt;

&lt;TD&gt;&lt;DIV align=center&gt;chhatro-'''der''' &lt;br&gt; the students'&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;

&lt;/TR&gt;

&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''Locative'''&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;&lt;DIV align=center&gt; - &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;&lt;DIV align=center&gt;juta-gula-'''te''' &lt;br&gt; on/in the shoes&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

When counted, nouns must also be accompanied by the appropriate [[measure word]]. As in many Asian languages (e.g. [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Thai language|Thai]], etc.), nouns in Bangla cannot be counted directly by adding the numeral directly adjacent to the noun. The noun's measure word ('''MW''') must be used in between the numeral and the noun. Most nouns take the generic measure word ''ţa'', although there are many more specific measure words, such as ''jon'', which is only used to count humans.

{| border=1 align=center cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3
&lt;CAPTION&gt;'''Measure Words'''&lt;/CAPTION&gt;
|align=center|'''Bangla'''

|align=center|Many people
|-
|align=center|Char-pañch-'''jon''' shikkhôk
|align=center|Four-five-'''MW''' teacher
|align=center|Four or five teachers
|}

Measuring nouns in Bangla without their corresponding measure words (e.g. ''aţ biŗal'' instead of ''aţ-'''ţa''' biŗal'' &quot;eight cats&quot;) would typically be considered ungrammatical. However, omitting the noun and preserving the measure word is grammatical and not uncommon to hear. For example, ''Shudhu êk-'''jon''' thakbe.'' (lit. &quot;Only one-'''MW''' will remain.&quot;) would be understood to mean &quot;Only one '''person''' will remain.&quot;, since ''jon'' can only be used to count humans. The word ''lok'' &quot;person&quot; is implied.

===Verbs===
Verbs divide into two classes: finite and non-finite. Non-finite verbs have no inflection for tense or person, while finite verbs are fully inflected for [[Grammatical person|person]] (first, second, third), [[Grammatical tense|tense]] (present, past, future), [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] (simple, perfect, progressive), and [[honorific|honor]] (intimate, familiar, and formal) -- but not for number. [[conditional mood|Conditional]], imperative, and other special inflections for [[grammatical mood|mood]] can replace the tense and aspect suffixes.

While the [[syntax]] of Bangla is not drastically different across the various dialects, the inflectional suffixes in the morphology of Bangla vary from region to region.

===Syntax===

As a Head-Final language, Bangla follows [[Subject Object Verb]] [[word order]], although word order variation is highly common. Bangla makes use of [[postposition|postpositions]], instead of English-style [[preposition|prepositions]]. [[determiner|Determiners]] follow the [[noun]], while numerals, [[adjective|adjectives]], and [[Possession (linguistics)|possessors]] precede the noun.

Yes-no questions do not require any change to the basic word order; instead, the low (L) [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] of the final syllable in the utterance is replaced with a falling (HL) [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]]. Additionally optional [[grammatical particle|particles]] (e.g. [-ki], [-na], etc.) are often [[clitic|encliticized]] onto the first word of a yes-no question.

Wh-questions are formed by fronting the wh-word to [[focus (linguistics)|Focus]] position, which is typically the first or second word in the utterance.

== Vocabulary ==
[[Image:Bengali_Vocabulary.GIF|Sources of Bangla words|250px|right]]
''Main article: [[Origins of Bangla Words]]''

The typical Bangla dictionary lists 75,000 separate words, of which 50,000 (67%) are considered '''tôtshôm''' (direct reborrowings from Sanskrit), 21,100 (28%) are '''tôdbhôb''' (native Bangla vocabulary), and the rest being '''bideshi''' (foreign) and '''deshi''' (indigenous  [[Austroasiatic_languages|Austroasiatic]]) words.

However, these figures do not take into account the fact that a huge chunk of these words are archaic or highly technical, minimizing their actual usage. The productive vocabulary used in modern literary works, in fact, is made up mostly (67%) of tôdbhôb words, while tôtshôm only make up 25% of the total. Deshi and bideshi words together make up the remaining 8% of the vocabulary used in modern Bengali literature.

Due to centuries of contact with [[Europeans]], [[Mughals]], [[Arabs]], [[Persians]], and [[East Asians]], Bangla has absorbed countless words from foreign languages, often totally integrating these [[Loanword|borrowings]] into the core vocabulary. The most common borrowings from foreign languages come from three different kinds of contact. Close contact with neighboring peoples facilitated the borrowing of words from [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and several indigenous [[Austroasiatic_languages|Austroasiatic languages]] of Bengal. After centuries of invasions from [[Persia]] and the [[Middle East]], numerous [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and [[Farsi language|Farsi]] words were absorbed and fully integrated into the lexicon. Later, European colonialism brought words from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[French language|French]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and most significantly [[English language|English]].

==Variation in dialects==
Dialectual differences in Bangla manifest themselves in three forms: [[standardized dialect]] vs. regional dialect, literary language vs. colloquial language and lexical influences.

===Phonological variations===
There are marked dialectal differences between the speech of Bengalis living on the ''Poshchim'' (western) side and ''Purbo'' (eastern) side of the [[Padma River]].

====Fricatives====
In the dialects prevalent in much of eastern Bangladesh ([[Barisal]], [[Chittagong]], [[Dhaka]] and [[Sylhet]] divisions), many of the stops and affricates heard in Kolkata Bangla are pronounced as fricatives.

Poshchim Bangla [[postalveolar consonant|palato-alveolar]] affricates চ [tʃ], ছ [tʃ&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;], জ [{{IPA|d&amp;#658;}}], and ঝ [{{IPA|d&amp;#658;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#614;&lt;/sup&gt;}}] correspond to Purbo Bangla চ&amp;#x02bb; [ts], ছ় [s], জ&amp;#x02bb; [dz], and ঝ় [z]. A similar pronunciation is also found in [[Assamese]], a related language across the border in India.

The aspirated velar stop খ [{{IPA|k&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;}}] and the aspirated labial stop ফ [{{IPA|p&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;}}] of Poshchim Bangla correspond to খ় [x] and ফ় [f] in many dialects of Purbo Bangla. These pronunciations are most extreme in the [[Sylheti language|Sylheti dialect]] of extreme northeastern Bangladesh -- the dialect of Bangla most common in the [[United Kingdom]].

Many Purbo Bangla dialects share phonological features with Assamese, including the debuccalization of শ [{{IPA|ʃ}}] to  হ [h] or খ় [x].

====Tibeto-Burman Influence====
The influence of Tibeto-Burman languages on the phonology of Purbo Bangla is seen through the lack of nasalized vowels, a more fronted place of articulation for the apico-postalveolar stops ট [{{IPA|&amp;#648;}}], ঠ [{{IPA|&amp;#648;&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;}}], ড [{{IPA|&amp;#598;}}], and ঢ [{{IPA|&amp;#598;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#614;&lt;/sup&gt;}}], and the lack of distinction between র [{{IPA| &amp;#638;}}] and ড়/ঢ় [{{IPA|&amp;#637;}}].

Unlike most Indic languages, some Purbo Bangla dialects do not include the breathy voiced stops ঘ [{{IPA|g&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#614;&lt;/sup&gt;}}], ঝ [{{IPA|d&amp;#658;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#614;&lt;/sup&gt;}}], ঢ [{{IPA|&amp;#598;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#614;&lt;/sup&gt;}}], ধ [{{IPA|d&amp;#810;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#614;&lt;/sup&gt;}}], and ভ [{{IPA|b&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#614;&lt;/sup&gt;}}].

Some variants of Bangla, particularly Chittagonian and Chakma Bangla (considered by some to be separate languages), have contrastive [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]; differences in the pitch of the speaker's voice can distinguish words.

===Lexical variations===
The third major factor in dialectical difference, specifically between the dialects of West Bengal and Bangladesh, is a lexical one. Even in Standard Bengali, vocabulary items often divide along the split between the predominantly Muslim Bangladeshi populace and largely Hindu West Bengali populace. Due to their cultural and religious traditions, Muslims occasionally utilize Perso-Arabic words instead of the Sanskrit-derived forms. 

Some examples of lexical alternation between standard West Bengali forms (or commonly called Hindu forms) and their corresponding standard Bangladeshi forms (or commonly called Muslim forms) are as follows:

* hello: nômoshkar (S) corresponds to assalamualaikum/slamalikum (A)
* invitation: nimontron/nimontonno (S) corresponds to daoat (A)
* guest: otithi (S) corresponds to mehman (P)
* sir: môshae (S) corresponds to shaheb (A)
* bath/shower: snan/chan (S) corresponds to gosol (A)
* water: jôl (S) corresponds to pani (S/Hindi)
* meat: mangsho (S) corresponds to gosh/goshto/gosto (P)
* prayer: prarthona (S) corresponds to doa (A)
* god: bhôgoban, ishshor (S) corresponds to Allah (A), Khoda (P)
* mother: ma (S) corresponds to amma (A)
* father: baba (S) corresponds to abba (A)
* maternal aunt: mashi (S) corresponds to khala (A)
* paternal aunt: pishi (S) corresponds to fupi/fupu (P)
* paternal uncle: kaka (S) corresponds to chacha (S/Hindi)

(here S = derived from Sanskrit; A = derived from Arabic, P = derived from Persian)  

The differences above depend on the region contemplated and are not always clearly distinct. For example, many people in West Bengal continue to use the words ''chan'' and ''gosol'' (or ''nimontron'' and ''daoat'') interchangeably with no particular bias towards one word or the other; a similar situation prevails (even among Muslims) in Hindu majority and Western regions of Bangladesh. Additionally, ''baba'' and ''ma'' are also heard often in Bangladesh.

Though ''jôl'', ''pani'', ''kaka'', and ''chacha'' are all Sanskrit derivatives, ''pani'' and ''chacha'' became more associated with the [[Hindustani language]] that imbibed so much of [[Mughal]] culture and so became the word of choice for Muslim speakers of Bangla.

Furthermore, there are cases where speakers of Standard Bangla in West Bengal will use a different word than a speaker of Standard Bangla in Bangladesh, even though both words are of native Bangla descent. Because each pair of words is made up of only native vocabulary, the choice of which word to use is not based on one's religion, but on regional usage. Examples of such cases are listed below, with the West Bengali standard marked (W) and the Bangladeshi standard marked (E):

* salt: nun (W) corresponds to lôbon (E)
* turmeric: holdi (W) corresponds to holud (E)
* chili pepper: lôngka (W) corresponds to morich (E)
* with: shôngge (W) corresponds to shathe (E)
* husband's sister: thakurjhi (W) corresponds to nônod (E)

Note that these differences reflect the vocabulary of the standard varieties of Bangla in West Bengali and Bangladesh. Variation in the vocabulary of the countless regional dialects of both West Bengal and Bangladesh are even more pronounced.

==Bangla literature==
''Main article: [[Bangla literature]]''

The first evidence of Bangla literature is [[Charyapada]] or Charyageeti, buddhist hymns or dohas from the 8th century.

[[Image:Rabindranath.png|Rabindranath Tagore|frame|right]]
Possibly the most prolific writer in Bangla is [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. Tagore dominated both the Bengali and Indian philosophical and literary scene for decades. His 2,000 ''Rabindrasangeets'' play a pivotal part in defining Bengali culture, both in West Bengal and Bangladesh. He is the author of the [[national anthem|national anthems]] of both [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]], both composed in Bangla. Other notable Bangla works of his are ''[[Gitanjali]]'', a book of poems for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913, and many short stories and a few novels.

In a similar category is [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], a Muslim who was invited to post-partition Bangladesh as the [[National Poet]] and whose work transcends sectarian boundaries.  Adored by Bengalis both in Bangladesh and West Bengal, his work includes 3,000 songs, known as ''nazrul geeti''. He is frequently called the '''rebel poet''' because of his strong involvement in revolution leading to India's independence from British Rule. His songs and poems were frequently used during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] as well. 

[[Michael Madhusudan Dutt]], a Christian by conversion, is best known for his [[Ramayana]]-based masterpiece, &quot;The Slaying of Meghnadh,&quot; (in Bengali &quot;''Meghnadh Bodh Kabbo''&quot; (&amp;#2478;&amp;#2503;&amp;#2456;&amp;#2472;&amp;#2494;&amp;#2470; &amp;#2476;&amp;#2471; &amp;#2453;&amp;#2494;&amp;#2476;&amp;#2509;&amp;#2479;)),  which essentially follows in the poetic tradition of [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''Paradise Lost''. Those who have read it consider this work a world-class epic poem of the modern era. Michael Madhusudan Dutta is also credited with the introduction of sonnets to Bangla literature.

[[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay]] was an author whose speciality was exploring complex human psychology. [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]] was one of the earliest Bengali novelists and is popularly known as the author of India's first ''national song'', &quot;Bande M&amp;#257;tarom&quot; (pronounced in Hindi &quot;[[Vande Mataram|Vande M&amp;#257;t&amp;#257;ram]]&quot;). Tarashankar Bandopadhay was another famous novelist whose works feature a realistic picture of the many-colored fabric of life in rural Bengal.

[[Jibanananda Das]] was a famous poet who, along with Buddhadev Basu, marks the beginning of the move to transcend the Tagore legacy. The new genere of Bengali poets departed considerably from Tagore's ideological style and adoped realism in their writing more pronouncedly. Titled '''polli-kobi''' (''Poet of the Village'') for works relating to the villages and countryside of Bengal, [[Jasimuddin]] is particularly famous for his poems that have become major highlights for pedagogical purposes in both West Bengal and Bangladesh.

Seminal Hindu religious works in Bangla include the many songs of [[Ramprasad Sen]]. His works (still sung today) from the 17th century cover an astonishing range of emotional responses to the goddess [[Kali]], detailing complex philosophical statements based on [[Vedanta]] teachings and more visceral prouncements of his love of the goddess. There are also the laudatory accounts of the lives and teachings of the [[Vaishnava]] saint [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] (the ''Choitanyo Chorit&amp;#257;mrit'') and [[Devi]] [[Advaitist]] Shri [[Ramakrishna]] (the ''Ramakrishna Kathamrita'', translated roughly as Gospel of Ramakrishna). There is also a large body of Islamic literature, that can be traced back atleast to ''Noornama'' by [[Abdul Hakim]]. ''Bishad Sindhu'' depicting the death of Hussain in [[Karbala]] is very popular novel written by [[Mir Mosharraf Hossain]]. Later works influenced by Islam include devotional songs written by Nazrul, and popularized by [[Abbas Uddin]], among others.

The mystic [[Baul]]s of the Bengal countryside who preached the boundless spiritual truth of ''Sôhoj Pôth'' (the Simple, Natural Path) and ''Moner M&amp;#257;nush'' (The Man of The Heart) drew on Vedantic philosophy to propound transcendental truths in song format, traveling from village to village proclaiming that there was no such thing as Hindu, Muslim or Christian, only ''moner m&amp;#257;nush.''

The literature discussed so far can be more or less regarded as the common heritage of both [[Bangladesh]] and [[West Bengal]]. Since the partition of [[Bengal]] in 1947, the east and west parts of Bengal have also developed their own distinctive literatures. For example, the [[Naxalite]] movement has influenced much of West Bengal's literature, whereas the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Liberation War]] has had a similarly profound impact on [[Bangladesh]]i literature.  

Major literary figures in Bangladesh include [[Shamsur Rahman]], [[Sufia Kamal]], [[Hasan Azizul Huq]], [[Akhtaruzzaman Ilias]] and [[Humayun Azad]] , to name a few. Some notable writers from West Bengal are [[Sunil Gangopadhyay]], [[Shankha Ghosh]], [[Shakti Chattopadhyay]], [[Mahasweta Devi]] and [[Joy Goswami]].

== Modern History ==
Until the [[18th century]], Bangla did not have a well-documented grammar. Bangla existed as a collection of thousands of dialects.  The first written Bangla grammar, ''Vocabolario em idioma Bengalla, e Portuguez dividido em duas partes'', was written by Manoel da Assumpcam, a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[missionary]]. Assumpcam wrote this grammar between [[1734]] and [[1742]] while he was serving in [[Bhawal]]. Nathaniel Brassey Halhed, a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[grammarian]], is credited as being the first to write a Bangla grammar using Bangla texts and letters for illustration: ''A Grammar of the Bengal Language ([[1778]])''. [[Raja Ram Mohan Roy]], the great Bengali Reformer, also published a book &quot;Grammar of the Bengali Language&quot; in [[1832]]. Since then, the written form of Bengali has gone under numerous changes. Perhaps the most important was the adoption of ''Cholti Bhasha'' over ''Shadhu Bhasha'' (an archaic form of the language) as the form of choice for written Bangla, spearheaded by Pramatha Choudhury. Spoken and written Bangla continues to evolve in both [[West Bengal]] and [[Bangladesh]].

=== Language movements ===
There have been several incidents of popular uprisings to protect the status of Bangla. Most notable among these is the [[Language movement]] of [[1952]], in [[East Pakistan]]. There have been other incidents in Bangla-speaking regions of [[India]] as well.

Between the years of [[1947]] and [[1971]], what is now known as Bangladesh was part of [[Pakistan]] (and first known as [[East Bengal (province)|East Bengal]] and later [[East Pakistan]]). During this period, the Bangla language became the focus and foundation of the national identity of the [[Bengali people]], leading ultimately to the creation of the sovereign state of [[Bangladesh]].

Around [[1950]]-[[1952|52]], the emerging middle class of [[East Bengal]] underwent an uprising known later as the ''Bhasha Andolon'', or [[Language Movement]]. Bengalis (then East Pakistanis) were initially agitated by a decision by the central Pakistani government to establish [[Urdu]] as the sole national language for all of [[Pakistan]], despite the fact that Urdu was only a minority language spoken by the supposed elite class of what was then [[West Pakistan]]. At the peak of resentment, on [[February 21]], [[1952]], Bengali students (mainly of [[Dhaka Medical College and Hospital]] and [[University of Dhaka]]) and activists walked into military and police fire and were killed in demand of the recognition and establishment of the Bangla language - spoken by the majority of the then-Pakistani population - as one of the, if not the sole, national language of erstwhile Pakistan.  The day is revered in modern-day Bangladesh and, to a somewhat lesser extent, in [[West Bengal]] as the [[Language Martyrs' Day]]. [[UNESCO]] decided to observe [[21 February]] as [[International Mother Language Day]]. The UNESCO General Conference took a decision to that took effect on [[17 November]] [[1999]] when it unanimously adopted a draft resolution submitted by Bangladesh and co-sponsored and supported by 28 other countries.

In 1961, the Government of the Indian state of [[Assam]] passed legislation making the use of Assamese language compulsory. This legislation resulted in widespread protest across [[Assam]]. In one such incident, 11 people were killed due to police firing in Silchar in southern [[Assam]]. Coming under intense pressure, the Government withdrew the legislation &lt;ref name=&quot;silchar&quot;&gt; [http://www.swordoftruth.com/swordoftruth/archives/readersvoice/ulmobvoa.html Silchar police firing incident] &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">:'''''Bobby Moore''' is also the original name of former [[American football]] player and current sportscaster [[Ahmad Rashad]].''

'''Robert Frederick Chelsea &quot;Bobby&quot; Moore''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] ([[April 12]], [[1941]] - [[February 24]], [[1993]]) was an [[England|English]] [[football (soccer)|footballer]] whose place in footballing history is secure as the captain of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]] and the English {{Wc|1966}}-winning team.  

Moore joined West Ham as a schoolboy and was a regular in the first team by [[1960]]. A composed central [[defender (football)|defender]], Moore was admired more for his reading of the game and ability to anticipate opposition movements, thereby distancing himself from the image of the hard-tackling, high-jumping defender. Indeed, Moore's ability to head the ball or keep up with the pace was average at best, but the way he marshalled his team and timed his tackles marked him out as world class.  In fact, [[Pelé]] used to call Moore the fairest defender he had ever played against.

He was in the [[England national football team|England]] squad for the [[Football World Cup 1962|1962 World Cup]] in [[Chile]], when England reached the quarter finals, and was captain of his country within another two years. In [[1964]], he skippered West Ham United to success in the [[FA Cup]] final at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] where they beat [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] 3-2, the first of three successive trips to the national stadium in major finals in as many years for Moore, and from which he would emerge undefeated.

In [[1965]], Wembley hosted West Ham's 2-0 victory over [[1860 Munich]] in the [[Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners Cup]], then in [[1966]], Moore was the leader of the side which gave English football its crowning glory and established him as a magnificent player, gentleman and sporting icon. His West Ham team-mate [[Geoff Hurst]] scored an historic [[hat-trick]] in the 4-2 [[Football World Cup|World Cup]] final win over [[Germany national football team|West Germany]], with Moore supplying pinpoint passes for two of his goals. Of many timeless images from that day, one is of Moore gallantly wiping his hands clean of mud on the velvet platform the [[Jules Rimet Trophy]] rested before shaking the hand of Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] as she presented him with the World Cup.

Moore faithfully pursued his West Ham and England career and was once again named as captain when England travelled to [[Mexico]] to defend the World Cup in [[1970]]. There was heavy disruption to preparations, however, when an attempt was made to implicate Moore in the theft of a bracelet from a jeweller in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]], where England had travelled for some warm-up games in order to get acclimatised with high altitude conditions. The charges were subsequently dropped, Moore was wholly exonerated and he was eventually permitted to rejoin his team-mates in Mexico.

In the group game against favourites [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], there was a defining moment for Moore when he tackled the great [[Jairzinho]] with such precision and cleanliness that many cite is a tackle which no-one will ever better. Brazil still won the game, but England also progressed through the group.

Defeat after extra time against West Germany saw England bow out in the last eight, and it would be 12 years before England were to return to a World Cup finals again.

Moore ended up with 108 England caps, breaking the record held by his fellow 1966 hero [[Bobby Charlton]] by just two appearances. Only [[Peter Shilton]], with whom Moore also played at international level, has since played more times for his country. Moore's last appearance in an England shirt was in [[1973]].

In 1974 prior to the World Cup in Germany Moore played the first-half in a charity match in the Duesseldorf Rheinstadion before suddenly and mysteriously leaving at half-time without collecting his match fee to catch a plane back to London feigning an &quot;emergency.&quot; At full-time many players complained of missing valuables and cash in the team dressing-room and accused Moore of taking them.  

A year later, Moore was allowed to leave his beloved West Ham after more than 15 years and joined London rivals [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], who were in the second division. Somehow, in his first season, they reached the FA Cup final where they were to play none other than Moore's old club West Ham. It was, however, no fairytale farewell ending for Moore as Fulham lost 2-0.

Moore played for two teams in the [[North American Soccer League]], [[San Antonio Thunder]] in 1976 and [[Seattle Sounders]] in 1978.  Seatle was the last team he played professional football for.

 [[Image:Sonny1.jpg|thumb|Bobby playing for [[San Antonio Thunder]].]]

Moore retired from playing in [[1977]] and had a short, relatively unsuccessful, spell in football management.  His life after football was eventful and difficult, with business deals going wrong and his marriage ending. Many have since said that [[the Football Association]] could have given a role to Moore, as the only Englishman to captain a World Cup winning team.  Moore himself kept a dignified silence.

On [[15 February]] [[1993]] Moore announced he was suffering from [[bowel cancer]]. He succumbed to the illness just seven days after commentating on an England match at his spiritual home, Wembley, when England beat San Marino 6-0.

Moore was made an Inaugural Inductee of the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] in 2002 in recognition of his impact on the English game as player

The stand replacing the south bank at West Ham's ground, the [[Boleyn Ground]] in [[Upton Park]] has since been named the Bobby Moore Stand.

He was married twice, firstly to Christina Dean on [[30 June]] [[1962]] and secondly to Stephanie Parlane-Moore on [[4 December]] [[1991]].

{{succession box|title=[[FWA Footballer of the Year|Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year]]|before=[[Stanley Matthews]] |after=[[Bobby Collins]]|years=1964}}
{{succession box|title=[[kolveurieg'') was given official recognition by the French authorities as the &quot;official orthography of Breton in French education&quot;. This orthography was met with strong opposition and is largely only used by the magazine ''Brud Nevez'' and the publishing house Emgléo Breiz.

Between 1971 and 1974 has been fixed a new standard orthography. The ''etrerannyezhel'' or ''interdialectale''. This system is based on derivation of the words.

Today the majority of writers continue to use the Peurunvan orthography, including most Breton-language schools.

===Differences between OU and Peurunvan===
Both orthographies make use of the [[Latin alphabet]], with the supplemental signs ''â, ê, î, ñ, ô, û, ù, ü'', and ''é'' which is used only in OU.

Differences between the two systems are particularly noticeable in word endings. In Peurunvan final [[obstruent|obstruents]] which are devoiced in absolute final position and voiced in [[sandhi]] before voiced sounds are represented by a grapheme indicating a voiceless sound. In OU they are written as voiced but represented as voiceless before suffixes: '''braz''' ''big'', '''brasoh''' ''bigger''.

In addition, Peurunvan maintains the KLT convention which distinguishes noun/adjective pairs with nouns written with a final voiced consonant and adjectives with a voiceless one (there is, however, no distinction in pronunciation), e.g. '''brezhoneg''' ''Breton language'' vs. '''brezhonek''' ''Breton (adj)''

Some examples of words in both orthographies:

{|
| '''Etrerannyezhel (1975)''' || '''Peurunvan (1941)'''  ||  '''Skolveureg (1956)'''
|-
| ''glaw''|| ''glav''  ||  ''glao''
|-
| ''piw''|| ''piv''   ||  ''piou''
|-
| ''levr''|| ''levr''  ||  ''leor''
|-
| ''ewid''|| ''evit''  ||  ''evid''
|-
| ''gant''|| ''gant''  ||  ''gand''
|-
| ''anezhi''|| ''anezhi''  ||   ''anezi''

|-
| ''brawañ''|| ''bravañ''  ||  ''brava''

|}

Visitors to Brittany may encounter words and phrases (especially on signs and posters) such as the following:

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Dun Carloway.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Dun Carloway]] broch, [[Lewis]], Scotland]]

The '''Broch''' is an [[Iron Age]] [[round tower]] fortification type unique to [[Scotland]].

The origin of brochs remains a mystery. Some archaeologists believed the brochs were built by an influx of broch builders who had been displaced and pushed northward during the Roman invasion of Britain. However, this theory has been largely disproven and current thought is that they were built by itinerant craftsmen since so many were built to almost the same exact design. The youngest surviving broch at Mousa dates from 100BC to 100AD with most being older. The distribution of brochs is centred on north west Scotland although isolated examples occur in the [[Scottish Borders|borders]] (for example [[Edin's Hall Broch]]) and near [[Stirling]].

Early in the use of a broch (from the middle of the [[1st millennium BC]] until the early [[3rd century]] AD) they would be used purely as defensive structures, places of refuge for communities and their livestock. As the Iron Age slowly gave way to the early [[Medieval]] period, however, it seems the defensive value of the broch design was lost. They became the [[stately home|Stately homes]] of their time, objects of prestige and superiority for rich merchants.

A typical broch is 20 metres in diameter, with 3 metre thick walls. On average, the walls only survive to 4 metres. More often than not, the walls are hollow, containing flat storage spaces (called galleries or cells) and steps to higher floors. Beside the door, it is normal for there to be a cell breaking off from the passage into the central space; this is known as the guard cell although there is no evidence it had any defensive value. However, it has been found in some Shetland brochs that guard cells in entrance passageways are close to large door-check stones.

On the [[Orkney Islands|Orkney]] and [[Shetland Islands|Shetland]] Islands there are very few cells at ground floor level. However, brochs in this region have scarcements (ledges) which would have allowed the construction of a very sturdy first floor.

[[Image:Scotland Glenelg broch.jpg|thumb|Dun Telve broch, [[Glenelg, Scotland|Glenelg]], Scotland]]

Brochs were always placed in locations which were easily defended, close to [[arable land]] and a source of water (many have deep wells or natural springs rising within their central space). They are often built beside the sea and on the site of previous dwellings such as [[Roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouses]].

Some good examples of brochs on [[Shetland Islands|Shetland]] are [[Mousa Broch]] (the walls here are fully intact, standing some 13m high), at [[Clickimin]] in [[Lerwick]], at [[Levenwick]] and in [[Culswick]]. Elsewhere, in [[Glenelg, Scotland|Glenelg]] (a galleried dun can also be seen here) and at [[Dun Carloway]] on [[Lewis]].  The best brochs in the [[Orkney Islands]] are at [[Gurness]] and [[Midhowe]].

The Shetland Amenity Trust list about 120 sites in [[Shetland]] as candidate brochs.

The skills involved in broch building are currently being explored by drystone dyker [http://www.brochbuild.co.uk/ Irwin Campbell].

'''Billy Crystal''' (born [[March 14]], [[1947]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[actor]], [[writer]], [[film producer|producer]], and [[film director]].

== Personal Life ==
Crystal was born in [[Long Beach, New York]] to [[Jewish]]-[[United States|American]] parents Jack and Helen Crystal. His father worked at, and later managed, the Commodore Music Shop. His uncle was record producer [[Milt Gabler]]. He went to [[Marshall University]] in [[Huntington, West Virginia]] on a baseball scholarship, having learned the game from his father, who pitched for St. John's University. Crystal, however never played a game at Marshall because the program was suspended during his freshman year and he didn't return as a sophomore, staying back in New York with his future wife. He has been married to Janice Goldfinger, with whom he has two daughters, since 1970.

== Career ==
Crystal returned to New York and studied film and television direction under [[Martin Scorsese]] at [[New York University]]. Crystal's earliest prominent role was as &quot;Jodie Dallas&quot; on ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'', one of the first [[List of television shows with lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgendered characters|gay characters]] portrayed on American television. 

He was scheduled to appear on the first episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (October 11, 1975), but his sketch was cut.  After hosting a show years later, in [[1984 in television|1984]], he joined the cast.  His most famous recurring sketch was his parody of [[Fernando Lamas]]. Crystal's &quot;Fernando&quot; is a smarmy talkshow host whose [[catch phrase]], &quot;You look mahvelous!&quot; became a media sensation.  
[[Image:Billy_crystal_on_hollywood_squares.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Crystal on ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''.]]
He appeared briefly in [[Rob Reiner]]'s [[1984 in film|1984]] &quot;[[rockumentary]]&quot; ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]''. Eventually, Reiner directed Crystal again in The Princess Bride and then in the romantic comedy ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'', for which Crystal was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]].

Crystal wrote, directed and starred in ''[[Forget Paris]]'' ([[1995 in film|1995]]) and ''[[Mr. Saturday Night]]'' ([[1992 in film|1992]]). He directed the made for television movie [[61*]] based on [[Roger Maris]] and [[Mickey Mantle]]'s race to break [[Babe Ruth]]'s single-season home run record in 1961. This earned Crystal an [[Emmy]] nomination for ''Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special''.

In [[1986]], Crystal started hosting ''[[Comic Relief]]'' on [[Home Box Office|HBO]] with [[Robin Williams]], and [[Whoopi Goldberg]]. Comic Relief, which was founded in [[1986]] by [[Andy Kaufman]] sidekick [[Bob Zmuda]], raises money for homeless men, women and children in the [[United States]]. 

Crystal hosted the [[Academy Award]]s broadcast in [[1990]], [[1991]], [[1992]], [[1993]], [[1997]], [[1998]], [[2000]] and [[2004]], and, apparently, turned down the opportunity to host the [[2006]] ceremony wanting to concentrate on his one-man show.

During the 1992 Academy Awards broadcast, Crystal at one point during the show, looked squarely at the camera and said, &quot;Didn't inhale&quot;, a commentary on then Presidential candidate [[Bill Clinton]] (who had claimed that he &quot;didn't inhale&quot; when smoking [[marijuana]]). The line is considered by some as one of the funniest lines in Academy Awards history.

Crystal continued working, appearing in popular films such as &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot; and then &quot;Analyze This&quot; with [[Robert De Niro]]. &quot;Analyze This&quot; even had a sequel, where both Crystal and De Niro returned, called &quot;Analyze That&quot;.

Crystal is preparing for the national tour of his hit solo show ''[[700 Sundays]]''. The two-act play, which he conceived and wrote, is about his parents and his childhood growing up on [[Long Island]]. Crystal won the 2005 [[Tony Award]] for Best Special Theatrical Event for ''700 Sundays'' and will bring the show back to Broadway for a limited run in 2006. 

Following the initial success of the play, Crystal wrote the book ''700 Sundays'' for [[Warner Books]], which was published on [[October 31]], [[2005]]. In conjunction with the book and the play, which also paid tribute to Gabler, Crystal produced two CD compilations: ''Billy Crystal Presents: The Milt Gabler Story'' featured the most influential recordings his uncle produced from [[Billie Holiday]]'s &quot;[[Strange Fruit]]&quot; to &quot;[[Rock Around the Clock]]&quot; by [[Bill Haley &amp; His Comets]]; ''Billy Remembers Billie'' featured Crystal's favorite Holiday recordings.

Crystal has lend his voice to an animated character in [[2001]]'s ''Monsters, Inc.'' as the voice of Mike, and in the English version of ''Howl's Moving Castle'' as the voice of [[Calcifer]].

On Tuesday [[September 6]], [[2005]] on [[The Tonight Show]] Crystal and [[Jay Leno]] were the first celebrities to sign a [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle to be auctioned off for Gulf Coast relief.

:''For any questions on black holes see [[Black hole FAQ]]''

A '''black hole''' is a concentration of [[mass]] great enough that the force of gravity prevents anything from escaping it except through [[quantum tunnelling]] behaviour (known as [[Hawking Radiation]]). The [[gravitational field]] is so strong that the [[escape velocity]]  near it exceeds the [[speed of light]]. This implies that nothing, not even [[light]], can escape its [[gravity]]. The term &quot;black hole&quot; is widespread, even though it does not refer to a ''hole'' in the usual sense, but rather a region of [[space]] from which nothing can return.

The existence of black holes in the [[universe]] is well supported by astronomical observation, particularly from studying [[X-ray]] emission from [[X-ray binaries]] and [[active galactic nuclei]].

==History==
The concept of a body so massive that not even light could escape it was put forward by the [[England|English]] [[geologist]] [[John Michell]] in a 1783 paper sent to the [[Royal Society]]. At that time, the [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] theory of [[gravity]] and the concept of [[escape velocity]] were well known. Michell computed that a body 500 times the [[radius]] of the Sun and of the same [[density]] would have, at its surface, an escape velocity equal to the [[speed of light]], and therefore would be [[invisible]]. In his words:
: ''If the semi-diameter of a sphere of the same density as the Sun were to exceed that of the Sun in the proportion of 500 to 1, a body falling from an infinite height towards it would have acquired at its surface greater velocity than that of light, and consequently supposing light to be attracted by the same force in proportion to its vis inertiae (inertial mass), with other bodies, all light emitted from such a body would be made to return towards it by its own proper gravity.''

Although he thought it unlikely, Michell considered the possibility that many such objects that cannot be seen might be present in the cosmos.

In 1796, the [[France|French]] mathematician [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] promoted the same idea in the first and second edition of his book ''[[Exposition du Systeme du Monde]].'' It disappeared in later editions. The whole idea gained little attention in the 19th century, since light was thought to be a massless wave, not influenced by gravity.

In 1915, [[Albert_Einstein|Einstein]] developed the theory of gravity called [[General relativity|General Relativity]]. Earlier he had shown that gravity does influence light. A few months later, [[Karl Schwarzschild]] gave the [[Schwarzschild metric| solution]] for the gravitational field of a point mass, showing that something we now call a black hole could theoretically exist. The [[Schwarzschild radius]] is now known to be the radius of the [[event horizon]] of a non-rotating black hole, but this was not well understood at that time. Schwarzschild himself thought it was not physical.

In the 1920s, [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] argued that special relativity demonstrated that a non-radiating body above 1.44 solar masses, now known as the [[Chandrasekhar limit]], would collapse since there was nothing known at that time that could stop it from doing so.  His arguments were opposed by [[Arthur Eddington]], who believed that something would inevitably stop the collapse.  Both were correct, since a [[white dwarf]] more massive than the Chandrasekhar limit will collapse into a [[neutron star]].  However, a neutron star above about three solar masses will itself become unstable against collapse due to similar physics.

In 1939, [[Robert Oppenheimer]] and H. Snyder predicted that massive stars could undergo a dramatic [[gravitational collapse]]. Black holes could, in principle, be formed in nature. Such objects for a while were called '''frozen stars''' since the collapse would be observed to rapidly slow down and become heavily [[redshift|redshifted]] near the Schwarzschild radius.  The mathematics showed that an outside observer would see the surface of the star frozen in time at the instant where it crosses that radius.  However, these hypothetical objects were not the topic of much interest until the late 1960s.  Most physicists believed that they were a peculiar feature of the highly symmetric solution found by Schwarzschild, and that objects collapsing in nature would not form black holes.

Interest in black holes was rekindled in 1967 because of theoretical and experimental progress. [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Roger Penrose]] proved that black holes are a generic feature in Einstein's theory of gravity, and cannot be avoided in some collapsing objects. Interest was renewed in the astronomical community with the discovery of [[pulsar]]s. Shortly thereafter, the use of the expression &quot;black hole&quot; was coined by theoretical physicist [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] [http://www.truephysics.com/timeline/timeline1961_1980.html]. The older Newtonian objects of Michell and Laplace are often referred to as &quot;[[dark star]]s&quot; to distinguish them from the &quot;black holes&quot; of general relativity.

==Evidence==

[[Image:Black_Hole_Milkyway.jpg|thumb|250px|A (simulated) Black Hole of ten solar masses as seen from a distance of 600km with the Milky Way in the background (horizontal camera opening angle: 90°).]]
===Formation===
General relativity (as well as most other metric theories of gravity) not only says that black holes ''can'' exist, but in fact predicts that they will be formed in nature whenever a sufficient amount of mass gets packed in a given region of space, through a process called [[gravitational collapse]].  For example, if you compressed the Sun to a radius of three kilometers, about four millionths of its present size, it would become a black hole. As the mass inside the given region of space increases, its gravity becomes stronger &amp;mdash; or, in the language of relativity, the space around it becomes increasingly deformed.  Eventually gravity gets so strong that nothing can escape; an [[event horizon]] is formed, and matter and energy must inevitably collapse into a [[gravitational singularity|singularity]].

A quantitative analysis of this idea led to the prediction that a star remaining about three to five times the mass of the Sun (the [[Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit]]) at the end of its [[stellar evolution|evolution]], will almost inevitably shrink to the critical size needed to undergo a gravitational collapse.  Once collapse starts, it cannot be stopped by any physical force, and a black hole is created.  This is because there is a limit tor>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Breathy voice''' or '''murmured voice''' is a [[phonation]] in which the [[vocal cords]] vibrate, as they do in normal (modal) voicing, but are held further apart, so that a larger volume of air escapes between them. This produces an audible noise. A breathy-voiced phonation {{IPA|[ɦ]}} (not actually a [[fricative]], as a literal reading of the IPA chart would suggest) can be heard as an [[allophone]] of English /h/ between vowels, eg. in ''behind''. A stop with breathy-voiced release (symbolised either as {{IPA|[bʱ], [dʱ], [gʱ],}} ''etc.'' or as {{IPA|[b̤], [d̤], [g̈],}} ''etc.'') is like [[aspiration]] in that it delays the onset of full voicing. This is the phonation of the [[Hindi]] &quot;voiced aspirated stops&quot; ''bh, dh, jh, gh.''

There are several ways to generate breathy-voiced sounds like {{IPA|[ɦ]}}. One is to hold the vocal cords apart, so that they are lax as they are for [h], but to increase the volume of airflow so that they vibrate loosely. A second is to bring the vocal cords closer together along their entire length than in voiceless [h], but not as close as in modally voiced sounds such as vowels. This results in an airflow intermediate between [h] and vowels, and is the case with English intervocalic /h/. A third is to constrict the glottis, but separate the [[arytenoid cartilage]]s that control one end. This results in the vocal cords being drawn together for voicing in the back, but separated to allow the passage of large volumes of air in the front. This is the situation with Hindi.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[number theory]], '''Bézout's identity''', named after [[Étienne Bézout]], is a [[linear equation|linear]] [[diophantine equation]]. It states that if ''a'' and ''b'' are [[integer|integers]] with [[greatest common divisor]] ''d'', then there exist integers ''x'' and ''y'' such that
:''ax'' + ''by'' = ''d''. 
Numbers ''x'' and ''y'' as above can be determined with the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]], but they are not uniquely determined.

For example, the greatest common divisor of 12 and 42 is 6, and we can write

:''12x'' + ''42y'' = ''6''.

with some of the solutions being

:(-3)·12 + 1·42 = 6
and also
:4·12 + (-1)·42 = 6.

The greatest common divisor ''d'' of ''a'' and ''b'' is in fact the smallest positive integer that can be written in the form ''ax'' + ''by''.

Bézout's identity works not only in the [[ring (algebra)|ring]] of integers, but also in any other [[principal ideal domain]] (PID).
That is, if ''R'' is a PID, and ''a'' and ''b'' are elements of ''R'', and ''d'' is a greatest common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'',
then there are elements ''x'' and ''y'' in ''R'' such that ''ax'' + ''by'' = ''d''. The reason: the [[ideal (mathematics)|ideal]] ''Ra''+''Rb'' is principal and indeed is equal to ''Rd''.

To confirm:
In some credible books, this identity has been attributed to French mathematician [[Claude Gaspard Bachet de Méziriac]].

'''''Banacek''''' (one of the rotating ''[[NBC Mystery Movie]]'' series) was a short lived light hearted detective [[Television programs|TV series]] on [[NBC]] from [[1972]] to [[1974]].  [[George Peppard]] played Thomas Banacek, a [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]-based freelance investigator who worked mostly for finder's fees offered by insurance companies by solving seemingly impossible theft cases.  The show had a mixture of humor combined with rather intricate plots that never generated the ratings needed to keep it on the air. Banacek's catch-phrase was, &quot;There's an old [[Poland|Polish]] proverb that says ...&quot;. 

Also featured were [[Ralph Manza]] as Banacek's chauffeur Jay Drury, [[Murray Matheson]] as rare-bookstore owner Felix Mulholland, and [[Christine Belford]] as Carlie Kirkland.

''Banacek'' alternated in its timeslot with several other shows, but it was the only one to last beyond its first season. It was later rebroadcast on [[A&amp;E Network]].

[[Image:BAHR6.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Blue Angels fly their F-4J Phantoms cross-country between show sites in a [[line abreast]] formation.]]
The [[United States Navy]]'s '''Blue Angels''' (or '''Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron'''), formed at the end of [[World War II]], is the world's first officially-sanctioned military aerial demonstration team. The team started out flying 3 aircraft in formation, then four, and currently operates 6 aircraft per show.

The team is split into &quot;the Diamond&quot; (Blue Angels 1 through 4) and the Opposing Solos (Blue Angels 5 and 6). Most of their display alternates between maneuvers performed by the diamond, and those performed by the solos. The diamond performs maneuvers in tight formation, usually at lower speeds, such as formation loops and barrel rolls or transitions from one formation to another. The opposing solos usually perform their maneuvers just under the speed of sound, and show off the capabilities of their individual F/A-18s through the execution of high-speed passes, slow passes, fast rolls, slow rolls, and very tight turns. Some of the maneuvers include both solo F/A-18s performing at once, such as opposing passes (where the solos fly towards each other in what appears to be a collision course, and then narrowly miss one another) and mirror formations (the two F/A-18s being flown back-to-back or belly-to-belly; in such formations, one of the aircraft is often inverted). At the end of the routine, all 6 aircraft join in formation and execute the team's signature &quot;[[fleur-de-lis]]&quot; closing maneuver.

The parameters of each show must be tailored to the local visibility: in clear weather the &quot;high&quot; show is performed, in overcast conditions it is the &quot;low&quot; show that the spectators see, and in limited visibility (weather permitting) the &quot;flat&quot; show is presented.  The &quot;high&quot; show requires an 8,000 foot ceiling and visibility of three nautical miles from the show's centerpoint.  &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;flat&quot; ceilings are 3,500 and 1,500 feet respectively.

==History==
[[Image:Voris and 1st Blue Angel team.jpg|thumb|310px|right|The first Blue Angel Flight Demonstration Squadron, 1946&amp;ndash;1947 (l to r): Lt. Al Taddeo, Solo; Lt. (J.G.) Gale Stouse, Spare; Lt. Cdr. R.M. &quot;Butch&quot; Voris, Flight Leader; Lt. Maurice &quot;Wick&quot; Wickendoll, Right Wing; Lt. Mel Cassidy, Left Wing.]]
On [[April 24]], [[1946]] [[Chief of Naval Operations]] [[Admiral]] [[Chester Nimitz]] issued a directive ordering the formation of a flight exhibition team (the first such official venture by any of the Armed Services) to boost Navy morale, demonstrate naval air power, and maintain public interest in naval aviation. However, an underlying mission was to help the Navy generate public and political support for a larger allocation of the shrinking defense budget. In April of that year, Rear Admiral Ralph Davison personally selected [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Roy Marlin Voris|Roy Marlin &quot;Butch&quot; Voris]], a World War II [[flying ace]], to assemble and train a flight demonstration squadron, naming him Officer-in-Charge and Flight Leader. Voris selected two fellow instructors to join him (Lt. Maurice &quot;Wick&quot; Wickendoll and Lt. Mel Cassidy, both veterans of the War in the Pacific), and the three spent countless hours developing the show. The group perfected their initial maneuvers in secret over the Florida [[Everglades]] so that, in Voris' words, &quot;''...if anything happened, just the alligators would know.''&quot; Their first demonstration before Navy officials took place on [[May 10]], 1946 and was met with enthusiastic approval.

On [[June 15]] Voris led a trio of [[Grumman F6F Hellcat|Grumman F6F-5 Hellcats]], specially modified to reduce weight and painted sea blue with gold leaf trim, through their inaugural 15-minute-long performance at the Southern Air Show at [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville, Florida's]] '''Craig Field'''. The group, known simply as the &quot;Navy Flight Exhibition Team,&quot; thrilled spectators with low-flying maneuvers performed in tight formations, and (according to Voris) by &quot;''...keeping something in front of the crowds at all times. My objective was to beat the Army Air Corps. If we did that, we'd get all the other side issues. I felt that if we weren't the best, it would be my naval career''.&quot; The Blue Angels' first public demonstration also netted the team its first trophy, which sits on display at the team's current home in [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]]. 

[[Image:Blue Angels Bearcats.jpg|thumb|300px|left|On August 25, 1946 the Blue Angels transitioned to the Grumman F8F-1 Bearcat and introduced the famous &quot;diamond&quot; formation at the '''World Air Carnival''' in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].]]
The team soon became known worldwide for its spectacular aerobatic stunts. During a trip to the &quot;[[Big Apple]],&quot; Lt. Wickendoll came across an advertisement in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' for the city's popular &quot;Blue Angel&quot; nightclub. Voris liked the name and on [[July 19]] officially made it the team's moniker. On [[August 25]] the squadron upgraded their aircraft to the [[F8F Bearcat|F8F-1 Bearcat]]. Though Voris left the team on [[May 30]], [[1947]] the &quot;Blues&quot; continued to perform nationwide until the start of the Korean War in 1950, when (due to a shortage of pilots) the team was disbanded and its members were ordered to combat duty. Once aboard the aircraft carrier [[USS Princeton|USS ''Princeton'']] the group formed the core of VF-191, '''Satan's Kittens'''. 

The Blue Angels were officially recommissioned on [[October 25]], [[1951]], and reported to [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi|NAS Corpus Christi]], Texas. Lt. Cdr. Voris was again tasked with assembling the flight team (he was the first of only two commanding officers to lead the group twice). By the end of the [[1940s]], the Blue Angels were flying their first jet aircraft, the Grumman [[F9F Panther|F9F-2 Panther]], but now would be utilizing the newer and faster version of the Panther, the F9F-5. The Blue Angels remained in Corpus Christi until the winter of [[1954]], when they relocated to their present home at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola, Florida]]. It was here that they progressed to the swept-wing Grumman [[F9F Cougar|F9F-8 Cougar]]. The ensuing 20 years saw the Blue Angels transition to two more aircraft, the Grumman [[F11F Tiger|F11F-1 Tiger]] ([[1957]]) and the McDonnell Douglas [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4J Phantom II]] ([[1969]]), the only plane to be flown by both the &quot;Blues&quot; and the [[United States Air Force]] [[Thunderbirds (squadron)|Thunderbirds]]. 

[[Image:BAHR9.jpg|thumb|right|300px|All six Blue Angel A-4F Skyhawks fly in [[delta formation]] with &quot;smoke on.&quot;]]
In December, [[1974]] the Navy Flight Demonstration Team began flying the McDonnell Douglas [[A-4 Skyhawk|A-4F Skyhawk II]] and was reorganized into the Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron. This reorganization permitted the establishment of a commanding officer, a flight leader, added support officers, and further redefined the squadron's mission emphasizing the support of recruiting efforts. Commander Tony Less was the squadron's first official commanding officer.

On [[November 8]], [[1986]] the Blue Angels completed their 40th anniversary year during ceremonies unveiling their present aircraft, the sleek McDonnell Douglas [[F/A-18 Hornet]], the first dual-role fighter/attack aircraft now serving on the nation's front lines of defense. The Blue Angels also operate a [[C-130 Hercules|C-130T Hercules]] nicknamed &quot;Fat Albert&quot; to provide support and (at selected venues) put on a show of its own with a jet-assisted take off ([[JATO]]) before the &quot;Blues&quot; begin their demonstration. &quot;Fat Albert Airlines&quot; flies with an all-Marine crew of three officers and five enlisted personnel.

The Blue Angels perform more than 70 shows at 34 different locations throughout the United States each year, where they still employ many of the same practices and techniques in their aerial displays as they did back in 1946. Since their inception, the &quot;Blues&quot; have flown for more than 260 million spectators worldwide.

[[Image:Blue Angels Skypatch insignia.jpg|frame|180px|right]]
:''Today is a very special and memorable day in your military career that will remain with you throughout your lifetime. You have survived the ultimate test of your peers and have proven to be completely deserving to wear the crest of the U.S. Navy Blue Angels. 

:''The prestige of wearing the Blue Angels uniform carries with it an extraordinary honor &amp;mdash; one that reflects not only on you as an individual, but on your teammates and the entire squadron. To the crowds at the air shows and to the public at hospitals and schools nationwide, you are a symbol of the Navy and Marine Corps' finest. You bring pride, hope and a promise for tomorrow's Navy and Marine Corps in the smiles and handshakes of today's youth. Remember today as the day you became a Blue Angel; look around at your teammates and commit this special bond to memory. &quot;Once a Blue Angel, always a Blue Angel,&quot; rings true for all those who wear the crest of the U.S. Navy Blue Angels. Welcome to the team.

==Trivia==
[[Image:BlueAngelsFA18.jpg|right|200px|thumb|An Angels Hornet heads for the sky.]]

* The &quot;Blues&quot; aircraft are completely combat-ready, and could be repainted and armed for combat service in just 24 hours.
* ''The Blue Angels'' was a short-lived dramatic television series inspired by the team's exploits and filmed with the cooperation of the Navy, that aired from [[September 1]], [[1960]] to [[March 20]], [[1961]]. 
* In 2005, [[The Military Channel]] aired a documentary miniseries, &quot;Blue Angels: A Year in the Life&quot;, focusing on the intricate day-to-day details of that year's training and performance schedule.
* The video for the [[United States|American]] [[rock and roll|rock]] [[rock band|band]] [[Van Halen|Van Halen's]] 1986 release &quot;Dreams&quot; is comprised of Blue Angels performance footage. The video was originally shot featuring the Blues in the [[McDonnell-Douglas]] [[A-4 Skyhawk]]. It was later reshot after the transition to the [[F/A-18 Hornet]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about the religious concept.  For other uses of the term see [[Born Again]]''.

'''Born again''' is a term used primarily in the  [[Fundamentalist_Christianity|Fundamentalist]],  [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]], and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] branches of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christianity]], where it is associated with salvation, conversion and spiritual rebirth.  Outside of these circles, the term is often applied by extension to other phenomena, including a ''transcending personal experience'' &amp;mdash; or the experience of ''being spiritually reborn'' as a &quot;new&quot; human being. 

==Christian concepts==
To be '''born again''' in [[Christianity]] is synonymous with [[spirituality|spiritual]] [[rebirth]] and, in many denominational traditions, [[salvation]]. The term is used somewhat differently in different Christian traditions.

The Christian use of the term is derived from the third chapter of the [[Gospel of John]], where [[Nicodemus]] visits [[Jesus]]:

:''Now there was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, a leader of the Jews. He came to Jesus by night and said to him, &quot;Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God; for no one can do these signs that you do apart from the presence of God.&quot;''
:''Jesus answered him, &quot;Very truly, I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God without being born again.&quot;''
:''Nicodemus said to him, &quot;How can anyone be born after having grown old? Can one enter a second time into the mother's womb and be born?&quot; Jesus answered, &quot;Very truly, I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit.&quot;''

::-John 3:1-5 (''New Revised Standard Version'')

:::::(''Note that some translators consider &quot;born from above&quot; to be a better translation than &quot;born again&quot;''.)

Most Christian denominations hold that a person must be ''born again'' in some sense in order to be a Christian, and thus that all who are true Christians are in fact born again, whether they describe themselves as such or not. The [[Roman Catholic]] church, for example, considers that &quot;[[Baptism]] is ... the sacrament by which we are born again of watghtenment|Enlightenment]] would ultimately lead to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''.

Leibniz and the encyclopedists realized that it is impossible to organize human knowledge unequivocally in a tree diagram, and consequently to construct an ''a priori'' language based on such a classification of concepts.  Under the entry ''Charact&amp;egrave;re'', [[D'Alembert]] critically reviewed the projects of philosophical languages of the preceding century.  From the ''Encyclopédie'', projects for ''a priori'' languages moved more and more to the lunatic fringe.  Individual authors, typically unaware of the history of the idea, continued to propose taxonomic philosophical languages until the early [[20th century]] (e.g. [[Ro]]), but most recent [[engineered language]]s have had more modest goals; some are limited to a specific field, like mathematical formalism or calculus (e.g. [[Lincos (language)|Lincos]] and [[programming language]]s), others are designed for eliminating syntactical ambiguity (e.g., [[Loglan]] and [[Lojban]]) or maximizing conciseness (e.g., [[Ithkuil]]).

Already in the ''Encyclopédie'' attention began to focus on ''a posteriori'' auxiliary languages. [[Joachim Faiguet]] in the article on ''Langue'' already wrote a short proposition of a &quot;laconic&quot; or regularized grammar of [[French (language)|French]]. During the [[19th century]], a bewildering variety of such International Auxiliary Languages (IALs) were proposed, so that [[Louis Couturat]] and [[Leopold Leau]] in ''Historire de la langue universelle'' ([[1903]]) could review 38 projects.  The first of these that made any international impact was [[Volapük]], proposed in [[1879]] by [[Johann Martin Schleyer]], and within a decade, 283 Volapükist clubs were counted all over the globe.  However, this language by its very success lost its unity, and within a few years, fell into obscurity, making way for [[Esperanto]], proposed in [[1887]] by [[L. L. Zamenhof|Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof]], the most successful IAL to date. [[Loglan]] ([[1955]]) and its descendants constitute a pragmatic return to the aims of the ''a priori'' languages, tempered by the requirement of usability of an auxiliary language.

Artistic languages, constructed for literary enjoyment or aesthetic reasons without any claim of usefulness, begin to appear in Early Modern literature (in [[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel]], and in [[Utopia]]n contexts), but they only seem to gain notability as serious projects from the [[20th century]].  ''[[A Princess of Mars]]'' by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] was possibly the first fiction of the 20th century to feature a constructed language.  [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] was the first to develop a family of related fictional languages and was the first academic to publicly discuss artistic languages, admitting to ''[[A Secret Vice]]'' of his in [[1930]] at an Esperanto congress. ([[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Newspeak]]'' should be considered a parody of an IAL rather than an artistic language proper.)

By the turn of the [[21st century]], it had become common for science-fiction and fantasy works set in other worlds to feature constructed languages, and constructed languages are a regular part of movies of the genre, including ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' and ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''computer keyboard''' is a [[computer peripheral|peripheral]] modeled after the [[typewriter keyboard]]. Keyboards are designed for the input of text and characters, and also to control the operation of the computer. Physically, computer keyboards are an arrangement of rectangular or near-rectangular buttons, or &quot;keys&quot;. Keyboards typically have characters engraved or printed on the keys; in most cases, each press of a key corresponds to a single written symbol. However, to produce some symbols requires pressing and holding several keys simultaneously, or in sequence; other keys do not produce any symbol, but instead affect the operation of the computer, or the keyboard itself. See [[input method editor]].

[[Image:Qwerty.svg|thumb|right|500px|A 102-key PC [[United States|US]] [[English language|English]] QWERTY keyboard layout]]

Roughly 50% of all keyboard keys produce letters, numbers or signs ([[character (computing)|characters]]). Other keys can produce actions when pressed, and other actions are available by simultaneously pressing more than one action key.

==Designs==

There exist a large number of different arrangements of symbols on keys. These different [[keyboard layout]]s arise because different people need easy access to different symbols; typically, this is because they are writing in different languages, but specialized keyboard layouts for mathematics, accounting, and computer programming do exist.

The number of keys on a keyboard generally varies from the standard 101 keys to the 104 windows keyboards all the way up to 130 keys with many programmable keys. There are also compact variants that have fewer than 90 keys. They are normally found in [[laptop]]s or in desktop computers with space constraints.

=== Standard arrangements ===
[[Image:Computer keyboard.gif|thumb|right]]
The most common arrangements in Western countries are based on the [[QWERTY]] layout (including closely-related variants, such as the [[France|French]] [[Keyboard_layout#AZERTY|AZERTY]] layout). Even in countries where different [[Alphabet|alphabets]] or writing systems are in use, the physical  layout of the keys is often quite similar (e.g. the [[Keyboard_layout#Thai|Thai keyboard layout]]).

====Additional keys and &quot;Internet&quot; keyboards====

Most modern computer keyboards (including those on the [[IBM PC|PC]] and [[Apple Mac]]) are based on these standard versions, but include additional keys not normally found on typewriters, such as [[Function key|function keys]], a [[numeric keypad]], and so on. In recent years, so-called &quot;Internet keyboards&quot; have also become popular. These include extra buttons for specific applications or functions (typically a [[Web browser|browser]] or [[E-mail|email client]]).

=== Plug Types ===
There are a few different ways of connecting a keyboard which have evolved over the years. These include [[PS/2|PS/2]] and [[USB|USB]] connections.

=== Alternatives ===

A standard keyboard is physically quite large, as each key must remain large enough to be easily pressed by fingers. Other types of keyboards have been proposed for small portable equipment where a standard keyboard is too large. One way to reduce the number of keys is to use [[Chorded keyboard|chording]], i.e. pressing several keys simultaneously. As an example, the [[GKOS keyboard]] has been designed for small wireless devices.  Other two-handed alternatives more akin to a gaming controller, such as the [[AlphaGrip]], are also used as a way to input data and text.

==Usage==
[[Image:Foldable keyboard.jpg|thumb|right|A foldable Keyboard]]
In normal usage, the keyboard is used to type text into word processor, text editor, or any other textbox.

In modern computers the interpretation of keypresses is generally left to the software. Modern keyboards distinguish each physical key from every other and report all keypresses and releases to the controlling software. This flexibility is not often taken advantage of and it usually does not matter, for example, whether the left or right shift key is held down in conjunction with another character.

===Commands===
A keyboard is also used to type commands in a computer. One famous example on the [[IBM PC|PC]] is the [[Control-Alt-Delete|Ctrl+Alt+Del]] combination. With current versions of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], this brings up a menu-window including options for handling currently-running applications and shutting down the computer, amongst other things. Under [[Linux]], [[MS-DOS]] and some older versions of Windows, Ctrl+Alt+Del performs either a 'cold' or 'warm' reboot.

===Games===
A keyboard is one of the primary [[game controller|controllers]] in [[computer game]]s. For instance, the [[arrow keys]] or a group of letters resembling the pattern of the arrow keys, like [[WASD]], can be used for movement of a game character. In many games keys can be configured to the user's preferences. Alphabet keys are also sometimes used to perform actions starting with that letter. (e.g. pressing ''e'' to ''eat'' in [[NetHack]]). Keyboards are less than ideal when many keys are to be pressed at once, as the limited circuitry means that only a certain number of keys will register at one time. An obvious example of this is phantom key blocking. On older keyboards, due to the circuit design, sometimes pressing three keys simultaneously results in a 4th keypress being registered. Modern keyboards prevent this from happening by blocking the 3rd key in certain key combinations, but while this prevents phantom input, it also means that when two keys are depressed simultaneously, many of the other keys on the keyboard will not respond until one of the two depressed keys is lifted. Better keyboards are designed so that this happens infrequently in office programs, but it remains a problem in games even on expensive keyboards, due to wildly different and/or configurable key/command layouts in different games.

==How it works==

The following briefly describes a &quot;[[Keyboard_technology#Dome_switch_keyboard|dome-switch]]&quot; keyboard (sometimes misleadingly referred to as a [[membrane keyboard]]), the most common type in use today:-

# When a key is pressed, it pushes down on a rubber dome sitting beneath the key. A [[Conductor (material)|conductive]] contact on the underside of the dome touches (and hence connects) a pair of conductive lines on the circuit below.
# This bridges the gap between them and allows current to flow (i.e. the [[switch]] goes from open to closed), changing the signal strength.
# A scanning signal is emitted by the chip along the pairs of lines to all the keys. When the signal in one pair becomes different, the chip generates a &quot;make code&quot; corresponding to the key connected to that pair of lines. 
# The code generated is sent to the computer either via a keyboard cable (using on-off electrical pulses to represent [[bit|bits]]) or over a [[wireless]] connection.
# A chip inside the computer receives the signal bits and decodes them into the appropriate keypress. The computer then decides what to do on the basis of the key pressed (e.g. display a character on the screen, or perform some action).

Other types of keyboard function in a similar manner, the main differences being how the individual key-switches work. For more detail, refer to the &quot;[[Keyboard technology]]&quot; article.

[[Image:Orion_constellation_map.png|thumb|300px|[[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] is a remarkable constellation, visible from most places on the globe at one time or another during the year. The '''constellation''' of Orion is the area outlined in the dashed yellow line. [[Orion]] contains a striking and well-known star pattern that has the form of a hunter.]]
A '''constellation''' is any one of the 88 areas into which the sky - or the [[celestial sphere]] - is divided. The term is also often used, incorrectly, to denote a group of [[star]]s visibly related to each other in a particular configuration or pattern.

Some well-known constellations contain striking and familiar patterns of bright stars.  Examples are [[Ursa Major]] (containing the star pattern known as the [[Big Dipper]]), [[Orion]] (containing a striking figure of a hunter), [[Leo]] (containing bright stars outlining the form of a lion) and [[Scorpius]] (a scorpion). Other constellations do not encompass any discernible star patterns, and contain only faint stars.

== Explanation ==

The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) divides the sky into 88 official constellations with precise [[boundaries]], so that every [[direction]] or place in the sky belongs within one constellation. In the northern celestial hemisphere, these are mostly based upon the constellations of the ancient [[ancient Greece|Greek]] tradition, passed down through the [[Middle Ages]], and contains the signs of the [[zodiac]]. 

The constellation boundaries were drawn up by [[Eugène Delporte]] in [[1930]], and he drew them along vertical and horizontal lines of [[right ascension]] and [[declination]].  However, he did so for the [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] [[B1875.0]], which means that due to [[precession]] of the equinoxes, the borders on a modern star map (eg, for epoch [[J2000]]) are already somewhat skewed and no longer perfectly vertical or horizontal.  This skew will increase over the years and centuries to come.

In [[dimension|three-dimensional]] space, most of the stars we see have little or no relation to one another, but can appear to be grouped on the [[celestial sphere]] of the [[night]] [[sky]]. [[Human]]s excel at finding [[pattern]]s and throughout history have grouped stars that appear close to one another into patterns.

A star pattern may be widely known but may not recognized by the [[International Astronomical Union]]; such a pattern of stars is called an [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]]. An example is the grouping called the [[Big Dipper]] (North America) or the [[Big Dipper|Plough]] ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).

The stars in a constellation or asterism rarely have any astrophysical relationship to each other; they just happen to appear close together in the sky as viewed from [[Earth]] and typically lie many [[light years]] apart in space.  However, one exception to this is the [[Ursa Major moving group]].

The grouping of stars into constellations is essentially [[wiktionary:arbitrary|arbitrary]], and different [[culture]]s have had different constellations, although a few of the more obvious ones tend to recur frequently, e.g., [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] and [[Scorpius]].

==History of the constellations==
{{main|Former constellations}}
Our current list is based on those listed by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] astronomer, [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemy]], who lived in [[Alexandria]], [[History of Greek and Roman Egypt|Egypt]]. ([[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemy]], the astronomer, was not related toion in the academic world. Josep Calveras used it for the first time in 1925, in his work ''La reconstrucció del llenguatge literari català'': «&quot;Catalan-Valencian-Balear&quot; would be the proper name that would satisfy everyone, if it were not because it is too long and the philologists are used to say briefly: Catalan language».

'''Catalan''' (''Català'') or '''Valencian''' (''Valencià'') is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]], the national language of [[Andorra]] and co-official in several regions of [[Spain]]. Spain has the majority of active Catalan speakers, and Catalan is the country's second most widely spoken language. It is spoken or understood by as many as 12 million people who live not only in Andorra and Spain, but also in parts of [[France]] and [[Italy]].

==Classification==
According to the [[Ethnologue]], its specific classification is a member of the [[East Iberian languages|East Iberian]] branch of the [[Iberian Romance languages|Ibero-Romance]] branch of the [[Gallo-Iberian languages|Gallo-Iberian]] branch of the [[Western Italo-Western|Western]] sub complex of the [[Italo-Western languages|Italo-Western]] complex of the [[Romance languages|Romance]] group of the [[Italic languages|Italic]] branch of the [[Indo-European]] [[language family]]. It shares many features with both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]], and is the language nearest to [[Occitan]], and is often thought of as a sort of &quot;transitory&quot; language between the [[Iberian Romance languages|Iberian]] and [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallic languages]] when comparing the modern descendants of [[Latin]].

==Geographic distribution==
[[Image:Catalan in Europe.png|thumb|right|Catalan in Europe]]
{{main|Catalan countries}}

Catalan is spoken in:
*[[Catalonia]]  in [[Spain]].
*[[La Franja|An adjacent strip]] of [[Aragon]], [[Spain]], in particular the ''comarques'' of Baixa [[Ribagorça]], [[Llitera]], [[Baix Cinca]], and [[Matarranya]].
*[[Balearic Islands]] in [[Spain]].
*[[Andorra]].
*Part of the [[Land of Valencia]] in [[Spain]]. (where is called [[valencian]])
*[[Northern Catalonia]] in [[France]].
*The city of [[Alghero]] (''l'Alguer'') on [[Sardinia]], an island in [[Italy]].
*A small region in [[Murcia (autonomous community)|Murcia]], Spain, known as ''el Carche'' in [[Spanish language|Castilian]] and ''el Carxe'' in Catalan.

All these areas are informally called [[Catalan countries]] (Catalan ''Països Catalans''), a denomination based originally on cultural affinity and common heritage, that some have subsequently interpreted politically.

===Official status===
Catalan is the official language of [[Andorra]]. It is co-official in the Spanish regions of [[Catalonia]], the [[Balearic Islands]], and [[Land of Valencia|Valencia]]. It has no official status in the parts of [[Aragon]] where it is spoken, but has gained some recognition by Aragonese laws since 1990. It has no official status in the other places where it is spoken.

==Dialects==
[[Image:Dialectal_map_of_Catalan_Language.png|thumb|right|250px|Dialectal Map of Catalan Language]]In 1861, [[Manuel Milà i Fontanals]] proposed a dialectal division of Catalan in two major blocks: [[Eastern Catalan]] and [[Western Catalan]].

There is no precise linguistic border between one dialect and another because there is nearly always a dialect transition zone of some size between pairs of geographically identified dialects, (except for dialects specific to an island). The main difference between both blocks is:
*'''Western Catalan''' (''Bloc o Branca del Català Occidental''):
**Unstressed vowels: {{IPA|[a] [e] [i] [o] [u]}}. Distinctions between ''e'' and ''a'' and ''o'' and ''u''.
**Initial or &lt;!-- this next word is probably wrong, but I don't know what's right, please remove this comment after fixing or confirming. - [[User:Jmabel]] --&gt; post-consonatic ''x'' is affricate {{IPA|/tʃ/}}. Between vowels or &lt;!-- this next pair of words is probably wrong, but I don't know what's right, please remove this comment after fixing or confirming. - [[User:Jmabel]] --&gt; final preceded of ''i'', {{IPA|/jʃ/}}.
**&lt;!-- this next phrase is probably wrong, but I don't know what's right, please remove this comment after fixing or confirming. - [[User:Jmabel]] --&gt; 1st person of Indicative's present desinence is -e or -o.
**&lt;!-- this next word is probably wrong, but I don't know what's right, please remove this comment after fixing or confirming. - [[User:Jmabel]] --&gt; Inchoative in -ix, -ixen, -isca
**Maintenance of medieval nasal plural in &lt;!-- this next word is probably wrong, but I don't know what's right, please remove this comment after fixing or confirming. - [[User:Jmabel]] --&gt; proparoxiton words: hòmens, jóvens
**Specific Vocabulary: espill, xiquet, granera, melic...
*'''Eastern Catalan''' (''Bloc o Branca del Català Oriental''):
**Unstressed vowels {{IPA|[ə] [i] [u]}}. The unstressed vowels ''e'' and ''a'' becomes /ə/ and ''o'' and ''u'' becomes /u/.
**Initial or &lt;!-- this next word is probably wrong, but I don't know what's right, please remove this comment after fixing or confirming. - [[User:Jmabel]] --&gt; post-consonatic ''x'' is fricative {{IPA|/ʃ/}}. Between vowels or final preceded of ''i'' is also {{IPA|/ʃ/}}.
**&lt;!-- this next phrase is probably wrong, but I don't know what's right, please remove this comment after fixing or confirming. - [[User:Jmabel]] --&gt; 1st person of Indicative's present desinence is -o, -i or ø.
**&lt;!-- this next word is probably wrong, but I don't know what's right, please remove this comment after fixing or confirming. - [[User:Jmabel]] --&gt; Inchoative in -eix, -eixen, -eixi.
**The -n- of medieval nasal plural falls in &lt;!-- this next word is probably wrong, but I don't know what's right, please remove this comment after fixing or confirming. - [[User:Jmabel]] --&gt; proparoxiton words: homes, joves.
**Specific Vocabulary: mirall, noi, escombra, llombrígol...
In addition, neither [[dialect]] is completely homogeneous: any dialect can be subdivided into several sub dialects. Catalan can be subdivided in two major dialectal blocks and those blocks into individual dialects:

== The status of Valencian ==
{{Main|Valencian}}

[[image:Valenciamaydayposter.jpg|300px|right|thumb|A poster in [[Catalan]] from the Spanish trade union federation displayed in [[Valencia]].]]

The official language academy of the [[Land of Valencia]] (the [[Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua]]) considers ''Catalan'' and ''Valencian'' simply to be two names for the same language. 
There is a roughly continuous set of [[idiolect]]s covering the various regional forms of Catalan/ Valencian, with no break at the border between Catalonia and Valencia (i.e. villages contiguous to both sides of the border speak exactly the same), and the various forms of Catalan and Valencian are mutually intelligible. All universities teaching Romance languages, and virtually all linguists, consider these all to be linguistic variants of the same language (similar to [[Canadian French]] versus Metropolitan French).

Nevertheless, differences do exist: the accent of a Valencian is recognisable, there are differences in subjunctive terminations, and there are a large number of words unique to Valencian; but those differences are not any wider than among North-Western Catalan and Eastern Catalan. In fact, Northern Valencian (spoken in the Castelló province and Matarranya valley, a strip of [[Aragon]]) is more similar to the Catalan of the lower [[Ebro]] [[basin]] (spoken in southern half of [[Tarragona province]] and another strip of Aragon) than to ''apitxat'' Valencian (spoken in the area of [[L'Horta]], in the province of Valencia).

The [[Valencian|Valencian language]] has often been seen as a dialect of Catalan due to their mutual intelligibility. However, the issue of ''language'' versus ''dialect'' is as much a matter of politics as of linguistics. By the criterion of mutual intelligibility, Valencian and other varieties of Catalan are dialects of a single language; but according to this criterion, [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] are also dialects of a single language, as are [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], a contentious conclusion in either case. A language is defined by several factors, [[Language-dialect aphorism|political ones among others]]. 

What gets called a ''language'' is defined in part by mutual comprehensibility, but also by political and cultural factors. Historically, the perceived status of Valencian as a &quot;dialect of Catalan&quot; has had important political implications including [[Catalan nationalism]] and the idea of the ''Països catalans'' or &quot;[[Catalan countries]].&quot; Conversely, some Valencians who advocate distinguishing the languages do so to resist a perceived Catalan nationalist agenda aimed at absorbing Valencian language and identity, and incorporating Valencians into a constructed nationality centered on Catalonia. However, this idea is mostly supported by extreme right-wing organisations who usually don't support actual use of Valencian, but rather fear a possible union between Catalonia and Valencia towards their independence. It should be noted as well that it is common consensus amongst linguists to consider Valencian and Catalan to be the same language.

Similarly to [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]], the issue of whether Catalan and Valencian constitute different languages or merely dialects has been the subject of political agitation several times since the end of the Franco era. The latest political controversy regarding Valencian occurred on the occasion of the drafting of the [[European Constitution]] in 2004. The Spanish government supplied the [[European Union|EU]] with translations of the text into [[Basque language|Basque]], Galician, Catalan, and Valencian, but the Catalan and Valencian versions were identical. While professing the unity of the Catalan language, the Spanish government claimed to be constitutionally bound to produce distinct Catalan and Valencian versions because the Statute of the Autonomous Land of Valencia refers to the language as ''Valencian''. In practice, the Catalan, Valencian, and Balearic versions of the EU constitution are identical, although some compromises over spelling may have been involved in making them so.

Most current (21st century) Valencian speakers and writers use spelling conventions (Normes de Castelló, 1932) that allow for several diverse idiosyncrasies of Valencian, Balearic, North-Western Catalan, and Eastern Catalan.

==Sounds and writing system==
{{main|Catalan phonology and orthography}}

==Grammar==
{{main|Catalan grammar}}

An interesting feature of Catalan, as compared to most other modern Romance languages, is its complex and extremely conservative system of pronoun [[clitic]]s.

==History==
Catalan developed by the [[9th century|9th century]] from [[Vulgar Latin]] on both sides of the eastern part of [[Pyrenees]] mountains (counties of [[Roussillon]], [[Empuries]], [[Besalú]], [[Cerdagne]], [[Urgell]], [[Pallars]] and [[Ribagorça]]). It shares features with Gallo-romance and Ibero-romance, and it could be said to be in its beginnings no more than an eccentric dialect of [[Occitan language|Occitan]] (or of Western Romance).
The language was spread to the south by the ''[[Reconquista]]''
in several phases: Barcelona and Tarragona, Lleida and Tortosa, the ancient Kingdom of Valencia, and transplanted to the Balearic Islands and l'Alguer ([[Alghero]]).

Catalan was exported in the thirteenth century to the Balearic Islands and the newly created Valencian Kingdom by the Catalan and Aragonese invaders (note that the area of Catalan language still extends to part of what is now the region of Aragon). During this period, almost all of the Muslim population of the Balearic Islands were expelled, but many Muslim peasants remained in many rural areas of the Valencian Kingdom, as had happened before in the lower [[Ebro]] basin (or Catalunya Nova).

During the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the Catalan language was important in the [[Mediterranean]] region. Barcelona was the pre-eminent city and port of the so-called [[Aragonese Empire]], a confederation nominally ruled by the King of Aragon (Aragon, Catalonia, Roussillon, Valencia, the Balearic Islands, Sicily, and &amp;mdash; later &amp;mdash; Sardinia and Naples). All prose writers of this era used the name 'Catalan' for their common language (e.g. the Catalan [[Ramon Muntaner]], the Majorcan [[Ramon Llull]], etc.) The matter is more complicated among the poets, as they wrote in a sort of artificial [[Occitan|Langue d'Oc]] in the tradition of the [[troubador]]s. Italian resentment of this Catalan dominance appears to have been one of the wellsprings of the so-called &quot;[[Black Legend]]&quot;.
[[Image:Tirant.jpg|right|thumb|One of the first few pages of ''[[Tirant lo Blanc|Tirant&amp;nbsp;lo&amp;nbsp;Blanch]]'', by [[Joanot Martorell|Joanot&amp;nbsp;Martorell]].]]
During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the city of Valencia gains pre-eminence in the confederation, due to several factors, including demographic changes and the fact that the royal court moved there. Presumably as a result of this shift in the balance of power within the confederation, in the fifteenth century the name 'Valencian' starts to be used by writers from Valencia to refer to their language.

In the sixteenth century the name 'Llemosí' (that is to say, &quot;the Occitan dialect of [[Limoges]]&quot;) is first documented as being used to refer to this language. This attribution has no philological base, but it is explicable by the complex sociolinguistic frame of Catalan poetry of this era (Catalan versus troubadoresque Occitan). [[Ausias March]] himself was not sure what to call the language he was writing in (it is clearly closer to his contemporary Catalan or Valencian than to the archaic Occitan).

Then, during the sixteenth century, most of the Valencian elites switched languages to Castilian Spanish, as can be seen in the balance of languages of printed books in Valencia city: at the beginning of century Latin and Catalan (or Valencian) were the main languages of the press, but by the end of the century Spanish was the main language of the press. Still, rural areas and urban working classes continued to speak their vernacular language.

During the first half of the nineteenth century, Catalan and Valencian experienced a major revival among urban elites due to the [[Renaixença]], a [[romanticism|romantic]] cultural movement. The effects of this revival continue to be felt to this day.

In Francoist Spain (1939-1975), the use of Castilian over Catalan was promoted,  and public use of Catalan was in fact forbidden, though thousands of books were published in Catalan (or sneaked under censorship). Following the death of Franco in [[1975]] and the restoration of democracy, the use of Catalan increased and the Catalan language is now used in politics, education and the media, including the newspapers ''Avui'' ('Today'), ''El Punt'' ('The Point') and ''El Periódico de Catalunya'' (sharing content with its Spanish release and with ''El Periòdic d'Andorra'', printed in [[Andorra]]; ''El Periódico de Catalunya'' has Spanish-language and Catalan-language editions, with identical content) and the [[television]] channels of ''Televisió de Catalunya'' (TVC): TV3 and Canal 33/K3 (culture and cartoons channel) as well as a 24 hour news channel 3/24; there are also many local channels available in region in Catalan, such as BTV and CityTV (Barcelona), Canal L'Hospitalet (L'Hospitalet de Llobregat) and Canal Terrassa (Terrassa).

== Mission highlights ==
Primary payload was [[Spacelab]]-2. Despite an [[Space Shuttle program#Intact_abort_modes|abort to orbit]], which required mission replanning, the mission was declared a success. A special part of the modular Spacelab system, the igloo, located at head of a three-pallet train, provided on-site support to instruments mounted on pallets. The main mission objective was to verify performance of Spacelab systems, determine the interface capability of the orbiter, and measure the environment created by the spacecraft. Experiments covered [[life science]]s, [[plasma physics]], [[astronomy]], high-energy [[astrophysics]], [[solar physics]], [[atmospheric physics]] and [[technology research]].

The flight marked the first time the ESA Instrument Pointing System (IPS) was tested in orbit. This unique pointing instrument was designed with an accuracy of one [[arcsecond]]. Initially, some problems were experienced when it was commanded to track the Sun, but a series of software fixes were made and the problem was corrected.

The payload with the most publicity probably was the ''Carbonated Beverage Dispenser Evaluation'' &amp;mdash; an experiment where both [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi]] tried to make their drinks available to astronauts.  Both fizzed excessively in microgravity.

== Launch ==
[[July 29]], [[1985]], 5:00:00 p.m. EDT. Launch countdown [[July 12]] halted at T-3 seconds after main engine ignition when a malfunction of number two [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]] (SSME) coolant valve caused shutdown of all three main engines. Launch July 29 delayed one hour, 37 minutes due to problem with table maintenance block update uplink. Five minutes, 45 seconds into ascent, number one main engine shut down prematurely due to a spurious high temperature sensor. This was the only in-flight main engine failure of the shuttle program. At about the same time, a second main engine almost shut down from a similar problem, but this was observed and inhibited by a fast acting [[flight controller]]. The failed SSME resulted in an 
[[Space Shuttle abort modes#Intact_abort_modes|Abort To Orbit (ATO)]] trajectory, whereby the shuttle achieves a lower than planned orbital altitude. Launch weight: 252,855 lb (114.693 t).

== Landing ==
[[August 6]], [[1985]], 12:45:26 p.m. PDT, Runway 23, [[Edwards Air Force Base]], [[California]]. Rollout distance: 8,569 ft (2.612 km). Rollout time: 55 seconds. Mission extended 17 revolutions for additional payload activities due to abort-to-orbit. Orbiter returned to KSC [[August 11]], 1985. Landing Weight: 216,735 lb (98.309 t).

== Mission insignia ==
The mission insignia was designed by [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] artist Skip Bradley. 
The Space Shuttle Challenger is depicted 
ascending toward the heavens in search of new knowledge in the 
field of solar and stellar astronomy, with its Spacelab 2 payload.  
The constellations [[Leo]] and [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] are in the positions they will be in, 
relative to the Sun during the flight. The nineteen stars signify that 
this will be the 19th STS flight.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Springfield npp.png|right|thumb|'''Springfield Nuclear Power Plant''', from [[The Simpsons Road Rage]].]] In the [[television]] [[animated cartoon]] series ''[[The Simpsons]]'', the city of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield's]] electricity is generated from the '''Springfield [[Nuclear power plant|Nuclear Power Plant]]'''. The plant has a [[monopoly]] on the city's energy supply, but is sometimes mismanaged and endangers much of the town with its presence. 

Based on the plant's appearance and certain episode plots, it likely houses only a single &quot;Unit&quot; or reactor (although, judging from the number of reactor domes and [[cooling tower]]s, there is a chance it may have two). In one episode an emergency occurs and Homer resorts to the manual, which begins &quot;Congratulations on your purchase of a Fissionator 1952 
Slow-Fission Reactor&quot;.

The plant is poorly maintained, largely due to owner Montgomery Burns' miserliness. Its safety record is appalling, with various episodes showing luminous rats in the bowels of the building, pipes and drums leaking radioactive waste, the disposal of waste in a children's playground, plutonium used as a paperweight, cracked cooling towers, dangerously high Geiger counter readings around the perimeter of the plant, and so on. In the opening credits a bar of some radioactive substance is trapped in Homer's overalls and later disposed of in the street.

The design and folly of Springfield Nuclear Power Plant is based on the real life [[Trojan Nuclear Power Plant]] near [[Matt Groening]]'s home town of [[Portland, Oregon]].  Trojan Nuclear Power Plant opened in [[1970]] was infamous for it's poor construction and maintenance, resulting in leaking steam generators by [[1974]].  The leaking generators ultimately forced the plant to close in [[1992]].

== Employees/Associates ==
*'''[[C. M. Burns|Charles Montgomery Burns]]''', Very rich real owner and CEO of the power plant.

*'''[[Waylon Smithers]]''', is Montgomery Burns's Executive Assistant and adoring henchman. While he appears to [[de facto]] run much of the plant's day-to-day administration, his main job is tending to Mr. Burns, and often trying to talk him out of his more outrageous schemes. 

[[Image:C-carl.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Carl Carlson]]
[[Image:C-lenny.jpg|thumb|150px||right|Lenny Leonard]]

*'''[[Homer Simpson]]''', currently works in Sector 7G as the Safety Officer and has been with the company in some capacity since the birth of his first child. He mostly works in a control room sitting in front of a console, but has little idea how to operate it (in one episode he was replaced by a chicken pecking at the buttons). Often he just reclines in his chair, snoozing or eating doughnuts. He frequently takes &quot;leaves of absence&quot; from (or flat-out quits) his job whenever something interesting comes up. This typically goes either unnoticed or without consequence by his superiors. Despite the fact that the safety of the plant - and Springfield - has been imperiled more than once on Homer's watch, he still keeps his job. Homer is the lowest-ranking person in the power plant [[Organizational chart|org chart]], subordinate to an [[Inanimate Carbon Rod]], and additionally holds a record for longest time spent in an entry-level position.

*'''[[Carl Carlson]]''', along with Lenny, is not just Homer's coworker but one of his best friends since childhood, and he likes to call himself &quot;an urban Lenny.&quot; He is black and handsome, a [[Buddhist]] with a [[master's degree]] in [[Nuclear Physics]], fond of bowling and having a drink at Moe's.  He is likely a [[American liberalism|liberal]] in terms of his politics, having described local talk show host Birch Barlow as &quot;a right-wing crackpot&quot;.  But these are the only definitive details given. He has stated in passing that he has a family and that he's Homer's supervisor, but he mostly keeps things to himself due to his uncontrollably abrasive tongue.

*'''[[Lenny Leonard|Lenford &quot;Lenny&quot; Leonard]]''', the nasal-voiced friend and co-worker of Homer. A [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] native, he is unmarried, a Buddhist, often described as plain looking, although sometimes also seen as very attractive (and featured in a photo-spread in the New Yorker), and though possessing a [[master's degree]] he's undeniably dumb. His living arrangements have included a house that is literally falling apart around him and a beautifully furnished apartment that shares a glass wall with a [[jai alai]] court. His relationship with Carl is complicated. Lifelong friends, Lenny clearly adores Carl. Carl is the dominant partner and generally regards Lenny coolly. They are nonetheless constant companions.

*'''Charlie''', the bespectacled dangerous emissions supervisor. Often quiet and working in the background, he is a known [[militiaman]] and can frequently be found at [[Moe's Tavern]] after hours.  Once landed a pencil in Homer Simpson's butt crack, thus stopping Homer's Train of Thought (Dental Plan!  Lisa needs braces!) and used his sister's prosthetic leg as a [[softball]] bat so he could join the power plant's team.

*'''[[Frank &quot;Grimey&quot; Grimes]]''', hired as executive vice-president and immediately replaced, he was assigned to Sector 7G. As a self-made man who suffered through the worst of life's obstacles, he was naturally outraged at Homer's countless faults, both professional and personal, and his enormous success in spite of them (becoming an [[astronaut]], winning a [[Grammy]], etc.). Attempts by both sides to &quot;deal with&quot; their differences only exacerbated the situation, resulting in Grimes's freakish and untimely death by electrocution. He fathered a son (Frank Grimes, Jr.) with a prostitute, who tried to kill Homer in revenge for his father.

*'''Mindy Simmons''', one of the only female employees hired under [[equal opportunity]] statute (guest-voiced by [[Michelle Pfeiffer]]), and Homer's soul mate. On a trip to promote nuclear power in Capital City, they nearly have an affair. Following Homer's decision not to pursue a relationship, Mindy was dismissed from the plant due to alcohol abuse.

*'''Jack Marley''', a long time employee who was retired against his will.

*'''Unnamed supervisor''', Sherri and Terri's father (no surname ever given, though Homer referred to him as '''Eugene Fisk'''), formerly Homer's supervisor.

*'''Unnamed supervisor''', Homer claims he is one of the guys he never sees at work.

*'''Carol''', member of [[payroll]].

*'''Mike''', married member of [[shipping]]. Burns thought he and Carol were going to hook up.

*'''Ms. Finch''', a woman employee who is one of the people Homer sees at the plant while trying to find a potential suitor for Selma in the episode Principal Charming. Not a man.

*'''Tibor''', Homer's co-worker who eventually becomes his supervisor, and also whom Homer thanked for having &quot;saved my (his) [[butt]].&quot;  He was used as a scapegoat for other employees' mistakes since he was also known as &quot;the guy who doesn't speak any [[English language|English]]&quot;, and is an [[List of unseen characters|unseen character]]. 

*'''Unnamed''', worker whose hand was enlarged a hundred times after exposure to radioactive waste.

*'''Zutroy''', the dangerous emissions supervisor hired when Charlie was temporarily disposed of. He is &quot;American as [[apple pie]]&quot;, according to Burns.

*'''Canary M. Burns''', [[canary]], the one-time legal owner of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant for reasons of [[prosecutory evasion]] by de facto owner Montgomery Burns. Now living in the [[Canary Islands]].

*'''Unknown''', [[Dobermann|Doberman]], the heroic dog made executive vice-president in lieu of previous choice, Frank Grimes in lieu of previous choice, Waylon Smithers.

*'''Queenie''', [[chicken]], a temporary replacement for Homer, deceased and consumed by Homer.

*'''Stuart''', [[duck]], an employee charged with intra-plant waste transport.

*'''Blinky''', three-eyed [[fish]], inadvertent resultant of the power plant's radioactive output and some-time mascot. Actually, one of many so &quot;evolved&quot; creatures found in Springfield's waters.

*'''[[Inanimate Carbon Rod]]''', named the plant's &quot;Worker of the Week&quot; after all others but prior to Homer. It becomes famous for saving the spaceship Homer was on with [[Buzz Aldrin]] in ''Deep Space Homer'', although Homer suggested its use to close a faulty opening. For its heroism, the rod was named [[Time Magazine]]'s [[Man of the Year]]. According to the SNPP flowchart, the rod out-ranks Homer.

*'''[[Brick]]''', another office fill-in during one of Homer's absences.

*'''Bernie''', plant employee assigned with Homer and another unnamed employee to watch a [[bee]] contained in a jar in the basement during a plant inspection.

*'''Unknown''', dog, trained to abort the core destruct sequence whenever Homer pushes the button while napping.

*'''Kathy''', more or less a female Mr. Burns, works in personnel. Her relationship to Burns is unknown.

*The power plant is also the work place of many [[robot]]s which have [[emotion]]s and feelings. Homer had to fire forty-seven robots when he became owner of the plant and had to watch them all cry.

*It is implied that an entire '''Brazilian Soccer Team''' is working for the plant, because &quot;that plane landed on [Mr. Burns'] property!&quot;. This is a reference to the true story of a Uruguayan rugby team whose plane crashed in the Andes in the 70s, which was also the basis for the book/movie [[Alive]].

To win a bet between the Shelbyville Power Plant, Mr. Burns hired professional baseball players to play for SNPP's company [[softball]] team. The [[parenthesis|parentheses]] indicate the misfortune that the player had.

*'''[[Roger Clemens]]''', security guard, [[softball]] team player ([[Hypnotism|hypnotized]] into thinking he is a chicken)

*'''[[Wade Boggs]]''', janitor, softball team player (knocked out by Barney Gumble in a bar argument)

*'''[[Ken Griffey Jr.]]''', lunchroom cashier, softball team player (gigantism caused by overdose of nerve tonic)

*'''[[Steve Sax]]''', softball team player (six consecutive [[life sentence]]s for various unsolved murders in [[New York City]])

*'''[[Don Mattingly]]''', softball team player (booted off team for not understanding what Mr. Burns wanted him to remove that he referred to as [[sideburns]])

*'''[[Darryl Strawberry]]''', softball team player (the only professional player not to have a misfortune, although he was taken out [because he and the opposing pitcher were both left-handed] during the only game he played at SNPP)

*'''[[Ozzie Smith]]''', softball team player (vanished off the face of the Earth while visiting the &quot;Springfield Mystery Spot&quot;)

*'''[[Mike Scioscia]]''', softball team player ([[radiation poisoning]])

*'''[[Jose Canseco]]''', softball team player (occupied by rescuing items and people from a burning house)

*A variety of nuclear regulators, safety inspectors, and immigration agened by very complex systems, they are remarkably unaware of the rules that govern their own speech. Thus, linguists must resort to indirect methods to determine what those rules might be. If speech is indeed governed by rules, they appear to be opaque to any conscious consideration.

A very fecund way to approach cognitive issues in language is the pragmatics of language, that is, the current use of the language by a real speaker. From a pragmatic analythical perspective it was possible to show that some professions categorically working with language (e.g. journalists) have a behavior non predictable by known theories.  Pragmatic approach is also useful to study collective distributed decision making, specially in broadcasted systems (for instance aviation approach control - APP).

===Learning and development===
''Main articles:'' [[Learning]], [[Developmental psychology]]

Learning and development are the processes by which we acquire information over time. Infants are born with little or no knowledge (depending on how knowledge is defined), yet they rapidly acquire the ability to use language, walk, and recognize people and objects. Research in learning and development aim to explain the mechanisms by which these processes might take place.

A major question in the study of cognitive development is the extent to which certain abilities are [[innate]] or learned. This is often framed in terms of the nature versus nurture debate. The nativist view emphasizes that certain features are innate to an organism and are determined by its [[genetics|genetic]] endowment. The empiricist view, on the other hand, emphasizes that certain abilities are learned from the environment. It is clear that intelligent behavior has components that are both innate and learned, but the extent to which particular behaviors are innate is a major research question. In the area of [[language acquisition]], for example, many questions remain about whether or not a special language acquisition device is necessary to facilitate the learning of language, or if humans can learn language through more general learning processes that take advantage of the information available in the environment.

===Memory===
''Main articles:'' [[Memory]]

Memory allows us to store information for later retrieval. Memory is often thought of consisting of both a long-term and short-term store. Long-term memory allows us to store information over prolonged periods (days, weeks, years). We do not yet know the practical limit of long-term memory capacity. Short-term memory allows us to store information over short time scales (seconds or minutes).

Memory is also often grouped into declarative and procedural forms. Declarative memory refers to our memory for facts and specific knowledge (e.g., Who was the first president of the U.S.?). Procedural memory allows us to remember actions and motor sequences (e.g. how to ride a bicycle).

===Perception and action===
[[Image:Necker_cube.jpg|thumb|150px|The Necker cube, an example of a visual illusion.]]

''Main article: [[Perception]]''

Perception is the ability to take in information via the [[senses]], and process it in some way. [[Visual perception|Vision]] and [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]] are two dominant senses that allow us to perceive the environment. Some questions in the study of visual perception, for example, include: (1) How are we able to recognize objects?, (2) Why do we perceive a continuous visual environment, even though we only see small bits of it at any one time? One tool for studying visual perception is by looking at how people process [[visual illusions]]. The image on the right of a Necker cube is an example of a bistable percept, that is, the cube can be interpreted as being oriented in two different directions.

The study of [[haptic]] ([[tactile]]), [[olfactory]], and [[gustatory]] stimuli also fall into the domain of perception.

Action is taken to refer to the output of a system. In humans, this is accomplished through motor responses. Spatial planning and movement, speech production, and complex motor movements are all aspects of action.

==Research methods==
Many different methodologies are used to study '''cognitive science'''. As the field is highly interdisciplinary, research often cuts across multiple areas of study, and draws on research methods from [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[computer science]].

===Behavioral experiments===
In order to have a description of what constitutes intelligent behavior, one must study behavior itself. This type of research is closely tied to that in [[cognitive psychology]] and [[psychophysics]]. By measuring behavioral responses to different stimuli, one can understand something about how those stimuli are processed.

* ''Reaction time.'' The time between the presentation of a stimulus and an appropriate response can indicate differences between two cognitive processes, and can indicate some things about their nature. For example, if in a search task the reaction times vary proportionally with the number of elements, then it is evident that this cognitive process of searching involves serial and not parallel processing.

* ''Psychophysical responses.'' Psychophysical experiments are an old psychological technique, which have been adopted by cognitive psychology. They typically involve making judgments of some physical property, e.g. the loudness of a sound. Correlation of subjective scales between individuals can show cognitive or sensory biases as compared to actual physical measurements. Some examples include:
** sameness judgments for colors, tones, textures, etc.
** threshold differences for colors, tones, textures, etc.

* ''[[Eye tracking]].'' This methodology is used to study a variety of cognitive processes, most notably visual perception and language processing. The fixation point of the eyes is linked to an individual's focus of attention. Thus, by monitoring eye movements, we can study what information is being processed at a given time. Eye tracking allows us to study cognitive processes on extremely short time scales. Eye movements reflect online decision making during a task, and they provide us with some insight into the ways in which those decisions may be processed. 

===Brain imaging===
[[Image:Hypothalamus.jpg|thumb|150px||Image of the human brain. The arrow indicates the position of the hypothalamus.]]

Brain imaging involves analyzing activity within the brain while performing various cognitive tasks. This allows us to link behavior and brain function to help understand how information is processed. Different types of imaging techniques vary in their temporal (time-based) and spatial (location-based) resolution. Brain imaging is often used in [[cognitive neuroscience]].

* ''[[Single photon emission computed tomography]]'' and ''[[Positron emission tomography]].'' SPECT and PET use radioactive isotopes, which are injected into the subject's bloodstream and taken up by the brain. By observing which areas of the brain take up the radioactive isotope, we can see which areas of the brain are more active than other areas. PET has similar spatial resolution to fMRI, but it has extremely poor temporal resolution.

* ''[[Electroencephalography|EEG]].'' Electroencephalography (EEG) measures the electrical fields generated by large populations of neurons in the cortex by placing a series of electrodes on the scalp of the subject. This technique has an extremely high temporal resolution, but a relatively poor spatial resolution.

* ''[[functional MRI|fMRI]].'' fMRI measures the relative amount of oxygenated blood flowing to different parts of the brain. More oxygenated blood in a particular region is correlated with an increase in neural activity in that part of the brain. This allows us to localize particular functions within different brain regions. fMRI has moderate spatial and temporal resolution.

* ''[[Optical imaging]].'' This technique uses infrared transmitters and receivers to measure the amount of light reflectance by blood near different areas of the brain. Since oxygenated and deoxygenated blood reflects light by different amounts, we can study which areas are more active (those that have more oxygenated blood). Optical imaging has moderate temporal resolution, but poor spatial resolution. It also has the advantage that it is extremely safe and can be used to study infants' brains.

*''[[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]].'' This technique measures magnetic fields resulting from cortical activity. It is similar to [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], except that it has improved spatial resolution and the apparatus is a very long device that ends at an interface with the head.&lt;!--I need help!!--&gt;

===Computational modeling===
[[Image:MultiLayerNeuralNetwork_english.png|thumb|200px|Neural network with two layers.]]

[[computer model|Computational models]] are often used to simulate specific aspects of intelligence. These models can help us understand the functional organization of a particular cognitive phenomenon.

* ''[[Connectionism|Connectionist/neural network models]].'' Connectionism relies on the idea that the mind/brain is composed of simple nodes and that the power of the system comes primarily from the existence, and manner of connections between the simple nodes. [[Neural nets]] are textbook implementations of this approach. Some critics of this approach feel that while it may be true as a repetition of how the system works it does not have explanative powers, as complicated systems of connections with even simple rules are extremely complex, and often less interpretable than the system they model.

* ''Symbolic models.''

* ''[[Dynamical systems]].''

===Neurobiological methods===
Research methods borrowed directly from [[neuroscience]] and [[neuropsychology]] can also help us understand aspects of intelligence. This methods allow us to understand how intelligent behavior is implemented in a physical system.

* ''Single-cell recording.''

* ''Direct brain stimulation.''

* ''Animal models.''

* ''Lesion patients.''

==Key findings==
'''Cognitive science''' has much to its credit. Among other accomplishments, it has given rise to models of human [[cognitive bias]] and [[risk]] perception, and has been influential in the development of [[behavioral finance]], part of [[economics]].  It has also given rise to a new theory of the [[philosophy of mathematics]], and many theories of [[artificial intelligence]], [[persuasion]] and [[coercion]]. It has made its presence firmly known in [[philosophy of language]] and [[epistemology]] - a modern revival of rationalism - as well as constituting a substantial wing of modern [[linguistics]].

The word '''copula''' originates from the [[Latin]] [[noun]] for a &quot;link or tie&quot; that connects two different things.  In [[linguistics]], a copula is a word that is used to link the [[subject]] of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] with a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] (a subject [[complement]] or an [[adverbial]]). Though it might not itself express any action or condition, it serves to equate (or associate) the subject with the predicate.

A copula is sometimes (though not always) a [[verb]] or a verb-like part of speech. In English [[primary education]] grammar courses, a copula is often called a '''linking verb'''.

The term is generally used to refer to the main copular verb in the language: in the case of English, this is &quot;'''to be'''&quot;.  It can also be used to refer to all such verbs in the language: in that case, English copulas include, &quot;to be&quot;, &quot;to become&quot;, &quot;to get&quot;, &quot;to feel&quot;, and &quot;to seem&quot;.  ''Fall'' can be a copulative verb, as in &quot;The zebra fell victim to the lion.&quot; See: [[List of English copulas]].

==The copula in English==

===Use===
We can identify several sub-uses of the copula:
*Identity: &quot;I only want to ''be'' myself.&quot;  &quot;When the area behind the dam fills, it will ''be'' a lake.&quot;  &quot;The Morning Star ''is'' the Evening Star.&quot;  &quot;Boys ''will be'' boys.&quot;  &quot;I ''yam'' what I yam&quot; ([[Popeye]]).
*Class membership.  To belong to a set or class: &quot;She could ''be'' married.&quot;  &quot;Dogs ''are'' canines.&quot;  &quot;Moscow ''is'' a large city.&quot;  Depending on one's point of view, all other uses can be considered derivatives of this use, including the following non-copular uses in English, as they all express a [[Subset|subset]] relationship.
*Predication (property and relation attribution): &quot;It hurts to '''be''' blue.&quot;  &quot;Will that house '''be''' big enough?&quot;  &quot;The hen '''is''' next to the cockerel.&quot;  &quot;I '''am''' confused.&quot;  Such attributes may also relate to temporary conditions as well as inherent qualities: &quot;I will '''be''' tired after running.&quot;  &quot;Will you '''be''' going to the play tomorrow?&quot; (see below)

The verb &quot;to be&quot; also has some non-copular uses, including:
*As an auxiliary verb:
**To form the passive voice: &quot;I '''was''' told that you wanted to see me&quot;
**To add continuous aspect to tenses: &quot;It is raining&quot;
*Meaning &quot;to exist&quot;:  &quot;I want only to '''be''', and that is enough.&quot; &quot;There's no sense in making a scientific inquiry about what species the Loch Ness Monster is, without first establishing that the Loch Ness Monster indeed ''is.''&quot;
Note that the auxiliary verb function derives from the copular function; and, depending on one's point of view, one can still interpret the verb as a copula and the following verbal form as being adjectival.

===Conjugation===
As in most [[Indo-European language]]s, the English copula is the most irregular verb, due to constant use.  Most English verbs (traditionally known as &quot;[[weak verb]]s&quot;) have just four separate forms, e.g. &quot;start&quot;, &quot;starts&quot;, &quot;starting&quot;, &quot;started&quot;.  A large minority of verbs (traditionally known as &quot;[[strong verb]]s&quot;) have five separate forms, e.g. &quot;begin&quot;, &quot;begins&quot;, &quot;beginning&quot;, &quot;began&quot;, &quot;begun&quot;.  &quot;To be&quot; is a very special case in having eight forms: &quot;be&quot;, &quot;am&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;are&quot;, &quot;being&quot;, &quot;was&quot;, &quot;were&quot;, &quot;been&quot;.  Traditionally, it had even more, including &quot;art&quot;, &quot;wast&quot;, &quot;wert&quot;, and, occasionally, &quot;best&quot; as a subjunctive.  On the history of the paradigm, see: [[Indo-European copula]].

==Copulas in other languages==
Languages tend to use copulas in quite different ways.

===Chinese===
In [[Chinese language|Chinese]] languages, both states and qualities are generally expressed with [[stative verb]]s with no need for a copula, e.g., &quot;to be tired&quot; (累 ''lèi''), &quot;to be hungry&quot; (饿 ''è''), &quot;to be located at&quot; (在 ''zài''), &quot;to be stupid&quot; (笨 ''bèn'') and so forth.  These verbs are usually preceded by an adverb such as 很 ''hěn'' (&quot;very&quot;) or 不 ''bù'' (&quot;not&quot;).

Only sentences with a noun as the complement (e.g. &quot;this is my sister&quot;) use the verb &quot;to be&quot;: 是 ''shì''. This is used frequently: for example, instead of having a verb meaning &quot;to be Chinese&quot;, the usual expression is &quot;to be a Chinese person&quot;, using 是 ''shì''.  Other sentences use adjectives plus the nominaliser 的 ''de'', e.g. 这是红的 ''zhè shì hóng de'' &quot;this is [a] red [one]&quot;.

The history of the Chinese copula 是 is a controversial subject. Before the [[Han Dynasty]], the character served as a [[demonstrative pronoun]] meaning &quot;this&quot; (this usage survives in some idioms and proverbs). Some linguists argue that 是 developed into a copula because it often appeared, as a repetitive subject, after the subject of a sentence (in [[classical Chinese]] we can say, for example: &quot;George W. Bush, '''this''' president of the United States&quot; meaning &quot;George W. Bush '''is''' the president of the United States). Other scholars cannot completely accept the explanation, proposing that 是 served as a demonstrative pronoun and a copula at the same  time in ancient Chinese. [[etymology|Etymologically]], 是 means &quot;straight&quot;; in modern Chinese, 是 means &quot;yes&quot; as an interjection, and &quot;correct&quot;, &quot;right&quot; as an adjective, implying a sense of judgement.      

&lt;small&gt;N.B. The characters used are [[Simplified Chinese|simplified]] ones, and the transcriptions given in italics reflect [[standard Mandarin]] pronunciation, using the [[Pinyin]] system.&lt;/small&gt;

===Japanese===
[[Japanese language|Japanese]] has copulas which would most often be translated as one of the so-called be-verbs of English. The Japanese copula has many forms, including but not limited to ''da'', ''na'', ''de'', and ''desu''. The first and last are used to [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] sentences, while the middle two are used within sentences to modify or connect.

Japanese sentences with copulas most often equate one thing with another, that is, they are of the form &quot;A is B.&quot; Examples:
* &amp;#12371;&amp;#12428;&amp;#12399;&amp;#12506;&amp;#12531;&amp;#12391;&amp;#12377;&amp;#12290;''Kore wa pen desu''. &quot;This is a pen&quot; (lit., this &lt;small&gt;TOPIC&lt;/small&gt; pen &lt;small&gt;COPULA&lt;/small&gt;)
* &amp;#20693;&amp;#12399;&amp;#23398;&amp;#29983;&amp;#12384;&amp;#12290;''Boku wa gakusei da'' &quot;I am a student&quot; (lit., I-&lt;small&gt;MASCULINE&lt;/small&gt; &lt;small&gt;TOPIC&lt;/small&gt; student &lt;small&gt;COPULA&lt;/small&gt;)

The following examples show the use of the copula as a modifier or connector.

* &amp;#21307;&amp;#32773;&amp;#12398;&amp;#12362;&amp;#12376; ''isha no oji'' &quot;uncle who is a physician&quot; (lit., physician &lt;small&gt;COPULA&lt;/small&gt; uncle)
* &amp;#22909;&amp;#12365;&amp;#12391;&amp;#12383;&amp;#12414;&amp;#12425;&amp;#12394;&amp;#12356; ''suki de tamaranai'' &quot;I love it so much I'm gonna burst&quot; (lit., like &lt;small&gt;COPULA&lt;/small&gt; not-be-able-to-bear)

The difference between ''da'' and ''desu'' is simple: ''desu'' is more formal and polite than ''da''. Thus, the two sentences below are identical in meaning and differ only in their politeness.
* &amp;#12354;&amp;#12428;&amp;#12399;&amp;#12507;&amp;#12486;&amp;#12523;&amp;#12384;&amp;#12290;''Are wa hoteru da''. &quot;That is a hotel.&quot; (lit., that &lt;small&gt;TOPIC&lt;/small&gt; hotel &lt;small&gt;COPULA&lt;/small&gt;)
* &amp;#12354;&amp;#12428;&amp;#12399;&amp;#12507;&amp;#12486;&amp;#12523;&amp;#12391;&amp;#12377;&amp;#12290;''Are wa hoteru desu''. &quot;That is a hotel.&quot; (lit., that &lt;small&gt;TOPIC&lt;/small&gt; hotel &lt;small&gt;COPULA&lt;/small&gt;)

Japanese sentences may be predicated with copulas or with verbs. However, ''desu'' may not always be a predicate. In some cases, its only function is to make a sentence predicated with a [[stative verb]] more polite. In a sense, there are two words ''desu'' in Japanese: one is a polite copula that predicates sentences, and the other is a politeness marker added to stative verbs. However, ''da'' always functions as a predicate, so it cannot be combined with a stative verb, because sentences need only one predicate. See the examples below.
* &amp;#12371;&amp;#12398;&amp;#12499;&amp;#12540;&amp;#12523;&amp;#12399;&amp;#12358;&amp;#12414;&amp;#12356;&amp;#12290;''Kono biiru wa umai'' &quot;This beer is good&quot; (lit., this beer &lt;small&gt;TOPIC&lt;/small&gt; be-tasty)
* &amp;#12371;&amp;#12398;&amp;#12499;&amp;#12540;&amp;#12523;&amp;#12399;&amp;#12358;&amp;#12414;&amp;#12356;&amp;#12391;&amp;#12377;&amp;#12290;''Kono biiru wa umai desu'' &quot;This beer is good&quot; (lit., this beer &lt;small&gt;TOPIC&lt;/small&gt; be-tasty &lt;small&gt;POLITE&lt;/small&gt;)
: but
* ''Kono biiru wa umai da'' - unacceptable

Japanese also has two verbs corresponding to English &quot;to be&quot;: ''aru'' and ''iru''. Neither of them is a copula. ''Aru'' is used for inanimate objects, including plants, while ''iru'' is used for people and animals, though there are exceptions to this generalization. Different usages of the copula, stative verbs, and the two verbs of being are shown below. 

* &amp;#26412;&amp;#12399;&amp;#12486;&amp;#12540;&amp;#12502;&amp;#12523;&amp;#12395;&amp;#12354;&amp;#12427;&amp;#12290;''Hon wa teeburu ni aru.'' &quot;The book is on the table.&quot;

===Indo-European languages===
{{main|Indo-European copula}}

In [[Indo-European language]]s, the words meaning &quot;to be&quot; (originating in stem ''*es'') often sound similar to each other. Due to the high frequency of their use, their inflection retains a considerable degree of similarity in some cases. Thus, for example, the [[English language|English]] form ''is'' is an apparent [[cognate]] of [[German language|German]] ''ist'', Latin ''est'' and [[Russian language|Russian]] ''&lt;nowiki&gt;jest'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'', in spite the fact that the Germanic, Romance, and Slavic language groups split at least three thousand years ago.

A feature of most [[Romance language]]s is the coexistence of two different verbs meaning &quot;to be&quot;, the main one from the [[Latin]] ''sum'', and a secondary one from '''sto'' (see [[Romance copula]]).  The difference is that the former usually refers to essential characteristics, whilst the latter refers to states and situations, e. g. &quot;Bob is old&quot; versus &quot;Bob is well&quot;.  (Note that the English words just used, &quot;essential&quot; and &quot;state&quot; are also cognate with the Latin roots ''esse'' and ''stare''.)

*[[Italian language|Italian]] ''Bob è vecchio'' &amp;mdash; Bob is old
*[[Italian language|Italian]] ''Bob sta bene''   &amp;mdash; Bob is well

In Spanish, for example, the quite high degree of verbal [[inflection]], plus the existence of two copulae (''ser'' and ''estar''), means that there are 105 separate forms to express the eight of English, and one of Chinese.

In certain languages there are not only two copulae but the [[syntax]] is also changed when one is distinguishing between states or situation and essential characteristics. For example, in [[Irish language|Irish]], describing the subject's state or situation typically uses the normal VSO ordering with the verb ''bí''. The copula ''is'', which is used to state essential characteristics or equivalences, requires a change in word order so that the subject does not immediately follow the copula (see [[Irish syntax]]).

===Russian and Hungarian===
In languages such as [[Russian language|Russian]] or [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], the copula in present tense is implied rather than spoken (Russian: я&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; человек, ''ya&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; chelovek'' &quot;I (am) a human&quot;; Hungarian: ''&amp;#337; ember'', &quot;he (is) a human&quot;).  This usage (also common in [[Semitic languages]]), is known generically as the '''[[zero copula]]'''.  Note that in other tenses (sometimes in other persons besides singular third) the copula usually reappears.

In Hungarian, zero copula is restricted to present tense in 3rd person singular and plural (see examples above): &quot;Ő ember/Ők emberek&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; &quot;s/he is a human&quot;/&quot;they are humans&quot;; but: &quot;(én) ember vagyok&quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; &quot;I am a human&quot;, &quot;(te) ember vagy&quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; &quot;you are a human&quot;, &quot;(mi) emberek vagyunk&quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; &quot;we are humans&quot;, &quot;(ti) emberek vagytok&quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; &quot;you (all) are humans&quot;. It also reappears for stating locations: &quot;az emberek a házban vannak&quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; &quot;the people are in the house&quot;.

To recycle the above examples (&quot;Bob is old&quot; versus &quot;Bob is here&quot;), Hungarian only uses a copula in the latter case (and this not only with regard to third person singular/plural) (''Itt van Róbert''), but not in the first example (''Róbert öreg''). This is to relate a subject to a more temporary condition/state taking place in ''space'' (very often in the sense of [[Lojban]] ''zvati''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; &quot;la rabyrt. zvati ne'i le zdani&quot; (Robert is in the house)).

In Russian, the verb &quot;быть&quot; (''byt&amp;rsquo;'') is the infinitive of &quot;to be&quot;.  The third person singular, &quot;есть&quot; (''yest&amp;rsquo;'') means &quot;is&quot; (and, interestingly enough, it is a homonym of the infinitive &quot;to eat&quot;). As a copula, it can be inflected into the past (&quot;был&quot;, ''byl''), future (&quot;будет&quot;, ''budet''), and subjunctive (&quot;был&quot; or &quot;бы&quot;, ''byl'' or ''by'') forms. A present tense (&quot;есть&quot;, ''yest&amp;rsquo;'') exists; however, it is almost never used as a copula, but rather omitted altogether or replaced by the verb &quot;являться&quot; (''yavlyat'sa'') (to be in essence). Thus one can say:

*Она была красивой (''Ona byla krasivoy'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; &quot;she was beautiful&quot; (adjective in [[instrumental case]]).
*Она красивая (''Ona krasivaya'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; &quot;she is beautiful&quot; (adjective in the [[nominative case]]).
*Она является красивой (''Ona yavlyayetsya krasivoy'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; &quot;she is beautiful&quot; (adjective also in instrumental).

But not (except for archaic effect):
*Она есть красивая (''Ona yest&amp;rsquo; krasivaya'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; &quot;she is beautiful&quot;.
&lt;!-- (Actually, the above is correct Russian, but is (a) to the highest degree formal language, and (b) goes beyond copulative usage to connote something more existential than is meant by the English ''is''.  For these two reasons, this construction is quite rare.) --&gt;
The third person plural &quot;суть&quot; (''sut&amp;rsquo;'') (&quot;are&quot;) is still used in some standard phrases (but since it is a homonym of the noun &quot;essence&quot;, most native speakers do not notice it to be a verb):
*Они суть одно и то же (''Oni sut&amp;rsquo; odno i to zhe'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; &quot;they are one and the same&quot;.

===Turkish===
''(See also the separate article on the [[Turkish copula]].)''

Unlike Indo-european languages, being an extremely regular [[agglutinative language]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] forms its &quot;being&quot; not as a regular verb, rather as an auxiliary verb denoted as &quot;i-mek&quot; which shows its existence only through suffixes to predicates which can be nouns, adjectives or arguably conjugated verb stems.

In the third person singular, just like in Hungarian or Russian [[Zero copula]] is the case. 

For example:
* ''Deniz mavi.'' = &quot;[The] sea is blue&quot; (the auxiliary verb &quot;i-mek&quot; is implied only)
* ''Ben maviyim'' = &quot;I am blue&quot; (the auxiliary verb &quot;i-mek&quot; appears in &quot;(y)im&quot;.)

===Georgian===

Just like in English, the verb &quot;to be&quot; (''qopna'') is irregular in [[Georgian language|Georgian]]; different verb roots are employed in different tenses. The roots -''ar''-, -''kn''-, -''qav''-, and -''qop''- (past participle) are used in the present tense, future tense, past tense and the perfective tenses respectively. Examples:

:''Masc'avlebeli v'''ar''''' (&quot;I ''am'' a teacher&quot;)
:''Masc'avlebeli vi'''kn'''ebi'' (&quot;I ''will be'' a teacher&quot;)
:''Masc'avlebeli vi'''qav'''i'' (&quot;I ''was'' a teacher&quot;)
:''Masc'avlebeli v'''qop'''ilv'''ar''''' (&quot;I ''have been'' a teacher&quot;)
:''Masc'avlebeli v'''qop'''ili'''qav'''i'' (&quot;I ''had been'' a teacher&quot;)

Note that in the last two examples (perfective and pluperfective) two roots are used in one verb compound. In the perfective tense, the root ''qop'' (which is the expected root for the perfective tense) is followed by the root ''ar'', which is the root for the present tense. In the pluperfective tense, again, the root ''qop'' is followed by the past tense root ''qav''. This formation is very similar to German. In German, the perfective and the pluperfective are expressed in this way:

:''Ich '''bin''' ein Lehrer '''gewesen''''' (&quot;I have been a teacher&quot;)
:''Ich '''war''' ein Lehrer '''gewesen''''' (&quot;I had been a teacher&quot;)

Here, ''gewesen'' is the past participle of ''sein'' (&quot;to be&quot;) in German. In both examples, just like in Georgian, this participle is used together with the present and the past forms of the verb in order to conjugate for the perfect and the pluperfect tenses.

===Nahuatl===
[[Nahuatl]], as well as some other [[Amerindian language]]s, has no copula. Instead of using a copula, it is possible to conjugate nouns or adjectives like verbs.

===Siouan languages===
In Siouan languages like [[Lakota]], this is similar as in principle almost all words - according to their structure - are verbs. So, not very unlike in Lojban (see below), not only (transitive, intransitive and so-called 'stative') verbs but even nouns often behave like verbs - and do not need to have copulas. E.g. _wicasa_ [wicha's^a] - man/adult male, to-be-a-man -&gt; wimacasa/winicasa/he wicasa (I am/you are/he is a man). Yet, there also is a verb (copula) _heca_ [he'cha] (to be a such) that in most cases is used: &quot;wicasa hemaca/henica/heca&quot; (I am/you are/he is a man). So, in order to express that I am a doctor of profession, I have to say: &quot;pezuta wicasa hemaca&quot; [phez^u'ta wicha's^a hema'cha]. But in order to express that I'm THE doctor (say, that had been phoned to help), I'd have to use another copula _(i)ye_ (to be the one): &quot;pezuta wicasa (kin) miye lo&quot; (medicine-man DEF ART I-am-the-one MALE ASSERT).

In order to refer to space (e.g. Robert is in the house), various verbs are used as copula, e.g. _yankA_ [yaNka'] (lit.: to sit) for humans, _han/he_ [haN'/he'] (to stand upright) for inanimates of a certain shape. So, &quot;Robert is in the house&quot; could be translated as &quot;Robert timahel yanke (yelo)&quot;, whereas &quot;there's one restaurant next to the gas station&quot; translates as &quot;owotetipi wigli-oinazin kin hel isakib wanzi he&quot;.
*[http://www.fa-kuan.de/LAKSTRUCT.HTML Essay on Lakota syntax]

===Artificial languages===
The [[artificial language]] [[Lojban]] has copula, but they are rarely used, and are sometimes viewed with distaste in the Lojban community, because all words that express a predicate can be used as verbs.  The three sentences above would all have the same form in Lojban: ''la bob. bajra'', ''la bob. tolcitno'', and ''la bob. fagdirpre''. There are several different copula: ''me'' turns whatever follows the word ''me'' into a verb that means ''to be'' what it follows. For example, ''me la bob.'' means ''to be Bob.'' Another copula is ''du'', which is a verb that means all its arguments are the same thing (equal) [http://ptolemy.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/lojbanbrochure/lessons/less12eq.html].

The [[E-Prime]] language, based on English, simply avoids the issue by not having a generic copula. It requires instead a specific form such as &quot;remains&quot;, &quot;becomes&quot;, &quot;lies&quot;, or &quot;equals&quot;.

[[Esperanto]] uses the copula much as in English.  However, as with the rest of Esperanto grammar, there are no irregularities.  The infinitive is ''esti'', and the whole conjugation is regular.

In [[Toki Pona]], if the subject is ''mi'' (I) or ''sina'' (you, sg.) there is no copula needed; otherwise, it's used ''li'' just before the verb. For example: &quot;sina pona&quot; (you're good), &quot;meli li pona&quot; ((the) woman is good).

==Existential usage==

The existential usage of &quot;to be&quot; is distinct from and yet, in some languages, intimately related to its copulative usage.  In language as opposed to formal logic, existence is a predicate rather than a quantifier, and the passage from copulative to existential usage can be subtle.

For example:

*'''Japanese''': &amp;#21566;&amp;#36649;&amp;#12399;&amp;#29483;'''&amp;#12391;&amp;#12354;&amp;#12427;'''&amp;#12290;&amp;#21517;&amp;#21069;&amp;#12399;&amp;#12414;&amp;#12384;'''&amp;#12394;&amp;#12356;'''&amp;#12290; ''Wagahai wa neko '''de aru'''. Namae wa mada '''nai''''' &amp;ndash; ''I '''am''' a cat. As yet, I '''have no''' name''. &amp;mdash; [[Soseki Natsume]]
*'''English''': '''''To be''' or not '''to be''', that ''is'' the question''. &amp;mdash; [[William Shakespeare]]
*'''English''': ''[Why climb Mount Everest?] Because '''it is there'''''. &amp;mdash; [[George Mallory]]
*'''Russian''': ''&amp;#1057;&amp;#1090;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1085;&amp;#1072;, &amp;#1082;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1090;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1091;&amp;#1102; &amp;#1080;&amp;#1097;&amp;#1091;&amp;#1090; &amp;#1076;&amp;#1077;&amp;#1090;&amp;#1080;, '''&amp;#1077;&amp;#1089;&amp;#1090;&amp;#1100;''''' [Strana, kotoruju ishchut djeti, jest'] &amp;ndash; ''That land we yearn for in our childhood '''is there'''.'' &amp;mdash; [[Prishvin]]
*'''French''': ''Je pense, donc '''je suis'''.'' &amp;ndash; ''I think, therefore '''I am'''''. &amp;mdash; [[Descartes]]
*'''Latin''': ''[[Cogito ergo sum|Cogito ergo '''sum''']].'' &amp;mdash; ''I think, therefore '''I am'''''. &amp;mdash; [[Descartes]]
*'''Turkish''': ''Dü_ünüyorum, öyleyse '''var1m'''.'' &amp;ndash; ''I think, therefore '''I am'''''. &amp;mdash; [[Descartes]]

Other languages prefer to keep the existential usage entirely separate from the copula.  Swedish, for example, reserves ''vara'' for the copula, keeping ''bli'' (to become) and ''finnas'' (to be found) for becoming and existing, respectively.  

*'''Swedish''': ''Vem vill '''bli''' miljonär?'' &amp;mdash; ''Who wants ''to be'' a millionaire?''. &amp;mdash; [[Bengt Magnusson]] 
*'''Swedish''': ''Varför bestiga Mt. Everest?  Därfor att det '''finns''' där.'' &amp;mdash; ''Why climb Mt. Everest? Because it ''is'' there''. &amp;mdash; [[George Mallory]]

In [[ontology]], philosophical discussions of the word &quot;be&quot; and its conjugations takes place over the meaning of the word ''is,'' the third person singular form of 'be', and whether the other senses can be [[reduction|reduced]] to one sense.  For example, it is sometimes suggested that the &quot;is&quot; of existence is reducible to the &quot;is&quot; of property attribution or class membership; to be, [[Aristotle]] held, is to be ''something''.  Of course, the gerund form of &quot;be&quot;, ''being'', is its own (vexed) topic: see [[being]] and [[existence]].

==Copula as subset relator==
From one perspective, the copula always relates two things as subsets.  Take the following examples:
#''John is a doctor.''
#''John and Mary are doctors.''
#''Doctors are educated.''
#''Mary is running.''
#''Running is fun.''

Example 1 includes John in the set of all doctors.  Example 2 includes John and Mary both in the set of all doctors.  Example 3 includes the set of doctors in the set of those who are educated.

Example 4 is different.  Example 4 includes Mary's [[Stative verb|state]] at the time of utterance in the [[Dynamic verb|set of states consistent with running]].  Example 5 then includes the set of states consistent with running in the set of states consistent with fun.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Venezuelan Beaver cheese''' is a variety of [[cheese]] referred to in the &quot;[[Cheese Shop sketch]]&quot; from ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''.  Although this delicacy appears to be entirely fictional, various recipes for Venezuelan Beaver cheese have in fact been published.  The active ingredients  generally include [[beaver]] milk (Venezuelan beavers apparently preferred, though [[Venezuela]] has no native beavers), [[rennet]] and salt.

Venezuelan Beaver cheese also makes an appearance in [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra]]'s computer adventure game ''[[Leisure Suit Larry|Leisure Suit Larry VII]]'', and in the webcomic ''[[Triangle and Robert]]''.

Notes:
# In the pre-reform [[Russian language|Russian]]  orthography, in [[Old Russian language|Old Russian]] and in [[Old Church Slavonic]] the letter is called [[yer]]. Historically, the &quot;hard sign&quot; takes the place of a now-absent [[vowel]], still preserved in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]. See the notes for Bulgarian.
# When an iotated vowel (vowel whose sound begins with {{IPA|/j/}}) follows a consonant, the consonant will become palatalised (the {{IPA|/j/}} sound will mix with the consonant), and the vowel’s initial {{IPA|/j/}} sound will not be heard independently. The Hard Sign will indicate that this does not happen, and the {{IPA|/j/}} sound will appear only in front of the vowel. The Soft Sign will indicate that the consonant should be palatised, but the vowel’s {{IPA|/j/}} sound will not mix with the [[palatalization]] of the consonant. The Soft Sign will also indicate that a consonant before another consonant or at the end of a word is palatised. Examples: та ({{IPA|ta}}); тя ({{IPA|tʲa}}); тья ({{IPA|tʲja}}); тъя ({{IPA|tja}}); т ({{IPA|t}}); ть ({{IPA|tʲ}}).

Historical letters: before [[1918]], there were four extra letters in use: {{Unicode|Іі}} (replaced by Ии), {{Unicode|Ѳѳ}} (Фита &quot;[[Fita]]&quot;, replaced by Фф), {{Unicode |Ѣѣ}} (Ять &quot;[[Yat]]&quot;, replaced by Ее), and {{Unicode |Ѵѵ}} (ижица &quot;[[Izhitsa]]&quot;, replaced by Ии); these were eliminated by [[reforms of Russian orthography]].

==== Ukrainian ====  

''Main article:'' [[Ukrainian alphabet]].

{{Ukrainian alphabet}}

[[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] differs from Russian in the following ways:
* [[He (Cyrillic) |He]] (Г, г) is a [[voiced]] [[fricative]] [[consonant]], pronounced {{IPA |/ɦ/}}.
* [[Ghe|Ge]] (Ґ, ґ) appears after He, pronounced {{IPA|/g/}}, i.e., like a Russian Г. It looks like He with an &quot;upturn&quot; pointing up from the right side of the top bar. (This letter was not officially used in the [[Soviet Union]] after 1933, so it is missing from older Cyrillic fonts.)
* [[Ye (Cyrillic) |E]] (Е, е) is pronounced {{IPA|/e/}} . 
* [[Ukrainian Ye|Ye]] (Є, є) appears after E, pronounced {{IPA|/je/}}. It looks like a mirrored Russian letter Э. 
* [[I (Cyrillic)|Y]] (И, и) is pronounced {{IPA|/ɪ/}} (similar to Russian [[Yery]]). 
* [[Ukrainian I|I]] (І, і) appears after Y, pronounced {{IPA|/i/}}. It looks like the Latin letter I.
* [[Yi (Cyrillic)|Yi]] (Ї, ї) appears after I, pronounced {{IPA|/ji/}}. It looks like I with a diaeresis above it (the same two dots that appear over the Russian letter Yo).
* [[Yot]] (Й, й) is the equivalent of Russian Short I. 
* [[Shcha]] (Щ, щ) is pronounced {{IPA|ʃʧ}}.
* An [[Apostrophe (mark) |apostrophe]] (’) serves the purpose of the Russian Hard Sign.
* [[Yo (Cyrillic) |Yo]] does not appear.

==== Belarusian ====

[[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] is also written in a Belarusian [[Latin alphabet]] (''[[Lacinka alphabet|Łacinka]]''). Historically, Belarusian [[Tatars]] have written the language in the [[Arabic alphabet]] (''Arabica''), and Belarusian [[Jew]]s in the [[Hebrew alphabet]].

|}

NB: Before 1933, Ґ ({{IPA|/g/}}) was also present. Some linguists call for restoring the letter.

Belarusian differs from Russian in the following ways:
* I looks like the Latin letter I (І, і). (But non-syllabic [[short I]] looks the same as in Russian.)
* Between U and Ef is the letter [[U short]] (Ў, ў), which looks like U (У) with a [[breve]] and pronounced {{IPA|/w/}}, or like the ''u'' part in [[diphthong]]s in ''now, low.''
* Shcha (Щ, щ) does not appear. A combination of sh and ch (ШЧ, шч) is typically used instead.
* The Hard Sign is not used. Its purpose (removing of palatalisation) is served by an apostrophe.
* The letter combinations Дж дж and Дз дз appear after Д д in the Belarusian alphabet in some publications. These [[digraph (orthography) |digraphs]] each represent a single sound: Дж {{IPA|/ʤ/}}, Дз {{IPA|/ʣ/}}.
* Г represents a [[voiced]] [[fricative]] [[consonant]].

Serbian differs from Russian in the following ways:
* Ye is pronounced {{IPA|/ɛ/}}. Yo does not appear. The Russian letter Э does not appear.
* Between D and E is the letter Djə (Ђ, ђ), which is pronounced {{IPA|/dʲ/}}, and looks like Tjə, except that the loop of the H curls farther and dips downwards.
* Short I does not appear. Between I and K is the letter Jə (Ј, ј), pronounced {{IPA|/j/}}, which looks like the Latin letter J.
* Between L and M is the letter Ljə (Љ, љ), pronounced {{IPA|/lʲ/}}, which looks like L and the Soft Sign smashed together.
* Between N and O is the letter Njə (Њ, њ), pronounced {{IPA|/nʲ/}}, which looks like N and the Soft Sign smashed together.
* Between T and U is the letter Tjə (Ћ, ћ), which is pronounced {{IPA|/tʲ/}} and looks like a lowercase Latin letter h with a bar. On the uppercase letter, the bar appears at the top; on the lowercase letter, the bar crosses the top half of the vertical line.
* Between Ch and Sh is the letter Dzhə (Џ, џ), pronounced {{IPA|/dʒ/}}, which looks like Ts but with the downturn moved from the right side of the bottom bar to the middle of the bottom bar.
* Sh is the last letter; the rest do not appear.

[[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] differs from ''Serbian'' in the following ways:
* Between Ze and I is the letter Dze (Ѕ, ѕ), pronounced {{IPA|/dz/}}, which looks like the Latin letter S.
* Djerv is replaced by Gje (Ѓ, ѓ), pronounced {{IPA|/gʲ/}}, which looks like Ghe with an acute accent (´).
* Tjerv is replaced by Kja (Ќ, ќ), pronounced {{IPA|/kʲ/}}, which looks like Ka with an acute accent (´).

=== Non-Slavic languages ===

These alphabets are generally modelled after Russian, but often bear striking differences, particularly when adapted for [[Caucasian languages]]. The first few of them were generated by Orthodox missionaries for the Finnic and Turkic peoples of [[Idel-Ural]] ([[Mari]], [[Udmurt people|Udmurt]], [[Mordvin people|Mordva]], [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Tatars|Kerashen Tatars]]) in [[1870s]]. Later such alphabets were created for some of the [[Siberia]]n and [[Caucasus]] peoples who had recently converted to Christianity. In the [[1930s]], some of those alphabets were switched to the [[Uniform Turkic Alphabet]]. All of the peoples of the former Soviet Union who had been using an Arabic or other Asian script ([[Mongolian script]], etc.) also adopted Cyrillic alphabets, and during the [[Great Purge]] in late 1930s, all of the Roman-based alphabets of the peoples of the Soviet Union (with the exception of the Baltic alphabets) were switched over to Cyrillic as well. The Abkhazian alphabet was switched to [[Georgian alphabet|Georgian script]], but after the death of [[Stalin]] Abkhaz also adopted Cyrillic. The last language to adopt Cyrillic was the [[Gagauz language]], which had used [[Greek script]] before.

In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Turkmenistan]], the use of Cyrillic to represent local languages has often been a politically controversial issue after the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], as it evokes the era of Soviet rule (see [[Russification]]). Some of Russia's languages have also tried to drop Cyrillic, but the move was halted under Russian law (see [[Tatar alphabet]]). A number of languages have switched from Cyrillic to other orthographies—either Roman-based or returning to a former script.

Unlike the Roman alphabet, which is usually adapted to different languages by using additions to existing letters such as accents, umlauts, tildes and cedillas, the Cyrillic alphabet is usually adapted by the creation of entirely new letter shapes. In some alphabets invented in the 19th century, such as [[Mari language|Mari]], [[Udmurt language|Udmurt]] and [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]], umlauts and breves also were used.

==== Abkhaz ====

[[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] is a [[Caucasian language]], spoken in the Autonomous Republic of [[Abkhazia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. See [[Abkhaz alphabet]].

==== Moldovan ====
{{main |Moldovan alphabet}}

The [[Moldovan language]] used the Cyrillic alphabet between 1946 and 1989. Nowadays, this alphabet is still official in the unrecognized republic of [[Transnistria]].

==== Mongolian ====

The [[Mongolian language|Mongolic]] languages include [[Khalkha]] (in [[Mongolia]]), [[Buryat]] (around [[Lake Baikal]]) and [[Kalmyk]] (northwest of the [[Caspian Sea]]). Khalkha Mongolian is also written with the [[Mongolian alphabet|Mongol vertical alphabet]], which is being slowly reintroduced in Mongolia.

The Cyrillic letters Кк, Фф and Щщ are not used in native Mongolian words, but only for Russian loans.


===== Buryat =====
The [[Buryat]] (буряад) Cyrillic alphabet is similar to the Khalkha above, but Ьь indicates palatalization as in Russian. Buryat does not use Вв, Кк, Фф, Цц, Чч, Щщ or Ъъ in its native words.

The [[Kalmyk language|Kalmyk]] (хальмг) Cyrillic alphabet is similar to the Khalkha, but the letters Ээ, Юю and Яя appear only word-initially. In Kalmyk, long vowels are written double in the first syllable (нөөрин), but single in syllables after the first. Short vowels are omitted altogether in syllables after the first syllable (хальмг = xaʎmag).

== Cyrillic in Unicode ==

Main article: [[Cyrillic characters in Unicode]].

In [[Unicode]], the Cyrillic block extends from U+0400 to U+052F. The characters in the range U+0400 to U+045F are basically the characters from [[ISO 8859-5]] moved upward by 864 positions. The characters in the range U+0460 to U+0489 are historic letters, not used now. The characters in the range U+048A to U+052F are additional letters for various languages that are written with Cyrillic script.

[[Unicode]] does not include accented Cyrillic letters, but they can be [[Combining diacritical mark|combined]] by adding U+0301 (&quot;combining acute accent&quot;) after the accented vowel (e.g., ы́ э́ ю́ я́). Some languages (e.g., modern [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]]) still are not fully supported.

A '''consonant''' is a [[sound]] in spoken [[language]] that is characterized by a closure or stricture of the [[vocal tract]] sufficient to cause audible turbulence. The word ''consonant'' comes from [[Latin]] and means &quot;sounding with&quot; or &quot;sounding together&quot;, the idea being that consonants don't sound on their own, but only occur with a nearby [[vowel]], which is the case in Latin. This conception of consonants, however, does not reflect the modern linguistic understanding which defines consonants in terms of vocal tract constriction.
{{Place_of_articulation}}
{{Manner_of_articulation}}
Since the number of consonants in the world's languages is much greater than the number of consonant letters in any one alphabet, [[linguist]]s have devised systems such as the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) to assign a unique [[symbol]] to each possible consonant. In fact, the [[Latin alphabet]], which is used to write English, has fewer consonant letters than English has consonant sounds, so some letters represent more than one consonant, and [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s like &quot;sh&quot; and &quot;th&quot; are used to represent some sounds. Many speakers aren't even aware that the &quot;th&quot; sound in &quot;this&quot; is a different sound from the &quot;th&quot; sound in &quot;thing&quot; (in the IPA they're [&amp;#240;] and [&amp;#952;], respectively).

Each consonant can be distinguished by several ''[[Distinctive feature|features]]'':
* The [[manner of articulation]] is the method that the consonant is articulated, such as [[nasal consonant|nasal]] (through the nose), [[stop consonant|stop]] (complete obstruction of air), or [[approximant]] (vowel like). 
* The [[place of articulation]] is where in the vocal tract the obstruction of the consonant occurs, and which speech organs are involved. Places include [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]] (both lips), [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] (tongue against the gum ridge), and [[velar consonant|velar]] (tongue against soft palate). Additionally, there may be a simultaneous narrowing at another place of articulation, such as [[palatalisation]] or [[pharyngealisation]].
* The [[phonation]] of a consonant is how the [[vocal cords]] vibrate during the articulation. When the vocal cords vibrate fully, the consonant is called [[voiced]]; when they do not vibrate at all, it's [[voiceless]]. 
* The [[voice onset time]] (VOT) indicates the timing of the phonation. [[Aspiration (phonetics)|Aspiration]] is a feature of VOT.
* The [[airstream mechanism]] is how the air moving through the vocal tract is powered. Most languages have exclusively [[pulmonic egressive]] consonants, which use the lungs and diaphragm, but [[ejective]]s, [[click consonant|click]]s, and [[implosive]]s use different mechanisms.
* The [[gemination|length]] is how long the obstruction of a consonant lasts. This feature is not distinctive in English, but various languages such as Italian, Japanese and Finnish have two length levels, &quot;single&quot; and &quot;[[geminate]]&quot;. [[Estonian_language|Estonian]] and some [[Sami]] languages have three lengths on the phonetic level: short, geminate, and long geminate.
* The articulatory [[force]] is how much muscular energy is involved. This has been proposed many times, but no distinction relying exclusively on force has ever been demonstrated.

All English consonants can be classified by a combination of these features, such as &quot;voiceless alveolar stop consonant&quot; [t]. In this case the airstream mechanism is omitted.

Some pairs of consonants like ''p::b'', ''t::d'' are sometimes called [[Fortis and lenis|fortis]] and [[Fortis and lenis|lenis]], but this is a [[phonology|phonological]] rather than phonetic distinction.

==Consonant as a symbol==
The word '''consonant''' is also used to refer to a [[letter]] of an [[alphabet]] that denotes a consonant sound. Consonant letters in the English alphabet are [[B]], [[C]], [[D]], [[F]], [[G]], [[H]], [[J]], [[K]], [[L]], [[M]], [[N]], [[P]], [[Q]], [[R]], [[S]], [[T]], [[V]], [[W]], [[X]], [[Z]], and usually [[Y]]: The letter Y stands for the consonant [j] in &quot;yoke&quot; but for the vowel {{IPA|[&amp;#618;]}} in &quot;myth&quot;, for example.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Costume jewelry''' is [[jewelry]] that is made of less valuable materials, including [[base metal]]s, [[glass]], [[plastic]], and synthetic stones, in place of more valuable materials such as [[precious metal]]s and [[gem]]s. These items are usually, but not always, inexpensive, and often flashy. Costume jewelry is mainly used for [[fashion]] purposes, opposed to &quot;real&quot; (precious) jewelery which may exist primary as collectables, keepsakes, or investments.

Costume jewelry gets its name from its use in [[stage (theatre)|stage]] [[costume]]s. See [[fashion jewelry]]

[[Coco Chanel]] greatly popularized the use of faux jewelry in her years as a fashion designer, bringing costume jewelry to life with gold and faux pearls. 

[[Pennino Brothers Jewelry]] is one rare, but well-known brand of costume jewelry.

[[Image:ChannelIslands.png|right]]

The '''Channel Islands''' are a group of [[island]]s off the coast of [[Normandy]], [[France]], in the [[English Channel]]. They comprise two separate [[bailiwick]]s: the Bailiwick of [[Guernsey]] and the Bailiwick of [[Jersey]]. 

==History==
Major articles: [[History of Jersey]], [[History of Guernsey]]

The Islands were annexed to the [[Duchy of Normandy]] in [[933]]. In [[1066]] the Duke [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] invaded and conquered [[England]], becoming the English monarch. Since [[1204]], the loss of the rest of the monarch's lands in mainland Normandy has meant that the Channel Islands have been governed as separate possessions of [[the Crown]].

The Bailiwicks have been administered separately from each other since the late [[13th century]], and although those unacquainted with the Islands often assume they form one political unit, common institutions are the exception rather than the rule. The two Bailiwicks have no common laws, no common elections, and no common representative body (although their politicians consult regularly). There is no common newspaper or radio station, but a common television station, [[Channel Television]].

The Islands acquired commercial and political interests in the [[North America]]n colonies. Islanders became involved with the [[Newfoundland]] fisheries in the 17th century. In recognition for all the help given to him during his exile in Jersey in the 1640s, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] gave [[George Carteret]], Bailiff and governor, a large grant of land in the American colonies, which he promptly named [[New Jersey]], now part of the [[United States of America]]. [[Edmund Andros]] of Guernsey was an early colonial governor in North America, and head of the short-lived [[Dominion of New England]]. 

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Islands were the only British soil [[Occupation of the Channel Islands|occupied by Germany]] (excepting that part of [[Egypt]] occupied by the [[Afrika Korps]] at the time of the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]]).  The Nazi occupation 1940-1945 was harsh, with some island residents being taken for [[Unfree labour|slave labour]] on the Continent; native [[Jews]] sent to [[concentration camp]]s; [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] resistance and retribution; accusations of [[collaboration]]; and slave labour (primarily [[Russia]]ns and eastern Europeans) being brought to the islands to build [[fortification]]s.  The [[Royal Navy]] [[blockade]]d the islands from time to time, particularly following the [[Battle of Normandy|liberation of mainland Normandy]] in 1944.  Intense negotiations resulted in some [[Red Cross]] humanitarian aid, but there was considerable hunger and privation during the five years of German occupation.

==Politics==
Major articles: [[Politics of Jersey]], [[Politics of Guernsey]]

The Channel Islands fall into two separate self-governing bailiwicks. Both the Bailiwick of [[Guernsey]] and the Bailiwick of [[Jersey]] are [[British Empire|British]] [[Crown dependency|crown dependencies]], but neither is part of the [[United Kingdom]]. They have been part of the [[Duchy of Normandy]] since the [[10th century]] and [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] is often referred to by her traditional and conventional title of [[Duke of Normandy]]. However, pursuant to the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)]] she is not the Duke in a constitutional capacity and instead governs in her right as Queen. This notwithstanding, it is a matter of local pride by monarchists to treat the situation otherwise; the [[Loyal Toast]] at formal dinners is to &quot;The Queen, our Duke&quot; rather than to &quot;Her Majesty, the Queen&quot; as in the UK.

[[Image:States Chamber public entrance Jersey.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the public gallery of the States Chamber in Jersey]]

The Channel Islands are not represented in the [[UK Parliament]] and each Island has its own primary legislature, known as the [[States of Guernsey]] and the [[States of Jersey]], with Chief Pleas in Sark and the States of Alderney. Laws passed by the States are given Royal Sanction by [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|The Queen in Council]], to which the Islands' governments are responsible. 

The systems of government date from [[Normans|Norman]] times, which accounts for the names of the [[legislature|legislatures]], [[the States]], derived from the [[Norman language|Norman]] ''États'' or ''[[Estates of the realm|estates]]'' (i.e. the Crown, the Church, and the people). The States have evolved over the centuries into democratic [[parliament]]s. 

A bailiwick is a territory administered by a bailiff. The [[Bailiff (Channel Islands)|Bailiff]] in each bailiwick is the civil head, presiding officer of the States, and also head of the [[judiciary]].

In [[2001]] responsibility for links between the Channel Islands (together with the [[Isle of Man]]) and the Crown passed from the [[Secretary of State for the Home Department|Home Secretary]] to the [[Lord Chancellor]]'s Department, replaced in [[2003]] by the [[Department of Constitutional Affairs]].

In addition, Acts of the UK Parliament may be extended to any of the Channel Islands by Order-in-Council (thus giving the UK Government the ultimate responsibility for good government in the Islands). By constitutional convention this is only done at the request of the Insular Authorities, and has become a rare option, the Islands usually preferring nowadays to pass localised versions of laws giving effect to international treaties. 

Matters reserved to the Crown (i.e. the United Kingdom government) are limited to defence, citizenship, and diplomatic representation. The Islands are not bound by treaties concluded by the United Kingdom (unless they so request) and may separately conclude treaties with foreign governments (except concerning matters reserved to the Crown). The United Kingdom conceded at the end of the 20th century that the Islands may establish direct political (non-diplomatic) contacts with foreign governments to avoid the situation whereby British Embassies were obliged to pass on communications from the governments of the Bailiwicks that were in conflict with United Kingdom government policy. 

The Islands are not part of the [[European Union]] but are part of the Customs Territory of the [[European Community]] by virtue of Protocol 3 to the [[Treaty on European Union]].

Islanders are full British Citizens, but not all are European Citizens. Any British citizen who applies for a passport in Jersey or Guernsey receives a passport bearing the words '[[British Islands]], Bailiwick of Jersey' or '[[British Islands]], Bailiwick of Guernsey'. Under the provisions of Protocol 3, Channel Islanders who do not have a close connection with the UK  (no parent or grandparent from the UK, and have never been resident in Great Britain or Northern Ireland for any 5 year period) do not automatically benefit from the EU provisions on free movement within the EU and consequently their passports receive an endorsement to that effect. This only affects a minority of Islanders.

Under the Interpretation Act 1978, the Channel Islands are deemed to be part of the [[British Islands]], not to be confused with the [[British Isles]], of which they are also historically considered a part. 

Both Bailiwicks are members of the [[British-Irish Council]], and [[Jèrriais]] and [[Dgèrnésiais]] are recognised [[regional language]]s of the Isles.

The legal courts are separate (separate courts of appeal have been in place since 1961). Among the legal heritage from Norman law is the [[Clameur de haro|Clameur de Haro]].

==Geography==

[[Image:Jethou Herm Sark viewed from Jersey.jpg|thumb|Viewed from Jersey's north coast, Jethou, Herm and Sark are hazy outlines on the horizon]]

The inhabited islands of the Channel Isles are [[Jersey]], [[Guernsey]], [[Alderney]], [[Sark]], [[Herm]] (the main islands); [[Jethou]], [[Brecqhou]] (Brechou), and [[Lihou]]. All of these except Jersey are in the Bailiwick of Guernsey, but the [[Minquiers and Ecréhous]], uninhabited groups of islets, are part of the Bailiwick of Jersey. [[Burhou]] lies off Alderney. As a general rule, the larger islands have the ''-ey'' suffix, and the smaller ones have the ''-hou'' suffix; this is believed to be from the [[Old Norse]] ''ey'' and ''holmr'' respectively.

There is another small island [[Chausey]], south of Jersey - not generally included in the geographical definition of the Channel Islands but occasionally as a 'Channel Island' in English despite its French jurisdiction. It is part of France and is incorporated in the commune of Granville ([[Manche]]), and although popular with visitors from France, it is rarely visited by Channel Islanders as there are no direct transport links from the other islands. 

In official Channel Island French, the Islands are called ''Îles de la Manche'', while in France, the term ''Îles anglo-normandes'' (Anglo-Norman isles) is used to refer to the British ''Channel Islands'' in contrast to other islands in the channel. Chausey is referred to as an ''Île normande'' (as opposed to ''anglo-normande''). ''Îles Normandes'' and ''Archipel Normand'' have also historically been used in Channel Island French to refer to the islands as a whole. 

The very large tidal variation provides an environmentally rich inter-tidal zone around the islands.

==Economy==
Tourism is the major industry in the smaller islands (with some agriculture). Jersey and Guernsey have, since the [[1960s]], relied on financial a of Chinese as a language family may suggest that China consists of several different nations, challenge the notion of a single [[Han Chinese]] &quot;[[race]]&quot;, and legitimize secessionist movements. Furthermore, for some, suggesting that Chinese is more correctly described as multiple languages implies that the notion of a single Chinese language and a single Chinese state or nationality is artificial.

However, the links between ethnicity, politics, and language can be complex. Many Wu, Min, Hakka, and Cantonese speakers consider their own varieties as separate spoken languages, but the [[Han Chinese]] race as one entity.  They do not regard these two positions as contradictory, but consider the Han Chinese an entity of great internal diversity.  Moreover, the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] officially states that China is a [[Nationalities of China|multinational state]], and that the term &quot;Chinese&quot; refers to a broader concept ''[[Zhonghua Minzu]]'' that incorporates groups that do not natively speak Chinese, such as [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]], [[Uyghur]]s, and [[Mongols]]. (Groups that do speak Chinese are properly called [[Han Chinese]], and are regarded as one component of a multiethnic whole.) Similarly, on Taiwan, some supporters of [[Chinese reunification]] promote the local language, while some supporters of Taiwan independence have little interest in the topic.  And the Taiwanese identity incorporates [[Taiwanese aborigines]], who are not considered Han Chinese because they speak [[Austronesian languages]], predate Han Chinese settlement, and are culturally and genetically linked to other Austronesian-speaking peoples such as [[Polynesia]]ns.

==Written Chinese==

&lt;!--This is a SUMMARY. Please add new information to [[Chinese written language]].--&gt;

The relationship among the Chinese spoken and written languages is complex.  It is compounded by the fact that spoken variations evolved for centuries, since at least the late [[Han Dynasty]], while written Chinese changed much less.

Until the 20th century, most formal Chinese writing was done in ''wényán'' (文言), translated as [[Classical Chinese]] or Literary Chinese, which was very different from any spoken variety of Chinese, much as [[Classical Latin]] differs from modern [[Romance language]]s.  Since the [[May Fourth Movement]] of [[1919]], the formal standard for written Chinese was changed to ''báihuà'' (白話/白话), or [[Vernacular Chinese]], which, while not completely identical to the grammar and vocabulary of dialects of Mandarin, was based mostly on them.  The term ''standard written Chinese'' now refers to Vernacular Chinese.

Chinese characters are [[morpheme]]s independent of phonetic change. Thus, although the number one is &quot;yi&quot; in [[Mandarin (linguistics)|Mandarin]], &quot;yat&quot; in [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]] and &quot;tsit&quot; in [[Min-nan|Hokkien]], they derive from a common ancient Chinese word and still share an identical character (&quot;一&quot;). Nevertheless, the orthographies of Chinese dialects are not completely identical. The vocabularies of different dialects have diverged. In addition, while literary vocabulary is &lt;!-- often [huh?] --&gt; mostly used by all dialects, colloquial vocabularies are often different. Colloquial non-standard written Chinese usually involves &quot;dialectal characters&quot; which may not be understood in other dialects or characters that are considered archaic in standard written Chinese.

Cantonese is unique among non-Mandarin [[regional language]]s in having a written colloquial standard, used in Hong Kong and by non-[[Standard Mandarin]] speaking Cantonese speakers overseas, with a large number of unofficial characters for words particular to this variety of Chinese. By contrast, the other regional languages do not have such widely-used alternative written standards. Written colloquial Cantonese has become quite popular in online [[chat room]]s and [[instant messaging]], although for formal written communications Cantonese speakers still normally use standard written Chinese.

Also, in Hunan, some women wrote their local language in [[Nü Shu]], a [[syllabary]] derived from [[Chinese character]]s.  The [[Dungan language]], considered a dialect of Mandarin, is also nowadays written in [[Cyrillic]], and was formerly written in the [[Arabic alphabet]], although the [[Dungan]] people live outside [[China]].

=== Chinese characters ===
{{main|Chinese character}}
&lt;!--This is a SUMMARY. Please add new information to [[Chinese character]].--&gt;

The Chinese written language employs [[Chinese character]]s (漢字/汉字 [[pinyin]]: ''hànzì''), which are [[logogram]]s: each symbol represents a [[semanteme]] (a meaningful unit of language). 

They are not just [[pictograph]]s (pictures of their meanings), but are highly stylized and carry much abstract meaning.  Only some characters are derived from pictographs.  &lt;!-- (1%, according to [[picogram]].) --&gt; In [[100]] AD, the famed scholar [[Xushen]] in the [[Han Dynasty]] classified characters into 6 categories, only 4% as pictographs, and 82% as phonetic complexes consisting of a ''radical'' element that indicates meaning, and a ''phonetic'' element that arguably once indicated the pronunciation.

All modern characters derive from [[Kaishu]].  There are currently two standards for Chinese characters.  One is the [[Traditional Chinese character|traditional system]], essentially a streamlined styling of Kaishu, still used in [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Macau]].  The other is the [[Simplified Chinese character|simplified system]] adopted during the [[1950s]] [[Chinese Cultural Revolution]] in [[Mainland China]].  The simplified system requires fewer strokes to write certain radicals and has fewer synonymous characters. [[Singapore]], which has a large Chinese community, is the first and only foreign country to recognize and officially adopt the simplified characters. 

[[Image:shodo.jpg|thumb|250px|Various styles of Chinese calligraphy.]]
Various written styles are used in [[Chinese calligraphy]], including [[seal script|zhuanshu]] (篆書, &quot;seal-script&quot;), [[caoshu]] (草書, &quot;grass script&quot; or &quot;haste script&quot;), [[lishu]] (隸書, &quot;official script&quot;) and [[kaishu]] (楷書, &quot;standard script&quot;). Calligraphers can write in traditional and simplified characters, but they tend to use traditional characters for traditional art.

As with [[Roman alphabet|Latin script]], a wide variety of [[typeface|fonts]] exist for printed Chinese characters, a great number of which are often based on the styles of single calligraphers or schools of calligraphy.

There is no concrete record of the origin of Chinese characters. Legend suggests that [[Cangjie]], a bureaucrat of the legendary emperor [[Huangdi]] of China about [[2600 BC]], invented Chinese characters.  But archaeological evidence, mainly the oracles found in the [[19th century|19]]-[[20th centuries]], only dates Chinese characters to the [[Shang dynasty]] in [[1700 BC]].

The vast majority of oracle bone inscriptions were found in [[Yinxu]] of the Shang Dynasty, although a few [[Zhou dynasty]]-related ones were also found. The forms of the characters in the inscriptions changed over the 200 to 300 years, and scholars date the inscriptions of the Shang to the ruler by the content, particularly from the name of the diviners who inscribed the shell or bone artifacts.

Contemporaneous with the end of Shang and Western Zhou periods are the [[bronzeware script|bronze inscriptions]]. Over the last century, a great many ancient bronze artifacts have been unearthed in China which contain dedicational texts of the Zhou aristocrats where the characters show similarities and innovations compared to the oracle inscriptions.

It is said that during the reign of Zhou King Xuan (宣王 [[820s BC|827]]-[[780s BC|782 BCE]]), the form of written characters was revised, and these became refered to as the &quot;[[greater seal script]]&quot; or ''dazhuan''.

==History==
Most linguists classify all of the variations of Chinese as part of the Sino-Tibetan [[language family]] and believe that there was an original language, called [[Proto-Sino-Tibetan]], analogous to [[Indo-European languages|Proto-Indo-European]], from which the Sinitic and Tibeto-Burman languages descended. The relations between Chinese and  other Sino-Tibetan languages are an area of active research, as is the attempt to reconstruct Proto-Sino-Tibetan. The main difficulty in this effort is that, while there is very good documentation that allows us to reconstruct the ancient sounds of Chinese, there is no written documentation of the division between proto-Sino-Tibetan and Chinese.  In addition, many of the languages that would allow us to reconstruct Proto-Sino-Tibetan are very poorly documented or understood.

Categorization of the development of Chinese is a subject of scholarly debate. One of the first systems was devised by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] linguist [[Bernhard Karlgren]] in the early [[1900s]]. The system was much revised, but always heavily relying on Karlgren's insights and methods.

[[Old Chinese]] ({{zh-tsps|t=上古漢語|s=上古汉语|p=Shànggǔ Hànyǔ}}), sometimes known as 'Archaic Chinese', was the language common during the early and middle [[Zhou Dynasty (1122 BC - 256 BC)|Zhou Dynasty]] ([[1122 BC]] - [[256 BC]]), texts of which include inscriptions on bronze artifacts, the poetry of the ''[[Shijing]]'', the history of the ''[[Shujing]]'', and portions of the ''[[Yijing]]'' (''I Ching''). The phonetic elements found in the majority of Chinese characters also provide hints to their Old Chinese pronunciations. The pronunciation of the borrowed Chinese characters in Japanese, Vietnamese and Korean also provide valuable insights. Old Chinese was not wholly uninflected. It possessed a rich sound system in which aspiration or rough breathing differentiated the consonants, but probably was still without tones. Work on reconstructing Old Chinese started with [[Qing dynasty]] philologists.

[[Middle Chinese]] ({{zh-tsps|s=中古汉语|t=中古漢語|p=Zhōnggǔ Hànyǔ}}) was the language used during the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]], [[Tang dynasty|Tang]], and [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties ([[7th century|7th]] through [[10th century|10th]] centuries AD).  It can be divided into an early period, reflected by the 切韻 '[[Qieyun]]' [[rime book|rhyme table]] ([[601]] AD), and a late period in the 10th century, reflected by the 廣韻 '[[Guangyun]]' [[rime book|rhyme table]]. Linguists are confident of having reconstructed how Middle Chinese sounded. The evidence for the pronunciation of Middle Chinese comes from several sources: modern dialect variations, rhyming dictionaries, foreign transliterations, &quot;rhyming tables&quot; constructed by ancient Chinese philologists to summarize the phonetic system, and Chinese phonetic translations of foreign words. However, all reconstructions are tentative; for example, scholars have shown that trying to reconstruct modern Cantonese from the rhymes of modern [[Cantopop]] would give a very inaccurate picture of the language.

The development of the spoken Chinese languages from early historical times to the present has been complex. Most northern Chinese people, in [[Sichuan]] and in a broad arc from the northeast (Manchuria) to the southwest (Yunnan), use various Mandarin dialects as their [[home language]]. The prevalence of Mandarin throughout northern China is largely due to north China's plains. By contrast, the mountains and rivers of southern China promoted linguistic diversity.  The presence of Mandarin in Sichuan is largely due to a plague in the [[12th century]]. This plague, which may have been related to the [[Black Death]], depopulated the area, leading to later settlement from north China.

Until the mid-[[20th century]], most southern Chinese did not speak any Mandarin. However, despite the mix of officials and commoners speaking various Chinese dialects, Nanjing Mandarin became dominant at least during &lt;!-- i.e., circa? --&gt; the officially [[Manchu]]-speaking [[Qing Empire]]. Since the [[17th century]], the Empire had set up [[orthoepy]] academies ({{zh-tsps|t=正音書院|s=正音书院|p=Zhèngyīn Shūyuàn}}) to make pronunciation conform to the Qing capital Beijing's standard, but had little success.  During the Qing's last 50 years in the late 19th century, the Beijing Mandarin finally replaced Nanjing Mandarin in the imperial court.  For the general population, although variations of Mandarin were already widely spoken in China then, a single standard of Mandarin did not exist. The non-Mandarin speakers in southern China also continued to use their regionalects for every aspect of life.  The new Beijing Mandarin court standard was thus fairly limited. 

This situation changed with the creation (in both the PRC and the ROC) of an elementary school education system committed to teaching Mandarin. As a result, Mandarin is now spoken fluently by a majority of people in [[mainland China]] and on [[Taiwan]]. In [[Hong Kong]], the language of education and formal speech remains [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]], but Mandarin is becoming increasingly influential.

==Influence on other languages==
Throughout history [[Chinese culture]] and [[political history of China|politics]] has had a great influence on unrelated languages such as [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. Korean and Japanese both have writing systems employing [[Chinese character]]s (Hanzi), which are called [[Hanja]] and [[Kanji]], respectively. 

The Vietnamese term for Chinese writing is [[Han Tu]].  It was the only available method for writing Vietnamese until the [[14th century]], used almost exclusively by Chinese-educated Vietnamese elites. From the 14th to the late 19th century, Vietnamese was written with [[Chu Nom]], a modified Chinese script incorporating sounds and syllables for native Vietnamese speakers. This is now completely replaced by a modified Latin script that incorporates a system of diacritical marks to indicate tones, as well as modified consonants. The Vietnamese language exhibits multiple elements similar to Cantonese in regard to the specific intonations and sharp consonant endings.  There is also a slight influence from Mandarin, including the sharper vowels and &quot;kh&quot; sound missing from other Asiatic languages.

In [[South Korea]], the [[Hangul]] alphabet is generally used, but [[Hanja]] is used as a sort of boldface. (In [[North Korea]], [[Hanja]] has been discontinued.) Since the modernization of Japan in the late 19th century, there has been debate about abandoning the use of Chinese characters, but the practical benefits of a radically new script have so far not been considered sufficient.

Languages within the influence of Chinese culture also have a very large number of [[loanword]]s from Chinese. 50% or more of Korean vocabulary is of Chinese origin and the influence on Japanese and Vietnamese has been considerable. 10% of Philippine language vocabularies are of Chinese origin. Chinese also shares a great many grammatical features with these and neighboring languages, notably the lack of [[grammatical gender|gender]] and the use of [[classifier (linguistics)|classifier]]s. The Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese languages seem to retain sounds of Classical Chinese that are otherwise only found in southern China.

==Phonology==
{{IPA notice}}
:''For more specific information on phonology of Chinese see the respective main articles of each [[Chinese spoken language|spoken variety]].'' &lt;!--I think this is about as specific we can get without making a looong and dull list of links--&gt;

The [[phonology|phonological]] structure of each syllable consists of a [[syllable nucleus|nucleus]] consisting of a [[vowel]] (which can be a [[monophthong]], [[diphthong]], or even a [[triphthong]] in certain varieties) with an optional [[syllable onset|onset]] or [[syllable coda|coda]] [[consonant]] as well as a [[tone (linguistics)|tone]].  There are some instances where a vowel is not used as a nucleus.  An example of this is in [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]], where the [[nasal consonant|nasal]] [[sonorant]] consonants {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/&amp;#331;/}} can stand alone as their own syllable.

Across all the spoken varieties, most syllables tend to be open syllables, meaning they have no coda, but syllables that do have codas are restricted to [[bilabial nasal|{{IPA|/m/}}]], [[alveolar nasal|{{IPA|/n/}}]], [[velar nasal|{{IPA|/ŋ/}}]], [[voiceless bilabial plosive|{{IPA|/p/}}]], [[voiceless alveolar plosive|{{IPA|/t/}}]], [[voiceless velar plosive|{{IPA|/k/}}]], or [[glottal stop|{{IPA|/ʔ/}}]].  Some varieties allow most of these codas, whereas others, such as [[Mandarin (linguistics)|Mandarin]], are limited to only two, namely {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/&amp;#331;/}}.  [[Consonant cluster]]s do not generally occur in either the onset or coda.  The onset may be an [[affricate consonant|affricate]] or a consonant followed by a [[semivowel]], but these are not generally considered consonant clusters.

The number of sounds in the different spoken dialects varies, but in general there has been a tendency to a reduction in sounds from [[Middle Chinese]]. The Mandarin dialects in particular have experienced a dramatic decrease in sounds and so have far more multisyllabic words than most other spoken varieties. The total number of syllables in some varieties is therefore only about a thousand, including tonal variation.

All varieties of spoken Chinese use [[tone (linguistics)|tones]]. A few dialects of north China may have as few as three tones, while some dialects in south China have up to 6 or 10 tones, depending on how one counts. One exception from this is [[Shanghainese]] which has reduced the set of tones to a two-toned [[pitch accent]] system much like modern Japanese.

A very common example used to illustrate the use of tones in Chinese are the five tones of [[Standard Mandarin]] applied to the syllable &quot;ma&quot;. The tones correspond to these five [[Chinese character|characters]]:
{{Ruby notice}}
*{{Ruby|媽/妈|mā}} &quot;mother&quot; — '''high level'''
*{{Ruby|麻|má}} &quot;hemp&quot; — '''high rising'''
*{{Ruby|馬/马|mǎ}} &quot;horse&quot; — '''low falling-rising'''
*{{Ruby|罵/骂|mà}} &quot;scold&quot; — '''high falling'''
*{{Ruby|嗎/吗|ma}} question particle — '''neutral'''

{{Listen|filename=zh-pinyin_tones_with_ma.ogg|title=Listen to the tones|description=This is a recording of the four main tones.  Fifth, or neutral, tone is not included.}}.

==Romanization==
[[Romanization]] is the process of transcribing a language in the Latin alphabet. There are many systems of romanization for the Chinese languages; this is due to the complex history of interaction between China and the West, and to the Chinese languages' lack of phonetic transcription until modern times. Chinese is first known to have been written in Latin characters by Western [[Christianity in China|Christian missionaries]] of the [[16th century]], but may have been written down by Western travelers or missionaries of earlier periods. 

At present, the most common romanization system for Standard Mandarin is [[Hanyu Pinyin]], also known simply as Pinyin. Pinyin is the official Mandarin romanization system for the People's Republic of China, and the official one used in [[Singapore]] (see also [[Chinese language romanisation in Singapore]]). Pinyin is also very commonly used when teaching Mandarin in schools and universities of North America and Europe. 

Perhaps the second-most common system of romanization for Mandarin is [[Wade-Giles]]. This system was probably the most common system of romanization for Mandarin before Hanyu Pinyin was developed. Wade-Giles is often found in academic use in the U.S., and until recently was widely used in Taiwan (Taipei city now officially uses Hanyu Pinyin and the rest of the island officially uses Tōngyòng Pinyin).

Here are a few examples of Hanyu Pinyin and Wade-Giles, for comparison:

|}

Regardless of system, tone transcription is often left out, either due to difficulties of typesetting or propriety for audience. Wade-Giles' extensive use of easily-forgotten apostrophes adds to the confusion. Thus, most Western readers will be much more familiar with Beijing than they will be with Běijīng, and with Taipei than with T'ai²-pei³.  

Regardless of romanization, the words are pronounced the same. Learning a system of romanization requires occasional deviations from the learner's own language, so, for example, Hanyu Pinyin uses &quot;q&quot; for very different values than an English speaker would probably be used to; the sound represented is similar to the English &quot;ch&quot;, but pronounced further forward (an aspirated alveolo-palatal fricative, /tɕʰ/). This is a cause of confusion but is unavoidable, as Mandarin (and any language transcribed) will have phonemes different from those of the learner's own.  On the other hand, this can be beneficial, since learners can immediately be made aware of the fact that they  will have to learn a new pronunciation.  With languages that use similar [[orthography]], the temptation to pronounce words just as in one's mother tongue can lead to great misunderstanding.

There are many other systems of romanization for Mandarin, as well as systems for Cantonese, Minnan, Hakka, and other Chinese languages.

==Other Transcriptions==
Chinese languages have been phonetically transcribed into many other writing systems over the centuries. The [[phagsba]] script, for example, has been very helpful in reconstructing the pronunciation of pre-modern forms of Chinese.

[[Zhuyin]] is still widely used in Taiwan's elementary schools.  A comparison table of [[Zhuyin]] to [[Pinyin]] exists in the [[Zhuyin]] page.  Syllables based on [[Pinyin]] and [[Zhuyin]] can also be compared by looking at the following pages:
*[[Pinyin table]]
*[[Zhuyin table]]

There are also at least two systems of [[cyrillization]] for Chinese. The most widespread is the [[Cyrillization of Chinese from Pinyin|Palladius system]].

==Morphology==
Chinese [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] is strictly bound to a set number of [[syllable]]s with a fairly rigid construction which are the [[morpheme]]s, the smallest building blocks, of the language.  Some of these single-syllable morphemes can stand alone as individual [[word (linguistics)|word]]s, but contrary to what is often claimed, Chinese is not a monosyllabic language.  Most words in the modern Chinese spoken varieties are in fact multisyllabic, consisting of more than one morpheme, usually two, but there can be three or more.

The confusion arises in how one thinks about the language.  In the Chinese writing system, each individual single-syllable morpheme corresponds to a single character, referred to as a ''zì'' (字).  Most Chinese speakers think of words as being ''zì'', but this view is not entirely accurate.  Many words are multisyllabic, and are composed of more than one ''zì''.  This composition is what is known as a ''cí'' (詞), and more closely resembles the traditional Western definition of a word.  However, the concept of ''cí'' was historically a technical linguistic term that until only the past century, the average Chinese speaker was not aware of.  Even today, most Chinese speakers think of words as being ''zì''.  This can be illustrated in the following Mandarin Chinese sentence ([[romanization|romanized]] using [[pinyin]]):
:''Jīguāng, zhè liǎngge zì shì shénme yìsi?''
:激光, 這兩個字是甚麼意思?
:激光, 这两个字是什么意思?

The sentence literally translates to, &quot;''Jī'' 激 and ''guāng'' 光, these two ''zì'' 字, what do they mean?&quot;  However, the more natural English translation would probably be, &quot;''Laser'', this word, what does it mean?&quot;  Even though ''jīguāng'' 激光 is a single word, speakers tend to think of its constituents as being separate (Ramsey, 1987).

Old Chinese and Middle Chinese had many more monosyllabic words due to greater variability in possible sounds.  The modern Chinese varieties lost many of these sound distinctions, leading to [[homonym]]s in words that were once distinct.  Multisyllabic words arose in order to compensate for this loss.  Most natively derived multisyllabic words still feature these original monosyllabic morpheme roots.  Many Chinese morphemes still have associated meaning, even though many of them no longer can stand alone as individual words.  This situation is analogous to the use of the English [[prefix]] ''pre-''.  Even though ''pre-'' can never stand alone by itself as an individual word, it is commonly understood by English speakers to mean &quot;before,&quot; such as in the words ''predawn'', ''previous'', and ''premonition''.

Taking the previous example, ''jīguāng'', ''jī'' and ''guāng'' literally mean &quot;stimulated light,&quot; resulting in the meaning, &quot;laser.&quot;  However, ''jī'' is never found as a single word by itself, because there are too many other morphemes that are also pronounced in the same way. For instance, the morphemes that correspond to the meanings &quot;chicken&quot; 雞/鸡, &quot;machine&quot; 機/机, &quot;basic&quot; 基, &quot;hit&quot; 擊/击, &quot;hunger&quot; 饑/饥, and &quot;sum&quot; 積/积 are also pronounced ''jī'' in Mandarin.  It is only in the context of other morphemes that an exact meaning of a ''zì'' can be known.  In certain ways, the [[logographic]] writing system helps to reinforce meaning in ''zì'' that are homophonous, since even though several morphemes may be pronounced the same way, they are written using different characters.  Continuing with the example, we have:

|&lt;font color=blue&gt;machine&lt;/font&gt; gun
|}

For this reason, it is very common for Mandarin speakers to put characters in context as a natural part of conversation. For example, when telling each other their names (which are often rare, or at least non-colloquial, combinations of zì), Mandarin speakers often state which words their names are found in. As a specific example, a speakers might say 名字叫嘉英，嘉陵江的嘉，英國的英 Míngzi jiào Jiāyīng, Jiālíngjiāng de jiā, Yīngguó de yīng &quot;My name is Jiāyīng, the ''Jia'' of ''Jialing River'' and the ''Ying'' in ''England''.&quot;  

The problem of homonyms also exists but is less severe in southern Chinese varieties like Cantonese and Taiwanese, which preserved more of the [[syllable rime|rimes]] of Middle Chinese.  For instance, the previous examples of ''jī'' for &quot;stimulated,&quot; &quot;chicken,&quot; and &quot;machine&quot; have distinct pronunciations in Cantonese (romanized using [[jyutping]]): ''gik1'', ''gai1'', and ''gei1'', respectively.  For this reason, southern varieties tend to employ fewer multisyllabic words.

There are a few morphemes in Chinese, many of them loanwords, that consist of more than one syllable. These words cannot be further divided into single-syllable meaningful units, however in writing each syllable is still written as separate ''zì''.  One example is the word for &quot;spider,&quot; ''zhīzhū'', which is written as 蜘蛛.  Even in this case, Chinese tend to try to make some kind of meaning out of the constituent syllables.  For this reason, the two characters 蜘 and 蛛 each have an associated meaning of &quot;spider&quot; when seen alone as individual characters.  When spoken though, they can never occur apart.

===Loanwords===
Most Chinese words are formed out of native Chinese morphemes, including words describing imported objects and ideas. However, direct phonetic borrowing of foreign words has gone on since ancient times. Words borrowed from along the [[Silk Road]] in ancient times include 葡萄 &quot;grape&quot;, 石榴 &quot;pomegranate&quot; and 獅子 &quot;lion&quot;. Some words were borrowed from [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] scriptures, including 佛 &quot;Buddha&quot; and 菩薩 &quot;bodhisattva&quot;. Other words came from nomadic peoples to the north, such as 哥哥 &quot;older brother&quot; and 胡同 &quot;[[hutong]]&quot;.

Foreign words continue to enter the Chinese language by transcription according to their pronunciations. This is done by employing Chinese characters with similar pronunciations; characters in this case are usually taken strictly for their phonetic values. For example, &quot;Israel&quot; becomes 以色列 (pinyin: yǐsèliè). The Chinese characters used here literally mean &quot;using-colour-rank&quot;, or &quot;ranking using colour&quot;, but the sense is automatically ignored because it is understood that the characters are used for their phonetic values only. Characters which are used nearly exclusively in the transcription of foreign words are present in Chinese; many of these characters date back to Middle Chinese when they were used to translate [[Sanskrit]] [[phoneme]]s. For example, 斯 ''sī'' and 爾 ''ěr'', which are [[Classical Chinese]] words for &quot;this&quot; and &quot;you&quot;, are never used in their original senses (except in a limited number of idiomatic expressions) and more often used to transcribe the sounds /s/ and /l/ in foreign words. Nevertheless, this method tends to yield somewhat strange results, and is therefore overwhelmingly used to transcribe foreign names only. A rather small number of direct phonetic borrowings have survived as common words, including 沙發 ''shāfā'' &quot;sofa&quot;, 馬達 ''mǎdá'' &quot;motor&quot;, 幽默 ''yōumò'' &quot;humour&quot;, 邏輯 ''luójí'' &quot;logic&quot;, 時髦 ''shímáo'' &quot;smart, fashionable&quot;, 麥克風 ''màikèfēng'' &quot;microphone&quot;, and 歇斯底里 ''xiēsīdǐlǐ'' &quot;hysterics&quot;.  The bulk of these words were originally coined in the [[Shanghainese]] dialect during the early 20th century and were later loaned into Mandarin, hence their pronunciations in Mandarin are quite off from the English. For example, 沙發 and 馬達 in Shanghainese actually sound like English &quot;sofa&quot; and &quot;motor&quot;. 

Today, it is much more common to use existing Chinese morphemes to coin new words in order to represent imported concepts, such as technical expressions. Any [[Latin]] or [[Greek language|Greek]] etymologies are dropped, making them more comprehensible for Chinese but introducing more difficulties in understanding foreign texts. For example, the word ''telephone'' was loaned phonetically as 德律風 ([[Shanghainese]]: ''télífon'' [{{IPA|təlɪfoŋ}}], [[Standard Mandarin]]: ''délǜfēng'') during the [[1920s]] and widely used in Shanghai, but later the Japanese 電話 (''diànhuà'' &quot;electric speech&quot;), built out of native Chinese morphemes, became prevalent. Other examples include 電視 (''diànshì'' &quot;electric vision&quot;) for television, 電腦 (''diànnǎo'' &quot;electric brain&quot;) for computer; 手機 (''shǒujī'' &quot;hand machine&quot;) for cellphone, and 藍牙 (''lányá'' &quot;blue tooth&quot;) for [[Bluetooth]]. Occasionally half-transliteration, half-translation compromises are accepted, such as 漢堡包 (''hànbǎo bāo'', &quot;''Hamburg'' bun&quot;) for ''hamburger''. Sometimes translations are designed so that they sound like the original while incorporating Chinese morphemes, such as 拖拉機 (''tuōlājī'', &quot;tractor&quot;). This is often done for commercial purposes, for example 奔騰 (''bēnténg'' &quot;running leaping&quot;) for [[Pentium]] and 賽百味 (''sàibǎiwèi'' &quot;better-than hundred tastes&quot;) for [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway restaurants]].

Another important source came from a related writing system, [[kanji]], which are Chinese characters used in the [[Japanese language]]. The Japanese used kanji to translate many European words in the late [[19th century]] and early [[20th century]]. These words are called ''[[wasei-kango]]'' in Japanese (和製漢語 literally ''Japanese-made Chinese''), and many of these Japanese words were then loaned into Mandarin Chinese. Examples include ''diànhuà'' (電話, denwa &quot;telephone&quot;), ''shèhùi'' (社会, Shakai &quot;society&quot;), ''kēxué'' (科學, kagaku, &quot;science&quot;), ''zhéxué'' (哲學, tetsugaku &quot;philosophy&quot;), ''chōuxiàng'' (抽象, Choushou, &quot;abstract&quot;), ''zhǔyì'' (主義, shugi, &quot;-ism&quot; or &quot;ideology&quot;) and ''làngmàn'' (浪漫、romansu、&quot;romance&quot;). Other terms were coined by the Japanese by giving new senses to existing Chinese terms or by referring to expressions used in classical Chinese literature, these include ''jīngjì'' (經濟, keizai) which in the original Chinese meant &quot;the workings of the state&quot; but in Japanese was narrowed to &quot;economy,&quot; this narrowed definition was then reimported into Chinese. As a result, these terms are virtually indistinguishable from native Chinese words: indeed, there is dispute over some of these terms as to whether the Japanese or Chinese coined them first. As a result of this to-and-fro process, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese continue to share many terms describing modern terminology, in parallel to a similar corpus of terms built from Greco-Latin terms shared among European languages.

==Grammar==
{{main|Chinese grammar}}

In general, all spoken varieties of Chinese are [[isolating language]]s, in that they depend on [[syntax]] (word order and sentence structure) rather than [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (changes in the form of the word through [[inflection]]). Because they are isolating languages, they make heavy use of [[grammatical particle]]s to indicate [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[grammatical mood|mood]].

Chinese features [[Subject Verb Object]] [[word order]], and like many other languages in East Asia, makes frequent use of the [[topic-comment]] construction to form sentences. Even though Chinese has no [[grammatical gender]], it has an extensive system of [[measure word]]s, another trait shared with neighbouring (but not related) languages like [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]]. See '''[[Chinese measure words]]''' for an extensive coverage of this subject.

Other notable grammatical features common to all the spoken varieties of Chinese include the use of [[serial verb construction]], [[pro-drop language|pronoun dropping]] (and the related [[null subject language|subject dropping]]), and the use of aspect rather than [[grammatical tense|tense]].

Although the grammars of the spoken varieties share many traits, they do possess various differences.  See '''[[Chinese grammar]]''' for the grammar of [[Standard Mandarin]] (the standardized Chinese spoken language), and the articles on other varieties of Chinese for their respective grammars.

The second part denotes the unit of measurement, such as yuán ([[Wiktionary:元|元]] for dollar) or máo ([[Wiktionary:毫|毫]] or [[Wiktionary:毛|毛]] for 10 cents) or xiān ([[Wiktionary:仙|仙]] for 1 cent) or lǐ ([[Wiktionary:里|里]] for the Chinese mile) or any other measurement unit. 
If the characters ''shí yuán'' ([[Wiktionary:拾|拾]][[Wiktionary:元|元]], &quot;10 dollars&quot;) are below the digits 〤〇〢二, it is then read as forty dollars and twenty two cents.
Notice that the decimal point is implicit when the first digit '4' is set at the 'ten' position.
This is very similar to the modern [[scientific notation]] for [[floating point]] numbers where the significant digits are represented in the mantissa and the order of magnitude is specified in the exponent.

When written vertically, the above example is written thus:

{|
|align=center| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ||align=center| 〤&lt;br&gt;〇&lt;br&gt;〢&lt;br&gt;二&lt;br&gt;拾&lt;br&gt;元
|}

The digits of the Suzhou numerals are defined between U+3021 and U+3029 in [[Unicode]]. 

Zero is represented by a circle, probably the numeral '0', letter 'O' or character [[Wiktionary:〇|〇]] may work well.
Leading and trailing zeros are unnecessary in this system.
Additional characters representing 10, 20, 30 and 40 exist: [[Wiktionary:十|十]], [[Wiktionary:卄|卄]], [[Wiktionary:卅|卅]], [[Wiktionary:卌|卌]].

For those who cannot see the Unicode glyphs in the web browser, here are the descriptions of the appearance of these digits:
* 0 is a circle ([[Wiktionary:〇|〇]])
* 1 is one horizontal ([[Wiktionary:一|一]]) or vertical ([[Wiktionary:〡|〡]]) stroke 
* 2 is two horizontal ([[Wiktionary:二|二]]) or vertical ([[Wiktionary:〢|〢]]) strokes 
* 3 is three horizontal ([[Wiktionary:三|三]]) or vertical ([[Wiktionary:〣|〣]]) strokes 
* 4 is a cross that looks like X ([[Wiktionary:〤|〤]])
* 5 is a loop ([[Wiktionary:〥|〥]])
* 6 is a dot (which signifies 5 the same way as on an abacus) on top of one horizontal stroke ([[Wiktionary:〦|〦]])
* 7 is a dot on top of two horizontal strokes ([[Wiktionary:〧|〧]])
* 8 is a dot on top of three horizontal strokes ([[Wiktionary:〨|〨]])
* 9 is a dot on top of a variant of the 〤 (4) symbol ([[Wiktionary:〩|〩]]); this symbol looks like the Chinese character for &quot;jiǔ ([[Wiktionary:久|久]])&quot;, compare to the formal character '9' &quot;jiǔ ([[Wiktionary:玖|玖]])&quot;. (''Some web browsers, e.g. IE 5.5, display this character incorrectly as the &quot;fǎn wén&quot;, or reverse &quot;wén&quot; radical (夂 &amp; 攵 &amp; 夊 &amp; 文), click [http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetUnihanData.pl?codepoint=3029 here] to see the correct graphic glyph.'')

The digits 1 to 3 come in the vertical and horizontal version so that they can alternate if these digits are next to each other. 
The first digit usually use the vertical version. 
e.g. 21 is written as ||— instead of || | which can be confused with 3.

==Hand gestures==
''Main article at: [[Chinese number gestures]].''

There is a common method of using of one hand to signify the numbers one to ten. While the five digits on one hand can express the numbers one to five, six to ten have special signs that can be used in commerce or day-to-day communication.

==Miscellaneous==

During [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties (when [[Arabic numerals]] were first introduced into China), some Chinese mathematicians used Chinese numeral characters as positional system digits.  After Qing dynasty, both the Chinese numeral characters and the Suzhou numerals were replaced by [[Arabic numerals]] in mathematical writings.

Traditional Chinese numeric characters are also used in [[Japan]]. In vertical text (that is, read top to bottom), using characters for numbers is the norm, while in horizontal text, Arabic numerals are most common. Chinese numeric characters are also used in much the same formal or decorative fashion that Roman numerals are in Western cultures. Chinese numerals may appear together with Arabic numbers on the same sign or document.

      <comment>/* Programs vs. data */ fixed link (prev went to speech impediment)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The terms '''computer program''', '''software program''', ''[[application software|applications program]]'', ''[[system software]]'', or just '''program''' are used to refer to either an [[executable]] program (by both lay people and [[computer programmer]]s) or the collection of [[source code]] from which an executable program is created (eg, [[compiled]]).

==Terminology==

[[Software]] programs (collections of programs and related resources) are most frequently referred to as [[Application software|applications]] by end-users, as these people are focused on the abilities of application software (application programs) rather than [[system software]].

In general discussion among [[computer programmer]]s the context is invariably sufficient to distinguish which of the two possible meanings of the term are intended. &lt;!-- which out of a choice of one? --&gt;

Note: The [[United Kingdom|British English]] spelling ''programme'' is, for the most part, no longer used to refer to ''computer programs'', as most internationally-used computing terms use the words (and spelling conventions) adopted in the [[U.S.]].

==Program execution==
A modern day computer program is loaded into memory (usually by the [[operating system]]), interpreted and then executed (&quot;run&quot;) instruction by instruction until &quot;program [[Termination|termination]]&quot;, either with success or through software or hardware error.  Some primitive types of computers ran instructions encoded in various ways, an example would be [[Punch card|punch cards]].

Before a computer can execute any sort of program (including the operating system which is also a program) the [[Computer hardware|computer hardware]] must be initialized. This is done by a piece of software stored on [[Programmable read-only memory|programmable memory]] chips installed by the manufacturer called the [[BIOS]]. The BIOS will attempt to initialize the [[boot sequence]] making the computer ready for miscellaneous program execution.

==Programs vs. data==

The [[source code]] of a program is often treated as being different from the [[data]] it operates on.  In some cases this distinction is blured with programs creating, or modifying data, which is subsequently executed as part of the same program (this is a common occurrence for programs written in [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]]).  [[Neural network]]s are another example where this distiction between code and data is not clear cut.

==Programming==

A program is likely to contain a variety of different [[algorithm]]s.

Creating a computer program is the iterative process of writing new [[source code]] or modifying existing source code, followed by testing, analyzing and refining this code.  A person who practices this skill is referred to as a computer [[programmer]] or software developer. The sometimes lengthy process of computer programming is now referred to as &quot;software development&quot; or [[software engineering]]. The latter becoming more popular due to the increasing maturity of the discipline. (see [[Software engineering#Debate over who is a software engineer|Debate over who is a software engineer]])

Two other forms of modern day approaches are [[team programming]] where each member of the group has equal say in the development process except for one person who guides the group through discrepancies. These groups tend to be around 10 people to keep the group manageable. The second form is referred to as &quot;peer programming&quot; or [[pair programming]].

See [[Software engineering#Process and methodology|Process and methodology]] for the different aspects of modern day computer programming.

{{OtherUses|the act of Crime}}
A '''crime''' in a nontechnical sense is an act that violates a [[politics|political]] or [[morality|moral]] rule. But in many [[nation]]s, the [[government]]s have discovered that informal sanctions are ineffective to control some types of antisocial behaviour, so the system of [[social control]] has to be formalised. [[Law]]s are designed to regulate human behaviour and the [[state (law)|state]] provides [[remedy|remedies]] and [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]] to protect its [[citizen]]s if the laws are broken. But not all breaches of the law are considered crimes, e.g. [[breach of contract|breaches of contract]]. The [[label (sociology)|label]] of &quot;crime&quot; and the accompanying [[social stigma]] are usually reserved for those activities causing more serious loss and damage to the citizens of the state. Its use is intended to reflect a consensus of condemnation for the identified behaviour and, in the event that an accused is [[conviction (law)|convicted]] following a [[trial (law)|trial]] applying principles of [[due process]], to justify the state imposing [[punishment]]. The term is also applied to minor [[regulatory offences]] or [[infraction]]s, e.g. where the [[criminal law]] is used to keep order on the roads.

== Definition of crime in general ==
The systematic study of the causes ([[aetiology]]), prevention, control, and penal responses to crime is called [[criminology]]. For these purposes, the definition of crime depends on the theoretical stance taken. The nature of crime could be viewed from either a legal or [[norm (sociology)|normative]] perspective. A legalistic definition takes as its starting point the [[common law]] or the [[statute|statutory]]/[[codification|codified]] definitions contained in the laws enacted by the [[sovereignty|sovereign]] government. Thus, a crime is any [[culpability|culpable]] action or [[omission (criminal)|omission]] prohibited by law and punished by the state. This is an uncomplicated view: a crime is a crime because the law defines it as such. 

A normative definition views crime as [[deviant behavior|deviant behaviour]] that violates prevailing norms, i.e. [[culture|cultural]] standards specifying how humans ought to behave. This approach considers the complex realities surrounding the concept of crime and seeks to understand how changing [[society|social]], political, [[psychology|psychological]], and [[economics|economic]] conditions may affect the current definitions of crime and the form of the legal, [[law enforcement]], and penal responses made by the state. These [[structuralism|structural]] realities are fluid and often contentious. For example, as cultures change and the political environment shifts, behaviour may be [[criminalisation|criminalised]] or [[decriminalisation|decriminalised]] which will directly affect the [[statistics|statistical]] [[crime rate]]s, determine the allocation of resources for the enforcement of such laws, and influence public opinion. Similarly, changes in the way that crime data is collected and/or calculated may affect the public perceptions of the extent of any given &quot;crime problem&quot;. All such adjustments to [[crime statistics]], allied with the experience of people in their everyday lives, shape attitudes on the extent to which law should be used to enforce any particular social norm. There are many ways in which behaviour can be controlled without having to resort to using the criminal law. Indeed, in those cases where there is no clear consensus on the given norm, the use of the criminal law by the group in [[power (sociology)|power]] to prohibit the behaviour of another group may be considered an improper limitation of the second group's [[freedom]], and the ordinary members of society may lose some of their respect for the law in general whether the disputed law is actively enforced or not.

==Why criminalise?==
Criminalisation is intended as a pre-emptive, harm-reduction device, using the threat of punishment as a [[deterrent]] to those proposing to engage in the behaviour causing harm. The state becomes involved because the costs of not criminalising (i.e. allowing the harms to continue unabated) outweigh the costs of criminalising it (i.e. restricting individual [[liberty]] and so minimising harm to others). The process of criminalisation should be controlled by the state because:
*Victims or witnesses of crimes might be deterred from taking any action if they fear retaliation. Even in policed societies, fear may inhibit reporting or co-operation in a trial.
*The victims may only want compensation for the injuries suffered, while being indifferent to the more general need for [[deterrence]]: see Polinsky &amp; Shavell (1997) on the fundamental divergence between the private and the social motivation for using the legal system.
*Even if the victims recognise that they are victims, they may not have the resources to investigate and seek legal redress for the injuries suffered: the enforcers formally appointed by the state have the expertise and the resources.
*Victims do not have economies of scale to administer a penal system, let alone collect any fines levied by a court (see Polinsky (1980) on the enforcement of fines). Garoupa &amp; Klerman (2002) warn that a [[rent-seeking]] government's primary motivation is to maximise revenue and so, if offenders have sufficient wealth, a rent-seeking government is more aggressive than a [[social welfare function|social-welfare]]-maximising government in enforcing laws against minor crimes (usually with a fixed penalty such as parking and routine traffic violations), but more lax in enforcing laws against major crimes.

==History ==
The first civilisations had codes of law, containing both civil and penal rules mixed together, though these codes were not always recorded. According to Oppenheim (1964), the first known written codes were produced by the [[Sumerians]], and it was probably their king [[Ur-Nammu]] (who ruled over [[Ur]] in the 21st century BC) who acted as the first legislator, creating a formal system in thirty-two articles. The Sumerians later issued other codes including the &quot;code of Lipit-Istar&quot; (last king of the 3rd dynasty of Ur, Isin - 20th century BC). This code contains some fifty articles and has been reconstructed by the comparison among several sources. Kramer (1971: 4) adds a further element: &quot;The Sumarian was deeply conscious of his personal rights and resented any encroachment on them, whether by his King, his superior, or his equal. No wonder that the Sumerians were the first to compile laws and law codes.&quot;

In [[Babylon]], Driver and Mills (1952-55) and Skaist (1994) describe the successive legal codes, including the [[code of Hammurabi]] (one of the richest of ancient times), which reflected society's belief that law was derived from the will of the gods (see [[Babylonian law]]. Many of the states at this time were [[theocracy|theocratic]], and their codes of conduct were religious in origin or reference.

[[Sir Henry Maine|Maine]] (1861) studied the ancient codes and failed to find any criminal law in the modern sense of the word. While modern systems distinguish between offences against the &quot;State&quot; or &quot;Community&quot;, and offences against the &quot;Individual&quot;, what was termed the penal law of ancient communities was not the law of &quot;Crimes&quot; (''crimina''); it was the law of &quot;Wrongs&quot; (''delicta''). Thus, the Hellenic laws (see Gagarin: 1986; and Garner: 1987) treated all forms of [[theft]], [[assault]], [[rape]], and [[murder]] as private wrongs, and action for enforcement was up to the victim or their survivors (which was a challenge in that although there was law, there were no formalised courts in the earliest system). It was the Romans who systematised law and exported it to their Empire. Again, the initial rules of [[Roman law|Roman Law]] were that assaults were a matter of private compensation. The significant Roman Law concept was of ''dominion'' (see Daube: 1969). The ''[[pater familias]]'' was in possession of all the family and its property (including slaves). Hence, interference with any property was enforced by the ''pater''. The Commentaries of Gaius on the [[Twelve tables|Twelve Tables]] treated ''furtum'' (modern theft) as if it was a [[tort]]. Similarly, assault and violent [[robbery]] were allied with [[trespass]] as to the ''pater's'' property (so, for example, the rape of a female slave, would be the subject of compensation to the ''pater'' as having trespassed on his &quot;property&quot;) and breach of such laws created a ''vinculum juris'' (an obligation of law) that could only be discharged by the payment of monetary compensation (modern [[damages]]). Similarly, in the consolidated Teutonic Laws of the Germanic tribes (see Guterman: 1990), there was a complex system of money compensations for what would now be considered the complete range of criminal offences against the person from murder down. 

Even though Rome abandoned [[England]] sometime around 400 AD, the Germanic mercenaries who had largely been enforcing the the Roman occupation, stayed on and continued to use a mixture of Roman and Teutonic Law, with much written down by the early Anglo-Saxon Kings (see Attenborough: 1963). But, it was not until a more unified Kingdom emerged following the Norman invasion and the King was attempting to assert power over the land and its peoples, that the modern concept emerged, namely that a crime is not only an offence against the &quot;individual&quot;, it is also a wrong against the &quot;state&quot; (see Kern: 1948; Blythe: 1992; and Pennington: 1993.). This is a [[common law]] idea and the earliest conception of a criminal act involved events of such major significance that the &quot;state&quot; had to usurp the usual functions of the civil tribunals and direct a special law or ''privilegium'' against the perpetrator. All the earliest criminal trials were wholly extraordinary and arbitrary without any settled law to apply, whereas the civil delictual law was highly developed and consistent in its operation (except where the King wanted to raise money by selling a new form of [[Writ]]). The development of the idea that it is the &quot;state&quot; dispensing [[justice]] in a court only emerges in parallel with or after the emergence of the concept of sovereignty. In continental Europe, Vinogradoff (1909) reports the persistence of Roman Law, but with a stronger influence from the Church (see Tierney: 1964, 1979). Coupled with the more diffuse political structure based on smaller state units, rather different legal traditions emerged, remaining more strongly rooted in Roman [[jurisprudence]] modified to meet the prevailing political climate.

From the Hellenic system onwards, the policy rationale for requiring the payment of monetary compensation for wrongs committed has been to avoid feuding between [[clan]]s and [[family|families]] (note the concept of ''pater familias'' as a unifying factor in extended kin groups, and the later practice of [[wergild]] in this context). If families' feelings could be mollified by compensation, this would help to keep the peace. It did not always work but, in the earliest times, the &quot;states&quot; were not prepared to provide an independent police force. Thus, criminal law grew out of what is now tort and, in real terms, many acts and omissions that are classified as crimes overlap civil law concepts.

== Natural law theory ==
The consistent theoretical problem has been to justify the state's use of force to coerce compliance with its laws. One of the earliest justifications was the theory of [[natural law]]. This posits that the standards of morality are derived from or constructed by the nature of the world or of human beings. [[Thomas Aquinas]] said: &quot;the rule and measure of human acts is the reason, which is the first principle of human acts&quot; (Aquinas, ST I-II, Q.90, A.I), i.e. since people are by nature rational beings, it is morally appropriate that they should behave in a way that conforms to their rational nature. Thus, to be valid, any law must conform to natural law and coercing people to conform to that law is morally acceptable. [[William Blackstone]] (1979: 41) describes the thesis: 
:&quot;This law of nature, being co-eval with mankind and dictated by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the globe, in all countries, and at all times: no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid derive all their force, and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from this original.&quot; 
But [[John Austin (legal philosophy)|John Austin]], an early [[Legal positivism|positivist]], applied [[utilitarianism]] in accepting the calculating nature of human beings and the existence of an objective morality, but denied that the legal validity of a noalways halting Turing machine.

* Type-1 grammars ([[context-sensitive grammar|context-sensitive grammars]]) generate the [[context-sensitive language|context-sensitive languages]].  These grammars have rules of the form &lt;math&gt;\alpha A\beta \rightarrow \alpha\gamma\beta&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; a nonterminal and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; strings of terminals and nonterminals. The strings &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; may be empty, but &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; must be nonempty.  The rule &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is allowed if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; does not appear on the right side of any rule.  The languages described by these grammars are exactly all languages that can be recognized by a non-deterministic Turing machine whose tape is bounded by a constant times the length of the input.

* Type-2 grammars ([[context-free grammar|context-free grammars]]) generate the [[context-free language]]s. These are defined by rules of the form &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow \gamma&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; a nonterminal and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; a string of terminals and nonterminals. These languages are exactly all languages that can be recognized by a non-deterministic [[pushdown automaton]]. Context free languages are the theoretical basis for the syntax of most [[programming language|programming languages]].

* Type-3 grammars ([[regular grammar|regular grammars]]) generate the [[regular language|regular languages]].  Such a grammar restricts its rules to a single nonterminal on the left-hand side and a right-hand side consisting of a single terminal, possibly followed (or preceded, but not both in the same grammar) by a single nonterminal. The rule &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is also here allowed if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; does not appear on the right side of any rule.  These languages are exactly all languages that can be decided by a [[finite state automaton]]. Additionally, this family of formal languages can be obtained by [[regular expressions]]. Regular languages are commonly used to define search patterns and the lexical structure of programming languages.

Note that the set of grammars corresponding to recursive languages is not a member of this hierarchy.

Every regular language is context-free, every context-free language is context-sensitive and every context-sensitive language is recursive and every recursive language is recursively enumerable. These are all proper inclusions, meaning that there exist recursively enumerable languages which are not recursive, recursive languages that are not context-sensitive, context-sensitive languages which are not context-free and context-free languages which are not regular.

The following table summarizes each of Chomsky's four types of grammars, the class of languages it generates, the type of automaton that recognizes it, and the form its rules must have.

[[Image:CRT_color.png|right|thumb|300px|Cutaway rendering of a color CRT]]
The '''cathode ray tube''' or '''CRT''', invented by [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]], is the [[display device]] that was traditionally used in most [[computer display]]s, [[video monitor]]s, [[television]]s and [[oscilloscope]]s. The CRT developed from [[Philo Farnsworth]]'s work was used in all television sets until the late [[20th century]] and the advent of [[plasma screen]]s, [[Liquid crystal display television|LCD]]s, [[DLP]], [[OLED]] displays, and other technologies.  As a result of this technology, television continues to be referred to as &quot;[[The Tube (disambiguation)|The Tube]]&quot; well into the [[21st century]], even when referring to non-CRT sets.

==Apparatus description==
The earliest version of the CRT was a cold-cathode diode, a modification of the [[Crookes tube]] with a phosphor-coated screen, sometimes called a [[Ferdinand Braun|Braun tube]].  The first version to use a hot cathode was developed by J. B. Johnson (who gave his name to the term [[Johnson-Nyquist noise|Johnson noise]]) and H. W. Weinhart of Western Electric and became a commercial product in 1922.

[[Cathode ray]]s exist in the form of streams of high speed [[electron]]s emitted from the heating of cathode inside a [[vacuum tube]].
The released electrons form a beam within the cathode ray tube due to the voltage difference applied in the two electrodes, and the direction of this beam is then altered either by a [[magnetic field|magnetic]] or [[electric field]] to swap over the surface at the fluorescent screen ([[anode]]), covered by [[Phosphor|phosphorescent material]] (often [[transition metal]]s or [[rare earth]]s). Light is emitted at the instant that electrons hit the surface of that material.

In case of a [[television]] and modern computer monitors, the entire front area of the tube is scanned in a fixed pattern called a ''raster'', and a picture is created by modulating the intensity of the electron beam according to the programme's [[video signal]]. The beam in all modern TV sets is scanned with a magnetic field applied to the neck of the tube with a &quot;magnetic yoke&quot;, a set of coils driven by electronic circuits. This usage of electromagnets to change the electron beam's original direction is known to be &quot;magnetic deflection&quot;.

In case of an [[oscilloscope]], the intensity of the electron beam is kept constant, and the picture is drawn by steering the beam along an arbitrary path. Usually, the horizontal deflection is proportional to time, and the vertical deflection is proportional to the signal. The tube for this kind of use is longer and narrower, and deflection is done by applying an [[electrical field]] via deflection plates built into the tube's neck. The use of an electrical field (so-called &quot;electrostatic deflection&quot;) allows the electron beam to be steered much more rapidly than with a magnetic field, where the [[inductance]] of the electromagnets imposes relatively severe limits on the frequency range that can be accurately reproduced.

The electron beam source is the [[electron gun]], producing the stream of electrons by [[thermionic emission]] and then focusing it to a thin beam. The gun was often mounted slightly off-axis, as it accelerated not only electrons but also ions resulting from [[outgassing]] of the internal tube components and from an imperfect [[vacuum]]. The ions are heavier than electrons, therefore they are less likely to be deflected by the magnetic field from the deflection coils, and in older constructions with in-axis guns they were bombarding the phosphor in the center of the screen and causing its deterioration; some very old black and white TV sets show browning of the center of the screen, known as ion burn. The combination of an off-axis mounting of electron guns and permanent magnets bending the electron beam back in the desired direction forms an [[ion trap]]; the ions were not deflected enough so they struck the neck of the tube instead of the screen and harmlessly dissipated. This system was later replaced with aluminium coating of the phosphor.

The internal side of the phosphor layer is often covered with a layer of [[aluminium]]. The phosphors are usually poor electrical conductors, which leads to deposition of residual charge on the screen, effectively decreasing the energy of the impacting electrons due to electrostatic repulsion (an effect known as &quot;sticking&quot;). The aluminium layer is connected to the conductive layer inside the tube, disposing of this charge. It also reflects the phosphor light in the desired direction towards the viewer, and protects the phosphor from ion bombardment.

[[Image:Egun.jpg|200px|thumb|Electron Gun]]

Graphical displays for early computers used [[vector monitor]]s, a type of CRT similar to the oscilloscope. Here, the beam would trace straight lines between arbitrary points, repeatedly refreshing the display as quickly as possible. Vector monitors were used in many computer displays as well as by some late 1970s to mid 1980s arcade games such as [[Asteroids]]. Vector displays for computers did not noticeably suffer the display artifacts of [[aliasing]] and [[pixelization]], but were limited in that they could display only a shape's outline, and only a very small amount of rather largely-drawn text. (Because the speed of refresh was roughly inversely proportional to how many vectors needed to be drawn, &quot;filling&quot; an area using many individual vectors was impractical as was the display of a large amount of text.) Some vector monitors are capable of displaying several colors using either an ordinary tri-color CRT or two [[phosphor]] layers (so called  &quot;penetration color&quot;). In these dual-layer tubes, by controlling the strength of the electron beam, electrons could be made to reach (and illuminate) either or both phosphor layers, typically producing green, orange, or red.

Other graphical displays used [[storage tube]]s including [[Direct View Bistable Storage Tube]]s ([[DVBST]]s). These CRTs inherently stored the image and did not require periodic refreshing.

Some displays for early computers (those that needed to display more text than was practical using vectors, or required high speed for photographic output) used [[Charactron]] CRTs. These used a perforated metal character mask (&quot;[[Stencil]]&quot;) to shape a wide electron beam to form a selected character shape on the screen. The electronics could quickly select a character on the mask with one set of deflection circuits, while selecting the position to display the character at with a second set of deflection circuits, and then just turn on the beam briefly to draw that character. Graphics could still be drawn by selecting the unneeded position on the mask corresponding to the code for a space (when drawing a space the beam was simply kept off), which had a small round hole in the center instead of being solid, and draw this as with other displays.

Many of these various types of early computer display CRTs use &quot;slow&quot; or long persistance phosphor, to reduce flicker for the operator.
[[Image:shadow_mask.jpg|200px|thumb|Shadow mask CRT close-up]]

[[Image:aperture_grille.jpg|200px|thumb|Aperture grille CRT close-up]]

Color tubes use three different materials which specifically emit red, green, and blue light, closely packed together in strips (in [[aperture grille]] designs) or clusters (in [[shadow mask]] CRTs). There are three electron guns, one for each color, and each gun can reach only the dots of one color, as the grille or mask absorbs electrons that would otherwise hit the wrong phosphor.

The outer glass allows the light generated by the phosphor out of the monitor, but (for color tubes) it must block dangerous [[X-ray]]s generated by the impact of the high energy electron beam. For this reason, the glass is made of leaded glass (sometimes called &quot;lead crystal&quot;).  Because of this and other shielding, and protective circuits designed to prevent the anode voltage rising too high, the X-ray emission of modern CRTs is well within safety limits.

CRTs have a pronounced [[triode]] characteristic, which results in significant [[gamma correction|gamma]] (a nonlinear relationship between beam current and light intensity). In early televisions, screen gamma was an advantage because it acted to compress the screen [[contrast]]. The gamma characteristic exists today in all [[digital video]] systems. However, in some systems where a linear response is required, as in [[desktop publishing]], [[gamma correction]] is applied.

CRT displays accumulate [[static electricity|static]] electrical charge on the screen, unless protective measures are taken. This charge does not pose a safety hazard, but can lead to significant degradation of image quality through attraction of [[dust]] particles to the surface of the screen. Unless the display is regularly cleaned with a dry cloth or special cleaning tissue (using ordinary household cleaners may damage anti-glare protective layer on the screen), after a few months the brightness and clarity of the image drops significantly.

The high voltage (E.H.T.) used for accelerating the electrons is provided by a transformer. For CRTs used in televisions, this is usually a [[flyback transformer]] that steps up the line (horizontal) deflection supply to as much as 32,000 volts for a colour tube. (Monochrome tubes may operate at a somewhat lower voltage and specialty CRTs may operate at much lower voltages.) The output of the transformer is rectified and the pulsating output voltage is smoothed by a capacitor formed by the tube itself: the accelerating anode being one plate, the glass being the dielectric, and the earthed coating on the outside of the tube being the other plate. Before all-glass tubes, the structure between the screen and the electron gun was made from a heavy metal cone which served as the accelerating anode. Smoothing of the E.H.T. was then done with a massive capacitor, external to the tube itself.

==Other technologies==
It is likely that technologies such as [[plasma display]]s, [[liquid crystal display]]s, and other newer technologies will eventually make CRT-based displays  mostly obsolete, because the new designs are less bulky and consume less power. As of mid-2003, LCDs are becoming directly comparable in price to CRTs, with LCDs forming 30% of the computer display market by value.  However, color CRTs still find adherents in computer gaming, due to their very quick response time, and in the printing and TV broadcasting industries for their better color fidelity and contrast. In 2005 Sony announced that they would stop the production of CRT computer displays.

==Magnets==
[[Magnet]]s should never be put next to a colour CRT, as they may cause magnetisation of the shadow mask, which will cause incorrect colours to appear in the magnetised area and may be expensive to have corrected (although this will correct itself over a few days or weeks). Most modern television sets and nearly all newer computer monitors have a built-in [[degauss]]ing coil (pronounced &quot;de-gow-sing&quot;). This coil creates a brief, alternating magnetic field from standard 50 or 60 Hz household power upon power-up which decays in strength as a resistor in the circuit increases resistance with its increasing temperature as a result of the current passing through it. The alternating magnetic field created is sufficient enough to shake off most cases of shadow mask magnetisation. It is also possible to purchase or to build your own external degaussing coil which can aid in demagnetising older sets or in cases where the built-in coil was not effective. A soldering gun (a [[soldering iron]] will not work as it does not contain a large transformer which produces a large alternating magnetic field) may also be used to degauss a monitor by holding it up to the center of the monitor with the hot tip end facing safely '''AWAY''' from the glass (and yourself!) and while holding down the on button, slowly moving the gun in ever wider concentric circles past the edge of the monitor until the shimmering colours can no longer be seen. This may need to be repeated several times to remove severe magnetisation.

In extreme cases, high power magnets such as the now popular [[neodymium]] [[iron]] [[boron]], or [[Neodymium magnet|NIB magnets]], can actually deform the shadow mask. This type of damage is considered permanent and will render the CRT mostly useless. However, subjecting an old black and white television or monochrome (green screen, amber screen) computer monitor to magnets is generally harmless. This can be used as a demonstration tool and children should even be encouraged to do this so that they may see the immediate and dramatic effect of a magnetic field on moving charged particles, provided they are informed to never do the same with a colour tube.

== Health danger==
Some believe the electromagnetic fields emitted by CRT monitors constitute a health danger to the functioning of living cells. Exposure to these fields is far lower at distances of 85 cm or farther. It is also less intensive for the display's user than for a person located behind it.

CRTs also emit very small amounts of [[X-rays]] as a result of the electron beam's bombardment of the shadow mask/aperture grille and phosphors. Almost all of this radiation is blocked by the thick leaded glass in the screen so the amount of radiation escaping the front of the monitor is mostly harmless. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulations in 21 CFR 1020 are used to strictly limit, for instance, television receivers to 0.5 milliroentgens per hour (mR/h) (0.13 µC/(kg·h) (at a distance of 5 cm from any external surface and as mentioned above, most CRT emissions fall well below this limit.[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=1020.10]

Old CRTs may also have used toxic phosphors, although that is much less common today. An implosion or other breaking of the glass envelope could release these toxic phosphors. And because of the X-ray hazard, the glass envelopes of most modern CRTs are made from heavily [[leaded glass]]. The [[lead]] in this glass may represent an environmental hazard, especially in the presence of [[acid rain]] leaking through [[landfill]]s.

The constant refreshing of a CRT can cause [[headaches]] in [[migraine]] sufferers and [[seizure|seizures]] in [[epilepsy|epileptics]], if they are [[Photosensitive epilepsy|photosensitive]]. Filters are available to reduce these effects.
A high refresh rate (above 75 Hz) also helps to negate these effects.

CRTs operate at very high voltages. These voltages can persist long (several days) after the device containing the CRT has been switched off and unplugged.  (Modern circuits contain [[bleeder resistor]]s to ensure the high-voltage supply is discharged to safe levels within a couple of minutes at most.)

CRT tubes present a hazard to those without proper training and  appropriate precautions. Since the CRT contains a vacuum, there is also risk of implosion, as well as electrocution from any residual charge.

== High vacuum safety ==
Because of the strong vacuum within a CRT, they store a large amount of mechanical energy; they can [[Implosion|implode]] very forcefully if the outer glass envelope is damaged. Most modern CRTs used in televisions and computer displays include a bonded, multi-layer faceplate that prevents implosion if the faceplate is damaged, but the bell of the CRT (back portions of the glass envelope) offers no such protection. Certain specialized CRTs (such as those used in [[oscilloscope]]s) do not even offer a bonded faceplate; these CRTs require an external plastic faceplate or other cover to render them implosion safe while in use. Before the use of bonded faceplates one of the hazards would be that a broken neck or envelope would cause the neck and electron gun to be propelled by atmosperic pressure at such a velocity that it would erupt through the face of the tube.

When handling or disposing of a CRT, you must take steps to avoid creating an implosion hazard for you or your trash removal service. The most simple and safe method to make the tube safe is to identify the small sealed glass nib at the far back of the tube (this may be obscured by the electrical connector) and then (while wearing [[safety glasses]] and gloves) filing a small nick across this and then to break it off using a pair of pliers. A loud sucking sound will be heard as the air enters the tube, filling the vacuum. One must be very cautious not to break the neck of the tube when it is evacuated since there is no plastic coating preventing shattering of the glass.  ''High vacuum and high voltage can be dangerous.''

It is estimated that there are now approximately 3,500 speakers of Cornish (about 0.7% of the Cornish population) and 300-400 fluent speakers (about 0.07%). It is estimated that in excess of 5,000 more have some knowledge of basic phrases or could understand basic sentences. A few people under the age of 30 have been brought up speaking it. Cornish exists in place names, and a knowledge of the language helps the understanding of old place names. Many Cornish names are adopted for children, pets, houses and boats. There is now an amount of Cornish literature, in which poetry is the most important genre, particularly in oral form or as song.

[[Cornwall County Council]] has, as policy, a commitment to support the language, and recently passed a motion supporting it being specified within the European charter for regional or minority languages. 

There are regular periodicals solely in the language such as the monthly ''An Gannas'', ''An Gowsva'', and ''An Garrick''. Radio Cornwall and Pirate FM have regular news broadcasts in Cornish, and sometimes have other programmes and features for learners and enthusiasts.  Local newspapers such as the ''[[The Western Morning News|Western Morning News]]'' regularly have articles in Cornish, and newspapers such as ''The Packet'', ''The West Briton'' and ''The Cornishman'' also support the movement. 

The language has financial sponsorship from many sources, including the [[Millennium Commission]]. Increasingly, churches have notices in Cornish and English.  The take-up of the language is now becoming so widespread that language organisations are finding it difficult to keep up with demand. These organisations include (in alphabetical order) [[Agan Tavas]] (Our Language), the Cornish sub-group of the [[European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages]], [[Gorseth Kernow]], [[Kesva an Taves Kernewek]] (the Cornish Language Board), [[Kowethas an Yeth Kernewek]] (the Cornish Language Fellowship), and [[Teere ha Tavas]] (Land and Language). One organisation, [[Dalleth]], promoted the language to pre-school children. There are many popular ceremonies, some ancient, some modern, which use the language or are entirely in the language.

===Culture===
:''See [[Cornish literature]]''

[[Cornwall]] has many other cultural events associated with the language, including the international [[Celtic film festival]], hosted in [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]] in [[1997]], with the programme in Cornish, English and French. There have been many films, some televised, made entirely, or significantly, in the language. Some shops, such as Gwynn ha Du, in the town of [[Liskeard]], sell books written in Cornish. Many companies use Cornish names. The overnight physician's service in Cornwall is now called ''Kernowdoc''. Cornish is taught in some schools; it was previously taught at degree level in the [[University of Wales]], though the only existing courses in the language at University level are as part of a course in Cornish Studies at the [[University of Exeter]], or as part of the distance-learning [[Welsh language | Welsh]] degree from the [[University of Wales, Lampeter]]. 

The Cornish language has been recognised as a minority language by the UK government under the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. This follows years of pressure by interest groups such as [[Mebyon Kernow]] and Kesva an Taves Kernewek.

The first complete edition of the New Testament in Cornish, [[Nicholas Williams]]' translation of the ''Testament Noweth agan Arluth ha Savyour Jesu Cryst'', was published at [[Easter]] 2002 by Spyrys a Gernow (ISBN 0-9535975-4-7); it uses Unified Cornish Revised orthography. The translation was made from the Greek text, and incorporated John Tregear's existing translations with slight revisions.

In August [[2004]], Kesva an Taves Kernewek published its edition of the New Testament in Cornish (ISBN 1-902917-33-2), translated by Keith Syed and Ray Edwards; it uses Kernewek Kemmyn orthography. It was launched in a ceremony in [[Truro Cathedral]] attended by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].

The [[Celtic Congress]] and [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]] is a group that advocates cooperation amongst the Celtic Nations in order to protect and promote Celtic languages and cultures, thus working in the interests of the Cornish language.

===European recognition===
On [[November 5]], [[2002]] in answer to a Parliamentary Question, Local Government and Regions Minister [[Nick Raynsford]] said: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;After careful consideration and with the help of the results of an independent academic study on the language commissioned by the government, we have decided to recognise Cornish as falling under Part II of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. The government will be registering this decision with the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The purpose of the Charter is to protect and promote the historical regional or minority languages of Europe. It recognises that some of these languages are in danger of extinction and that protection and encouragement of them contributes to Europe's cultural diversity and historical traditions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;This is a positive step in acknowledging the symbolic importance the language has for Cornish identity and heritage.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Cornish will join Welsh, Scottish Gaelic, Irish, Scots and Ulster Scots as protected and promoted languages under the Charter, which commits the government to recognise and respect those languages.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Officials will be starting discussions with [[Cornwall County Council]] and Cornish language organisations to ensure the views of Cornish speakers and people wanting to learn Cornish are taken into account in implementing the Charter.

==Grammar==
Cornish is a member of the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] branch of the [[Indo-European]] family of languages, and shares many of the characteristics of the other Insular Celtic languages.  These include:

*''Initial [[consonant mutation]]''.  The first sound of a Cornish word may change according to grammatical context.   There are four types of mutation in Cornish (compared to three in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and two in [[Irish language|Irish]]).  These are known as ''soft'' (''b'' -&gt; ''v'', etc.), ''hard'' (''b'' -&gt; ''p''), ''aspirate'' (''b'' unchanged, ''t'' -&gt; ''th'') and ''mixed'' (''b'' -&gt; ''f'').
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Before rounded vowels, and r (provided it is followed by a rounded vowel). 
&lt;/center&gt;
*''[[inflected language|inflected]] (or [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]]) [[preposition|prepositions]].''  A preposition combines with a personal pronoun to give a separate word form.  For example, ''gans'' (with, by) + ''my'' (me) -&gt; ''genef''; ''gans'' + ''ef'' (him) -&gt; ''ganso''.
*''No indefinite [[article (grammar)|article]].''  ''Cath'' means &quot;a cat&quot; (there is, however a definite article: ''an gath'' means &quot;the cat&quot;).
*''For other grammatical characteristics of Cornish, see the section on grammar in the [[Welsh language]] article, until this section is finished.''

==Dialects==
There are, essentially, four 'dialects' of Cornish.  They are not dialects in the normal sense (though regional variations exist to some degree), but rather differences in the manner of revival.  

See: [[Cornish language#Revival|Revival]]

It is also possible that a variety of Cornish was spoken in [[Devon]] as late as the [[14th century]]: Then President of the Devonshire Association, Sir Henry Duke, said in 1922 that &quot;various writers have made (assertions) of the continuance of British occupancy and of the British tongue in South and West Devon to a time well within the reigns of the Plantagenets.  Risdon, for example, says that the Celtic tongue was spoken throughout the South Hams in Edward the First's time&quot;.

==Examples==
This table compares some Cornish words (written using UCR and Kernewek Kemmyn orthographies) with equivalents from its sister Brythonic languages of Welsh and Breton.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Complexity theory''' can refer to more than one thing:

* '''[[Computational complexity theory]]''': a field in [[theoretical computer science]] and [[mathematics]] dealing with the resources required during computation to solve a given problem.
* The theoretical treatment of '''[[Kolmogorov complexity]]''' of a [[string (computer science)|string]] is studied in [[algorithmic information theory]] by identifying the length of the shortest binary program which can output that string.
* '''[[Systems theory]]''' (or ''systemics'' or ''general systems theory''): an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field including [[engineering]], [[biology]] and [[philosophy]] that incorporates science to study large systems.
* '''Complexity Theory''' is sometimes used as a broad term addressing the study of '''[[complex system]]s''', including subjects such as [[chaos theory]], [[artificial life]], and [[genetic algorithm]]s.
* '''Complexity Theory''' as a simplified concept alludes to systems' &quot;sensitive dependence on initial conditions.&quot; [eg. the waving of a butterfly's wings today changes weather patterns tomorrow]

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Charybdis.PNG|right|Engraving of Charybdis]]
In [[Greek mythology]], '''Charybdis''', or '''Kharybdis''' (&quot;sucker down&quot;, [[Greek language|Greek]] Χάρυβδις), is a [[sea monster]], daughter of [[Poseidon]] and [[Gaia (mythology)]], who swallows huge amounts of water three times a day and then spouts it back out again, forming an enormous whirlpool. She lay on one side of a narrow channel of water. 

On the other side of the strait was [[Scylla]], another sea-monster. The two sides of the strait are within an arrow's range of each other, so close that sailors attempting to avoid Charybdis will pass too close to Scylla and vice versa.  The phrase ''between Scylla and Charybdis'' has come to mean being in a state where one is between two dangers and moving away from one will cause you to be in danger from the other and may be the genesis of the phrase ''&quot;between a rock and a hard place&quot;'' speaking of the rock upon which Scylla dwelt and the hard place being the whirlpool of Charybdis.

The [[Argonauts]] were able to avoid both dangers because they were guided by [[Thetis]], one of the [[Nereids]]. [[Odysseus]] was not so fortunate; he chose to risk Scylla at the cost of some of his crew rather than lose the whole ship to Charybdis. ([[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', Book XII).

Traditionally, the location of Charybdis has been associated with the [[Strait of Messina]] off the coast of [[Sicily]], opposite the rock called [[Scylla]]. The whirlpool there is caused by the meeting of currents, but is seldom dangerous. Recently scholars have looked again at the location and suggested this association was a misidentification and that a more likely origin for the story could be found close by [[Cape Skilla]] in north west [[Greece]].

Charybdis was originally a sea-[[nymph]] who flooded land to enlarge her father's underwater kingdom, until [[Zeus]] turned her into a [[monster]].

| [[{{PAGENAME}} (data page)#Theropean language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) roots shows that they cannot be cognate (see for example [[Grimm's law]]).  German ''haben'' (like English ''have'') in fact comes from PIE *kap, 'to grasp', and its real cognate in Latin is ''capere'', 'to seize, grasp, capture'.  Latin ''habere'', on the other hand, is from PIE *ghabh, 'to give, to receive', and hence cognate with English ''give'' and German ''geben''.

The similarity of words between languages is ''not'' enough to demonstrate that the words are related to each other, in much the same way that facial resemblance does not determine whether two people are genetically related. Over the course of hundreds and thousands of years, words may change their sound completely. Thus, for example, English ''five'' and [[Sanskrit]] ''pança'' are cognates, while English ''over'' and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''a'var'' are not, and neither are English ''dog'' and [[Mbabaram language|Mbabaram]] ''dog''.

Contrast this with [[false friend]]s, which frequently ''are'' cognate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Chromatography''' is a family of [[analytical chemistry]] techniques for the [[separation of mixtures]].  It involves passing the sample, a mixture which contains the [[analyte]], in the &quot;mobile phase&quot;, often in a stream of [[solvent]], through the &quot;stationary phase.&quot; The stationary phase retards the passage of the components of the sample. When components pass through the system at different rates they become separated in time, like runners in a mass-start foot race.  Each component has a characteristic time of passage through the system, called a &quot;retention time.&quot;  Chromatographic separation is achieved when the retention time of the [[analyte]] differs from that of other components in the sample.

A '''chromatograph''' takes a chemical mixture carried by [[liquid]] or [[gas]] and separates it into its component parts as a result of differential distributions of the [[solute]]s as they flow around or over a stationary liquid or solid phase. Various techniques for the separation of complex mixtures rely on the differential affinities of substances for a gas or liquid mobile medium and for a stationary [[absorption|absorbing]] medium through which they pass; such as [[paper]], [[gelatin]], [[alumina]] or [[silica]].

''Analytical chromatography'' is used to determine the identity and concentration of molecules in a mixture.  ''Preparative chromatography'' is used to purify larger quantities of a molecular species.  Most of the following refers to analytical chromatography.

== History == 

It was the [[Russia]]n [[botanist]]  [[Mikhail Tsvet]] (Mikhail Semyonovich Tsvet) who invented the first chromatography technique in [[1901]] during his research on [[chlorophyll]]. He used a liquid-adsorption column containing [[calcium carbonate]] to separate plant [[pigment]]s. The method was described on December 30, 1901 at the XI Congress of Naturalists and Doctors (XI съезд естествоиспытателей и врачей) in St. Petersburg. The first printed description was in [[1903]], in the Proceedings of the [[Warsaw]] Society of Naturalists, section of biology. He first used the term ''chromatography'' in print in [[1906]] in his two papers about chlorophyll in the German botanical journal, ''Berichte der Deutschen Botanischen Gesellschaft''.  In [[1907]] he demonstrated his chromatograph for the German Botanical Society. The phenomenon of precipitational separation was observed before Tsvet as well. His contribution was turning the phenomenon into the method of scientific analysis.

The Greek word ''chroma'' in ''chroma''tography means ''color'' in English and refers both to Tsvet's name that is literally translated from Russian as ''color'' and to the color of the plant pigments he was separating at that time.

In [[1952]] [[Archer John Porter Martin]] and [[Richard Laurence Millington Synge]] were awarded the Chemistry Nobel Prize &quot;for their invention of partition chromatography&quot;. [http://www.nobel.se/chemistry/laureates/1952/]

The technology of chromatography advanced rapidly throughout the 20th century.  Researchers found that the principles underlying Tsvet's chromatography could be applied in many different ways, giving rise to the different varieties of chromatography described below.  Simultaneously, advances continually improved the technical performance of chromatography, allowing increasingly similar molecules to be resolved.

== Chromatography theory ==
Chromatography is a separation method that exploits the differences in partitioning behavior between a '''mobile phase''' and a '''stationary phase''' to separate the components in a mixture. Components of a mixture may be interacting with the stationary phase based on charge, relative solubility or adsorption. There are two theories of chromatography, the plate and rate theories.

=== Retention ===
The retention is a measure of the speed at which a substance moves in a chromatographic system. In continuous development systems like HPLC or GC, where the compounds are eluted with the eluent, the retention is usually measured as the ''retention time'' ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; or  ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;, the time between injection and detection. In interrupted development systems like TLC the retention is measured as the ''retention factor'' ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;, the run length of the compound divided by the run length of the eluent front:

: &lt;math&gt;R_f = \frac{distance\ moved\ by\ compound} {distance\ moved\ by\ eluent}&lt;/math&gt;

The retention of a compound often differs considerably between experiments and laboratories due to variations of the eluent, the stationary phase, temperature, and the setup. It is therefore important to compare the retention of the test compound to that of one or more standard compounds under absolutely identical conditions.

=== Plate theory ===
The plate theory of chromotography was developed by [[Archer John Porter Martin]] and  [[Richard Laurence Millington Synge]]. The plate theory describes the chromotography system, the mobile and stationary phases, as being in equilibrium. The partition coefficient ''K'' is based on this equilibrium, and is defined by the following equation:

: &lt;math&gt;K = \frac{Concentration\ of\ solute\ in\ stationary\ phase} {Concentration\ of\ solute\ in\ mobile\ phase}&lt;/math&gt;

''K'' is assumed to be independent of concentration, and can change if experimental conditions are changed, for example temperature is increased or decreased. As ''K'' increases, it takes longer for solutes to separate.
For a column of fixed length and flow, the retention time &lt;math&gt;(t_R)&lt;/math&gt; and retention volume &lt;math&gt;(V_r)&lt;/math&gt; can be measured and used to calculate ''K''. 
&lt;!--==Rate theory==--&gt;

== Paper chromatography ==
''See the article [[paper chromatography]]''

[[Image:Cromatography tank.png|thumb|200px|In paper chromatography, chemical interactions with the paper make compounds travel at different rates.]]

&lt;!--Some of this may be moved to the paper chromatography article, now a stub--&gt;
A small spot of solution containing the sample is applied to a strip of ''[[chromatography paper]]'' about one centimeter from the base. This sample is ''adsorbed'' onto the paper. This means that the sample will contact the paper and may form interactions with it. Any substance that will react with (and thus bond to) the paper cannot be measured using this technique. The paper is then dipped in to a suitable [[solvent]] (such as [[ethanol]] or [[water]]) and placed in a sealed container. As the solvent rises through the paper it meets the sample mixture which starts to travel up the paper with the solvent. Different [[chemical compound|compound]]s in the sample mixture travel different distances according to how strongly they interact with the paper. Paper chromatography takes some time and the experiment is usually left to complete for some hours. 

The final ''chromatogram'' can be compared with other known mixture chromatograms to identify sample mixes. ''Two-way paper chromatography'' involves using two solvents and rotating the paper 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; in between. This is useful for separating complex mixtures of similar compounds.

This method is only very rarely employed and has been largely replaced by thin layer chromatography (see below.) It remains a powerful pedagogical tool, however.

== Thin layer chromatography (TLC) ==
[[Image:TLC_black_ink.jpg|thumb|200px|Separation of black ink on a TLC plate.]]
In ''thin layer chromatography'' or ''TLC'' the stationary phase consists of a thin layer of adsorbent like [[silica gel]], [[aluminium oxide|alumina]], or [[cellulose]] on a flat carrier like a [[glass]] plate, a thick aluminum foil, or a plastic sheet. 

The process is similar to paper chromatography with the advantage of faster runs, better separations, and the choice between different adsorbents.
TLC is a standard laboratory method in [[organic chemistry]]. Because of its simplicity and speed TLC is often used for monitoring [[chemical reaction]]s and for the qualitative analysis of reaction products.

TLC plates are made by mixing the adsorbent with a small amount of [[inert]] binder like [[calcium sulfate]] (gypsum) and water, spreading the a thick slurry on the carrier, drying the plate, and activation of the adsorbent by heating in an oven. 
The thickness of the adsorbent layer is typically around 0.1&amp;ndash;0.25&amp;nbsp;mm for analytical purposes and around 1&amp;ndash;2&amp;nbsp;mm for preparative TLC. 

Several methods exists to make colorless spots visible:
* Often a small amount of a [[fluorescent]] dye is added to the adsorbent that allows the visualization of [[UV]] absorbing spots under a [[blacklight]] (&quot;UV&lt;sub&gt;254&lt;/sub&gt;&quot;).
* [[Iodine]] vapors are a general unspecific color reagent.
* Specific color reagents exist into which the TLC plate is dipped or which are sprayed onto the plate.

Once visible, the ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; values of the spots can be determined.  These values should be the same regardless of the extent of travel of the solvent, and in theory are independent of a single experimental run.  They do depend on the solvent used, and the type of TLC plate.

Thin Layer Chromatography is also used in finding which pigments a plant contains.  By taking extract of the plants cellulose and applying the technique, one can adaquately find the pigments.

It is used to detect pesticide or insecticide residues in food. Thin-layer chromatography is also used in forensics to analyze the dye composition of fibers.

== Column chromatography ==
Column chromatography utilizes a vertical glass column filled with some form of solid support with the sample to be separated placed on top of this support. The rest of the column is filled with a solvent which, under the influence of gravity, moves the sample through the column.  Similarly to other forms of chromatography, differences in rates of movement through the solid medium are translated to different exit times from the bottom of the column for the various elements of the original sample.

[[Image:columnchromatography.gif|thumb|right|400px|A picture of a standard column chromatography and a flash column chromatography setup]]

In 1978, W. C. Stills introduced a modified version of column chromatography called '''flash column chromatography''' (&quot;flash&quot;). The technique is very similar to the traditional column chromatography, except for that the solvent is driven through the column by applying positive pressure.

When applying positive pressure on top of the column, most separations could be performed in less than 20 minutes with improved separations compared to the old method. This makes flash column chromatography the method of choice for most synthetic organic chemists when purifying organic compounds.

In the modern Flash chromatography systems which can be purchased, the glass columns are replaced with pre-packed plastic cartridges. Solvent is pumped through the cartridge, which is much quicker. Systems may also be linked with detectors and fraction collectors providing automation. The introduction of gradient pumps means quicker separations and less solvent usage.

== Gas-liquid chromatography ==
[[Gas-liquid chromatography]] is based on a [[partition equilibrium]] of analyte between a liquid stationary phase and a mobile gas. It is useful for a wide range of non-polar analytes, but poor for thermally labile molecules.

== Ion exchange chromatography ==
Ion exchange chromatography is a column chromatography that uses a charged stationary phase. It is used to separate charged compounds including [[amino acid]]s, [[peptide]]s, and [[protein]]s. The stationary phase is usually an [[ion exchange resin]] that carries charged [[functional group]]s which interact with oppositely charged groups of the compound to be retained:
* Positively charged ion exchanger (''anion exchanger'') interacts with [[anion]]s
* Negatively charged ion exchanger (''cation exchanger'') interacts with [[cation]]s.
Bound compounds can be eluted from the column by [[gradient elution]] or isocratic elution with a change in salt concentration or pH.  Ion exchange chromatography is commonly used to purify proteins using [[Fast protein liquid chromatography|FPLC]].

== Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography ==
IMAC is a popular and powerful way to purify [[protein]]s. It is based on the specific [[coordinate covalent bond|coordinate covalent binding]] between [[histidine]] or other unique [[amino acid]]s (either naturally present on the surface of the protein or grafted with [[recombinant DNA technology|recombinant DNA techniques]]) and various immobilized metal ions, such as copper, nickel, zinc, or iron.

Salt concentration is increased to produce later fractions.

== High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) ==
[[High performance liquid chromatography]], usually referred to simply as '''HPLC''', is a form of [[column chromatography]] used frequently in [[biochemistry]] and [[Analytical Chemistry]].  The analyte is forced through a column (stationary phase) by a liquid (mobile phase) at high pressure, which decreases the time the separated components remain on the stationary phase and thus the time they have to [[diffuse]] within the column. Diffusion within the column leads to broad peaks and loss of resolution.  Less time on the column then translates to narrower peaks in the resulting chromatogram and thence to better resolution (it's easier to differentiate one peak from another) and sensitivity (tall, narrow peaks can be easier to discriminate from noise than shorter, broader peaks).  Another way to decrease time the analyte stays on the column is to use a solvent gradient.  A solvent gradient is how the composition of the mobile phase changes over a period of time and can be used to force the analyte off of the column at a faster rate.  

=== Normal phase (NP) liquid chromatography ===
Normal phase HPLC (NP-HPLC) was the first kind of HPLC setup used.  This method uses a polar stationary phase and a nonpolar mobile phase, and is commonly used when the analyte of interest is has a nonpolar nature.  NP-HPLC has fallen out of favor recently with the development of reversed phase HPLC.

=== Reversed phase (RP) liquid chromatography ===
Reversed phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) was developed due to the increasing interest in large polar biomolecules.  Like the name implies the nature of the stationary phase is reversed.  The RP-HPLC consists of a nonpolar stationary phase and a polar mobile phase. One common stationary phase is a ''normal'' silica which has been treated with RMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;SiCl, where R is a straight chain alkyl group such as C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;37&lt;sub&gt; or C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;sub&gt;. It is the case that for a given substance the retention time is longer when the mobile phase is more polar. This is the reverse of the situation which exists when normal silica is used as the stationary phase.

Reversed phase columns are quite difficult to damage when compared with normal silica columns. But they must never be used with strong aqueous [[bases]] ([[alkali]]) as these will destroy the silica, however they can be used with aqueous acid but the column should not be exposed to the acid for too long. One reason is because the acid will corrode the metal parts of the HPLC equipment. The metal content of HPLC columns must be kept low if the best possible ability to separate substances is to be retained. A good test for the metal content of a [[column]] is to inject a sample which is a [[mixture]] of 2,2'- and 4,4'- [[bipyridine]]. Because the 2,2'-bipy can [[chelate]] the metal it is normal that when a [[metal]] [[ion]] is present on the surface of the [[silica]] the shape of the peak for the 2,2'-bipy will be distorted, tailing will be seen on this distorted peak.

== Gel permeation chromatography ==
[[Gel permeation chromatography]], also known as size exclusion chromatography or Sephadex gel chromatography, separates molecules on basis of size. Smaller molecules enter a porous media and take longer to exit the column, hence larger particles leave the column first.  GPC is good for determining polymer molecular weight distribution, but is low [[resolution]].

== Affinity chromatography ==
[[Affinity chromatography]] is based on selective non-covalent interaction between an analyte and specific molecules. It is very specific, but not very [[robust]]. It is often used in biochemistry in the purification of [[protein]]s (or better: protein constructs). These constructs can be of [[fusion protein]]s with a so-called [[His-tag]], [[biotin|biotinylated]] or possibly [[antigen]]s. After purification some of these [[tag]]s are usually removed and the pure protein is obtained.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Clement Martyn Doke''' ([[1893]]-[[1980]]) was a [[South African]] [[linguist]] working mainly on [[African languages]]. A most prolific writer, he published a string of grammars, several dictionaries, comparative work, and a history of Bantu linguistics. Many of these works appeared while he was working in relative obscurity at the University of the Witwatersrand (1923-1953). He wrote on [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and other [[Bantu languages]], and was an early describer of [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]] and Bantu [[click consonant]]s, devising phonetic symbols for a number of them. Realizing that the grammatical structures of Bantu languages are quite different from those of European languages, he was one of the first African linguists of his time to abandon the Euro-centric approach to language description for a more locally grounded one.

Doke's report &quot;'Report on the unification of the Shona dialects&quot; (1931) was an attempt to resolve conflicts about the orthography of [[Shona language|Shona]].  Doke devised a unified orthography based on the Zezuru, Karanga and Manyika dialects.  However, Doke's orthography was never fully accepted and the South African government introduced an alternative, leaving Shona with two competing orthographies between 1935-1955.

In the early [[1940s]], Doke colloborated with Zulu [[poet]] and scholar [[Benedict Wallet Vilakazi]] to create a Zulu-English dictionary, published [[1948]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Carl Friedrich Michael Meinhof''' ([[July 23]],[[1857]]-[[February 11]],[[1944]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[linguist]] known as one of the first linguists to study African languages. In [[1905]] he became professor at the School of Oriental Studies in [[Berlin]].

He was most notable for the work that he did developing comparative grammar studies of the [[Bantu languages]]. He followed from the pioneering work of [[Wilhelm Heinrich Immanuel Bleek]] on Bantu grammar. In his work, Meinhof looked at the common Bantu languages such as [[Swahili]] and [[Zulu]] to determine similarities and differences. 

In his work, Meinhof looked at [[Grammatical gender|noun classes]] with all Bantu languages having at least 10 classes and with 22 classes of nouns existing throughout the Bantu languages, though his definition of noun class differs slightly from the accepted one. While no language has all 22, [[Sesotho]] has 18. Several Bantu languages have a noun class specifically for humans and the [[Fula language]] having one reserved for liquids.

Meinhof also looked at other African languages including the [[Kordofanian languages]], [[Bushman]], [[Khoikhoi]] and [[Hamitic]] languages. During his career, Meinhof published several books on African languages and made recordings of East African music in 1902 which was one of the first recordings made of traditional African music.

[[Category:1944 deaths|Meinhof&quot;word&quot; ''aboot''. Ironically, a monophthongized pronunciation of ''aboat'' is quite common in parts of the U.S. Upper Midwest, such as [[Minnesota]]. Anecdotally, the ''abuhwt'' vowels are heard in Ontario and further west, and the ''aboot'' vowels are heard in the Eastern provinces.

Diphthong raising is shared with many American dialects in the words ''writer''  and ''rider'', pronounced (approximately) as {{IPA|[ɹʌjɾəɹ]}} and {{IPA|[ɹajɾəɹ]}} ([[phonetic transcription]] in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]). Note that Canadian English shares with American English the phenomenon where {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} become {{IPA|[ɾ]}} after a vowel and before an unstressed vowel. Canadian raising preserves the voicelessness of {{IPA|/t/}} and the voicedness of {{IPA|/d/}} where it is etymologically appropriate, even where the contrast is lost in the consonant itself. 

Also heard is the variation in the pronunciation of the word ''can't'', in Ontario, it is said almost as ''canned'', whereas in the west, it becomes more like ''kahnt''.  The [[Northern cities vowel shift]] that is happening in Michigan also is heard to an extent in Southwestern Ontario, for example, Andy is pronounced {{IPA|[eəndi]}} or {{IPA|[ɪəndi]}}.

A recently identified feature (1995) found among many Canadians is a [[chain shift]] known as the Canadian Shift.  This is not found in the Atlantic Provinces, east of [[Quebec]]; it is only found in [[Ontario]] and further west.  For people with this shift, ''cot'' and ''caught'' merge in rounded {{IPA|[ɒ]}} position.  The {{IPA|/æ/}} of ''bat'' then moves down to {{IPA|[a]}}, while the {{IPA|/ɛ/}} of ''bet'' becomes {{IPA|[æ]}}, which is short-a in other accents.  This shift is still a relatively new phenomenon, so not all Canadians have it. Of the ones that do, not all have the last stage.  Canadians without the Shift typically pronounce ''cot'' and ''caught'' as an un-rounded {{IPA|[ɑ]}}, as in the western United States. 

There is a tendency to [[monophthong]]ize the long ''a'' and ''o'' sounds, resulting in {{IPA|[beːt]}} for ''bait'' and {{IPA|[boːt]}} for ''boat'' (though this occurs usually in rapid speech). Finally, the broad {{IPA|/ɑ/}} of foreign loan words in words like ''drama'' or ''Iraq'' are usually pronounced like the short ''a'' of ''bat'': {{IPA|/dɹæmə/, /ɪɹæk/}}.

Like American English, Canadian English is largely [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]]. This means it maintains the pronunciation of ''r'' before consonants. Rhoticity has been largely influenced by [[Hiberno-English]], [[Scottish English]], and [[West Country dialects|West Country English]].

Americans sometimes claim to be able to recognize some Canadians instantly by their use of the word [[eh]]. However, only a certain usage of ''eh'' (detailed in the article) is peculiar to Canada. It is common in southern [[Ontario]], the [[Maritimes]] and the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairie provinces]]. In some parts of the United States, American English exhibits features of Canadian English, including Canadian Raising and the use of eh. Canadian accents are sometimes detected among [[Michigan|Michiganders]], [[Minnesota|Minnesotans]], [[Western New York|Western New Yorkers]] and their northern fellows.

===Other variations===
[[Canada]] shares similarities with [[British English]] in pronouncing words like ''fragile'', ''fertile'', and ''mobile''. While [[American English]] pronounce them as {{IPA|[fɹædʒl̩]}}, {{IPA|[fɝɾl̩]}}, and {{IPA|[moʊbl̩]}}, Canadians pronounce them as the British do, sounding like {{IPA|/fɹædʒajl̩/}}, {{IPA|/moʊbajl̩/}} An exception is ''missile'', where the American and British versions are almost equal; the American pronunciation of ''fertile'' is also becoming very popular in Canada, even though the British pronunciation remains dominant.

In American English, words like ''semi'', ''anti'', and ''multi'' are often pronounced as {{IPA|/sɛmaj/}}, {{IPA|/æntaj/}}, and {{IPA|/mʌltaj/}}, whereas the British pronounce them like {{IPA|/sɛmi/}}, {{IPA|/ænti/}}, and so on. Canadians tend to prefer the British pronunciation of these words, though American pronunciation has made headway.

In Canada, the word ''premier'', as meant to be the leader of a provincial or territorial government, is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈpɹɛ.mjɛɹ]}}, {{IPA|[ˈpɹi.mjiɹ]}}, or {{IPA|[ˈpɹi.mjɛɹ]}} in most places&lt;!--, as opposed to the United States, where it is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈpɹɛ.miɹ]}}--&gt;. ''Premiere'', denoting a first performance, is pronounced the same in Canada as the rest of the world.

==Vocabulary== 

Where Canadian English shares vocabulary with other English dialects, it tends to share most with American English. For instance, automotive terminology in Canada is entirely American. Canadians may prefer the British term ''railway'' to the American ''railroad'', but most railway terminology in Canada follows American usage (e.g., ''ties'', as well as ''cars'' rather than ''sleepers'' and ''waggons''), although railway employees themselves say ''sleeper''.

Spoken Canadian English and American English are mutually intelligible with each other and much more readily understood and less fraught with differences than British English is to either of them.  However, some terms in standard Canadian English are shared with Commonwealth English, but ''not'' with American English. These include:

===Britishisms===
*''[[Tory]]'' for a supporter of the federal [[Conservative Party of Canada]], the historic [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] or a provincial Progressive Conservative party; the U.S. use of ''Tory'' to mean the Loyalists in the time of the [[American Revolution]] is unknown in Canada, where they are called [[United Empire Loyalists]].
*''solicitor'' and ''barrister'' for lawyers — although in Canada, a lawyer is usually referred to as a barrister and solicitor only in formal and professional usage; ''lawyer'', or ''counsel'' predominates in everyday contexts, and sometimes the American usage ''attorney'' is encountered. In England, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Wales, etc. the legal profession remains divided and the terms have a practical meaning and [[solicitor]] and [[barrister]] are two different people; in Canada, the same [[lawyer]] occupies both roles but will often use terms like ''Barrister and Solicitor'', or ''QC'' (Queen's Counsel, an honour given in some provinces for a certain level of experience or, be it said, service to the political party in office) as formal or official titles. Prior to the fusion of law and equity solicitors and attorneys practised, respectively, in the courts of law and equity. When the courts were fused, one of the two terms became superfluous; Americans chose &quot;attorney&quot;; the British, Canadians, Australians and New Zealanders chose &quot;solicitor,&quot; although one still hears &quot;attorney&quot; from time to time in Australia. In the Indian subcontinent, perplexingly, the term &quot;advocate&quot; is used — in Canada this would indicate a Quebec practitioner. 
*[[Back bacon]]: called in the U.S. ''Canadian bacon''
*''bum'' for the American ''butt''. The two words co-exist in Canadian English, and &quot;bum&quot; is most commonly used as a polite or childish euphemism. However, &quot;bum&quot; does not have the indecent character it retains in British and Australasian use. [[Robert Munsch]] found it necessary to change &quot;You are a bum&quot; to &quot;You are a toad&quot; in the British edition of his children's story ''The Paper Bag Princess''. And the 1940s United Church Young People's Union song &quot;There's not a bum in the Yonge Street Mission/...Put a nickel in the drum, save another dirty bum&quot; provokes considerable shock among fellow Methodists in other Commonwealth countries.
*''tin'' (as in ''tin of tuna'') rather than ''can.'', however, as elsewhere, the latter is used more often. 
*''[[arse]]'' is commonly used in Atlantic Canada and among older people in Ontario and to the west. West of the Ottawa river, ''ass'' is more idiomatic among younger people. 
*''serviette'': a table napkin. Considered a give-away of low-class antecedents in the UK and the U.S. and also generally in English Canada but sometimes in Canada assumed to be indicative of a knowledge of French and therefore sometimes to be heard among upper middle class people on that basis. 

Several lexical items come from British English, such as ''lieutenant'' ({{IPA|/lɛf-/}}) (used in the Canadian military: &quot;lootenant&quot; in the navy; &quot;leftenant&quot; in the army and airforce);  ''light standard'' (an obsolete British word for lamp-post, rarely used today). Several political terms are uniquely Canadian, including ''[[riding]]'' (a [[parliament]]ary constituency or electoral district).

===French Loanwords===
Like other dialects of English that exist in proximity to [[francophone]]s, [[French language|French]] [[loanword]]s have entered Canadian English, such as:
*''alcool'': grain [[alcohol]]; [[everclear (alcohol)|everclear]] (pronounced as if English, ''al-cool'')
*''[[CÉGEP]]'' (Collège d'enseignement général et professionnel): a two- or three-year pre-university or professional college (Quebec only)
*''[[dépanneur]]'': a corner store (convenience store), shortened to ''dep'' (Québec only)
*''[[poutine]]'': a dish where [[french fries]] (or chips) are topped with cheese [[curd]]s and covered with hot gravy (Quebec) or a dumpling filled with ground meat (Maritimes).
*''Society of Alcohols'': the [[Société des alcools du Québec]], a [[liquor]] store. Often called the SAQ (Pronounced ''sack'' or ''S-A-Q'') by anglophones. Formerly called the Regie (for Regie des alcools). (Québec only)
*''[[tuque]]'': a close-fitting woolen winter hat (sometimes spelled ''[[toque]]'', which is assimilated from a different kind of hat, or ''touque'').  [[American English]] would use the terms [[stocking-cap]], [[knit cap]] or [[watch cap]].
*historical and political terms such as ''[[voyageur]]'', ''[[Les Automatistes|Automatiste]]'', ''[[Quiet Revolution]]'', ''[[Parti Québécois|péquiste]]'', ''[[Bloc Québécois|bloquiste]]'' 

Often native French Canadian speakers will use [[calque]]s of French [[idiom]]s, so in Quebec it is relatively common of for both Anglophones and Francophones to &quot;close the light&quot; or to &quot;open the light&quot;, meaning to turn on or off the light in a room.  This was especially common in the [[Gaspé Peninsula]], where until recently Anglophones and Francophones lived in mixed communities for generations.  Similar [[calque]]s from other languages are found in English throughout Canada, particularly in BC and the Prairies where translated usages from European languages are common, whether inherited from parents or spoken by new immigrants.

===Some Distinctive Canadian English Terms===
Canadian English also has its own terms not found, or not widely used, in other variants of English. In [[1998]], [[Oxford University Press]] produced a Canadian English dictionary, after five years of lexicographical research, called ''The Canadian Oxford Dictionary''; a second edition was published in [[2004]]. It listed uniquely Canadian words and words borrowed from other languages, and surveyed spellings, such as whether ''colour'' or ''color'' was the most popular choice in common use. The list below includes some words that are not strictly unique to Canada, but are distinctive for their relatively widespread use there.

*[[Allophone (Canadian usage)|Allophone]]: a resident of Quebec who speaks a first language other than English or French. This is &quot;uniquely Canadian&quot; only in the sense that a word that only linguists use in English in other countries has come to be used by journalists and broadcasters, and then by the general public, in some parts of Canada.
*Biffy: outdoor toilet usually located over pit or a septic tank.  The Americanism &quot;john&quot; and the Britishism &quot;loo&quot; are relatively common in British Columbia.
*Big Smoke: lately co-opted by Toronto but originally and for a long time in [[British Columbia|BC]] and [[Alberta]] used ''only'' in reference to Vancouver, either with or without a definite article.  The origin of the term is not mill-smoke, as might be guessed at first, but from the use of &quot;smoke&quot; in the Chinook Jargon to mean rain and/or fog (of which Vancouver has plenty)
*Blochead: (derogatory term) a member of the [[Bloc Québécois]]
*[[Butter tart]]: a single-serving sweet pie, often with raisins; very like pecan pie, minus the pecans - but in Canada a single-serving pecan pie is called a &quot;butter tart with pecans&quot;.
*[[Concession road]]; in southern Ontario and southern Quebec, one of a set of roads laid out by the colonial government as part of the distribution of land in standard lot sizes. The roads were laid out in squares as nearly as possible equal to 1,000 acres (that is, one and a quarter miles square). In Ontario, many roads are still called ''lines''.
*[[couch|Chesterfield]] (also [[Northern California]]n English and [[British English]]): a sofa, couch, or loveseat[http://www.bartleby.com/61/94/C0279400.html] 
*Dayliner: a [[Budd Rail Diesel Car]], a self-propelled diesel passenger railcar, typically called a &quot;Budd Car&quot;
*Double-double: a cup of coffee with two creams and two sugars (especially, but not exclusively, from [[Tim Hortons]])
*Eavestroughs (also Northern &amp; Western U.S.): grooves or channels that attach to the underside of the roof of a house to collect rainwater. Known to most Americans and to Britons as [[gutter]]s.
*[[Family Compact]]: a group of influential [[family compact|families]] who exercised substantial political control of [[Ontario]] during part of the [[1800]]s.  The Quebec equivalent was the [[Chateau Clique]]
*[[Garburator]]: a garbage disposal unit located beneath the drain of a kitchen sink.
*Gettone (in [[Toronto]] and environs): [[foosball]]; pronounced roughly as in [[Italian language|Italian]]
*Grit: a member or supporter of one of the federal or provincial [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] parties (but ''not'' the [[Parti libéral du Québec]])
*Joe job: a low-class, low-paying job. Not to be confused with the American term [[joe job]].
*Keener: an enthusiastic student, not necessarily a positive term
*[[Kokanee (fish)|Kokanee]]: British Columbian name for a species of land-locked salmon (accent on first syllable). Also the name of a [[Kokanee beer|popular beer]] made in the [[Kootenay]] district, aka &quot;Blue Cocaine&quot;. 
*[[Kraft Dinner]]: often shortened to ''KD'', known in the U.S. as [[Kraft Macaroni and Cheese]]
*[[Loonie]] and [[toonie]]: Canadian one- and two-dollar coins. Derived from the use of the [[Loon|loon]] on the Canadian dollar coin.
*Loser cruiser: public transit, i.e. the bus.  Usually only used by owners of vehicles when speaking disparagingly of transit riders.
*[[Nanaimo bar]]: a confection named for the town of [[Nanaimo, British Columbia]] and made of egg custard with a Graham-cracker-based bottom and a thin layer of chocolate on top; however, this term is now common in the United States and elsewhere, thanks to the efforts of [[Starbucks]] in popularizing them.
*Navvy Jack - the name for the top grade of washed pea gravel in the hardware/landscaping business in [[British Columbia]].  Named for the first white settler in West Vancouver, a British &quot;[[navvy]]&quot; who supplied this type of gravel to the growing communities of Burrard Inlet.
*[[Parkade]]: parking garage
*[[Quiggly hole]] and Quiggly town: remains of First Nations underground houses in the Interior of [[British Columbia]]
*[[Robertson screwdriver|Robertson]]: a Canadian square-headed screw or [[screwdriver]].  While this is used outside the country for that screw head type, the screws are much less common.
*Runners: running shoes; sneakers
*Shit disturber: a person who tends to create controversy or chaos
*[[Sugar pie]]: A pie made with maple-sugar filling, similar to a [[butter tart]] and a staple in Québécois home cooking.  
*[[Ski-Doo]]: a brand name now used generically to refer to any [[snowmobile]].  Can also be used as a verb.
*Snowbird: a Canadian who spends the winter in the States (often [[Florida]]).  Often retired.  Also the name of [[Snowbirds|the Canadian Forces aerobatics team]].
*[[Timbits]]: a brand name of doughnut holes made by [[Tim Hortons]] that has become a generic term
*Trousseau tea: a reception held by the mother of a bride, for neighbours not invited to the wedding
*[[Tuque]]: a knit winter hat that covers the head and ears (called a &quot;ski hat&quot;, &quot;watch cap&quot;, &quot;stocking cap&quot;, or &quot;beanie&quot; in American English)
*Newfie: A colloquial term used to discribe one who is from Newfoundland and Labrador.
*[[Pickerel]]: This is a mis-used slang word for [[Walleye]]. [[pickerel]] are actually a number of species that are members of the [[Esox]] family, commonly called the pike family, while [[walleye]] is a member of the [[Percidae]] family. 
*[[Canuck]]: A a slang term for &quot;Canadian&quot; in American English and Canadian English. It sometimes means &quot;French Canadian&quot; in particular, especially when used in the Northeast of the United States and in Canada.



The [[Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie]] &quot;Take off to the Great White North&quot; comedy routines, popular in both the U.S. and Canada in the early [[1980]]s, drew heavily on linguistic differences such as pronunciation (such as ''Trawna'' for Toronto or ''brudle'' for brutal) as well as once-obscure historical terms such as ''hoser'' or ''hosehead'' (originally used to refer to gas [[siphon]]ing on the [[Canadian Prairies|prairies]] in the [[Great Depression|depression]] era).

===Variations between Canadian and American lexicons===
There are a few meaning differences between Canadian and American English; for example, to table a document in Canada is to present it, whereas in the U.S. it means to withdraw it from consideration. Also, a 'rubber' in the U.S. and Canada is slang for a condom; however, in Canada it is sometimes also another term for 'eraser' (as it is in [[England]]) and for overshoes.  In the same vein is &quot;pissed&quot;, which in the U.S. means &quot;angry&quot; but in Canada means &quot;drunk&quot;; the Canadian equivalent to the American usage most often requires the context &quot;pissed off&quot;, although the &quot;off&quot; is not mandatory.  Similarly, &quot;pissed up&quot; means ''(got) drunk'' and the phrase &quot;it was a real piss-up&quot; means that everybody involved became really inebriated.

Canadians mostly use the term 'gasoline', rather than the [[United Kingdom|British]] term 'petrol'. Gasoline prices require some awkward [[translation]] between Canadian and American figures. Even before the [[metrication]] efforts of the [[1970]]s, the translation of &quot;dollars per gallon&quot; required not only replacing Canadian vs. American [[currency|currencies]] but also a conversion between Imperial (4.5 [[litre|L]]) vs. U.S. (3.8 [[liter|L]]) [[gallon]]s.

When pronouncing letters of the alphabet, Canadians almost invariably use the Anglo-European (and French) &quot;zed&quot; rather than the American &quot;zee&quot; for the letter [[Z]]. Canadian students add &quot;grade&quot; before their grade level, instead of after it as is the usual, but not sole, American practice. For example, a student in the &quot;10th grade&quot; in the U.S. would be in &quot;Grade 10&quot; in Canada. (Quebec anglophones may instead say &quot;sec 5&quot; (secondary 5) for Grade 11.)  It should also be noted that in Canada, the specific high school grade (eg. Grade 9 or Grade 12) or university year is stated and not the American terms &quot;freshman&quot; or &quot;sophomore&quot;.  Also, while in the United States the term &quot;college&quot; refers to post-secondary education in general, the term &quot;college&quot; has a different meaning in Canada. It refers to either a post-secondary technical or vocational institution, or to one of the colleges that exist as individual institutions within some Canadian universities. Most often, a &quot;college&quot; is a community college, not a university. It may also refer to a [[CÉGEP]] in Quebec. In Canada a &quot;college student&quot; might denote someone obtaining a diploma in plumbing while &quot;university student&quot; is the term for someone earning a [[bachelor's degree]].  Still, &quot;going to college&quot; has the same meaning as &quot;going to university&quot;, unless someone is being specific about which level of post-secondary education they are referring to.

There is also greater resistance to turning nouns into verbs in Canada. Until recently, many Canadian teachers rejected the verb ''to contact''.

Adoption of [[SI|metric]] units is more advanced in Canada than in the U.S. due to governmental efforts during the [[Pierre Trudeau|Trudeau]] era; Canadians still often use pounds, feet and inches to measure themselves; cups, teaspoons and tablespoons in the kitchen; and miles per gallon instead of litres per 100km for fuel efficiency; but outdoor temperatures, groceries, fuel and highway speeds/distances are almost always given in metric figures.

===Chinook Jargon words in British Columbia===
British Columbia English has several words still in current use which are loanwords from the [[Chinook Jargon]], which was widely spoken throughout the province by all ethnicities well into the middle of the 20th Century.  Granted these originally came from the lower Columbia River (for the most part) but the Jargon came to B.C. before the mainland colony was declared and the development of the Jargon in the form it spread to here as is the direct result of British influence (the HBC's activity) in the region.  These words tend to be shared with, but are not as common in, the states of [[Oregon]], [[Washington]], [[Alaska]] and, to a lesser degree, [[Idaho]] and western [[Montana]].  The most famous of these words, and probably the most popular still, is ''skookum'', which was used in the [[Chinook Jargon|Jargon]] either as a verb auxiliary for ''to be able'' or an adjective for ''able, strong, big, genuine, reliable'' - which sums up its use in BC English, although there are a wide range of possible usages: a ''skookum house'' is a jail or prison (''house'' in the [[Chinook Jargon|Jargon]] could mean anything from a building to a room.  &quot;He's a skookum guy&quot; means that the person is solid and reliable while &quot;we need somebody who's skookum&quot; means that a strong and large person is needed.  A carpenter, after banging a stud into place, might check it or refer to it as &quot;yeah, that's skookum&quot;.  Asking for affirmation, someone might say &quot;is that skookum&quot; or &quot;is that skookum with you?&quot;  ''Skookum'' can also be translated simply as &quot;O.K.&quot; but it means something a bit more emphatic.  

Other [[Chinook Jargon|Jargon]] words in BC English include ''chuck'', originally meaning water or any fluid but adapted into English to refer to bodies of water, particularly &quot;the saltchuck&quot; in reference to salt water.  In combination with ''skookum'' the compound word ''skookumchuck'', meaning a rapids (lit. &quot;strong water&quot;), is found in three placenames although not used with its true meaning in ordinary speech.  ''Chuck'' and ''saltchuck'', however, remain common, even in local broadcast English.   

There's also &quot;high muckamuck&quot; and even its proper form &quot;hyas muckamuck&quot; (high-ass), and the variant &quot;high mucketymuck&quot;; &quot;high mucketymuck/muckamuck&quot; has spread far beyond the Pacific Northwest, and meaning a big boss, a high poohbah, and while literally meaning &quot;big feed&quot; or &quot;important banquet&quot;, potentially meaning even a fullblown [[potlatch]] - another very BC word, by the way - in English it has a sense of &quot;the guys at the head table&quot; since &quot;muckamuck&quot; or &quot;a feed&quot; is in the same vein in non-city BC English as &quot;grub&quot; or &quot;a meal/dinner&quot;.  &quot;Quiggly hole&quot; or &quot;quiggly&quot; referst to the remains of an old Indian pit-house, or underground house, from &quot;kickwillie&quot; or &quot;kekuli&quot;, which in the Jargon means &quot;down&quot; or &quot;underneath&quot; or &quot;beneath&quot;.

In northern BC and the [[Yukon]], and used in broadcast English in those areas, the Chinook Jargon adaption of the French ''merci'' remains common, i.e. ''mahsi'' or ''masi'', with the accent on the first syllable (unlike in French).

==Regional variation in pronunciation==

===Toronto===
The English spoken in [[Toronto]] is closely related to the midwestern American accent, but without the [[Northern cities vowel shift]]. Slang terms used in Toronto are synonymous with those used in other major North American  cities. There is also a heavy influx of slang terminology originating from Toronto's many immigrant communities, of which the vast majority speak English only as a second or minor language. These terms originate mainly from various European, Asian and African words. Many Torontonians  use ''buddy'' (without a capital) as it is often used in Newfoundland English &amp;#8211; as equivalent to ''that man'' (''I like buddy's car.'').

===Maritimes===
[[Canadian Maritimes|Maritimer]] English quirks include the removal of pre-consonantal [ɹ] sounds, and a faster speech tempo. It is heavily influenced by both British and Irish English.

An example of typical Maritime English might be the pronunciation of the word &quot;battery.&quot;  In American English (and also Western Canadian English) the word would be pronounced &quot;bad-der-y&quot;, but (sometimes) &quot;bat-try&quot; in the Maritimes which follows the British pronunciation. The letter &quot;T&quot; is strongly pronounced in general, but always lightly. It is rare for the &quot;T&quot; at the end of a word to receive a &quot;D&quot; pronunciation.

While the stereotypical Canadian interrogative &quot;Eh?&quot; is used more often in the Maritimes than it would be in the U.S., it is actually quite rare compared to Western Canada.  Alternatively, one might hear the interrogative &quot;Right?&quot; which is in turn used as an adverb (e.g.: &quot;It was right foggy today!&quot;) as well. &quot;Some&quot; can be used as an adverb as well, in certain circles (e.g.: &quot;This cake is some good!&quot;).

The second syllable of &quot;about&quot; is pronounced {{IPA|[ʌʊ]}} rather than RP {{IPA|[aʊ]}}. The main distinction between Canadian (Prairie) pronunciation of this diphthong is in its resolution. Namely, an American pronunciation resolves the ''a''-sound {{IPA|[ɶ]}} (or, alternatively, the schwa sound ({{IPA|[ə]}})) &lt;!-- resolves with an ''oo''-sound [u], (''a bah oo t''); --&gt;, whereas the Canadian pronunciation resolves with an ''oh''-sound {{IPA|[ɔ]}} (''a bah oh t'').  One might hear the term &quot;Out and about&quot; being pronounced as &quot;Oat in a boat&quot; in the Maritimes.

British terms are very much still a part of Maritime English, although slowly fading away in favour of American or Western terms.  &quot;Chesterfield&quot; and &quot;front room&quot; are examples of this.

[[Cape Breton Island]] has a [[Cape Breton accent|distinct dialect]] due to settlement by speakers of [[Acadian French]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]].

===Newfoundland===
The province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], which was an autonomous dominion until [[March 31]], [[1949]], has its own [[dialect]] distinct from the rest of Canadian English. See [[Newfoundland English]].

===Quebec===
English is a minority language in Quebec, but has many speakers in Montréal, the [[Eastern Townships]] and in the [[Gatineau]]-[[Ottawa]] region.

Among Montréal-native anglophones, there is a distinction between /æ/ and /a/, unique in Canada, so that ''Mary'' and ''merry'' are not homophones.

Among Eastern Townships-native anglophones, ''syrup'' is often pronounced as ''sir-rup''.

A short ''a'' is used in words like ''drama''; in common with most Canadians, Québécois and Ontarians pronounce words of foreign origin (Datsun, Mazda, etc.) as if the vowels are French.

===Ontario===
The [[Canadian raising]] is often quite strong in [[Ontario]]. Many speakers in Ontario and the provinces further west have a new [[chain shift]] called the [[Canadian Shift]].

In southwestern Ontario (especially rural areas), some speakers also have aspects of the Midwestern U.S. accent, e.g. ''not'' sounds like ''naht'' ({{IPA|/nɔt/}} → /nat/), combined with Canadian raising (see U.S. below). The accent is slightly modified to signify sarcasm or emphasis: ''not'' becomes a heavily stressed ''nat'', for example, and ''hockey'' may sound like ''hackey'' (with an ''æ'').

Use of the interrogative &quot;[[Eh]]?&quot; is widespread.

Intervocalic ''s'' {{IPA|–}} is more frequently voiced in words such as ''resource''. A short ''a'' is used in words like ''drama''; in common with most Canadians, Québécois and Ontarians pronounce words of foreign origin (Datsun, Mazda, etc.) as if the vowels are French. Many Ontarians do not pronounce, or give very little emphasis to the second ''t'' in ''[[Toronto]]'' (hence, ''Toronno'').

In Central Ontario (that is, the region around [[Toronto]]) in particular, the voiced ''th'' and ''d'' are often not distinguished, the two pronunciations frequently appearing together (&quot;Do you want this one or dis one?&quot;, for example). Sometimes (particularly in [[North York]], see the above section), the ''th'' is dropped altogether, resulting in &quot;Do you want this one er'iss one?&quot; The word southern is often pronounced as 'sow-thern' as opposed to 'suth-ern'. Most accents, of course, are quite subtle, and most immaterial to detailed speech. In the regional area north of York and south of Parry Sound, notably among those who were born in these bedroom communities (Barrie, Vaughn, Orillia, Bradford, Newmarket) as opposed to those who moved there to commute, the cutting down of syllables is often heard, e.g. &quot;prolly&quot; instead of &quot;probably&quot; (as in a response).

The [[Ottawa valley]] has its own distinct accent, known as the [[Ottawa Valley Twang]].

===Prairies===
A strong [[Canadian raising]] exists in the [[Canadian Prairies|prairie regions]] together with certain older usages such as ''chesterfield'' and ''front room'' also associated with the Maritimes. Aboriginal Canadians are a larger and more conspicuous population in prairie cities than elsewhere in the country and certain elements of aboriginal speech in English are widely to be heard.  Similarly, the linguistic legacy, mostly intonation, of the Scandinavian, Slavic and German settlers who are far more numerous in the Prairies than in Ontario or the Maritimes can be heard in the general milieu.  Again, the large Metis population in Saskatchewan also carries with it certain linguistic traits inherited from French, aboriginal and Celtic forebears.

===British Columbia===

There have been no formal studies of English pronunciation in [[British Columbia]], although locals note variations between certain towns.  Parts of the [[Interior Plateau|Interior]] have a strong cowboy twang or drawl - elongated vowels and diphthongs - rooted in the family legacies of American settlement during the province's frontier era.  British accents and a wide range of European and Asian second-language flavoured English have always been common, to the point of the British flavour being identifiably a hallmark of early 20th century BC, as has been English as spoken by [[First Nations]] peoples, which is distinct as an accent but also remains undocumented.

'''Czech''' (''Čeština'') is one of the West [[Slavic languages]], along with [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Pomeranian language|Pomeranian]] (extinct), and Lusatian [[Sorbian language|Sorbian]]. It is spoken by most people in the [[Czech Republic]] and by Czechs all over the world (about 12 million native speakers in total). Czech is very close to Slovak and, to a lesser degree, to Polish. Most adult Czechs and Slovaks are able to understand each other without difficulty as they were routinely exposed to both languages on the national TV and radio until the [[Velvet Divorce|splitting of Czechoslovakia]]. People born after circa 1985 may have difficulty grasping the few words that differ significantly, or understanding fast spoken language.

Because of its complexity, Czech is said to be a difficult [[language]] to learn. The complexity is due to extensive [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and highly free word order. As in all Slavic languages (except [[Bulgarian language|modern Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]), many words (especially nouns, verbs, and adjectives) have many forms ([[inflection]]s).  In this regard, Czech and the Slavic languages are closer to their [[Indo-European language|Indo-European]] origins than other languages in the same family that have lost much inflection. Moreover, in Czech the rules of morphology are extremely irregular and many forms have official, [[colloquial]] and sometimes semi-official variants.  The word order serves similar function as emphasis and articles in English. Often all the [[permutation]]s of words in a [[clause]] are possible. While the permutations mostly share the same meaning, it is nevertheless different, because the permutations differ in the [[topic-focus articulation]]. As an example we can show: ''Češi udělali revoluci''
(The Czechs made a revolution), ''Revoluci udělali Češi'' (It was the Czechs who made the revolution), and ''Češi revoluci udělali'' (The Czechs did make a revolution).

The [[phonology]] of Czech may also be very difficult for speakers of other languages. For example, some words do not appear to have [[vowel]]s: ''zmrzl'' (froze to death), ''ztvrdl'' (hardened), ''scvrkl'' (shrunk), ''čtvrthrst'' (quarter-handful), ''blb'' (fool), ''vlk'' (wolf), and ''smrt'' (death). A popular example of this is the phrase &quot;''strč prst skrz krk''&quot; meaning &quot;stick a finger through your throat&quot;. The [[consonant|consonants]] ''l'' and ''r'', however, function as [[sonorant]]s and thus fulfill the role of a vowel (a similar phenomenon also occurs in American English, for example ''bird'' is pronounced as [brd] with a syllabic r). It also features the consonant ''ř'', a [[phoneme]] that is said to be unique to Czech and quite difficult for foreigners to pronounce. To a foreign ear, it sounds very similar to ''zh'', though a better approximation could be rolled (trilled) ''r'' combined with ''zh'', which was incidentally sometimes used as an [[orthography]] for this sound (rž) for example in the royal charter of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]] from [[1609]].

==Morphology==

===Parts of speech===
&lt;!-- give an English translation of each of these --&gt;

*[[Noun]] (''podstatné jméno'')
*[[Adjective]] (''přídavné jméno'')
*[[Pronoun]] (''zájmeno'')
*[[Numeral]] (''číslovka'')
*[[Verb]] (''sloveso'')
*[[Adverb]] (''příslovce'')
*[[Preposition]] (''předložka'')
*[[Grammatical conjunction|Conjunction]] (''spojka'')
*[[Grammatical particle|Particle]] (''částice'')
*[[Interjection]] (''citoslovce'')

Nouns, adjectives, pronouns and numbers are declined (7 cases over a number of declension models) and verbs are conjugated; the other parts of speech are not inflected (with the exception of comparative formation in adverbs).

===Dialects===

In the Czech Republic three distinct [[koine]], or interdialects can be found, all corresponding more or less to geographic areas within the country. They differ from standard Czech, creating some form of [[diglossia]]. The first, and most widely used, is &quot;Common Czech&quot;, spoken in [[Bohemia]]. It has some grammatical differences from &quot;standard&quot; Czech, along with some differences in pronunciation.  The most common pronunciation changes include ''-ý'' becoming ''-ej'' in some circumstances, ''-é'' becoming ''-ý-'' in some circumstances (''-ej-'' in others), and the insertion of prothetic ''v-'' at the beginning of some words starting with ''o-''.  Also, noun declension is changed, most notably the instrumental case.  Instead of having various endings (depending on gender) in the instrumental, Bohemians will just put ''-ama'' or ''-ma'' at the end of all plural instrumental declensions. Also pronunciation changes slightly, as the Bohemians tend to have more open vowels than Moravians. This is said to be especially prevalent among people from Prague.

The second major interdialect is spoken in [[Moravia]]. This dialect has some totally different words from standard Czech. Unlike in Bohemia, Moravia tends to have more local dialects varying from town to town. For example in Brno, ''tramvaj'' (streetcar or tram) is ''šalina'' (originating from German &quot;ElektriSCHELINIE&quot;). Everyday spoken form in Moravia would be a mixture of given interdialect, remnants of old local dialect, some Standard Czech forms and sometimes also Common Czech. The use of Standard Czech in everyday situations is more frequent than in Bohemia and Moravians tend to say that they use &quot;proper&quot; language, unlike their Bohemian brothers.

The third major dialect - [[Teshen Silesian dialect|Teshen Silesian]] - is spoken in [[Silesia]], centered around the city [[Ostrava]].  This dialect, too, is grammatically sound and closer to Standard Czech, but in this dialect people speak very quickly, and the long vowels become the same as their short counterparts.

===Declension===
&lt;!-- give the number of declensions and tables of all their affixes/mutations/whatever (or just some example ones if they are very numerous)  or put the tables in a Czech grammar article if you want to start one or if one already has been started)--&gt;

The noun cases are typically referred to by number, and learned by means of the question to which they are the answer.  When learning a new word, children recite the cases using a set of example phrases, shown as follows:
# ''kdo/co?'' (who/what?) - [[Nominative]]
# ''bez koho/čeho?'' (without whom/what?) - [[Genitive]]
# ''komu/čemu?'' (to whom/what?) - [[Dative]]
# ''vidím koho/co?'' (I see whom/what?) - [[Accusative case|Accusative]]
# ''volám'' (I call) [[Vocative]]
# ''o kom/čem?'' (about whom/what?) - [[Locative]] (also known as Prepositional)
# ''s kým/čím?'' (with whom/what?) - [[Instrumental case|Instrumental]]

The case used depends on a number of variables, and for foreigners can be very confusing.

The simplest of the rules governing noun declension is the use of [[prepositions]] (''předložky'').  Excepting expressions and common phrases, each preposition is matched with a certain noun declension case depending on use.  The following are basic examples of common prepositions and their corresponding noun cases (note: these examples represent only one circumstance.  Often each preposition can be used with two or more noun cases depending on the sentence).

Genitive: ''během'' (during), ''podle/dle'' (according to/along), ''vedle'' (beside), ''kolem'' (around), ''okolo'' (around), ''do'' (into), ''od'' (away from), ''z'' (out of), ''bez'' (without).

Dative: ''k'' (towards), ''proti'' (against), ''díky'' (thanks to), &quot;naproti&quot; (opposite).

Accusative: ''skrz'' (through), ''pro'' (for) &quot;na&quot; (to/for).

Locative/Prepositional: ''o'' (around, about), ''na'' (on), ''při'' (into, in, around), ''v'' (in), ''po'' (after, around).

Instrumental: ''za'' (behind), ''před'' (in front of), ''mezi'' (between), ''pod'' (below), ''s'' (with) &quot;nad&quot; (above).

Many of the above prepositions are used in different circumstances.  For instance, when motion or a change of position is expressed, prepositions like ''nad, mezi, na, pod'', etc. are used with the accusative case.  

The second factor affecting noun declension is the verb used.  In Czech grammar, the Accusative case serves as the direct object, and the Dative case serves as the indirect object.  Some verbs require the Genitive case to be used.  For example the verb to ask &quot;zeptat se&quot; requires that the person being asked the question be in the genitive case (Zeptat se koho/čeho), and that the thing being asked about follow the preposition &quot;na&quot; and be in the accusative case (Zeptat se koho/čeho na koho/co).

The third factor affecting noun declension is number.  The Czech language has a very complex counting system, explained as follows with the example masculine animate noun ''muž'' (man):

For the number one, the singular number is of course used: ''jeden muž''.

For the numbers 2, 3, and 4, any case may be used, depending on the function of the noun in the sentence: ''dva muži'' (nominative).  &quot;Vidím dva muže&quot; (accusative). 

For all numbers from 5 to infinity, the genitive plural is used when the noun would normally be in the nominative, accusative or vocative case: ''pět mužů''.  &quot;Pět mužů je tam.&quot;  Five men are over there.  &quot;Vidím pět mužů.&quot;  I see five men.  For other cases, however, the noun is not placed in the genitive. &quot;Nad pěti muži.&quot;  Above the five men (instrumental). 

Numbers also have declension patterns in Czech.  The number two, for instance, declines as follows:
Dva/dvě: nominative
Dvou: genitive
Dvěma: dative
Dva/dvě: accusative
(o) dvou: locative
Dvěma: instrumental

The numbers are singular (''jednotné číslo''), plural (''množné číslo''), and remains of [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]].  The dual number is used for only several parts of the human body, of which each person has two: hands, shoulders, eyes, ears, knees, legs, breasts.  In all but two of the above body parts (eyes and ears) the dual number is only vestigial and affects very few aspects of declension (mostly the genitive and prepositional cases).

The [[grammatical gender|genders]] are masculine animate, masculine inanimate, feminine, and neuter.  Masculine animate is used only to describe living things (note: plants are not considered animate in Czech noun declension!).  Strangely enough, there are hundreds of words for living things that are not masculine words (for example ''morče'' is a neuter word, and means &quot;guinea-pig&quot;).

===Software===
Coding of Czech letters with diacritical marks (especially those with a ''[[háček]]'', e.g., č, ě, š, ř, and ž) is not uniform and sometimes causes incorrect display and printing of texts. The following sentence is commonly used to test all special characters: '''Příliš žluťoučký kůň úpěl ďábelské ódy''' (&quot;a too yellow horse moaned devilish odes&quot;; needs to be tested with lower- and uppercase).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The outer shell of a [[virus (biology)|virus]] is called the '''capsid'''. It consists of several monomeric subunits made of [[protein]]. The capsid serves three main purposes :

* It protects the [[genetic material]] of the virus.
* It determines if a [[cell (biology)|cell]] is suitable for [[infection]].
* It starts the actual infection by attaching and &quot;opening&quot; the target cell and injecting the genetic material of the virus into the cell.

Once the virus has infected the cell, it will sooner or later start replicating itself, using the &quot;infrastructure&quot; of the infected cell. During this process, the capsid subunits are synthesized according to the genetic material of the virus, using the [[protein biosynthesis]] mechanism of the cell. Some viruses will also take a portion of the host cell's [[cell membrane]] with them when they depart, enclosing the proteinaceous capsid with viral proteins projecting through it.

The majority of viruses come in three different structures; [[helical]] capsids, [[icosahedral]] (isometric) capsids, or enveloped. In helical symmetry, the protein subunits are arranged around the [[circumference]] of a circle to form a disk. In icosahedral symmetry, the subunits form a quasi-spherical structure. In enveloped viruses, the protein subunits are exposed to the external environment.

'''Chloramphenicol''' (or '''2,2-dichlor-N-[(aR,bR)-b-hydroxy-a-hydroxymethyl-4-nitrophenethyl]acetamide''') is an [[antibiotic]] that was derived from the [[bacterium]] ''[[Streptomyces venezuelae]]'' and is now produced synthetically. Chloramphenicol is effective against a wide variety of microorganisms, but due to serious side-effects (e.g., damage to the [[bone marrow]], including [[aplastic anemia]]) in humans, it is usually reserved for the treatment of serious and life-threatening [[infection]]s (e.g., [[typhoid fever]]).
  
Regardless of serious side-effects, the WHO advocates its use in many third world countries for pediatric treatment in the absence of cheaper alternatives.  It is used in treatment of [[cholera]], as it destroys the [[vibrio]]s and decreases the [[diarrhea]]. It is effective against [[tetracycline]]-resistant [[vibrio]]s.

It is also used in [[eye drop]]s or [[ointment]], commonly sold under the name of Chlorsig, to treat bacterial [[conjunctivitis]]. 
 
== Mechanism and Resistance ==
Chloramphenicol stops bacterial growth by binding to the bacterial [[ribosome]] (blocking peptidyl transferase) and inhibiting [[Translation (genetics)|protein synthesis]]. 

Resistance to chloramphenicol is conferred by the ''cat''-gene. This [[gene]] codes for an [[enzyme]] called &quot;[[chloramphenicol acetyltransferase]]&quot; which inactivates chloramphenicol by covalently linking one or two [[acetyl]] groups, derived from acetyl-S-coenzyme A, to the [[hydroxyl]] groups on the chloramphenicol. The acetylation prevents chloramphenicol from binding to the ribosome. 
 
==Codes==
It has many different codings in the [[Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System]]:
* {{ATC|D06|AX02}}
* {{ATC|D10|AF03}}
* {{ATC|G01|AA05}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''cut-up technique''' is a [[aleatory]] [[literary technique]] or [[literary genre|genre]] in which a [[text]] is cut up at [[random]] and rearranged to create a new text.

==Technique==
The '''cut-up''' and the closely associated '''fold-in''' techniques are literary writing styles that tries to break the [[linearity]] of common literature. They are designed to be used with common [[typewriter]]s.

*''Cut-up'' is performed by taking a finished and fully linear text (printed on paper) and cutting it in pieces with a few or single words on each piece. The resulting pieces are then rearranged into a new text. The rearranging work often result in surprisingly innovative new phrases. A common way is to cut a sheet in four rectangular sections, rearranging them and then typing down the mingled prose while compensating for the haphazard word breaks by improvising and innovating along the way.
*''Fold-in'' is the technique of taking two different sheets of linear text (with the same linespacing), cutting each sheet in half and combining with the other, then reading across the resulting page. The resulting text is often a blend of the two themes, somewhat hard to read.

==History==
The first recorded instance of a cut-up dates from a [[Dada]] rally in the [[1920s]]: [[Tristan Tzara]] offered to create a [[poem]] on the spot by pulling words at [[random]] from a hat. A riot ensued and [[André Breton]] expelled Tzara from the movement. 

In the [[1950s]] painter and writer [[Brion Gysin]] more fully developed the cut-up method after accidentally discovering it. He had placed layers of [[newspaper]]s as a matt to protect a tabletop from being scratched while he cut papers with a [[razor blade]]. Upon cutting through the newspapers, Gysin noticed that the sliced layers offered interesting [[juxtaposition]]s. He began deliberately cutting newspaper articles into sections, which he randomly rearranged. ''[[Minutes to Go]]'' resulted from his initial cut-up experiment: unedited and unchanged cut-ups which emerged as coherent and meaningful prose.

Gysin introduced writer [[William S. Burroughs]] to the technique at the [[Beat Hotel]]. The pair later applied the technique to printed media and [[audio recording]]s in an effort to decode the material's implicit content, [[Hypothesis|hypothesizing]] that such a technique could be used to discover the true meaning of a given [[text]].  Burroughs also suggested cut-ups may be effective as a form of [[divination]] saying, ''Perhaps events are pre-written and pre-recorded and when you cut word lines the future leaks out.'' Burroughs further developed the ''fold-in'' technique.

Burroughs has cited earlier works as proto-cut-ups: [[T.S. Eliot]]'s long poem, ''[[The Waste Land]]'', and portions of [[John Dos Passos]]' works.

==Literary influence==
[[William S. Burroughs|Burroughs]] taught cut-up technique to [[Genesis P-Orridge]] in [[1971]] as a method for &amp;quot;altering reality&amp;quot;. Burroughs' explanation was that everything is recorded, and if it is recorded, then it can be edited (P-Orridge, [[2003]]). P-Orridge has long employed cut-ups as an applied [[philosophy]], a way of creating [[art]] and [[music]], and of conducting one's life.

==Musical influence and similarities==
From at least the early [[1970s]], [[David Bowie]] has used cut-ups to create some of his [[lyric]]s. It is a technique which came to influence [[Kurt Cobain]]'s songwriting.

Other musicians working in [[sampling (music)|sample]]-based [[music genre]]s, such as [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[electronic music]], employ a similar technique. [[Disc jockey|DJs]] may spend hours in record stores looking (&amp;quot;digging&amp;quot;) for [[Vinyl record|LP records]] featuring obscure or interesting [[breaks]], vocals, and other fragments to meld together in new compositions. Some have suggested these practices are a form of cut-ups, but most such musicians are probably unaware of Tzara, Burroughs or Gysin ([[DJ Spooky]] being an exception). [[Musique concrète]] had introduced such techniques &amp;mdash; cutting, re-arranging and re-editing sounds &amp;mdash; much earlier in a musical (as opposed to literary) context.

[[Jeff Noon]] uses a similar ''remixing'' technique in his writing based on the practices prevalent in [[Dub music]].  He expanded upon his remixing with his [[Cobralingus]] system, which breaks down a piece of writing, going as far as turning individual words into anagrams, then melding the results into a narrative.

And to return to Tzara's Dadaist example, [[Thom Yorke]] applied a similar method in [[Radiohead]]'s ''[[Kid A]]'' (2000) album, writing single lines, putting them into a hat, and drawing them out at random while the band rehearsed the songs.

An online subculture of [[bastard pop]] resembles the fold-in technique by for example taking instrumentals from one artist and combining it with the vocals of another artist.

==Email cut-ups==
A recent phenomenon is an [[e-mail spam]] tactic in which randomly-generated text passages are used to thwart [[Bayesian filtering|Bayesian filters]]. For example,

:''The first question of course was, how to get dry again:  they me as I walked, the remembrance of my churlishness and that I must confidence between himself and Mrs. Micawber.  After which, he for his dagger till his hand gripped it. Then he spoke. I kissed her, and my baby brother, and was very sorry then; but not''

Even grammatically consistent sentences can be formed, such as

:''Then, from sea to shining sea, the God-King sang the praises of teflon, and with his face to the sunshine, he churned lots of butter.''

Such text is called spamoetry (spam poetry) or [[spam art]].  Since the text is often derived from actual books, this is effectively a cut-up method (though the perpetrators may be unaware of this).

'''Cretinism''' (most likely from the [[Latin]] ''Christiānum'', &quot;[[Christian]]&quot;) is a condition of severely stunted physical and mental growth due to untreated [[congenital disorder|congenital]] deficiency of [[thyroid]] [[hormone]]s ([[hypothyroidism]]). The term ''cretin'' refers to a person so affected.

==Etymolology and usage of the term==
The term ''cretin'' was brought into medical use in the 18th century from an Alpine French dialect where persons with such a condition were especially common (though the cause was unknown). It was used widely as a medical term in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but in recent decades has spread more widely in popular English as a markedly derogatory term for a hopelessly stupid person. Because of its pejorative connotations in popular speech, the term has been largely abandoned by physicians.  A cretin of the [[Pyrenees]] was called a ''cagot'' (kag'&amp;#333;).  

The etymology of the word ''cretin'' is not known with certainty. Several hypotheses have been proposed. The most common derivation provided in English dictionaries is from the Latin ''Christiānum'' (Christian), via a medieval French dialect (compare modern French ''chretien''). The connecting meaning between &quot;Christian&quot; and &quot;cretin&quot; is not obvious. According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the translation of the Latin term into &quot;human creature&quot; implies that the label &quot;Christian&quot; is a reminder of the humanity of the afflicted, in contrast to brute beasts {{ref label|OED|1|a}}. Other sources have suggested &quot;Christian&quot; refers to the inability to sin of such a person who lacks the capacity to distinguish right from wrong {{ref label|Atlantic|2|a}}.

Other speculative etymologies have been offered:
#From ''creta'', Latin for ''chalk'', because of the pallor of those affected.
#From ''cretira'', Grisson-Romance ''creature'', from Latin ''creatus''.
#From ''cretine'', French for ''alluvium'' (soil deposited by flowing water), an allusion to the suspected origin from inadequate soil.
#:&lt;small&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;ref_Medvei&quot;&gt;Source: VC Medvei. ''The History of Clinical Endocrinology''. Pearl River, New York: Parthenon Publishing Group. 1993.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

==Cretinism due to congenital hypothyroidism==
[[Congenital hypothyroidism]] can be endemic, genetic, or sporadic. If untreated, it results in mild to severe impairment of both physical and mental [[growth]] and development.

Poor length growth is apparent as early as the first year of life. Adult stature without treatment ranges from 1 to 1.6 meters, depending on severity, sex and other genetic factors. [[Bone maturation]] and [[puberty]] are severely delayed. [[Ovulation]] is impeded and [[infertility]] common.

Neurological impairment may be mild, with reduced muscle tone and coordination, or so severe that the person cannot stand or walk. Cognitive impairment may also range from mild to so severe that the person is nonverbal and dependent on others for basic care. Thought and reflexes are slower.

Other signs may include thickened skin and a protruding abdomen. 

Sporadic and genetic cretinism results from abnormal development or function of the fetal thyroid gland. This type of cretinism has been almost completely eliminated in developed countries by early diagnosis by [[newborn screening]] programs followed by lifelong treatment with [[thyroxine]].

Endemic cretinism arises from a diet deficient in [[iodine]] and has affected far more people worldwide and continues to be a major [[public health]] problem in many countries. Iodine is an essential trace element, necessary primarily for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Although it is found in many foods it is not universally present in all soils in adequate amounts. The soils of many inland areas on all continents are iodine deficient, and plants and animals grown there are correspondingly deficient. Populations living in those areas without outside food sources are most at risk for [[iodine deficiency]] diseases.

Iodine deficiency results in the impairments of varying degrees of physical and mental development. It also causes gradual enlargement of the thyroid gland, referred to as a [[goiter]]. It is being combatted in many countries by public health campaigns of iodine administration.

==History==
Endemic cretinism was especially common in areas of southern Europe around the Alps and was described by Roman writers, and often depicted by medieval artists. Alpine cretinism was described from a medical perspective by several travellers and physicians in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. At that time the cause was not known and it was often attributed to &quot;stagnant air&quot; in mountain valleys or &quot;bad water&quot;. The proportion of people affected varied markedly throughout southern Europe and even within very small areas it might be common in one valley and not another. The number of severely affected persons was always a minority and most persons affected by cretinism to the extent of having a goiter and some degree of reduced cognition and growth were still socially functional in their pastoral villages.

More mildly affected areas of Europe and North America in the 19th century were referred to as &quot;goiter belts&quot;. The degree of iodine deficiency was milder and manifested primarily as thyroid enlargement rather than severe mental and physical impairment. In Switzerland for example where soil is poor with iodine the cases of cretinism were very abundant and even were considered as genetically caused. As the variety of food sources dramatically increased in Europe and North America and the populations became less completely dependent on locally grown food, the prevalence of endemic goiter diminished.

In the early 20th century the relationships of sporadic cretinism with congenital hypothyroidism, and endemic cretinism with hypothyroidism due to iodine deficiency were discovered and both have been largely eliminated in the developed world.

== Parliamentary cretinism ==
The term '''parliamentary cretinism''' was introduced by [[Marx]]. According to Marx, parliamentary cretinism &quot;confines its victims to an imaginary world and robs them of their senses, their recollection, all knowledge of the rude external world.&quot;

Note: Cantonese, like most of the other Chinese languages, does not actually have words for &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no.&quot; Translations for &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; given above actually mean &quot;it is&quot; and &quot;it is not&quot; and can be used for questions asking for confirmation. However, for certain yes/no questions, one would normally respond with the verb or the negation of the verb. For instance, to respond to a question such as &quot;do you want to go?&quot; one would respond with &quot;want&quot; or &quot;not want.&quot;

=== [[Standard Mandarin|Chinese, Mandarin]] ([[Chinese language|Sinitic]]) ===

''Note || Mandarin Chinese is a [[tonal language]]. Tone 1 (e.g. mā) is high and level; 2 (e.g., má) is rising; 3 (e.g., mǎ) is low dipping; 4 (e.g., mà) is falling. For more info, see [[pinyin]]. Also note that the first set of characters preceding the slashes are in [[Simplified_Chinese|simplified Chinese characters]] and the ones following the slashes are in [[Traditional_Chinese|traditional characters]]. If the simplified- and traditional-character versions of a phrase are identical, only one phrase is shown.''

====Usage Notes====
# The second syllable of &quot;nèige&quot; is actually a generic [[measure word]]; it is replaced by the appropriate measure word for the noun it refers to. You may therefore hear a number of different syllables after the initial nèi. In many parts of southern China, nèi is also pronounced nà.
# This actually means &quot;it is&quot; and can only be used in an answer to a question with the verb &quot;to be&quot; (in casual speech, this can be neglected). Languages like Chinese, Irish, Toki Pona, and Welsh do not have words for &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. Instead you repeat the main verb of the question in your answer. Shaking your head in affirmation or negation works as expected, though speakers should ensure they are answering negative questions as literally asked – answering in the negative to &quot;You don't like him?&quot; would indicate that you ''do'' like him.

=== [[Shanghainese|Chinese, Shanghainese]] ([[Chinese language|Sinitic]]) ===
''Note: Chinese characters for Shanghainese are not standardized and are provided for reference only.  IPA transcription is for the Middle period of modern Shanghainese (中派上海话), pronunciation of those between 20 and 60 years old.''

===Usage Notes===
# No word directly corresponds to the word &quot;please&quot;. Danish and Finnish express the concept of politeness in a request in various ways.)  One way is to smile while asking for something, another is to add tak (thank you) to the end of the question: &quot;kan jeg få noget mere at drikke, tak&quot;, although this is more of an anglicised form of Danish.

*&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;These are not used nearly as casually in Hindi and Urdu as they are in western languages. कृपया especially is used only in cases of true importance or urgency, and using it otherwise would sound incredibly stilted and formal. Instead, politeness is achieved by proper address and verb forms and body language/tone of voice.
&lt;!-- I didn't add &quot;please sit&quot; because I didn't know how to spell the polite imperative bitaye, which would cover please in the verb form. A problem I came into, is that Hindi and Urdu don't use 'please', 'excuse me', 'thank you', or even 'sorry' in the same casual, polite manner as other languages. As &quot;common&quot; phrases, they really don't belong here at all, nor, even possibly, the formal namaskaar; - but I erred on the cautious side, choosing to conform to the rest of the page. --&gt;

Pronunciations are first given in the Ecclesiastical Pronunciation (Based on [[Italian language|Italian]], and used in some ceremonies by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] church, and usually heard in recordings of [[European classical music|classical music]]). These pronunciations are followed by the classical pronunciation (a reconstruction of how scholars believe the Romans pronounced these expressions)

For example -- &quot;of light&quot; lucis {{IPA|/'luʧis/}} (LOO-cheess) {{IPA|/'luːkis/}} (LOO-kiss), with (LOO-cheess) being the ecclesiastical pronunciation, and (LOO-kiss) how the Romans said lucis.

== [[Swahili language|Swahili]] ([[Bantu]]) ==

Usage Note: Greetings in Swahili are a crucial aspect of Swahili culture; it is not uncommon for a conversation to last five minutes before it actually moves beyond saying &quot;Hello&quot;. There is no generic word for &quot;Hello&quot; in the language, rather there are numerous options depending on the relative ages and/or race of the people involved, as well as singular and plural forms.

'''Note:''' The polite forms of some phrases - those which make use of the word ''pô'' - should generally be used when speaking to persons of authority and seniority, or to show reverence to the person to whom spoken. With friends and in casual situations, ''pô'' is not used. Also, in modern written Filipino/Tagalog, diacritical marks are omitted.

A '''child node''' or ''descendant node'' is a [[node (computer science)|node]] in a [[tree data structure]] that is linked to by a [[parent node]]. Thinking of the tree as a [[directed graph]], node ''A'' is a child of node ''B'' if and only if node ''A'' is a successor node of ''B''.

A node with no child nodes is called a [[leaf node]].

A node which is not the child of any node (i.e. has no parent) is called a [[root node]].

The '''coyote''' (''Canis latrans'', meaning &quot;barking dog&quot;, also ''prairie wolf''[http://www.bartleby.com/65/x-/X-prairiew.html]) is a member of the [[Canidae]] (the [[dog]] family) and a relative of the domestic dog. Coyotes are only found in [[North America]]. Coyotes may occasionally assemble in small packs, but normally hunt alone. Coyotes live an average of about 6 years. The word &quot;coyote&quot; derives from the [[Nahuatl language|Náhuatl]] (Aztec) word '''cóyotl''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] /&amp;#712;k&amp;#596;.j&amp;#596;t&amp;#620;/).

Despite being extensively hunted, the coyote is one of the few medium-to-large-sized animals that has enlarged its territory since human encroachment began (another is the [[raccoon]]). Coyotes have moved into most of the areas of North America formerly occupied by [[Gray Wolf|wolves]], and the &quot;dog&quot; one sees scrounging from a suburban trashcan may in fact be a coyote.

== Anatomy ==
[[Image:Coyote portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Coyote profile]]

The coyote stands less than two feet (0.6 m) tall and varies in color from gray to tan with sometimes a reddish tint to its coat. A coyote's ears and nose appear long and pointed, especially in relation to the size of its head. It weighs between 9 - 22 kilograms (20 - 50 lb), averaging 14 kg.  The coyote can be identified by its thick bushy tail, which it often holds low to the ground. It can be distinguished from its much larger relative, the [[Gray Wolf]], by its overall slight appearance compared to the massive 34 to 57 kg (75 to 125 lb) stockiness of the bigger canid. The coyote is an extremely lean animal and may appear underfed even if healthy.

The northeast coyote and the Cape Cod coyote are thought to be a 50% mix with the [[Red Wolf]].  Coyotes can also hybridize and produce fertile offspring with [[Gray Wolf|Gray Wolves]] and domestic dogs.  However practical constraints such as the timing of [[estrus cycle]]s and the need for both parents to care for the pups limit such crosses in the wild.  Hybrids between coyotes and Domestic Dogs are known as &quot;[[Coydog]]s&quot;.

== Behavior ==
[[Image:Coyote in forest.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Coyote in a forest]]

Coyotes are highly adaptable and live in a variety of different niches.  Their behavior can vary widely depending on where they live, but in general they live and hunt singly or in monogamous pairs in search of small mammals including rabbits, mice, shrews, voles, and foxes. It is an omnivore and adapts its diet to the available food sources including fruits, grasses, and vegetables along with small mammals. In [[Yellowstone National Park]], before the reintroduction of the [[wolf]], they began to fill the wolf's ecological niche, and hunted in packs to bring down large prey.

Coyotes mate for life. They breed around the month of February and 4&amp;ndash;6 pups are born in late April or early May.  Both parents (and sometimes undispersed young from the previous year) help to feed the pups.  At three weeks old the pups leave the den under close watch of their parents.  Once the pups are eight to twelve weeks old they are taught to hunt. Families stay together through the summer but the young break apart to find their own territories by fall.  They usually relocate within ten miles. The young are sexually mature at 1 year of age.

Hearing a coyote is much more common than seeing one. The calls a coyote makes are high-pitched and variously described as howls, yips, yelps and barks. These calls may be a long rising and falling note (a howl) or a series of short notes (yips). These calls are most often heard at dusk or night, less often during the day. Although these calls are made throughout the year, they are most common during the spring mating season and in the fall when the pups leave their families to establish new territories. Many people find these calls eerie or disturbing. As well, its howl can be very deceiving: due to the way the sound carries, it can seem as though it is in one place, when the coyote is really elsewhere.

In rural areas, coyotes will respond to human calls. This is most often after the coyotes have started a howling session. They will also respond to recorded howls. In some of these areas, the coyotes will stop and wait for the humans to stop before resuming their howling session, once they've figured out that it isn't one of them that's been calling to them. In areas where the coyotes have grown accustomed to humans calling back to them, they tend to continue with simpler calls back to the humans and return to more complex calls when the humans get tired of calling to them. Playing a recorded wolf howl will make them stop for up to an hour before they start in again (probably because wolves prey upon coyotes.)

Coyotes may also thrive in urban settings.  A study by scientists at The [[Ohio State University]] yielded some surprising findings in this regard.  Researchers studied Coyote populations in [[Chicago, IL]] over a six year period, proposing that coyotes have adapted well to living in densely populated urban environments while avoiding contact with humans.  They found, among other things, that urban coyotes tend to live longer than their rural counterparts, help humans by killing vermin and other small animals, and live anywhere from parks to industrial areas.{{ref|URB}}   The scientists estimate that there are up to 2,000 coyotes living in [[Chicagoland]] and that this circumstance may well apply to many other urban landscapes in North America.{{ref|URB}}

== Character in mythology ==
{{main|Coyote (mythology)}}

Many myths from [[Native American (Americas)|Native American]] peoples that include a character named &quot;Mika&quot; or just &quot;Coyote&quot;.  He can play the role of [[trickster]] or [[culture hero]] (or both), and also often appears in [[creation myth]]s and [[just-so story|just-so stories]].

== Fictional coyotes ==
[[Image:Coyote in grass.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Coyote]]

*[[Road Runner cartoon|Wile E. Coyote]] is a [[Warner Brothers]] cartoon coyote who is endlessly trying to catch and eat an extremely fast [[Greater Roadrunner|Road Runner]] with his tricks, many of which involve technology or [[Rube Goldberg#Rube_Goldberg_machines|Rube Goldberg machines]]. His efforts are always futile, and he usually harms himself in the effort. It is likely that the stereotype of Coyote-as-trickster helped form the basis of this protagonist. The cartoon character Wile E. Coyote has a comically exaggerated nose, tail and ears, inspired by the appearance of the real animal.

* Coyotes feature prominently in the novel ''The Book of Sorrows'', by Walter Wangerin Jr, sequel to the award-winning ''The Book of the Dun Cow''.  The coyote Ferric is a skinny, scared creature struggling to feed his wife Rachael and their three pups, and to protect them from the cruel, wild world outside the den. As he travels far from home looking for food in the barren winter, he accidently sets in motion a chain of events that bring Heaven and Hell crashing down upon him, and on every living thing in the land.

* The [[San Antonio Spurs]] NBA basketball team has used a Coyote as its mascot for more than 22 years. The character was created by Tim Derk.

* The mascots of the Phoenix NHL hockey team are the [[Phoenix Coyotes]].

* Coyote the [[trickster]] appears as a major character in the novel ''[[Coyote Blue]]'' by [[Christopher Moore]].  He is the companion of the [[protagonist]], a [[Crow Indian]] used-car salesman. A number of traditional Crow stories about Coyote are used as [[vignette]]s in the story.

*Coyote, trickster and creator, is a central character in Ursula Le Guin's ''Buffalo Gals'', and also plays a role in Thomas King's ''Green Grass, Running Water''.

*In the [[Disney Channel|Disney]] cartoon show [[Gargoyles]], Coyote is the name of a series of robots of human level intelligence created by Xanatos and having his personality. Also, the mythical Coyote the [[trickster]] makes an appearance in the episode &quot;Cloud Fathers&quot;, and is portrayed as one of [[Oberon's children]].

*''[[Sky Coyote]]'' is the role taken by the [[cyborg]] Joseph in the book of that title by [[Kage Baker]], to convince the [[Chumash]] tribe of [[California]] to evacuate before white men could wipe them out in 1700.

==Vocalization==
The coyote is one of the few wild animals whose vocalizations are commonly heard. At night coyotes both howl (a high quavering cry) and emit a series of short, high-pitched yips. Howls are used to keep in touch with other coyotes in the area. Sometimes, when it is first heard, the listener may experience a tingling fear of primitive danger, but to the seasoned outdoorsman, the howl of the coyote is truly a song of the West.


'''Howling''' - communication with others in the area. Also, an announcement that “I am here and this is my area. Other males are invited to stay away but females are welcome to follow the sound of my voice. Please answer and let me know where you are so we don't have any unwanted conflicts.”

'''Yelping''' - a celebration or criticism within a small group of coyotes. Often heard during play among pups or young animals.

'''Bark''' - The scientific name for coyotes means &quot;Barking dog,&quot; Canis latrans. The bark is thought to be a threat display when a coyote is protecting a den or a kill.

'''Huffing''' - is usually used for calling pups without making a great deal ofry/timeteam/snapshot_crannogs.html Channel 4 Time Team on Crannogs] The Channel 4 Time Team on Crannogs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''date''' in a calendar is a reference to a particular day by means of a [[calendar]] system.  The calendar date allows the particular day to be identified. A person can often determine how many days a particular date comes after another date. For example, &quot;[[19 February]], [[2003]]&quot;, is ten days after &quot;[[9 February]], [[2003]]&quot;, in the [[Gregorian calendar]].

In most calendar systems, the date consists of three parts: the ''day of month'', ''month'', and the ''year''. There may also be additional parts, such as the ''day of week''. Years are usually counted from a particular starting point, usually called the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]], with [[era]] referring to the particular period of time. Note the different use in [[geology]].

A date without the year part may also be referred to as a ''date'' or ''calendar date'' (such as &quot;[[9 February]]&quot; rather than &quot;[[9 February]] [[2003]]&quot;). As such, it defines the days of an annual festival, such as a birthday or Christmas on [[25 December]].

==Date format==

Related to the classification of a day as a specific calendar date is the format used to express that date. The differing formats of dates are an example of [[endianness]].

Even for any specific calendar system, different formats are used. For example, the following formats all express the same date in the [[Gregorian calendar]]:

===Little endian forms, starting with the day===

This sequence is common to the vast majority of the world's countries, and is used as the accepted international date usage.

* 16/11/2003, 16.11.2003, 16-11-2003 or 16-11-03
* 16th&amp;nbsp;of November 2003
* 16th&amp;nbsp;November 2003
* 16&amp;nbsp;November 2003
* 16&amp;nbsp;Nov 2003

===Big endian forms, starting with the year===

This form is consistent with the endianness of the western decimal numbering system, progressing from the highest to the lowest order magnitude.

* 2003 November&amp;nbsp;16
* 2003-11-16: the [[ISO 8601]] [[International standard|International formal standard]] ordering for dates, often formatted to be especially easily read and sorted by computers. It's used with [[UTC]] in the '''Internet date/time format''' (see the [[#external links|external link below]]).  This format is also favoured in certain [[Asia|Asian]] countries, mainly the [[East Asia]].

===Middle endian forms, starting with the month===

This sequence is common to a smaller number of countries.

* November&amp;nbsp;16, 2003
* Nov.&amp;nbsp;16, 2003
* 11/16/2003, 11-16-2003, 11.16.2003 or 11.16.03

This order is used in the [[United States]] and countries with U.S. influence (but the U.S. federal government sometimes uses day, month, year). England originally used day, month, year, then for a while used month, day, year, and finally the original form (day, month, year) was revived around 1900. [[Canada]] officially uses the big endian convention, but all three conventions are used in practice.

===Usage issues===

The many numerical forms can create confusion when used in international correspondence, particularly when abbreviating the year to its final two digits.

When numbers are used to represent months, a significant amount of confusion can arise from the ambiguity of a date order; especially when the numbers representing the day, month or year are low, it can be impossible to tell which order is being used.  This can be clarified by using four digits to represent years, and naming the month; for example, &quot;Feb&quot; instead of &quot;02&quot;. Many Internet sites use year/month/day, and those using other conventions often write out the month (9-MAY-2001, MAY 09 2001, etc.) so there is no ambiguity. The [[ISO 8601]] date order, with four-digit years, is specifically chosen to be unambiguous.

The [[ISO 8601]] standard also has the advantage of being language independent and therefore is useful when there may be no language context and a universal application is desired (expiration dating on export products, for example). Another advantage is that a plain text list of dates with this format can be easily sorted by [[Word processor|word processors]], [[spreadsheet|spreadsheets]] and other software tools with built-in sorting functions.

At least in the [[United States]], dates are rarely written in purely numerical forms in formal writing.

Mixed units, for example feet and inches, or pounds and ounces, are normally written with the largest unit first, in decreasing order.  Numbers are also written in that order, so the digits of 2006 indicate, in order, the millennium, the century within the millennium, the decade within the century, and the year within the decade.  The only date order that is consistent with these well established conventions is year-month-day.  

An early U.S. [[Federal Information Processing Standard]] recommended 2-digit years.
This is now widely recognized as a [[year 2000 problem|bad idea]]. Even some U.S. government agencies now use ISO 8601 with 4 digit years [http://www.nyecounty.net/iso8601.html][http://www.iprocessmart.com/techsmart/iso-time.htm].

When transitioning from one date notation to another,
people often write both [[Old Style and New Style dates]].

====d/m/y (day, month, year) is used by:====

* [[Switzerland]]
* [[Thailand]] (with [[Thai solar calendar|Buddhist Era]] instead of [[Common Era]])
* [[Turkey]]
* [[Ukraine]]
* [[United Kingdom]]
* [[Uruguay]]
* [[Venezuela]]
Although '9/11' refers to [[Berlin_Wall#The_fall_of_the_Wall|'The fall of the Berlin Wall']] on [[9 November]] [[1989]], '9/11' and sometimes '11/9' is also used to refer to the [[11 September]] [[2001]] [[September 11, 2001 attacks|attacks on the World Trade Centre]] in the USA.

====yyyy-mm-dd (year, month, day), the [[ISO 8601]] [[standardization|standard]], is used by:====
* [[Canada]] (yyyy-mm-dd) (All 3 main types are used in Canada- in French and in English)
* [[China]]
* [[Hong Kong]] (Chinese)
* [[Hungary]] (yyyy.mm.dd)
* [[Japan]] (but often in the form yyyy年mm月dd日, or as yy年mm月dd日 when using [[Japanese era name|Japanese era year]])
* [[Korea]]
* [[Latvia]]
* [[Norway]] (yyyy-mm-dd)
* [[South Africa]] (English)
* [[Sweden]] (yyyy-mm-dd or yyyy.mm.dd)
* [[Taiwan]]

It is often used in scientific, technical or international communication.

====yyyy-mmm-dd====
*[[Canada]] (as in 2006-JAN-01)

====m/d/y (month, day, year) is used by:====
* [[Canada]] (Although most official documents use the y-m-d format, the m/d/y format is also understood due to influences from the United States. However, m/d/y is not an official format in Canadian English and its use should be avoided where possible.) 
* [[United States]] (Although [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] is often referred to as &quot;the Fourth of July.&quot;)

===Day and year only===

The U.S. military sometimes uses a system that indicates the year and day, but not the month. For example, &quot;[[10 December]] [[1999]]&quot; can be written in some contexts as &quot;9345&quot;, for the 345th day of 1999. This system is most often used on forms.

:''See also'': [[calendar]], [[time]], [[date-time group]], [[Japanese calendar]], [[Wikibooks:English:Time]]

===Week number used===
Companies in Europe often use year, week number and day, for planning purposes.
Since week is a fundamental unit for working life, it makes sense.
An event in a project can happen for example w43, w0543 or w543 (week 43 year 2005) or even w43-1 (Monday week 43 year 2005). One problem is that week numbering have different standards, for example [[ISO 8601]], not used by the [[USA]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''cist''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet for English|IPA]] {{IPA|[k&amp;#618;st]}}) is a small stone-built coffin-like box used to hold the [[corpse|bodies of the dead]] (notably during the [[Bronze Age]] in [[Britain]] and occasionally in [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] burials). The sides are usually built of single slabs.

A cist may have been associated with other monuments, perhaps under a [[cairn]] or long [[tumulus|barrow]]. It would not be uncommon to find several cists close together within the same cairn or barrow. Occasionally, ornaments have been found within a cist under excavation, which could indicate the wealth of the interred individual.

A cist is also a mediterranean flower, see [[rockrose]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[abstract algebra]], the '''center''' of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' is the set ''Z''(''G'') of all elements in ''G'' which [[Commutative|commute]] with all the elements of ''G''. Specifically,
:''Z''(''G'') = {''z'' &amp;isin; ''G'' | ''gz'' = ''zg'' for all ''g'' &amp;isin; ''G''}

Note that ''Z''(''G'') is a [[subgroup]] of ''G'' &amp;mdash; if ''x'' and ''y'' are in ''Z''(''G''), then for each ''g'' in ''G'', ''(xy)g'' = ''x(yg)'' = ''x(gy)'' = ''(xg)y'' = ''(gx)y'' = ''g(xy)'' so ''xy'' is in ''Z''(''G'') as well. A similar argument applies to inverses.

Moreover, ''Z''(''G'') is an [[abelian group|abelian subgroup]] of ''G'', a [[normal subgroup]] of ''G'', and even a strictly [[characteristic subgroup]] of ''G'', but not always fully characteristic.

The center of ''G'' is all of ''G'' [[iff]] ''G'' is an abelian group. At the other extreme, a group is said to be '''centerless''' if ''Z''(''G'') is trivial.

Consider the map ''f'': ''G'' &amp;rarr; Aut(''G'') to the [[automorphism group]] of ''G'' defined by ''f''(''g'')(''h'') = ''ghg''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of this map is the center of ''G'' and the image is called the [[inner automorphism group]] of ''G'', denoted Inn(''G''). By the [[first isomorphism theorem]] ''G''/''Z''(''G'') &lt;math&gt;\cong&lt;/math&gt; Inn(''G'').

Example:

The center of the [[orthogonal group]] O(''n'' ) is { ''I'', &amp;minus;''I'' }.

'''The Commonwealth''' was the [[republic]]an government which ruled first [[England]] and then the whole of [[Ireland]], the colonies and other Crown possessions during the periods from 1649 to 1653 and from 1659 to 1660.

After the beheading of the monarch [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] on [[January 30]] 1649, its existence was initially declared (&quot;[[Wikisource:An Act declaring England to be a Commonwealth|An Act declaring England to be a Commonwealth]]&quot;) by the [[Rump Parliament]] on [[19 May]] that year.

The government during 1653 to 1659 is properly called [[The Protectorate]], and took the form of direct personal rule by [[Oliver Cromwell]] and, after his death, his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]], as [[Lord Protector]]. The term &quot;The Commonwealth&quot; is, however, loosely used to describe the system of government during the whole of 1649 to 1660, the years of the [[English Interregnum]]. 

== Radicals vs. Conservatives ==
Parliament had, to a large degree, encouraged the radical political groups which emerged when the usual social controls broke down during the [[English Civil War]]. It had also unwittingly established a new political force when it set up the [[New Model Army]]. Not surprisingly, all these groups had their own hopes for the new Commonwealth.

=== Levellers ===
Led by [[John Lilburne]], [[Levellers]] drew their main support from London and the Army. In the [[Agreement of the People]], 1649, they asked for: a more representative and accountable parliament, to meet every two years; a reform of law so it would be available to, and fair to all; and religious toleration. Though they wanted a more [[Democracy|democratic]] society, their proposed franchise did not extend to women or to the lowest orders of society.

Levellers saw the Rump as little better than the monarchy it had replaced, and they showed their displeasure in demonstrations, pamphlets and mutinies. While their numbers did not pose a serious threat to the government, they scared the Rump into action and the [[Treasons Act 1649|Treasons Act]] was passed against them in 1649.

=== Diggers  ===
Led by [[Gerrard Winstanley]], [[Diggers (True Levellers)|Diggers]] wanted an even more equal society than the Levellers. They advocated a lifestyle that was an early form of [[communism]], with communal ownership of land, and absolute equality for males and females in law and education. They existed in only very small numbers and faced strong opposition, even from the Levellers.

=== Religious sects ===
The breakdown of religious uniformity and incomplete [[Presbyterian]] Settlement of 1646 enabled independent churches to flourish. The main sects (''see also [[English Dissenters]]'') were: [[Baptists]], who advocated adult re[[baptism]]; [[Ranters]], who claimed that sin did not exist for the &quot;chosen ones&quot;; and [[Fifth Monarchy Men]], who opposed all &quot;earthly&quot; governments, believing they must prepare for God's kingdom on earth by establishing a &quot;government of saints&quot;.

Despite greater toleration, extreme sects were opposed by the upper classes as they were seen as a threat to social order and property rights.
[[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] were also excluded from the toleration applied to the other groups.

=== Conservatives ===
Conservatives were still dominant in both [[central government]] and [[local government]]. In the former, the Rump was anxious not to offend the traditional ruling class whose support it needed for survival, so it opposed radical ideas. In the latter, that ruling class dominated through the influence of traditional regional gentry.

== Political experiments of the Commonwealth ==
=== The Rump Parliament 1649–53 ===
The Rump was the purged remnant of the original [[Long Parliament]]. As such it was a link with the old constitution. With the abolition of the monarchy, [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] and the [[House of Lords]], it had unchecked executive, as well as legislative, power. The '''Council of State''', which replaced the Privy Council, took over many of the executive functions of the monarchy.  It was selected by the Rump, and most of its members were MPs. Ultimately however, the Rump depended on the support of the Army with which it had a very uneasy relationship.

==== Structure of the Rump ====
In [[Pride's Purge]], all MPs (including most of the political Presbyterians) who would not accept the need to bring the King to trial had been removed. Thus the Rump never had more than 200 members (less than half the number in the original Long Parliament). They included: supporters of religious independents who did not want an established church and some of whom had sympathies with the Levellers; [[Presbyterians]] who were willing to countenance the trial and execution of the King; and later admissions, such as formerly excluded MPs who were prepared to denounce the [[Newport Treaty]] negotiations with the King.

Most Rumpers were [[gentry]], though there was a higher proportion of lesser gentry and lawyers than in previous parliaments.  Less than one-quarter of them were [[regicide]]s. This left the Rump basically a conservative body whose vested interests in the existing land ownership and legal systems made them unlikely to want to reform these.

==== Rump issues and achievements====
For the first two years of the Commonwealth, the Rump faced economic depression and the risk of invasion from [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]]. (By 1653 Cromwell and the Army had largely eliminated these threats).

There were many disagreements amongst factions of the Rump. Some wanted a republic, but others favoured retaining some type of monarchical government. Most of England's traditional ruling classes regarded the Rump as an illegal government made up of regicides and upstarts. However, they were also aware that the Rump might be all that stood in the way of an outright [[martial law|military dictatorship]]. High taxes, mainly to pay the Army, were resented by the gentry. Limited reforms (see below) were enough to antagonise the ruling class but not enough to satisfy the radicals.

Despite its unpopularity, the Rump was a link with the old constitution, and helped to settle England down and make it secure after the biggest upheaval in its history. By 1653, both [[France]] and [[Spain]] had recognised England's new government.

==== Rump reforms ====
Though the national church (now Presbyterian) was retained, the 1559 [[Act of Uniformity]] was repealed in 1650. Many independent churches were therefore tolerated, although everyone still had to pay [[tithe]]s to the established church.  This wide toleration came about mainly because of the insistence of the Army.

Some small improvements were made to law and court procedure, for example all court proceedings were now conducted in English rather than in [[Law French]] or [[Latin]].  However, there were no widespread reforms of the [[Common Law]]. This would have upset the gentry, who regarded the Common Law as reinforcing their status and property rights.

The Rump passed many restrictive 'moral' laws to regulate people's behaviour, such as closing down theatres and requiring [[Blue law|strict observance of Sundays]]. This antagonised most of the gentry.

==== The dismissal of the Rump ====
Cromwell forcibly dismissed the Rump in April 1653, for reasons that are unclear. Theories are that he feared the Rump was trying to perpetuate itself as the government, or that the Rump was preparing for an election which could return an anti-Commonwealth majority. Many former members of the Rump continued to regard themselves as England's only legitimate constitutional authority. The Rump had not agreed to its own dissolution when it was dispersed by Cromwell and legislation from the period immidiatly before the Civil War the [Act against dissolving the Long Parliament without its own consent [[11 May]] [[1641]], gave them the legal basies for this view.

=== The 'Barebones' Parliament, July–December 1653 ===
The dissolution of the Rump was followed by a short period in which Cromwell and the Army ruled alone. Nobody had the constitutional prostitute in Britain and elsewhere.

The phrase &quot;A court of kangaroos&quot; is frequently thought to be legitimate, given the (quite unrelated) expression &quot;a kangaroo court&quot;. There is no known evidence of its legitimacy as a collective noun, however.

A &quot;ream of paper&quot; - A ream is traditionally defined as 480 sheets (twenty [[quire|quires]] of twenty-four sheets each); the more usual modern count is 500 sheets to the ream.  This is more a measure of paper than a collective noun, however.

==Notes==
* The phrase &quot;A court of kangaroos&quot; is frequently thought to be legitimate, given the (quite unrelated) expression &quot;a [[kangaroo court]]&quot;. There is no known evidence of its legitimacy as a collective noun, however.
* A &quot;complaint of camels&quot; was formerly common in Australia due to the poem &quot;The Plaint of the Camel&quot; by Charles Edward Carryl, which was part of the primary school syllabus for many years.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For other uses of the word carat, see [[Carat]].''

The '''carat''' is a unit of [[mass]] used for [[gem]]s, and equals [[1 E-4 kg|200 milligrams]].  The word derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''keration'' (fruit of the [[carob]]), via [[Arabic (language)|Arabic]] and [[Italian (language)|Italian]].  Carob seeds were used as weights on precision scales because of their uniform size.  In the distant past, different countries each had their own carat, roughly equivalent to a [[carob]] seed.  

Eventually, it was linked to the [[gEast End of London]]. Many of its expressions have passed into common language, and the creation of new ones is no longer restricted to [[Cockney]]s. 

== Overview ==
Rhyming slang developed as a way of obscuring the meaning of sentences to those who did not understand the [[slang]], though it remains a matter of speculation whether this was a [[linguistics|linguistic]] accident, or whether it was developed intentionally to assist [[criminal]]s or to maintain a particular [[community]].

Rhyming slang works by replacing the word to be obscured with the first word of a phrase that rhymes with that word. For instance, &quot;face&quot; would be replaced by &quot;boat&quot;, because face rhymes with &quot;boat race&quot;.  Similarly &quot;feet&quot; becomes &quot;plates&quot; (&quot;plates of meat&quot;), and &quot;money&quot; is &quot;bread&quot; (a very common usage, from &quot;bread and honey&quot;).  Sometimes the full phrase is used, for example &quot;Currant Bun&quot; to mean ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'', usually referring to the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[tabloid newspaper]] of that name.  There is no hard and fast rule for this, and you just have to know whether a particular expression is always shortened, never shortened, or can be used either way.

Some substitutions have become relatively widespread in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], for example to &quot;have a [[Wiktionary:butcher's|butcher's]]&quot; means to have a look, from the rhyming slang &quot;butcher's hook&quot;, and these are often now used without awareness of the original rhyming slang (so for example &quot;[[Wiktionary:berk|berk]]&quot; and &quot;[[Wiktionary:cobblers|cobblers]]&quot; are both less [[taboo]] than their [[etymology]] would suggest).  However, most other actual and purported substitutions are still not in common usage.

This style of rhyming has also spread through many English-speaking countries, where the original phrases are supplemented by rhymes created to fit local needs. Creation of rhyming slang has become a [[word game]] for people of many classes and regions.  The term Cockney rhyming slang is generally applied to these expansions to indicate the rhyming style, though arguably the term only applies to phrases used in the East End of London. Similar formations exist in other parts of the United Kingdom. In the East Midlands, 'Derby Road' is rhymed with 'cold', a conjunction that would not be possible in any other dialect of the UK.

All slang is rooted in the era of its origin and therefore some of it will to be lost as time passes.  In the [[1980s]], for example, &quot;[[Kerry Packer]]ed&quot; meant &quot;[[knackered]]&quot;; in [[2004]], the term &quot;Britneys&quot; was used to mean [[beer]]s (or in [[Ireland]] to mean [[homosexuality|queers]]) via the music artist &quot;[[Britney Spears]]&quot;, although the usage may not outlast her career and/or popularity.  

== Rhyming slang in popular culture ==
Musical artists such as [[Audio bullys|The Audiobullys]] and [[The Streets]] use CRS in almost all of their songs. It is also often used in [[feature film]]s, such as ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'' ([[1998]]) (which contains a glossary of Cockney rhyming slang on the United States [[DVD]] version to assist the viewer), and on [[television]] (e.g. ''[[Minder]]'', ''[[EastEnders]]'') to lend authenticity to an East End setting.  The theme song to ''[[The Italian Job]]'', composed by [[Quincy Jones]], contains many Cockney rhyming slang expressions.  The lyrics by [[Don Black (musician)|Don Black]] amused and fascinated the composer. The schoolkid characters in the film [[To Sir With Love]] regularly utilise CRS, which their new teacher (played by Sidney Poitier) finds impossible to understand.  

The box office success ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'' ([[2001]]) contains an apparent example of Cockney rhyming slang, when the character Basher Tarr (played by [[Don Cheadle]]) uses the slang &quot;Barney&quot; to mean &quot;trouble,&quot; derived from [[Barney Rubble]]. In common usage, &quot;Barney&quot; does not mean trouble; it means an argument or a fight. Some argue that it is derived from &quot;Barn Owl&quot; which (in a Cockney accent) nearly rhymes with &quot;row&quot; (argument). However, the book ''Understanding British English'', by Margaret E. Moore, Citadel Press, [[1995]], does not list &quot;Barney&quot; in its &quot;Rhyming Slang&quot; section. Furthermore, an old book called ''Slang and Its Analogues'', by J.S. Farmer and W.E. Henley, originally printed in [[1890]] and reprinted by Arno Press in 1970, states that &quot;Barney&quot; (which can mean anything from a &quot;lark&quot; to a &quot;row&quot;) is of unknown origin, and was used in print as early as [[1865]].

== Other rhyming slang ==
[[Australian English]] shares some Cockney rhyming slang and also has many of its own terms. (See: [[Australian words#Rhyming slang|Australian rhyming slang]].) Some people have speculated that this is due to a strong formative influence of Cockneys on [[Australian culture]].

It has been noted by the Edinburgh author and journalist [[Irvine Welsh|Irvine Welsh]] that rhyming slang with Cockney origin is now more likely to be used and developed in Scotland than in the East End of London, giving rise to formations that rely on the Scottish accent for their effect (see 'Dennis Law' = 'snow' for example).

In [[United States]] some common slang seems to have had its origin in Cockney rhyming slang: &quot;raspberry,&quot; shortened from &quot;[[Raspberry and cream tart|raspberry tart]]&quot; means [[fart]]; &quot;[[Wiktionary:duke|dukes]]&quot; means fists; &quot;duke it out&quot; means settle an argument via [[bare-knuckle|fisticuffs]]; &quot;[[bread]]&quot; means [[money]]; &quot;creamed&quot; means beaten (interestingly, in the UK &quot;creamed&quot; can also mean &quot;exhausted&quot;, from the rhyme of &quot;cream cracker&quot; and &quot;knacker&quot;).

There is a set of specialist rhyming slang terms used by some members of the British disabled community to describe medical conditions.  This is sometimes termed &quot;disability rhyming slang&quot; and shares the same style, and some of the same phrases, as the more traditional rhyming slang.

Its origin is Central [[Brazil]] and it was developed by crossing the [[India]]n [[Zebu]] cattle (''Bos taurus indicus'') and the [[Europe]]an (''Bos taurus taurus'') [[Charolais cattle]] which were introduced to Brazil in the [[18th century]]. Compared to the very productive European cattle, Zebu cattle is better suited to the Brazilian climate.

'''Central Committee''' most commonly refers to the central executive unit of a [[communist party]], whether ruling or non-ruling. In a communist party, the Central Committee is made up of delegates elected at a [[Party Congress]]. In ruling communist parties, the Central Committee makes decisions for the party between congresses, and usually is responsible for electing the [[Politburo]]. In non-ruling communist parties, the Central Committee is usually understood by the party membership to be the ultimate [[authority]] in decision-making once the process of [[democratic centralism]] has led to an agreed-upon position

Organizations besides communist ones also have Central Committees, such as the [[Mennonite Central Committee|Mennonite Church]] and [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], as well as the ''Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors'' (to [[war]]). In the United States the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Parties both have Central Committees; these act as the leading body of those organizations at the national/administrative level, as well as local committees in a similar capacity within the local Democratic or Republican governments of individual [[county|counties]] and states.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Central Committee''', abbreviated in Russian as '''ЦК''', &quot;Tseka&quot;,  was the highest body of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU). Its full name was 
''Центра́льный Комите́т Коммунисти́ческой Па́ртии Сове́тского Сою́за = ЦК КПСС; Tsentralnyy Komitet Kommunistitcheskoy Partii Sovetskogo Soyuza = TSK KPSS'', or the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

According to Party rules, the Central Committee directed all Party and government activities between each [[Congress of the CPSU|Party Congress]] with the [[Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo]] elected by and reporting to the Central Committee. Members of the committee were elected at the Party Congress every five years.

For most of its existence, the power of the Central Committee was limited by its infrequent meetings and large membership, and true power lay with the Politburo. The Committee functioned as a rubber-stamp to legitimise and give an aura of consensus to Politburo decisions. The Committee would meet only twice a year, with sessions lasting one or two days. Special plenary sessions would be held before a major event, such as a new long-term plan or the selection of a new General Secretary. The elections were façades too, with the membership being selected in advance by the leaders.

From [[1917]] to [[1934]], the Central Committee did act as a parliament. But its occasional opposition to [[Stalin]] led to a [[purge]] of the body between the 17th and 18th Party Congresses ([[1934]]-[[1939|39]]). Until Stalin's death, its role was therefore almost non-existent. After Stalin's death, there was a period of collective leadership, which revitalised the Committee before it was returned to its compliant role. However the Committee did play a critical role in the career of [[Nikita Khrushchev]].  In [[1957]], the Central Committee played a critical role when it overturned a decision by the Presidium (ie the Politburo) to remove Nikita Khrushchev as party leader. Khrushchev, with the assistance of [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]]  [[Zhukov]], rallied the support of the Central Committee against what he called the [[Anti-Party Group]]. Seven years later, on [[October 14]], [[1964]] it was a meeting of the Central Committee that deposed Khrushchev. The Central Committee also made a landmark decision in March 1985 when it elected the reformist [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] as the next [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of CPSU]] with the margin of just one vote more than the hardliner [[Viktor Grishin]].

Following the failed coup of August [[1991]], the Central Committee was dissolved as was the Communist Party itself.

{{Communism}}
The '''Communist Party of the [[Soviet Union]]''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия Сове́тского Сою́за'' = ''КПСС'') was the name used by the successors of the [[Bolshevik]] [[political faction|faction]] of the [[Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party]] from [[1952]] to [[1991]], but the wording '''Communist Party''' was present in the party's name since [[1918]] when the Bolsheviks became the ''All-Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)''. In 1925 the party became the ''All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)'' (Всесоюзная коммунистическая партия (большевиков), '''ВКП(б)'''); both '''VKP(b)''' and '''AUCP(b)''' abbreviations are in use. Finally in 1952 it became simply the '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union''' or '''CPSU'''. This article follows the course of the party from 1918 until its dissolution in 1991. ''For information on the pre-1918 party see [[Bolshevik]]. ''

Once the ''Third International'' or [[Comintern]] was formed in 1919, the [[democratic centralism|democratic centralist]] [[Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] structure of the CPSU was copied by the other Comintern members resulting in [[Communist Party|Communist parties]] being formed around the world.

For most of the history of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union, the Communist Party was virtually indistinguishable from the government, as it was the only political party tolerated by the government and its security forces. Consequently, the history of the USSR and the CPSU are deeply intertwined and overlapping. Therefore, it is useful for those interested in the history of the CPSU to also consult the [[History of Russia]] series of articles.

==Structure==
===CPSU===

The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the CPSU|Party Congress]] which initially met annually but whose meetings became less frequent, particularly under [[Stalin]]. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo]]. Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo. In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Brezhnev]] in 1966. 

In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress, however, in practice the power structure became reversed and, particularly after the death of Lenin, supreme power became the domain of the General Secretary.  

At lower levels, the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or '''partkoms''' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected '''partkom secretary''' (секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, [[kolkhoz]]es, etc., they were called as such, i.e., &quot;partkoms&quot;. At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: '''raikoms''' (райком) at [[raion]] level, '''obkoms''' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as '''gubkoms''' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), '''gorkom''' (горком) it city level, etc.

The bottom level of the Party was the '''primary party organization''' (первичная партийная организация) or '''party cell''' (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called '''party bureau''' (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected '''bureau secretary''' (секретарь партбюро).

At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding plant/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an '''exempt secretary''' (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.


===Membership===
Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege with Communist Party members becoming an elite, or [[nomenklatura]], in Soviet society. Members of the nomenklatura would enjoy special privileges such as shopping at well-stocked stores, have preference in obtaining housing and access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities and obtain prestigious jobs for them. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.

Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself!.

When the Bolsheviks became the ''All-Russian Communist Party'' it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the &quot;Lenin Levy&quot;) of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to &quot;proletarianize&quot; the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.

By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members and candidate members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939.  In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian federation itself there was no separate Communist Party as affairs were run directly by the CPSU.

== History ==
''Main article: [[History of the CPSU]]''

With some exceptions, the course of the CPSU (and the history of the whole Soviet Union) was largely determined by its leader. The history of the CPSU since the death of [[Lenin]] can thus be divided into the eras of [[Stalin]], [[Khrushchev]], [[Brezhnev]] and [[Gorbachev]]. 

&lt;!-- a summary is in order --&gt;

==End of Communist rule==
The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led conservative elements in the CPSU to launch the [[August Coup]] in [[1991]] which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On [[August 19]], 1991, a day before a ''Union Treaty'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the &quot;State Emergency Committee&quot; seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved due to large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of conservatives.  Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.

After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there is widespread flora of parties in Russia, claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (due to its massive size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.

In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Communist Party of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]].

In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was converted into the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]].

In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islam Karimov]] converted the CPSU branch into the [[Democratic People's Party (Uzbekistan)|Democratic People's Party]].

In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in [[1992]]. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).

* [[Central Cushitic languages|Central Cushitic]] or [[Agaw languages|Agaw]] languages
* [[East Cushitic languages]] (including Oromo, Somali, Sidamo, and Afar)
* [[South Cushitic languages|South Cushitic]] or Rift languages (including [[Iraqw language|Iraqw]]-[[Alagwa language|Alagwa]], [[Burunge language|Burunge]], and arguably [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]])

[[Robert Hetzron]] has suggested that the South Cushitic languages are a subgroup of Lowland East Cushitic. Maarten Mous, in his [[24 June]] [[2005]] oration at Leiden University, has suggested more specifically that South Cushitic be linked to the Southern Lowland East Cushitic branch, together with such languages as Oromo, the Omo-Tana languages (such as Somali), and Yaaku-Dullay. 

Richard Hayward, on the other hand, breaks up East Cushitic into three well-supported families: ''Sidamic'' or Highlands, a diverse Lowlands family (with ''Afar'', ''Somalic'', and ''Oromic'' subgroups), and ''[[Dullay language|Dullay]]'' (he apparently leaves [[Yaaku language|Yaaku]] unclassified), that he believes should be considered separately when attempting to work out the internal relationships of Cushitic. This makes for a tentative four to seven branches, depending on the status of Beja, Rift, and Yaaku. 

Cushitic was traditionally seen as also including the [[Omotic languages]], then called [[West Cushitic languages|West Cushitic]], but this view has been largely abandoned; the Omotic languages are now considered an isolated branch of Afro-Asiatic.

==Cushitic peoples==

''Cushitic'' also is used to refer to the indigenous peoples of the Horn of Africa.  ''Ethiopid'' is an equivalent, though somewhat archaic, term.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Chapter 11''' is a chapter of the Untied States [[Bankruptcy Code]] which governs the process of ''reorganization'' under the [[bankruptcy]] laws of the [[United States]].  (The Bankruptcy Code itself is Title 11 of the [[United States Code]]; therefore reorganization under bankruptcy is covered by Chapter 11 of  Title 11 of the United States Code.)  In contrast, [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] governs the process of a ''liquidation'' bankruptcy.)

==Definition==
When a troubled business decides that it is unable to service its debt or pay its creditors, it can file (or be forced by its creditors to file) with a federal bankruptcy court for bankruptcy protection under either [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] or Chapter 11.  A Chapter 7 filing means that the business intends to sell all its assets, distribute the proceeds to its creditors, and then cease operations.  A Chapter 11 filing, on the other hand, is an attempt to stay in business while a bankruptcy [[court]] supervises the &quot;reorganization&quot; of the company's [[contract|contractual]] and [[debt]] obligations.  The court can grant complete or partial relief from most of the company's debts and its contracts, so that the company can make a fresh start.  Often, if the company's debts exceed its assets, then at the completion of bankruptcy the company's owners (stockholders) all end up with nothing &amp;mdash; all their rights and interests are terminated &amp;mdash; and the company's creditors end up with ownership of the newly reorganized company, in the hopes that it will eventually succeed financially as compensation for their losses.

==Rationale==
It is thought that the value of a typical business as a going concern is far higher than the value of the sum of its parts if the business's assets were to be sold off individually. It follows that it is more economically efficient to allow a troubled company to continue running, cancel some of its debts, and give ownership of the newly reorganized company to the creditors whose debts were cancelled; in this way, jobs are saved, assets are retained, the engine of profitability which is the business is maintained rather than being dismantled, and, hopefully, the business's creditors end up with more money than they would in a Chapter 7 liquidation.

==Details==
All creditors who register with the court can be heard by the court, which is responsible for determining whether the plan of reorganization complies with the purposes of the bankruptcy law and provides for fair and equitable treatment of all parties in interest. Priority of claims is determined by Section 507 of the Bankruptcy Code, but as a general rule secured creditors, such as some banks and [[bond (finance)|bondholders]], have a higher-priority claim on the proceeds of the sale of corporate assets than unsecured creditors, such as vendors who have not been paid for products they previously delivered to the company (and who don't have any collateral for their claim).  Once a business files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, its creditors are not allowed to attempt to collect previously incurred debts except through the bankruptcy court.  Under some circumstances, the creditors or the [[United States Trustee]] can ask the court either to convert the case to a liquidation under Chapter 7, or to appoint a trustee to manage the debtor's business. The court will grant a motion to convert to Chapter 7 or appoint a trustee if either of these actions is in the best interest of all creditors (appointment of a trustee also requires some wrongdoing or gross mismanagement on the part of existing management, and is relatively rare).

Typical debts and contracts cancelled in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy include unsecured loans and, if cancelling them would be financially favorable to the company, [[labor union|union]] contracts, supply or operating contracts (with both vendors and customers) and long-term real estate leases.

Once Chapter 11 is filed, the company may &quot;emerge&quot; from bankruptcy within a few months or within several years, depending on the size and complexity of the bankruptcy. All debtors filing Chapter 11 cases are required to propose a plan of reorganization: if the debtor fails to make a proposal, the court may consider proposals from creditors. If no plan of reorganization is approved by the court (this process is called ''confirmation'') then the court may either convert the case to a liquidation under Chapter 7 or, if in the best interests of the creditors and the estate, the case may be dismissed resulting into a return to the status quo before bankruptcy.

If the company's stock is publicly traded, a Chapter 11 filing generally causes it to be delisted from its primary stock exchange it if was listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], the [[American Stock Exchange]], or the [[NASDAQ]].  On the NASDAQ the identifying fifth letter &quot;Q&quot; at the end of a stock symbol indicates the company is in bankruptcy (formerly  the &quot;Q&quot; was placed in front of the pre-existing stock symbol; a celebrated example was [[Penn Central]], whose symbol was originally &quot;PC&quot; and became &quot;QPC&quot; after the company filed Chapter 11 in 1970).

Individuals may also file Chapter 11, but due to the complexity and expense of the proceeding, this option is rarely chosen by debtors who are eligible for Chapter 7 or [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13]] relief.

==Criticism==
Some critics have claimed that Chapter 11 bankruptcy is excessively lenient in giving a needless &quot;escape hatch' to the incompetent management of a failing company, damaging the efficiency of the economy as a whole and allowing poor managers to continue managing. It is unusual for the management of a company in Chapter 11 to be fired, as it is usually assumed that the present management team knows far more about the company and its customers than would a new set of management. These critics note that in Europe, bankruptcy law is far less lenient for failing companies.

Another efficiency criticism is that a company undergoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy is effectively operating under the &quot;protection&quot; of the court until it emerges, in some cases giving the bankrupt company a great advantage against its competitors. The most-cited current example is the [[airline industry]] in the United States; [[as of 2006]], over half the industry's [[seating capacity]] is on airlines that are in Chapter 11. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Delta and Northwest airlines both file for bankruptcy | url = http://money.cnn.com/2005/09/14/news/fortune500/bankruptcy_airlines/ | accessdate = November 17 | accessyear = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These airlines have been able to stop making debt payments, freeing up cash to expand routes or weather a price war against competitors &amp;mdash; all with the bankruptcy court's approval.  This is especially important in the airline industry as fixed capital costs for the airplanes (and the debt on those costs) make up such a large part of the airlines' expenditures.

==Statistics==
===Largest bankruptcy===
The largest bankruptcy in history was of the US telecommunications corporation [[Worldcom|Worldcom, Inc.]], which listed over 103 billion dollars in assets as of its Chapter 11 filing in 2002; the bankruptcy was triggered by the discovery that in the previous several years, the company had fraudulently overreported its assets by an estimated 12 billion dollars.

=== 2003 Statistics ===
Bankruptcy filings by individuals:

* [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] filings:  1,156,284
* Chapter 11 filings:  959
* [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13]] filings:  468,562

Bankruptcy filings by businesses:

* [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] filings:  21,008
* Chapter 11 filings:  9,185
* [[Chapter 12, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] filings:  698
* [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13]] filings:  5,201

The total number of bankruptcies rose 7.4 percent over the previous twelve months.  These totals were for the 12-month period ending [[September 30]], [[2003]].

      <comment>Added detail to the Grammatical conjugation bullet</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The word '''conjugation''' has several meanings:

*[[Grammatical conjugation]] is the modification of a [[verb]] from its basic form.
**In many [[language|languages]], such as [[latin language|Latin]] and [[spanish language|Spanish]], verbs have complex conjugation rules; in other languages, such as [[english language|English]], verb conjugation is much simpler.  See: [[Latin conjugation]], [[Spanish conjugation]] and [[English verb|The English verb]].
*In [[biology]], conjugation is transmission of [[DNA]] between [[cell (biology)|cells]] by contact other than fusion.  Various forms of conjugation exist in different groups, such as [[bacterium|bacteria]] (see [[bacterial conjugation]]) and [[ciliate]]s.  The term is derived from the use of the word for [[marriage]].
*[[Marriage]] -- derived from &quot;joining together&quot; or &quot;playing together&quot;.
*In [[mathematics]]:
**[[complex conjugation]] is the operation which multiplies the imaginary part of a [[complex number]] by -1; more generally see [[conjugate element (field theory)]].
** if ''a'' is an element of a [[group (mathematics)|group]], then the [[map (mathematics)|map]] ''f''(''x'') = ''axa''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is called conjugation by ''a''. See [[inner automorphism]], [[conjugacy class]], [[conjugate closure]], and [[conjugation of isometries in Euclidean space]]
** in [[differential geometry]], [[Glossary of Riemannian and metric geometry|Conjugate point]]s
** an operation on [[Latin square]]s
** in [[probability theory]],  [[conjugate prior]]
*In [[quantum physics]], two quantities are ''conjugates'' when they are linked by the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], such as position and [[momentum]], or [[energy]] and duration.
*In [[organic chemistry]], conjugation is the interaction between two carbon-carbon double bonds, increasing stability and thereby lowering the overall energy of the molecule. The system formed is called a [[conjugated system]].
*In [[metabolism]], conjugation is a [[biochemistry|biochemical]] process to bind a substance to an acid and thereby deactivating its biological activity, making it water-soluble, and facilitating its excretion. Thus [[steroid hormones]] can be excreted as sulfo or glucuro conjugates.
* in [[thermodynamics]], it may refer to [[Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|Conjugate variables]]

'''Conjugate''' can be:
* in [[quantum physics]], two quantities are conjugates when they are linked by the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], such as position and [[momentum]], or [[energy]] and duration
* in [[chemistry]], [[Conjugate acid]] or conjugate base
* in [[linguistics]], [[grammatical conjugation]]
* in [[biology]], '''conjugation''' is [[sexual reproduction]] involving interchange of [[DNA]] between [[cell (biology)|cells]], rather than their fusion.  Various forms of conjugation exist in different groups, such as [[bacterium|bacteria]] (see [[bacterial conjugation]]) and [[ciliate]]s.  The term is usually applied only to microscopic life-forms.

{{otheruses}}
A '''controversy''' is an [[opinion]] or opinions over which parties are actively arguing. Controversies can range from private disputes between two to large scale disagreements.

Present-day areas of controversy include [[religion]], [[politics]], [[war]], [[property]], [[social class]], [[tax|taxes]], and most recently in [[sports]]. Controversy in matters of  [[theology]] has traditionally been particularly heated, giving rise to ''[[odium theologicum]]''.

==In law==
In [[jurisprudence]], a controversy differs from a [[jurisprudence|case]]. While the latter includes all suits, [[criminal]] as well as [[Civil law (private law)|civil]], a conterversy is a purely civil proceeding.  For example, the [[Constitution of the United States]] states that &quot;the judicial Power shall extend to ... Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party&quot; ([[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article 3, Section 2]]). The meaning to be attached to the word ''Controversy'' in the constitution is that given above.

==In propaganda==
The term is not always used in a purely descriptive way. The use of the word tends itself to create controversy where none may have authentically existed, acting as a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]]. [[Propaganda|Propagandists]], therefore, may employ it as a &quot;tar-brush,&quot;  [[pejorative]]ly, and thus create a perceived atmosphere of controversy, discrediting the subject:

::&quot;Beatrix Potter's creation, Peter Rabbit...&quot;
::vs.
::&quot;Beatrix Potter's controversial creation, Peter Rabb] for a list of collating rules for Latin-based alphabets.

Languages that used a [[syllabary]] or [[abugida]] instead of an alphabet (for example, [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]]) can use approximately the same system if there is a set ordering for the symbols.

===Radical-and-stroke sorting===
[[Image:Character_Palette.png|right|246px|thumbnail|The [[Character Palette]] from [[Mac OS X]] is an example of use of radical-and-stroke sorting on a computer to provide an interface to input Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters]]

Another form of collation is '''radical-and-stroke sorting''', used for non-alphabetic writing systems such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]] logographs and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[kanji]], whose thousands of symbols defy ordering by convention. In this system, common components of characters are identified; these are called [[radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] in Chinese and logographic systems derived from Chinese.
Characters are then grouped by their primary radical, then ordered by number of pen strokes within radicals. When there is no obvious radical or more than one radical, convention governs which is used for collation. For example, the Chinese character for &quot;mother&quot; (&amp;#23229;) is sorted as a thirteen-stroke character under the three-stroke primary radical (&amp;#22899;). 

The radical-and-stroke system is cumbersome compared to an alphabetical system in which there are a few characters, all unambiguous. The choice of which components of a logograph comprise separate radicals and wich radical is primary is not clear-cut. As a result, logographic languages often supplement radical-and-stroke ordering with alphabetic sorting of a phonetic conversion of the logographs.
For example, the kanji word ''''Tōkyō'' (&amp;#26481;&amp;#20140;), the Japanese name of [[Tokyo]] can be sorted as if it were spelled out in the Japanese alphabet as &quot;to-u-ki-&lt;sub&gt;yo&lt;/sub&gt;-u&quot; (&amp;#12392;&amp;#12358;&amp;#12365;&amp;#12423;&amp;#12358;).

Nevertheless, the radical-and-stroke system is the only practical method for constructing dictionaries that someone may use to look up a logograph whose pronunciation is unknown.

===Multilingual ordering===
When lists of names or words need to be ordered, but the context does not define a particular single language or alphabet, the [[Unicode Collation Algorithm]] provides a way to put them in sequence.

==Complications==
===Compound words and special characters===
A complication in alphabetical sorting can arise due to disagreements over how groups of words (separated [[Compound (linguistics)|compound word]]s, [[name]]s, [[title]]s, etc.) should be ordered.  One rule is to remove spaces for purposes of ordering, another is to consider a [[space (punctuation)|space]] as a character that is ordered before numbers and letters (this method is consistent with ASCII-ordering), and a third is to order a space after numbers and letters.  Given the following strings to alphabetize &amp;mdash; &quot;catch&quot;, &quot;cattle&quot;, &quot;cat food&quot; &amp;mdash; the first rule produces &quot;catch&quot; &quot;cat food&quot; &quot;cattle&quot;, the second &quot;cat food&quot; &quot;catch&quot; &quot;cattle&quot;, and the third &quot;catch&quot; &quot;cattle&quot; &quot;cat food&quot;.  The first rule is used in most (but not all) [[Dictionary|dictionaries]], the second in [[Telephone directory|telephone directories]] (so that Wilson, Jim K appears with other people named Wilson, Jim and not after Wilson, Jimbo).  The third rule is rarely used.

A similar complication arises when special characters such as [[hyphen]]s or [[apostrophe]]s appear in words or names.  Any of the same rules as above can be used in this case as well; however, the strict ASCII sorting no longer corresponds exactly to any of the rules.

===Name/Surname ordering=== 
The telephone directory example sheds light on another complication.  In cultures where [[family name]]s are written after [[given name]]s, it is usually still desired to sort by family name first.  In this case, names need to be reordered to be sorted properly.  For example, Juan Hernandes and Brian O'Leary should be sorted as Hernandes, Juan and O'Leary, Brian even if they are not written this way.  Capturing this rule in a computer collation algorithm is difficult, and simple attempts will necessarily fail.  For example, unless the algorithm has at its disposal an extensive list of family names, there is no way to decide if &quot;Gillian Lucille van der Waal&quot; is &quot;van der Waal, Gillian Lucille&quot;, &quot;Waal, Gillian Lucille van der&quot;, or even &quot;Lucille van der Waal, Gillian&quot;.

In telephone directories in English speaking countries, surnames beginning with Mc are sometimes sorted as if starting with Mac and placed between &quot;Mabxxx&quot; and &quot;Madxxx&quot;.  Under these rules, the telephone directory order of the following names would be: Maam, McAllan, Macbeth, MacCarthy, McDonald, Macy, Mboko.

===Abbreviations and common words===
When abbreviations are used, it is sometimes desired to expand the abbreviations for sorting.  In this case, &quot;St. Paul&quot; comes before &quot;Shanghei&quot;.  Obviously, to capture this behavior in a collation algorithm, we need a list of abbreviations.  It may be more practical in some cases to store two sets of strings, one for sorting and one display.  A similar problem arises when letters are replaced by numbers or special symbols in an irregular manner, for example 1337 for [[leet]] or the movie ''[[Seven (movie)|Se7en]]''.  In this case, proper sorting necessitates keeping two sets of strings.

In certain contexts, very common words (such as [[article (grammar)|article]]s) at the beginning of a sequence of words are not considered for ordering, or are moved to the end.  So &quot;[[The Shining]]&quot; is considered &quot;Shining&quot; or &quot;Shining, The&quot; when alphabetizing and therefore is ordered before &quot;[[Summer of Sam]]&quot;.  This rule is fairly easy to capture in an algorithm, but many programs rely instead on simple lexicographic ordering.  One fairly quaint exception to this rule, is the flying of the flag of [[Republic of Macedonia |The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]]; at the [[United Nations]], between those of [[Thailand]], and [[East Timor |Timor Leste]].

===Numerical sorting of strings===
Sometimes, it is desired to order text with embedded numbers using proper numerical order.  For example, &quot;Figure 7b&quot; goes before &quot;Figure 11a&quot;.  This can be extended to [[Roman numeral]]s. This behavior is not particularly difficult to produce as long as only integers are to be sorted, although it can slow down sorting significantly.  

For example, [[Windows XP]] does this when sorting [[file name]]s (much to the annoyance of some people who are used to a simple lexicographic ordering).  Sorting decimals properly is a bit more difficult, due to the fact that different locales use different symbols for a [[decimal separator|decimal point]], and sometimes the same character used as a decimal point is also used as a separator, for example &quot;Section 3.2.5&quot;.  There is no universal answer for how to sort such strings; any rules are application dependent.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Several [[United States]] laws have been called the '''Civil Rights Act''':

* [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]] aimed to buttress Civil Rights Laws to protect freedmen and to grant full  citizenship to those born on U.S. soil except [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]]s. While President [[Andrew Johnson]] vetoed the bill, the veto was overridden by [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]].
* [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]] was also known at the time as the &quot;[[Ku Klux Klan]] Act&quot; because one of main reasons for its passage was to protect southern blacks from the KKK by providing a civil remedy for abuses then being committed in the south.
* [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]] guaranteed [[African American|blacks]] the same treatment as [[whites]] in certain public places.

[[Image:Cola.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Cola]]
A '''cola''' is a sweet [[Carbonation|carbonated]] drink, usually with [[caramel]] coloring and containing [[caffeine]]. 
The flavor of the [[soft drink]] sometimes comes from a mixture of [[vanilla]], [[cinnamon]],
and [[citrus]] flavorings. The name comes from the [[kola nut]]s that were originally used as the source of caffeine.

The drink may also be caffeine-free, and although some people disagree on calling such a drink a ''cola'', neither the cola companies themselves nor the vast majority of cola drinkers would make such a distinction.  
Cola drinks are generally sweetened with [[corn syrup]], but may be sweetened with [[sugar]] or an [[artificial sweetener]].

Major brands of cola include [[Coca-Cola]], [[Pepsi]], [[R.C. Cola|Royal Crown]], [[Virgin Cola]] and various local producers. [[Jolt Cola]] also has a dedicated cult following (especially with college students or young professionals who have to meet tight deadlines), as it has a particularly high caffeine content (about 200 mg/L, compared with about 110-130 mg/L for Pepsi and Coca-Cola and 320 mg/L in non-cola [[energy drink]] [[Red Bull]]).  Among colas, German brand [[Afri-Cola]] had a higher caffeine content until the product was relaunched with a new formulation in 1999. [[Inca Kola]] is another brand that is marketed in many countries by the [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca Cola group]]; it is the major cola in some South American countries. [[TuKola|tuKola]] and Tropicola are brands from [[Cuba]]; the former is also sold in [[Italy]]. [[Star cola]] is a brand from Gaza-Palestine marketed by Mecca Cola and Zam Zam Cola.{{fact}}
There is also an [[open source]] recipe for a cola drink, [[OpenCola]].

In 2002 a new brand, [[Mecca Cola]], aimed at [[Muslim]] customers (with the slogan ''Think Muslim, Drink Muslim''), was launched in [[France]] by Tawfik Mathlouthi. It is inspired by Iranian [[Zam Zam Cola]]. The product became available in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 2003.  Some of the profits are directed to the Palestinian cause, and to domestic charities.  &lt;!--[Source: Channel 4 News, 8 Jan 03]--&gt; A similar product with a similar concept, [[Qibla Cola]], was launched in 2003 in the UK. [[Cola Turka]], a [[Turkey|Turkish]] brand, and [[Zelal Cola]] are also popular among the Muslim community in [[Germany]].

The '''Capability Maturity Model''' (CMM) is a method for evaluating and measuring the maturity of the [[software development process]] of organizations on a scale of 1 to 5.

The CMM was developed by the [[Software Engineering Institute]] (SEI) at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]]. It has been used extensively for [[avionics software]] and for government projects since it was created in the mid-1980s.

A maturity model is a structured collection of elements that describe characteristics of effective processes.

A maturity model provides:
* a place to start
* the benefit of a community’s prior experiences
* a common language and a shared vision
* a framework for prioritizing actions
* a way to define what improvement means for your organization

A maturity model can be used as a benchmark for assessing different organizations for equivalent comparison.

The SEI has subsequently released a revised version known as the '''Capability Maturity Model Integration''' (CMMI).

== History ==

=== Context ===

The term '''software''' originates from the idea that software is easy to change (&quot;soft&quot;) in comparison to hardware, which was more difficult to change (&quot;hard&quot;). Another theory: software is ''soft'' in the sense that it is not tangible, unlike hardware, which we can replace and touch.  In the [[1970s]], the field of [[software development]] saw significant growth as more organizations began to move to computerized information systems.  With this significant growth, two events began unfolding.

The first event was that computerized information systems became commonplace and improved computer hardware allowed for more ambitious information system projects.  Along with the improved computer hardware, new technologies and manufacturing processes resulted in cheaper, more reliable, and more flexible computer platforms and peripherials which in turn encouraged the use of information systems in more diverse applications.

The second event was the need for many more people to develop the software needed for the computers created by the explosion in the number of computer information systems due to the increased application of computers to organizational problems.  This in turn meant that people with little experience in the art of developing computer software moved into that area of work.  Not only was there increased demand for people to design and write computer software, there was also increased demand for people to manage these projects.

Many software projects failed due to inadequate processes and project management.  This was primarily due to two causes.  The first was software development, both the design and writing of computer software as well as the management of software development projects, did not have a large body of published work discussing software development and what work existed was not used by industry to any great extent.

The second cause was that as information systems became more commonplace and people became more ambitious in the application of computer systems to organizational problems.  Projects attempted moved from well known areas such as accounting systems or inventory systems which involved primarily numbers and the embedding of an abstract model into a computing platform with software to applications which involved the movement of physical objects in the real world.  In addition, software development teams ran into the problem of attempting to model [[complex system]]s, such as the complete information flows of an enterprise, within information systems.  The sheer complexity of the problem lead to project failue.

During the 1970s there were a number of proponents for a more scientific and professional practice.  People such as [[Edward Yourdon]], [[Larry Constantine]], [[Gerald Weinberg]], [[Tom DeMarco]], and [[David Parnas]] published articles and books with research results in an attempt to professionalize the software development community.

During the 1980s, [[Watts Humphrey]] published a series of works about software development processes and organizations.  From this work sprang the ongoing work at the Software Engineering Institute to provide a framework for a professional software development process and meta-process to allow organizations to develop higher quality software.

=== Origins ===

The [[United States Air Force]] funded a study at the SEI to create a model for the military to use as an objective evaluation of software subcontractors. In [[1989]], the Capability Maturity Model was published as ''Managing the Software Process''.

'''Timeline'''
* [[1987]]: SEI-87-TR-24 (SW-CMM questionnaire), released.
* [[1989]]: ''Managing the Software Process'', published.
* [[1991]]: SW-CMM v1.0, released.
* [[1993]]: SW-CMM v1.1, released.
* [[1997]]: SW-CMM revisions halted in support for CMMI.
* [[2000]]: CMMI v1.02, released.
* [[2002]]: CMMI v1.1, released .

=== Current state ===

Although these models have proved useful to many organizations, the use of multiple models has been problematic. Further, applying multiple models that are not integrated within and across an organization is costly in terms of training, appraisals, and improvement activities. The CMM Integration project was formed to sort out the problem of using multiple CMMs. The CMMI Product Team's mission was to combine three source models:

# The Capability Maturity Model for Software (SW-CMM) v2.0 draft C
# The Systems Engineering Capability Model (SECM)
# The Integrated Product Development Capability Maturity Model (IPD-CMM) v0.98
# Supplier sourcing

CMMI is the designated successor of the three source models. The SEI has released a policy to [[sunset]] the Software CMM. The same can be said for the SECM and the IPD-CMM. These models are expected to be succeeded by CMMI.

=== Future direction ===

Suggestions for improving CMMI are welcomed by the SEI. For information on how to provide feedback, see the [http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/models/change-requests.html CMMI Web site].

== Levels of the CMM ==

:(See chapter 2 of ([http://www.sei.cmu.edu/pub/documents/02.reports/pdf/02tr012.pdf March 2002 edition of CMMI&lt;sup&gt;SM&lt;/sup&gt; from SEI]), page 11.)

There are five levels of the CMM. According to the SEI,
:''&quot;Predictability, effectiveness, and control of an organization's software processes are believed to improve as the organization moves up these five levels. While not rigorous, the empirical evidence to date supports this belief.&quot;''

=== Level 1 - Initial === 

At maturity level 1, processes are usually ad hoc and the organization usually does not provide a stable environment. Success in these organizations depends on the competence and heroics of the people in the organization and not on the use of proven processes. In spite of this ad hoc, chaotic environment, maturity level 1 organizations often produce products and services that work; however, they frequently exceed the budget and schedule of their projects.

Maturity level 1 organizations are characterized by a tendency to over commit, abandon processes in the time of crisis, and not be able to repeat their past successes again.

=== Level 2 - Repeatable === 

At maturity level 2, Software development successes are repeatable.  The organization may use some basic [[project management]] to track cost and schedule.

Process discipline helps ensure that existing practices are retained during times of stress.  When these practices are in place, projects are performed and managed according to their documented plans.  

Project status and the delivery of services are visible to management at defined points (for example, at major milestones and at the completion of major tasks).

Basic project management processes are established to track cost, schedule, and functionality. The necessary process discipline is in place to repeat earlier successes on projects with similar applications.

=== Level 3 - Defined === 

At maturity level 3, processes are well characterized and understood, and are described in standards, procedures, tools, and methods.

The organization’s set of standard processes, which is the basis for level 3, is established and improved over time. These standard processes are used to establish consistency across the organization. Projects establish their defined processes by the organization’s set of standard processes according to tailoring guidelines.

The organization’s management establishes process objectives based on the organization’s set of standard processes and ensures that these objectives are appropriately addressed.

A critical distinction between level 2 and level 3 is the scope of standards, process descriptions, and procedures. At level 2, the standards, process descriptions, and procedures may be quite different in each specific instance of the process (for example, on a particular project). At level 3, the standards, process descriptions, and procedures for a project are tailored from the organization’s set of standard processes to suit a particular project or organizational unit.

=== Level 4 - Managed === 

Using precise '''measurements''', '''management''' can effectively control the software development effort.  In particular, management can identify ways to adjust and adapt the process to particular projects without measurable losses of quality or deviations from specifications.

Subprocesses are selected that significantly contribute to overall process performance. These selected subprocesses are controlled using statistical and other quantitative techniques.

Since a really systematic correspondence can hardly be accidental, if we can rule out alternative possibilities like massive borrowing, the correspondence can be attributed to common descent. If there are many regular correspondence sets of this kind (the more the better), and if they add up to a sensible pattern (one that could have been produced by known types of sound change), and if some of the correspondences are non-trivial (''t : t'' is trivial but ''{{IPA|ŋ}} : b'' is not), then common origin becomes a virtual certainty.

===3. Discover which sets are in complementary distribution===

During the time the comparative method was being developed (late 18th to late 19th century), two major developments occurred which improved the method's effectiveness.

First, it was found that many sound changes are conditioned by a particular '''context'''.  Thus for example, in both Greek and Sanskrit, an aspirated stop evolved into an unaspirated one, but only if a second aspirate occurred later on in the same word; this is the so-called &quot;[[Grassmann's law]]&quot;, known to the ancient Indian grammarians and promulgated as a historical discovery by [[Hermann Grassmann]].

Second, it was found that sometimes sound changes occurred in ''contexts that were later lost''.  For instance, in Sanskrit [[velar]]s (''k''-like sounds) were replaced by [[palatal]]s (''ch''-like sounds) whenever the following vowel was ''*i'' or ''*e'' (the asterisk means that the sound is inferred rather than historically documented).  Subsequent to this change, all instances of ''*e'' were replaced by ''a'' (or, more accurately, earlier ''*e'', ''*o'', and ''*a'' merged as ''a'').  The situation would probably have been unreconstructable, had not the original distribution of ''e'' and ''a'' been recoverable from the evidence of other Indo-European languages.  Thus, for instance, Latin ''que'', &quot;and,&quot; preserves the original ''e'' vowel that caused the consonant shift in Sanskrit:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| (1)
| ''*ke''
| Pre-Sanskrit &quot;and&quot;
|-
| (2)
| ''*ce''
| Velars replaced by palatals before ''*i'' and ''*e''
|-
| (3)
| ''ca''
| ''*e'' becomes ''a''
|}

''Ca'' is the attested Sanskrit form for &quot;and.&quot;  This finding was made independently by several scholars during the 1870's.

In the [[Dravidian languages]] of [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], velar [[plosive]]s in [[Proto-Dravidian language|Proto-Dravidian]] have been replaced by the corresponding palatal if the velar plosive is followed by {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/iː/}}, {{IPA|/e/}} or {{IPA|/eː/}}. However this change is absent in [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and few other languages in the family. For example, Proto-Dravidian ''*kedi'' becomes Tamil ''chedi'', but Kannada ''gida''.

[[Verner's Law]], discovered by [[Karl Verner]] in about 1875, is a similar case: the voicing of consonants in [[Germanic languages]] underwent a change that was determined by the position of the old Indo-European accent.  Following the change, the accent shifted across the board to initial position. Verner solved the puzzle by comparing the Germanic voicing pattern with data from Greek and Sanskrit accent. For full discussion, see [[Verner's Law]].

This stage of the comparative method, therefore, involves examining the correspondence sets discovered in step 2 and seeing which of them apply only in certain contexts. If two (or more) sets involve identical or similar sounds, and apply in [[complementary distribution]], then the sets can be assumed to reflect a single original phoneme. This is because &quot;some sound changes, particularly conditioned sound changes, can result in a proto-sound being associated with more than one correspondence set&quot; (Campbell 2004:136).

To take another example, when we examine the [[Romance languages]], descended from Latin, we find two different correspondence sets which both involve ''k'':

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!
! [[Italian language|Italian]]
! [[Spanish language|Spanish]]
! [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]
! [[French language|French]]
|-
| (1)
| ''k''
| ''k''
| ''k''
| ''k''
|-
| (2)
| ''k''
| ''k''
| ''k''
| ''{{IPA|ʃ}}''
|}

What we do in this situation is try to see if the two sets occur in complementary distribution (in which case they reflect a single proto-phoneme) or if both occur in identical environments (in which case they must both reflect separate proto-phonemes). In this case, we discover that French ''{{IPA|ʃ}}'' only occurs before ''a'' in the other languages (which becomes ''{{IPA|ɛ}}'' in French), while French ''k'' occurs elsewhere. Both sets (1) and (2) can therefore be assumed to reflect a single proto-phoneme (in this case ''*k'', spelled &lt;c&gt;).

A more complex case involves consonant clusters in [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]], which have been notoriously difficult to reconstruct. The Algonquianist [[Leonard Bloomfield]], however, looked at the reflexes of the clusters in four of the daughter languages of Proto-Algonquian, and came up with the following correspondence sets (although the clusters are shown here ending in ''-k'', this also generally applies to clusters ending in any of the plosives; &lt;š&gt; and &lt;č&gt; are [[Americanist phonetic notation|Americanist]] symbols for {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/ʧ/}}):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!
! [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]
! [[Fox language|Meskwaki]]
! [[Cree language|Plains Cree]]
! [[Menominee language|Menomini]]
|-
| (1)
| ''kk''
| ''hk''
| ''hk''
| ''hk''
|-
| (2)
| ''kk''
| ''hk''
| ''sk''
| ''hk''
|-
| (3)
| ''sk''
| ''hk''
| ''sk''
| ''čk''
|-
| (4)
| ''šk''
| ''šk''
| ''sk''
| ''sk''
|-
| (5)
| ''sk''
| ''šk''
| ''hk''
| ''hk''
|}

Although all 5 correspondence sets overlap with one another in various places, they are not in complementary distribution, and so Bloomfield recognized that a different cluster must be reconstructed for each set (his reconstructions were, respectively, ''*hk'', ''*xk'', ''*čk'', ''*šk'', and ''çk'' (the modern reconstructions for these clusters are ''*hk'', ''*tk'', ''čk'', ''šk'', and ''rk'', respectively, and two more clusters, reconstructed as ''{{IPA|*ʔk}}'' and ''{{IPA|ɬk}}'', are recognized).

===4. Reconstruct proto-phonemes===

This step tends to be much more subjective than the previous ones. A linguist here has to rely mostly on their general intuitions about what types of sound changes are likely and which are unlikely. For example, the voicing of voiceless plosives between vowels is an extremely common sound change, occurring in languages all over the world, which the devoicing of voiced plosives between vowels is extremely uncommon. Therefore, if a linguist were comparing two languages with a correspondence of ''-t-'' : ''-d-'' between vowels, they would reconstruct the proto-phoneme as being ''*-t-'', and assume that it became voiced to ''-d-'' in the second language (unless they had a very good reason not to). 

It is important to keep in mind, however, that there are sometimes changes that are extremely unexpected. The Proto-Indo-European word for &quot;two,&quot; for example, is reconstructed as ''*duwō'', which is reflected in [[Armenian language|Classical Armenian]] as ''erku''. Several other cognates demonstrate that the change ''*d-'' → ''erk-'' in the history of Armenian was a regular one. Similarly, in Bearlake, a dialect of the [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan language]] of [[Slavey language|Slavey]], there has been a sound change of Proto-Athabaskan ''*ts'' → Bearlake ''{{IPA|kʷ}}''.  Obviously, ''*d-'' did not change directly into ''erk-'' and ''*ts'' did not change directly into ''{{IPA|kʷ}}'', but they instead must have gone through several intermediate steps to arrive at the later forms. The lesson here is that with enough sound changes, a given sound can change into just about any other sound. This is why it is not '''phonetic similarity''' which matters when utilizing the comparative method, but '''regular sound correspondences'''.

Another assumption used in determining a proto-phoneme is that our reconstruction should ideally involve as few sound changes as possible to arrive at the modern reflexes in the daughter languages. In other words, unless there is persuasive evidence to the contrary, we should reconstruct for a proto-phoneme whatever value is the most common reflex in the daughter languages. For example, in the [[Algonquian languages]], we find the following correspondence set:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]
! [[Mi'kmaq language|Mi'kmaq]]
! [[Cree language|Cree]]
! [[Lenape language|Munsee]]
! [[Blackfoot language|Blackfoot]]
! [[Arapaho language|Arapaho]]
|-
| ''m''
| ''m''
| ''m''
| ''m''
| ''m''
| ''b''
|}

Obviously, we should reconstruct either ''*m'' or ''*b'' for this set. Both ''*m'' → ''b'' and ''*b'' → ''m'' (where &quot;*A → B&quot; means &quot;*A becomes B&quot;) are concievable sound changes, so the principle of reconstructing &quot;likely&quot; changes over &quot;unlikely&quot; ones is not useful here. Instead, linguists note that the reflex of this proto-phoneme is ''m'' in five of the languages compared here, and ''b'' in one of them. If we reconstruct ''*b'', we need to assume five separate changes of ''*b'' → ''m'', whereas if we reconstruct ''*m'', we only need to assume a single change of ''*m'' → ''b'' in one language in the family. Since we are working on the assumption that our reconstructions should require the fewest number of changes possible to arrive at the modern reflexes, we would obviously reconstruct ''*m'' here.

===5. Examine the reconstructed system typologically===

In the final step, the linguist takes all the proto-phonemes they have reconstructed using steps 1-4, and checks to see how the system fits with what is currently known about [[linguistic typology|typological constraints]]. For example, if the reconstructed phonemes fit together in the following system, the linguist would be suspicious, because languages generally (though not always) tend to maintain symmetry in their phonemic inventories:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! &amp;nbsp; p &amp;nbsp;
! &amp;nbsp; t &amp;nbsp;
! &amp;nbsp; k &amp;nbsp;
|-
! &amp;nbsp; b &amp;nbsp;
!
! 
|-
!
! &amp;nbsp; n &amp;nbsp;
! &amp;nbsp; ŋ &amp;nbsp;
|-
!
! &amp;nbsp; l &amp;nbsp;
!
|}

In this reconstructed system, there is only one voiced plosive, ''*b'', and although there is an [[apical]] and velar [[nasal]], ''*n'' and ''*ŋ'', there is no corresponding [[labial]] nasal. In this case, we would have to return to step 4 and reevaluate our earlier conclusions. In this case, we would try to figure out if there is any evidence to suggest that what we earlier reconstructed as ''*b'' is actually ''*m'', or evidence that what we earlier reconstructed as ''*n'' and ''*ŋ'' are actually ''*d'' and ''*g''.

Even a symmetrical system can be typologically suspicious. For example, the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] plosive inventory, as traditionally reconstructed, is as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!
![[Labial]]s
![[Apical]]s
![[Velar]]s
![[Labiovelar]]s
|-
![[Voiceless consonant|Voiceless]]
| align=center|p
| align=center|t
| align=center|k
| align=center|{{IPA|kʷ}}
|-
![[Voiced consonant|Voiced]]
| align=center|(b)
| align=center|d
| align=center|g
| align=center|{{IPA|gʷ}}
|-
![[Voiced consonant|Voiced]] [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]
| align=center|{{IPA|bʱ}}
| align=center|{{IPA|dʱ}}
| align=center|{{IPA|gʱ}}
| align=center|{{IPA|gʷʱ}}
|}

Lately, however, a number of linguists have argued that this system is, at best, very suspicious typologically. It extremely unlikely, or maybe even impossible, they say, for a language to have a voiced aspirated ([[breathy voice]]) series without a corresponding voiceless aspirated series. These linguists therefore argue, on typological grounds, that we need to reevaluate the traditional reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European. A potential solution was provided by [[Thomas Gamkrelidze]] and [[Vyacheslav V. Ivanov]], who argued that the series traditionally reconstructed as plain voiced should in fact be reconstructed as [[Glottalization|glottalized]] — either [[implosive]] {{IPA|(ɓ, ɗ, ɠ)}} or [[ejective]] {{IPA|(pʹ, tʹ, kʹ)}}. The plain voiceless and voiced aspirated series would thus be seen as just voiceless and voiced, with aspiration being a non-distinctive quality of both. This has become known as the [[Glottalic theory|Glottalic Theory]], and although it has not yet become accepted, it does have a large number of proponents, and is an excellent example of the application of linguistic typology to linguistic reconstruction

The reconstruction of proto-sounds and their historical transformations enables us to proceed further: we can compare grammatical morphemes (word-forming affixes and inflectional endings), patterns of declension and conjugation, and so on. The full reconstruction of an unrecorded protolanguage can never be complete (for example, proto-[[syntax]]  is far more elusive than [[phonology]] or [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and all elements of linguistic structure undergo inevitable erosion and gradual loss or replacement over time), but a consistent partial reconstruction can and must be attempted as proof of genetic relationship.

==Weaknesses of the comparative method==

While most historical linguists continue to use the comparative method, many of them now also recognize quite a few serious weaknesses in the method. In recent years, alternatives to the comparative method have been proposed (see [[Mass lexical comparison]]), in part due to percieved problems inherent to the method.

===The Neogrammarian Hypothesis===
The first weakness of the comparative method is the fundamental Neogrammarians' assumption that &quot;sound laws have no exceptions&quot;.  This assumption is problematic even on theoretical grounds: the very fact that different languages evolved according to different sound-change laws seems to indicate a degree of arbitrariness in language evolution.  Moreover, once one accepts that sound changes may be conditioned by context according to rather complicated rules, one opens the door for &quot;laws&quot; that may affect only a few words, or even a single word; which is logically equivalent to admitting exceptions to the broader laws. This problem has led some critics to a radically opposite position, summarized by the maxim &quot;each word has its own history.&quot;

====Borrowings and random mutations====
Even the Neogrammarians recognized that, apart from the general sound change laws, languages are also subject to borrowings from other languages and other ''sporadic changes'' (such as irregular inflections, compounding, and abbreviation) that affect one word at a time, or small subsets of words.

While borrowed words should be excluded from the analysis, on the grounds that they are not ''genetic'' by defintion, they do add noise to the data, and thus may hide systematic laws or distort their analysis.  Moreover, there is the danger of circular reasoning — namely, of assuming that a word has been borrowed solely because it does not fit the current assumptions about the regular sound laws.

The other exceptions to the sound laws are a more serious problem, because they occur in generic language transmission.  One example of such a sporadic change, with no apparent logical reason, is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for &quot;word,&quot; ''palabra''. By regular sound changes from Latin, it should have become ''parabola'', but the ''r'' and ''l'' changed places by sporadic [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]]).

In principle, As those sporadic changes accumulate, they will increasingly obscure the systematic sound laws, and eventually prevent the recognition of the genetic relationship between languages, or lead to incorrect reconstructions of proto-languages and incorrect family trees.

====Analogy====
A source of sporadic changes that was recognized by the  Neogrammarians themselves was [[analogy (linguistsics)|analogy]], in which a word is sporadically changed to be closer to another word in the lexicon which is perceived as being somehow related to it. For example, the [[Russian language|Russian]] word for &quot;nine,&quot; by regular sound changes from [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]], should have been {{IPA|/nʲevʲatʲ/}}, but is actually {{IPA|/dʲevʲatʲ/}}.  It is believed that the initial ''{{IPA|nʲ-}}'' changed to ''{{IPA|dʲ-}}'' due to influence of the word for &quot;ten&quot; in Russian, {{IPA|/dʲesʲatʲ/}}.

====Gradual application====
More recently, [[William Labov]] and other linguists who have studied contemporary language changes in detail have discovered that even a systematic sound change is at first applied in an unsystematic fashion, with the percentage of its occurrence in a person's speech dependent on various social factors.  Often the sound change begins to affect some words in a language, and then gradually spreads to others. These observations considerably weaken the Neogrammarians axiom that &quot;sound laws have no exceptions.&quot;

===Problems with the tree model===
Another weakness of the comparative method is its reliance on the so-called &quot;Tree Model&quot; (German ''Stammbaum''). In this model, daughter languages are seen as branching out from the proto-language, gradually growing more and more distant from the proto-language through accumulated phonological, morpho-syntactical, and lexical changes; and possibly splitting into further daughter languages. This model is usually representd by upside-down tree-like diagrams. For example, here is a diagram of the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] family of languages, spoken throughout the southern and western [[United States]] and [[Mexico]]:

[[Image:Uto-Aztecan Family Tree.jpg|none|720px|center]]

(Families are in '''bold''', individual languages in ''italics''. Not all of the branches and languages are shown, for lack of space.)

====The Wave Model====
Unfortunately, the tree model does not reflect the reality of how languages change. Since languages change gradually, there are long periods in which different dialects of a language, as they evolve into separate languages, remain in contact with one another and influence each other. Even once they are completely separated, languages which are near to one another will continue to influence each other, often sharing grammatical, phonological, and lexical innovations. A change in one language of a family will often spread to neighboring languages; and multiple waves of change may partially overlap like waves on the surface of a pond, across language and dialect boundaries, each with its own randomly delimited range (Fox 1995:129) The following diagram illustrates this conception of language change, called the ''Wave Model'':

[[Image:Wave_Model_Schmidt.jpeg|none|300px|center]]

This is a serious challenge to the comparative method, which is entirely based on the assumption that each language has a single &quot;genetic&quot; parent, and hence that the genetic relationship between two languages is due to their descent from a common ancestor.

===Non-uniformity of the proto-language===
Another assumption implicit in the methodology of the comparative method is that the proto-language is uniform. However, even in extremely small language communities there are always [[Dialect|dialect differences]], whether based on area, gender, class, or other factors (the Pirahã language of Brazil is spoken by only several hundred people, but has at least two different dialects, one spoken by men and one by women, for example). Therefore, the single proto-language reconstructed by the comparative method is, in all likelihood, a language which never existed.

===Creoles===
Another potential problem for the comparative method is the phenomenon of [[creole language]] formation, where essentially a new language is formed from a complicated combination of two languages that are not closely related. The [[papiamentu]] language, spoken in the [[Caribbean]], is a notable example.  In these events, the new language may end up with a lexicon and phonology which is derived from both parent languages, in varying proportions; while the grammar (morphology and syntax) is partly inherited, and partly the result of local innovation.  Often function words from one of the parent languages are inherited, but used for a completely different function in the creole.  

Creole formation seems to be a fairly common phenomenon. Dozens of such events have been documented in the last 500 years, in the wake of European colonial expansion, and many more must have happened along the fringes of past empires.  While the comparative method may be able to detect the existence of a genetic relation between the creole and the parent languages (or between two creoles with shared parents), the reconstructed &quot;proto-language&quot; is likely to be a thoroughy artificial construct.

===Subjectivity of the reconstruction===
While the identification of systematic sound correspondences between known languages is failry objective, the reconstruction of their common ancestral language is inherently subjective.  In the proto-Algonquian example above, the choice of ''m'' as the parent phoneme is only ''likely'', not ''certain''. It is quite possible that a proto-Algonquian language with ''b'' in those locations split into two branches, one which preserved ''b'' and one with ''m'' instead; and while the first originated only the Arapaho, the second spread out wider and  originated all the other Algonquian tribes.  (Such dramatic asymmetries in the growth of different branches of the same tree are actually common; contrast for example the Romance and Celtic branches of Indo-European.) It is also possible that the nearest common ancestor of the Algonquian languages used some other sound intead, such as ''p'', which eventually mutated to ''b'' in one branch and to ''m'' in the other.  

Since the reconstruction of a proto-language involves many of these choices, the probability of making a wrong choice is very high.  That is, any reconstructed proto-language is ''almost certainly'' incorrect; it is an artificial construct that is accepted by convention, not by rigorous proof.  These hidden errors take their toll when two reconstructed proto-languages are compared in order to build large family trees.

===Assessment===
In view of these weaknesses, we must be wary of the reconstructions and trees obtained with the comparative method. Most linguists, however, continue to use it, although they now recognize its flaws. Fox (1997:141-2), for example, concludes: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The Comparative Method ''as such'' is not, in fact, historical; it provides evidence of linguistic relationships to which we may give a historical interpretation. ...The interpretative processes must therefore weight up the evidence provided by the Comparative Method in conscious knowledge of these weaknesses, and in the light of other relevant considerations, if they are to give historical validity to the reults. ...Our interpretation of the findings of the method have doubtless changed as more has been learnt of the historical processes involved, and this has probably made historical linguists less prone to equate the idealizations required by the method with historical reality. ...Provided we keep [the interpretation of the results and the method itself] apart, the Comparative Method can continue to be used in the reconstruction of earlier stages of languages.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Releases==

===Inventories of click releases===

There are seven known click releases, not counting slapped or egressive clicks. These are ''bilabial affricated'' {{IPA|ʘ}}, or &quot;bilabial&quot;; ''laminal denti-alveolar affricated'' {{IPA|ǀ}}, or &quot;dental&quot;; ''apical (post)alveolar plosive'' {{IPA|ǃ}}, or &quot;alveolar&quot;; ''laminal postalveolar (palato-alveolar) plosive'' {{IPA|ǂ}}, or &quot;palatal&quot;; ''subapical postalveolar (retroflex)'' {{IPA|ǃ˞}} (rare); and two lateral clicks, which in the only language known to distinguish them are ''laminal denti-alveolar lateral'' {{IPA|ǁ̻}} and ''apical postalveolar lateral'' {{IPA|ǁ̺}}. No language is known to have more than five of these.

==Click loss==
We do not know how clicks first arose, and the development of clicks from other consonants has never been observed, but it seems likely that they arose from consonant clusters of some type. 

However, several still vibrant languages demonstrate click loss. For example, the [[List_of_Khoisan_languages#East_Tshu-Khwe|East Tshu-Khwe languages]] have lost a large percentage of their clicks, presumably due to [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] influence. Generally a click is replaced by a consonant that retains the [[manner of articulation]] of the accompaniment. Alveolar click releases {{IPA|ǃ}} tend to simply drop out, leaving a velar stop or affricate such as {{IPA|k, ɡ, ŋ, k͡x}}, while palatal clicks {{IPA|ǂ}} leave behind a palatal stop such as {{IPA|c, ɟ, ɲ, c’}}, or a post-alveolar affricate {{IPA|ʧ, ʤ}}, and dental clicks {{IPA|ǀ}} tend to leave an alveolar affricate {{IPA|ʦ}} behind. That is, in the latter cases the resulting consonant retains the manner of the accompaniment but the [[place of articulation|place]] of the release.

This article relates to the novel, [[The Cider House Rules]] by [[John Irving]]. [[The Cider House Rules (film)]] is also a [[1999]] [[film]] starring [[Tobey Maguire]] and [[Michael Caine]], directed by [[Lasse Hallström]].

==Plot of The Cider House Rules==
{{spoiler}}
Homer Wells, an un-adopted [[orphan]], is the book's central protagonist; Homer grew up in an orphanage directed by Dr. Wilbur Larch. Dr. Larch is also secretly an [[abortion]]ist, and believes that he is doing the world a service because &quot;one way the [[poor]] can help themselves would to be in control of the size of their families.&quot; Dr. Larch also refers to abortion as &quot;The Lord's Work&quot; and trains Homer in the realm of gynecology/abortions in a paternal way. The novel continues as Homer decides to leave the orphanage with Candy Kendall and her boyfriend Wally Worthington, a young couple who work at the Worthington family apple orchard. Wally leaves to fight in [[World War Two]], but his plane is shot down over [[Burma]]. Believing Wally to be dead, Homer and Candy have an affair and Candy subsequently becomes [[pregnant]]. Candy secretly gives birth to a boy named Angel at the orphanage (the first child to go home with its mother). Wally is found alive, so Candy and Homer return home, lying to the family about Angel's parentage (they claim that Homer decided to adopt him). Wally and Candy [[marry]] shortly afterwards. Many years later, when Angel is a teenager, he makes friends with Rose Rose, the daughter of Mr. Rose, a migrant worker. Rose Rose becomes pregnant with her father's child, and Homer performs an abortion on her. Homer decides to return to the orphanage after the [[death]] of Dr. Larch, and works as the new director. Homer and Candy eventually tell Angel that they are his biological parents.

The novel also follows a sub-plot of Melony, Homer's fellow orphan, and her [[lesbian]]-lover, Lorna.

==Controversy==
The novel clearly takes a pro-choice stance on abortion. Dr. Larch, the novel's primary abortion-advocate, feels strongly towards the &quot;[[left]]&quot; on the subject because he believes an infant who is unwanted is too emotionally painful for the mother and the child. Homer is initially reluctant with the subject, but understands Dr. Larch's perception when he must perform an abortion on Rose Rose. The novel also introduces [[adoption]] as an alternative.

Many [[pro-life]] groups contend that the uncommon scenario of a father-daughter [[rape]] is not a strong argument for the legalization of all abortions. The novel also takes on many other cases of an abortion being a necessary option for a woman, including the extremely poor, [[prostitutes]] who are incapable of raising a child, and in one instance a young woman who had a botched abortion and died after her &quot;abortionist&quot; left the [[crochet]] needle in her uterus. Irving uses her as an example for people who are going to perform their own &quot;back alley&quot; abortions and need medical assistance for their own safety. Pro-life organizations state that the novel is [[pro-choice]] propaganda, and the assumption that Homer will grow up to be a [[moral]] man if he performs abortions is a poor image.

'''Consumers''' are [[individual]]s or [[household]]s that consume [[Good (economics)|goods and services]] generated within the [[economic system|economy]].  Since this includes just about everyone, the [[term]] is a political term as much as an economic term when it is used in everyday speech.  Typically when businesspeople and economists talk of ''consumers'' they are talking about ''person as consumer'', an aggregated [[commodity]] item with little [[individuality]] other than that expressed in the buy not buy [[decision]]. However there is a [[trend]] in [[marketing]] to individualize the concept. Instead of generating broad [[demographic profile]]  and [[psychographic profile]]s of [[market segment|market segments]], marketers are engaging in [[personalized marketing]], [[permission marketing]], and [[mass customization]]. 

A consumer is assumed to have a [[budget]] which can be spent on a [[range]] of [[Product (business)|goods and services]] available on the [[market]]. Under the assumption of [[rationality]], the budget allocation is chosen according to the [[preference]] of the consumer, i.e. to maximize his or her [[utility]] function.

In 'time series' [[model (abstract)|models]] of consumer behaviour, the consumer may also [[investment|invest]] a [[proportion]] of their budget in order to gain a greater budget in [[future]] [[period]]s. This [[investment]] [[choice]] may include either [[fixed rate]] [[interest]] or risk-bearing [[security|securities]].

In the [[context]] of [[mental health]], consumer is also a term applied to describe a [[person]] living with [[mental illness]].

Concern over the best interests of consumers has spawned much activism, as well as incorporation of consumer [[education]] into the [[school]] [[curriculum]].  There are many non-profit publications available to assist in consumer education such as [[Consumer Reports]] or [[Choice Magazine]].

Within many [[sales|selling]] [[company (law)|companies]] as well as debt-management consultants consumer has come to be a derogatory term which means an unintelligent buyer of poorly made clothing and plastic or metallic items. Consumer could also be seen as an offensive term, implying that both an adult and a child's only function is to buy (consume) a product and discard it after only a short period of time.

'''Cactus''' is the name given to any member of the [[flowering plant]] family [[Cactaceae]]. Cacti are almost exclusively [[New World]] plants. This means that they are native only in [[North America]], [[South America]], and the [[West Indies]]. There is however one exception, ''Rhipsalis baccifera''; this species has a pantropical distribution, occurring in the [[Old World]] in tropical [[Africa]], [[Madagascar]] and [[Sri Lanka]] as well as in tropical America. This plant is thought to be a relatively recent colonist in the Old World (within the last few thousand years), probably carried as seeds in the digestive tracts of [[bird migration|migratory]] [[bird]]s. Many other cacti have become naturalized to similar environments in other parts of the world after being introduced by people.

[[Image:Cactus1web.jpg|thumb|left|Many species of cactus have long, sharp spikes.]]
Many [[succulent plant]]s in both the Old and New World
bear a striking resemblance to cacti, and are often called &quot;cactus&quot; in common usage.
This is, however, due to [[parallel evolution]];
none of these are closely related to the Cactaceae.
One distinct identifying characteric of the Cactus family
is the [[areole]], a specialized structure from which spines and new shoots grow.

Cacti are believed to have evolved in the last 30 to 40 million years. Long ago, the Americas were joined to the other continents, but separated due to [[continental drift]]. Unique species in the New World must have developed after the continents had moved apart. Significant distance between the continents was only achieved around in the last 50 million years. This may explain why cacti are so rare in Africa; the continents had already separated when cacti [[evolve|evolved]].

[[Image:Cactus flower02.jpg|thumb|left|Cactus Flower]]
Like other succulents, cacti are well-adapted to life with little [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. The [[leaf|leaves]] have evolved into [[spine (biology)|spines]], which in addition to allowing less water to evaporate than regular leaves, defend the cactus against water-seeking animals. [[Photosynthesis]] is carried out by enlarged [[Plant stem|stems]], which also store water. Unlike many other succulents, the stem is the only part of a true cactus where this takes place. Very few members of the family have leaves, and when present these are usually rudimentary and soon fall off; they are typically awl-shaped and only 1-3 mm long. Two genera, ''Pereskia'' and ''Pereskiopsis'', do however retain large, non-succulent leaves 5-25 cm long, and also non-succulent stems; they are possibly primitive genera, thought to be closely similar to the plants that cacti evolved from.

Cacti come in a wide range of shapes and sizes. Some grow to great size. Some cacti produce beautiful [[flower]]s, which like spines and branches arise from [[areole]]s. Many cactus species are night-blooming, as they are [[pollen|pollinated]] by [[nocturnal]] [[insect]]s or small animals, principally [[moth]]s and [[bat]]s. Cacti range from small and round to pole-like and tall, such as the [[Saguaro]].

A number of cactus species are cultivated for use as houseplants, as well as for ornamental gardens. They often form part of [[xeriscaping|xerophilic (dry) gardens]] in arid regions. Some cacti bear edible fruit.

==Etymology==
The word ''cactus'' is ultimately derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] Κακτος ''kaktos'', used in classical Greek for a species of spiny [[thistle]], possibly the [[cardoon]], and used as a generic name, ''Cactus'', by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in 1753 (now rejected in favor of ''Mammillaria''). There is some dispute as to the proper plural form of the word; as a Greek loan into English, the correct plural in English would be &quot;cactuses&quot;. However, as a word in [[Botanical Latin]] (as distinct from [[Classical Latin]]) &quot;cactus&quot; would follow standard Latin rules for pluralization and become &quot;cacti&quot;, which has become the prevalent usage in English.

s demonstrating usage.

Any dictionary has been designed to fulfil one or more functions. The dictionary functions chosen by the maker(s) of the dictionary provide the basis for all lexicographic decisions, from the selection of entry words, over the choice of information types, to the choice of place for the information (e.g. in an article or in an appendix). There are two main types of function. The communication-oriented functions comprise text reception (understanding), text production, text revision, and translation. The knowledge-oriented functions deal with situations where the dictionary is used for acquiring specific knowledge about a particular matter, and for acquiring general knowledge about something. The optimal dictionary is one that contains information directly relevant for the needs of the users relating to one or more of these functions. It is important that the information is presented in a way that keeps the [[lexicographic information cost]]s at a minimum.

==History==

The art and craft of writing dictionaries is called [[lexicography]].  

One of the earliest dictionaries known, and which is still extant today in an abridged form, was written in [[Latin]] during the reign of the emperor [[Augustus]].  It is known by the title &quot;De Significatu Verborum&quot; (&quot;On the meaning of words&quot;) and was originally compiled by [[Verrius Flaccus]].  It was twice abridged in succeeding centuries, first by [[Festus]], and then by [[Paul the Deacon]].  Verrius Flaccus' dictionary was an abridged list of difficult or antiquated words, whose usage was illustrated by quotations from early Roman authors.

''[[Shuo Wen Jie Zi]]'' (说文解字), written in the early [[2nd century]], was the first [[Chinese language]] dictionary. The author [[Xu Shen]] first organized [[Chinese characters]] by [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]].

The first true English dictionary was the ''[[Table Alphabeticall]]'' of [[1604]], although it only included 3,000 words and the definitions it contained were little more than synonyms. The first one to be at all comprehensive was [[Thomas Blount (Lexicographer)|Thomas Blount]]'s dictionary ''Glossographia'' of [[1656]].  This was followed by [[Samuel Johnson]]'s famous and more complete dictionary of [[1755]].

In [[1806]], Noah [[Webster's Dictionary|Webster's dictionary]] was published by the G&amp;C Merriam Company of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] which still publishes ''Merriam-Webster'' dictionaries, but the term ''Webster's'' is considered generic and can be used by any dictionary.

The most complete dictionary of the English language is the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]. The first edition was properly begun in 1860 and was completed in 1928, by which time a supplement that took an additional five years to complete was already necessary.

==Miscellaneous==

The Irish mathematical physicist, [[John Lighton Synge|J. L. Synge]], created a game, [[Game of Circ]], to emphasize the circular reasoning implicit in the defining process of any standard dictionary.

'''Daffodils''' form a group of large-[[flower]]ed members of the genus ous]]'', of being ''[[vagueness|vague]]'', or a combination of the two.  Most words are, in fact, both ambiguous and vague.  This is not a skeptical or even a controversial claim; to say that many, or perhaps even most, words are both ambiguous ''and'' vague is not to say that they have no meaning.  It is to say, first, that many individual words have many distinct senses; and, second, that those senses are often, in ordinary language, not meant to be exhaustively precise.  A word that is both ambiguous and vague, whose extreme limits are fuzzy and undefined, can still contain a rich fund of meaning.

== A definition of 'definition'==

Suppose we have decided to define a certain word or a concept associated with that word.  Suppose also that we have identified ''which sense'' of the word we are interested in, and we have noted clear cases, some unclear cases, and some borderline cases of the application of the word.  The question then is: how can this word be defined?  What is desired here is a description of the ''intension'' of the word: that is, an account of the set of properties that characterizes all and only members of the extension.  In that case, it seems the following is a serviceable account of the meaning of '(intensional) definition':
:The ''definition'' of a [[concept]], or of (a given sense of) a word or phrase, is a [[description]] of its [[intension]]&amp;mdash;that is, the set of [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] that characterizes all and only members of the [[extension (semantics)|extension]] of the word; the extension is all the things that the concept, word, or phrase applies to.
Some philosophers have criticisms of this sort of definition of the word ''definition''; or perhaps it would be better to say that some philosophers think that it is, for various reasons, impossible to give exhaustively exact definitions of most concepts, words, and phrases.  Two prominent critics are [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] and [[W. V. Quine|Quine]].  Still most philosophers acknowledge that in philosophy something similar to giving definitions of important philosophical concepts is necessary.

== ''A contribution to defining the term 'definition''' ==

Minimum Intent: The following definition of the term 'definition' is presented as a reference, (a comparator, a norm) that must not be violated when defining scientific terms.
 
Axioms: 

1) ‘Something’ is a term that has a most general meaning, it can mean anything (but it does not automatically include ‘everything’).

2) 'Ambient' is anything in the vicinity of, and, to a certain degree, within something.
 
3) ‘Event’ is something that can be distinguished from its ambient. 

4) ‘Relation’ is something that has, at least, two events. 

5) ‘System’ is something that has at least two relations.

6) ‘Phenomenon’ is a generic term (hypernym) for the above terms,  providing that one or several of  human senses indicate (directly or indirectly, presently or in the past) the existence of a so-termed system, relation, event, ambient, or something else.

7) All other terms used within this theorem - apart from the term “definition” and the terms listed in inverted commas under 1) to 6) above - are already intrinsically known; the understanding of each of these terms is consistent with this treatise. 
 
Theorem: 

&quot;Definition&quot; is a fixed, static form (a model; an appearance of something as distinguished from the substance of which it is made; something autonomous from its own representation) of some relation(s) that significantly increases the probability of realisation of an intended (premeditated) change of some phenomenon. Such a change is to be achieved by an entity that is capable of utilising this definition for such a specified purpose. A definition cannot be generated, or used, without the existence of a system, which is organised and structured above a certain level of chaos. However, once it is generated and recorded, a definition can continue to exist (to be recorded) without the existence of the mentioned entity. A definition should be complemented with a minimum intent statement: a context that delimits a minimum domain of purposes for which it can be used. This statement does not exclude the possibility of using the same definition correctly for some other purpose. However, this extended use must not violate (contradict) an already established meaning; e.g. it must not cause synonymy or homonymy.
 
In addition, a definition must be complemented with axioms, with one or more examples, and, when needed and possible, with figures and animated representations.

Definitions are the bits necessary to construct and communicate knowledge. A definition is built up of structural components: pieces of information. Information is conveyed by means of signals of various kinds; the most frequently used include figures and terms. Although terms can be transferred by means of figures, they can also be transferred by means of sounds which are registered by the hearing senses. It is worth noting that information media can be mutually translated, e.g. visual info can be translated into information received by tactile or hearing senses. A history of the media used to record information reveals a variety of options. Alphabetic writing (in which consonant and vowel sounds are presented by letters or other symbols such as Braille characters and Morse code) is the most widespread system, but it is not the earliest, nor is it the only one. Writing has evolved from an extension of pictures that iconically represented some thing or action and then the word that bore that meaning. This approach led to so-called character script, such as that of Chinese, in which each word is represented by a separate symbol. 
 
Contemporary definitions rely heavily on textual formulations, but figures are also very efficient at conveying comprehensive information; many sciences (e.g. mathematics, chemistry) have accepted ideograms to convey sophisticated notions. The optimal solution is an appropriate combination of text, figures, animation and sound.

The following definition is presented to provide an example of a definition:

“Figure”: (n) an arrangement of points made within two-dimensional space to present a visual static impression (a perception) of something (e.g., a figure printed on a book page, showing the front view of a home). [http://proceedings.informingscience.org/InSITE2004/090spuzi.pdf Spuzic S and Nouwens F (2004) &quot;A Contribution to Defining the Term ‘Definition’&quot;, Issues in Informing Science and Information Technology Education, Volume 1 (2004) pp 645 - 662]

==Quotation==
''&quot;Nothing is more usual than for philosophers to encroach on the province of grammarians, and to engage in disputes of words, while they imagine they are handling controversies of the deepest importance and concern.&quot;'' &amp;mdash; [[David Hume]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Disruption''' generally refers to the normal workings of something being interrupted. 

*In [[Scotland]], the '''[[Disruption of 1843]]''' refers to the divergence from the [[Church of Scotland]] of the [[Free Church of Scotland]]
*'''[[Dismemberment|Disruption]]''' as a method of [[execution (legal)|execution]] consists of tying each leg of the victim to [[horse]]s or other animals, to two [[winch]]es or other pulling machines, such as the [[rack]], or to two small trees that have been bent down to the ground and then releasing the trees to spring up or pulling simultaneously with the animals or machines so that the body of the execution victim is pulled apart. One celebrated victim of such an execution was Queen [[Brunhilda of Austrasia]], who, on her nephew's orders, was subjected to horrific extension on the rack for three days, before suffering final dismemberment between four horses.

*In [[Korea]], during the periods of 12th and 18th century, there was a form of punishment that was called &quot;Neung Ji Cheo Cham&quot; that would involve four hooved animals (ox, horse), and a criminal. The victim's legs and arms would each be tied to the four animals separately, and on one instance, all animals would be commanded or whipped to run in opposite directions, thereby literally 'tearing' the victims body in 5 pieces (two legs, two arms and the torso)

*[[Information security]] specialists also may refer to a disaster as a '''disruption''' when an event interrupts normal business or technical processes.
*[[Disruption (of adoption)|Disruption]] is also the term for the cancellation of an [[adoption]] of a child before it is legally completed. In common usage, though, it refers also to the legal procedure for ending an adoption already completed, which is technically known as [[dissolution]].
*Disruption is a method of disabling an explosive device by shooting it with water at high velocity.

      <comment>/* Rock versus disco  That last paragraph soo doesn't fit. Nice, but utterly unessisary.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{disco}}

'''Disco''' is a genre of music that originated in [[discothèque]]s.  Generally the term refers to a specific style of music and [[dance]]. 

==Origins==
[[Image:Discofeverstamp.jpg|right|200px]]
As with all such musical genres, defining a single point of disco's development is difficult, as many elements of disco music appear on earlier records (such as the [[1971]] theme from the film ''[[Shaft (1971 film)|Shaft]]'' by [[Isaac Hayes]]) (Jones and Kantonen, 1999). In general it can be said that first true disco songs were released in [[1973]], however, many consider [[Manu Dibango]]'s 1972 ''Soul Makossa'' the first disco record (Jones and Kantonen, 1999). Initially, most disco songs catered to a nightclub/[[dancing]] audience only, rather than general audiences such as [[radio]] listeners, but there are many aspects proving opposite tendencies as well; popular radio-hits were being played in discothèques, as long as they had an easy to follow rhythmic base-pattern close to 120 BPM (beats per minute).

Musical influences include [[funk]], [[soul music]], and [[salsa (music)|salsa]] and the Latin or Hispanic musics which influenced salsa.

Soul and funk records that influenced disco include:

*[[Sly and the Family Stone]] - &quot;[[Dance to the Music (song)|Dance to the Music]]&quot; (1968), &quot;[[Everyday People]]&quot; (1968) (Jones and Kantonen, 1999), &quot;Family Affair&quot; (1971)
*[[Hugh Masekela]] - &quot;Grazing in the Grass&quot; (1968)
*[[Honey Cone]] - &quot;Want Ads&quot; (1971), &quot;Stick Up&quot; (1971)
*[[Isaac Hayes]] - &quot;Shaft&quot; (1971)
*[[Incredible Bongo Band]] - &quot;Bongo Rock&quot; (1973) (ibid)
*[[Eumir Deodato]] - &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot; (1973)
*[[Average White Band]] - &quot;Pick Up the Pieces&quot; (1974), &quot;Cut the Cake&quot; (1975) (ibid)
*[[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]] - &quot;Get Up (I Feel Like Being A) Sex Machine&quot; (1970), &quot;Get Up, Get Into It, Get Involved&quot; (1971), &quot;Get Up Off of That Thing&quot; (1975) (ibid)

The [[Motown Sound]] also featured many elements that would be associated with the disco sound:
*[[Martha &amp; The Vandellas]] &quot;Dancing In The Street&quot; (1963) 
*[[The Supremes]] - &quot;[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]&quot; (1966), &quot;Reflections&quot; (1967)
*[[Jackson 5]] - &quot;[[I Want You Back]]&quot;, &quot;[[ABC (song)|ABC]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Love You Save]]&quot;, &quot;[[Mama's Pearl]]&quot; (1969-71)
*[[Stevie Wonder]] - &quot;Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday&quot; (1969), &quot;Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm Yours&quot; (1970), &quot;Superstition&quot; (1972), &quot;Higher Ground&quot; (1973) (ibid)
*[[Diana Ross]] - &quot;[[Ain't No Mountain High Enough]]&quot; (1970)

[[Philadelphia International Records]] defined [[Philly soul]] and helped define disco (ibid) with records such as:
*[[The Three Degrees]] - &quot;When Will I See You Again&quot; (1973) (ibid)
*[[The Intruders]] - &quot;I'll Always Love My Mama&quot; (1973) (ibid)
*[[The O'Jays]] - &quot;Love Train&quot; (1972), &quot;For the Love of Money&quot; (1974), &quot;I Love Music&quot; (1975) (ibid)
*[[MFSB]] - &quot;[[TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)]]&quot; (1973), &quot;Love is the Message&quot; (1973) (ibid)

Pre-/Early-disco [[TK Records]] tracks:
*[[Betty Wright]] - &quot;Clean Up Woman&quot; (1972) (ibid)
*[[George McCrae]]- &quot;Rock Your Baby&quot; (1974) (ibid)
*[[KC and the Sunshine Band]] - &quot;Get Down Tonight&quot; (1975), &quot;That's the Way (I Like It)&quot; (1975), &quot;(Shake Shake Shake) Shake Your Booty&quot; (1976) (ibid)

Early-disco hits include:
*[[Nelson James]] - &quot;I Have An Afro&quot; (1972) (ibid)
*[[Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes]] - &quot;The Love I Lost&quot; (1973) (ibid)
*[[Love Unlimited Orchestra]] - &quot;Love's Theme&quot; (1973) (ibid)
*[[The Jackson 5]]- &quot;Dancing Machine&quot; (1974) (ibid)
*[[Barry White]] - &quot;I'm Gonna Love You Just a Little More, Baby&quot; (1973), &quot;Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe&quot; (1974), &quot;You're the First, the Last, My Everything&quot; (1975) (ibid)
*[[Shirley and Co.]] - &quot;Shame, Shame, Shame&quot;  (1975) (ibid)
*[[Hues Corporation]] - &quot;Rock the Boat&quot; (1974) (ibid)

*[[Dalida]]- &quot;J'Attendrai&quot; (the first French disco song and first hit in Europe) (1975) (ibid)
*[[LaBelle]] - &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; (1975) (ibid)
*[[The Four Seasons]] - &quot;Who Loves You&quot; and &quot;December '63 (Oh What A Night!)&quot; (1975) (ibid)
*[[Silver Convention]] - &quot;Fly Robin Fly&quot; (1975), &quot;Get Up and Boogie&quot; (1976) (ibid)
*[[Andrea True Connection]]- &quot;More More More&quot; (1976) (ibid)

==Popularity==
[[1975]] was the year when disco really took off, with hit songs like [[Van McCoy]]'s &quot;[[The Hustle]]&quot; and [[Donna Summer]]'s &quot;Love To Love You Baby&quot; reaching the mainstream. 1975 also marked the release of the first [[disco mix]] on album, the A side of [[Gloria Gaynor]]'s ''Never Can Say Goodbye'' (Jones and Kantonen, 1999). Disco's popularity peaked in the so-called Disco era of [[1977]] - [[1980]], driven in part by the [[1977]] classic film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]''.  Disco also gave rise to an increased popularity of [[Line dance|line dancing]] and other partly pre-choreographed dances; many line dances can be seen in films such as ''Saturday Night Fever'', which also features the [[Hustle (dance)|Hustle]].

In [[1975]], the pop star [[Dalida]] was the first to make disco music in France with her song &quot;J'attendrai&quot; which was a big hit there as well as in Canada and Japan in [[1976]]. She also released many other disco hits between [[1975]] and [[1981]], including &quot;Monday, Tuesday... Laissez-moi danser&quot; in [[1979]], translated the same year as &quot;Let Me Dance Tonight&quot; for the USA, where she was their &quot;French diva&quot; since her late-[[1978]] performance at the [[Carnegie Hall]]). Soon after [[Dalida]]'s pioneering French disco work, other French artists recorded disco: [[Claude François]], in [[1976]] with his song &quot;Cette année-là&quot; (a cover of [[The Four Seasons]]' disco hit &quot;December 1963 (Oh what a night)&quot;), then the famous &quot;yé-yé&quot; French pop singer [[Sheila]], with her group [[B. Devotion]], who even had a hit in the USA (a rarity for French artists) with the song &quot;Spacer&quot; in [[1979]]. Many other European artists also recorded disco music.

==Popular disco artists==
[[Image:Saturday night fever.jpg|thumb|left|Saturday Night Fever]]
The most popular disco artists of the 1970s include [[The Bee Gees]], [[A Taste of Honey (band)|A Taste of Honey]],  [[Cerrone]], [[ABBA]], [[Chic]], [[Sister Sledge]], [[The Jacksons]], [[Claudja Barry]], [[Linda Clifford]], [[Teri DeSario]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Stephanie Mills]], [[Carol Williams]], [[Sylvester James|Sylvester]], [[Gloria Gaynor]], [[Boney M]], [[Village People]], [[K.C. and the Sunshine Band]], [[Vicki Sue Robinson]], [[MFSB]], [[Loleatta Holloway]], [[France Joli]], [[Evelyn King|Evelyn 'Champagne' King]], [[Yvonne Elliman]], [[Tavares (music group)|Tavares]], [[Salsoul Orchestra]], [[Phyllis Hyman]], [[The Emotions]], [[Thelma Houston]], [[Cheryl Lynn]], [[The Trammps]], [[Love and Kisses]], [[Barry White]], [[Silver Convention]], [[Kool &amp; the Gang]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Dalida]], and [[Machine (disco artist)]]. However, many disco fans would agree that, &quot;for every chart hit pounded into the public's consciousness, fifty far superior tracks from all over the world were being played at some hard-to-find basement club&quot; (Jones and Kantonen, 1999). There appeared many non-disco artists, which included [[The Eagles]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], [[The Grateful Dead]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Cher (entertainer)|Cher]], [[Barry Manilow]],  [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Leif Garrett]], [[Toto (band)|Toto]], [[Chaka Khan]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[Billy Preston]], [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[Electric Light Orchestra]], [[The Pointer Sisters]], [[Elton John]], [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Prince]], [[Helen Reddy]], [[Carly Simon]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Earth, Wind and Fire]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]] (with the bass guitar riffs emulating those of Chic in their hit ''[[Another One Bites The Dust]]''), [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], [[Bryan Adams]], as well as veteran entertainers such as [[Paul Anka]], [[Ann-Margret]], [[Charo]], [[Frankie Avalon]], [[Engelbert Humperdinck]], [[Ethel Merman]], [[Wayne Newton]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Andy Williams]], and [[Frank Sinatra]].

Many disco novelty songs sold well and were popular. [[Rick Dees]], at the time a radio DJ in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], recorded what is considered to be one of the most popular parodies of all time, ''[[Disco Duck]]''.

==DJs and producers==
Disco music diverged from the [[rock (music)|rock]] of the [[1960s]], elevating music from the raw sound of 4-piece [[garage bands]] to refined music composed by producers who contracted local [[symphony]] and [[philharmonic]] [[orchestras]] and session musicians. For the first time in three decades, orchestral music became the preeminent sound in the popular-music scene. Top disco music producers included [[Patrick Adams]], [[Biddu]], [[Cerrone]], [[Alec R. Costandinos]], [[John Davis]], [[Gregg Diamond]], [[Kenneth Gamble]], [[Norman Harris]], [[Leon Huff]], [[Sylvester Levay]], [[Ian Levine]], [[Mike Lewis]], [[Van McCoy]], [[Meco Monardo]], [[Tom Moulton]], [[Boris Midney]], [[Vincent Montana Jr]], [[Randy Muller]], [[Freddie Perren]], [[Laurin Rinder]], [[Richie Rome]], [[Warren Schatz]], [[Harold Wheeler]], and [[Michael Zager]], whose roles involved every aspect of production, from composing the arrangements to conducting the 50- to 100-member orchestras from [[Los_Angeles (orchestra)|Los Angeles]] to [[New_York (orchestra)|New York]], from [[Chicago (orchestra)|Chicago]] to [[Philadelphia (orchestra)|Philadelphia]], from [[Detroit (orchestra)|Detroit]] to [[Miami (orchestra)|Miami]], from [[London (orchestra)|London]] to [[Berlin (orchestra)|Berlin]], from [[Vancouver (orchestra)|Vancouver]] to [[Montreal (orchestra)|Montreal]], from to [[Paris (orchestra)|Paris]] to [[Milan (orchestra)|Milan]].

With as many as 64 [[sound_recording|track]]s of vocals and instruments to be compiled into a fluid composition of verses, bridges, and refrains, complete with [[orchestral build]]s and [[break (music)|break]]s, the mixing engineers became an important fixture in the production process, and, as a result, were most influential in developing the &quot;sound&quot; of the recording through the [[disco mix]]. Record sales were often dependent on, though not guaranteed by, floor play in clubs. Notable DJs include [[Jim Burgess]], [[Walter Gibbons]], [[John &quot;Jellybean&quot; Benitez]], [[Rick Gianatos]], [[Francis Grasso]] (Sanctuary), [[Larry Levan]] (Paradise Garage), [[Ian Levine]] (Heaven), John Luongo, and [[David Mancuso]] (The Loft).

==Instrumentation==
Instruments commonly used by disco musicians included the rhythm [[guitar]] (most often played in &quot;chicken-scratch&quot; style, usually through a [[wah-wah]] or [[phaser]]), [[bass guitar|bass]], [[piano]] and electroacoustic keyboards (most important: the [[Fender-Rhodes]] and [[Wurlitzer]] electric pianos and the [[Hohner Clavinet]]), [[harp]], [[synthesizer|string synth]], [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]], [[trumpet]], [[saxophone]], [[trombone]], [[clarinet]], [[flugelhorn]], [[Horn (instrument)|French horn]], [[tuba]], [[English horn]], [[oboe]], [[flute]], [[piccolo]], and [[drums]], [[timpani]], as well a [[drum kit]].  [[Electronic drum]]s were making a debut during this era, with Simmons and [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[sound module|drum modules]] appearing as pioneers in electronic percussion.  Most disco songs have a steady [[four-on-the-floor (music)|four-on-the-floor]] beat (sometimes using a 16-beat pattern on the [[hi-hat]] cymbal, or an eight-beat pattern with an open hi-hat on the &quot;off&quot; beat) and a heavy, syncopated bassline. 

In general, the difference between a disco, or any dance song, and a rock or popular song is that in dance music the bass hits &quot;[[four to the floor]]&quot;, at least once a beat (which in 4/4 time is 4 beats per measure), whereas in rock the bass hits on one and three and lets the snare take the lead on two and four. (Michaels, 1990) Disco is further characterized by a sixteenth note division of the quarter notes established by the bass as shown in the second drum pattern below, after a typical rock drum pattern:

[[Image:Characteristic rock and disco drum patterns.PNG|550px|Characteristic rock and disco drum patterns]]

This sixteenth note pattern is often supported by other instruments such as the rhythm guitar (lead guitar parts are rare), and may be implied rather than explicitly present, often involving [[syncopation]]. As a simpler example, bass lines often use the following rhythm:

[[Image:Characteristic disco bass rhythm.PNG|550px|Characteristic disco bass rhythm]]

The orchestral sound usually known as &quot;disco sound&quot; relies heavily on strings and horns playing linear phrases, in unison with the soaring, often reverberated vocals or playing instrumental fills, while electric pianos and chicken-scratch guitars create the background &quot;pad&quot; xtended while the rest of the letter was reduced, resulting in an angled stroke and loop. The angled stroke then developed into a vertical stroke.

==Usage==

The letter D generally takes the [[voiced alveolar plosive]] value, [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|/d/}} in most languages that use the Roman alphabet, including [[English language|English]]. In [[Welsh language|Welsh]] d when doubled (dd) has the value {{IPA|/ð/}}, like English ''th'' in ''this''.

Digraphs of D are rare in English, although other languages use DH or DD for a [[voiced dental fricative]] (some [[Celtic languages]]) or an aspirated [[voiced dental plosive]] (some [[Indo-Aryan languages]]), or use [[affricate|affricates]] DZ, DV, or DZH.

In [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]], the sound {{IPA|/d/}} means ''a little bit'', from the ancient use of the character &amp;#30340; (in the phrase &quot;&amp;#20800;&amp;#30340;&quot;) in [[Chinese written language]]. Since &amp;#30340; is no longer used in this way, [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong residents]] invented a new character &amp;#21874; (which is not supported in many Chinese systems), or simply write '''D''' instead.

      <comment>stigma already has its own article; clarify distinction between digamma as number and stigma</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Table_Greekletters|letter=digamma2}}

{{Otheruses4|the Greek letter|the mathematical function|digamma function}}

'''Digamma''' (upper case {{polytonic|&amp;#988;}}, lower case {{polytonic|&amp;#989;}}) is an archaic letter of the [[Greek alphabet]], used primarily as a [[Greek numeral]].

The letter had the phonetic value [[Voiced labial-velar approximant|/w/]].  Its original name is unknown, but was probably {{polytonic|&amp;#988;αυ}} (wau).  It was later called 'digamma' (double [[gamma (letter)|gamma]]) because of its shape.  It is attested in archaic and dialectal [[Ancient Greek language|ancient Greek]] [[inscription]]s, and is occasionally used as a symbol in later Greek mathematical texts.

It is also used as the [[Greek numeral]] 6.  In ancient usage, the numeral had the same form as the letter digamma.  However, in medieval and modern usage, the numeral has normally been written in the graphic form of a [[stigma (letter)|stigma]] ({{polytonic|&amp;#986;}}, {{polytonic|&amp;#987;}}), which historically is completely distinct from digamma; it is a medieval [[Ligature (typography)|ligature]] of [[sigma (letter)|sigma]] and [[tau (letter)|tau]].  To complete the confusion, in modern times, the sequence &amp;sigma;&amp;tau; or &amp;Sigma;&amp;Tau; is sometimes used instead of the stigma symbol.

Digamma, like [[Upsilon|Y]], derives from the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] letter [[Waw (letter)|Waw]], and in its turn gave rise to the [[Roman alphabet|Roman letter]] [[F (letter)|F]].

==The sound [w] in Greek==

The sound [w] existed in Mycenean Greek, as attested in [[Linear B]] and archaic Greek inscriptions using digamma.  It is also confirmed by the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] name of [[Troy]], Wilusa, corresponding to the Greek name *Wilion.  The sound was lost at various times in various dialects, mostly before the classical period. 

In [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]], [w] had probably disappeared before [[Homer]]'s epics were written down ([[7th century BC]]), but its former presence can be detected in many cases because its omission left the [[meter (poetry)|meter]] defective. An example is the word {{polytonic|ἄναξ}} (king) found in the [[Iliad]], which would originally have been [wanaks]. Also {{polytonic|&amp;omicron;&amp;#7990;&amp;nu;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf;}} (wine) was used in the meter where a word starting with a consonant would be expected. Further evidence coupled with cognate-analysis shows that {{polytonic|&amp;omicron;&amp;#7990;&amp;nu;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf;}} was earlier [woinos] (cf. [[Latin language|Latin]] ''vinum'' and [[English language|English]] &quot;wine&quot;).

'''Digamma Club''' was the original name of the Fox Club, a [[Harvard University]] [[final club]].

[[Image:Dilbert-animated.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Dilbert'' animated series, [[The Virtual Employee (Dilbert episode)|episode 212]]]]
'''''Dilbert''''' is a popular [[United States of America|American]] [[comic strip]]. Written and drawn by [[Scott Adams]], the comic is known for its heavily [[satire|satirical]] [[humor]] about a [[white-collar]], [[micromanage]]d [[office]], featuring the [[engineer]] [[Dilbert (character)|Dilbert]] as the [[title role|title character]]. The strip has run in newspapers since [[April 16]], [[1989]], spawning several books, an [[Dilbert#Animated series|animated television series]], a [[computer game]], and hundreds of Dilbert-themed [[merchandising|merchandise]] items.  Adams has also received the [[National Cartoonist Society]] [[Reuben Award]] and Newspaper Comic Strip Award in 1997 for his work on the strip. Dilbert appears in 2500 newspapers worldwide in 65 countries and 19 languages with over 150 million fans.

==Themes==
The comic strip originally revolved around the engineer [[Dilbert (character)|Dilbert]] and his &quot;pet&quot; dog [[Dogbert]], with most action taking place in their home.  Many plots revolved around Dilbert's engineer nature or his bizarre inventions. These alternated with plots based on Dogbert's [[megalomania]]cal ambitions.  Later on, the location of most of the action moved to Dilbert's workplace at a large technology company, and the strip started to satirize [[Information Technology|IT]] workplace and company issues.  The comic strip's popular success is attributable to its workplace setting and themes, which are familiar to a large and appreciative audience.

''Dilbert'' portrays corporate culture as a [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]]esque world of [[bureaucracy]] for its own sake and office politics that stand in the way of productivity, where employees' skills and efforts are not rewarded, and [[busy work]] praised. Much of the humor emerges as the audience sees the characters making obviously ridiculous decisions that are natural reactions to [[management|mismanagement]].

Themes explored include:
* Engineers' personal traits
** Lack of style
** Hopelessness in [[dating]]
** Attraction to tools and technological products
* [[Esotericism]]
[[Image:Dilbert-20050910.gif|thumb|198px|Announcement of changes in company password policy. From left: the [[Pointy-Haired Boss]], [[Dilbert (character)|Dilbert]], [[Alice (Dilbert character)|Alice]], and [[Wally (Dilbert character)|Wally]]]]
* [[incompetence|Incompetent]] and [[sadism|sadistic]] management
** Scheduling without reference to reality
** Failure to reward success or penalize laziness
** Penalising employees for failures caused by bad management
** [[Micromanagement]]
** Failure to improve others' morale, lowering it instead
** Failure to communicate objectives
** Handling of projects doomed to failure or cancellation
** Sadistic [[human resources|HR]] policies with flimsy (or purely [[evil]]) rationale
* [[Corporate]] bureaucracy
* Stupidity of the general public
** Susceptibility to [[advertising]]
** Susceptibility to [[peer pressure]]
** Gullibility in the face of obvious [[scam]]s
* [[Third world]] countries and [[outsourcing]] ([[Elbonia]])
** Dilapidation
** Bizarre [[culture|cultural]] habits
** Lack of understanding of [[capitalism]]

==Characters==
The main characters in Dilbert include:
; [[Dilbert (character)|Dilbert]] : The main character in the strip, an electrical engineer. He understands engineering well and has good ideas, but has a poor social life.  

:Dilbert is a stereotypical technically-minded single male.  Neither attractive nor blessed with tremendous social graces, Dilbert is capable but ignored at work, and struggles with his romantic life.  While he is frequently seen having dates with eligible women, the dates almost invariably end in disaster, usually in surreal and bizarre ways.  Dilbert loves computers and technology and will spend much of his free time playing with such things.

:Dilbert is the strip's Everyman, albeit of a specific sort.  Despite his intelligence, Dilbert is usually doomed to having events control him; he is generally powerless at work and too inept to improve his social standing.

:Dilbert is usually pictured wearing a white dress shirt, red and black striped tie, and black pants.  Dilbert's tie, for reasons never really explained, curls upward, as if formed by a wire.  It is alluded to in the strip that the tie curving up indicates the fact he has not had sex lately.

:Dilbert's unusual name was suggested to Adams by a co-worker; Adams later found that the name likely came from a cartoon character used by the United States Navy during World War II.

; [[Dogbert]] : Dilbert's pet [[dog]]. He is a [[megalomaniac]] intellectual, planning to one day conquer the world and enslave all humans. Once he succeeded, but got bored and quit. Often seen in high ranking consultant jobs, he constantly abuses his power and fools the management of Dilbert's company.  Dogbert also enjoys pulling scams on unsuspecting, and usually dull, customers to steal their money.  However, despite Dogbert's cynical exterior, he has been known to pull his master out of some tight jams.

:Dogbert's canine nature was more emphasized during the earlier years of the strip; as the strip progressed, references to his acting like a dog became less common.  

; [[Ratbert]] : A rat formerly used as a laboratory test animal. He usually gets all the lowest and most menial jobs, i.e. temp.  Ratbert is tolerated, but never liked, by Dilbert.

; [[Catbert]] : The company's evil [[cat|feline]] Human Resources director. He derives sadistic pleasure from seeing employees worry about their jobs. Merely mentioning the term &quot;layoffs&quot; causes him to wag his tail in delight.  
; [[List of minor characters in Dilbert#Bob, Dawn, and Rex, the Dinosaurs|Bob the dinosaur]] : A dinosaur who is the wedgie enforcer at the office. He was found after Dilbert realized that dinosaurs weren't extinct, they were just really good at hiding.

; [[Pointy-Haired Boss]] : The manager of Dilbert and the other engineers. He is hopelessly incompetent at management and does not understand the technical issue but always tries to disguise this, usually by talking in [[buzzword]]s he does not understand.  The Pointy-Haired Boss's actual name is never used.  In earlier strips the Boss was depicted as a stereotypical late-middle-aged balding middle manager.  Later he developed his signature &quot;pointy hair&quot;.  This transformation occurred between the strip of September 20 (or possibly September 26), 1991, and the strip of October 21, 1991.

:The Boss treats his employees alternately with disdain or neglect; he is almost wholly [[sociopathic]], using them to his own ends irrespective of the consequences to them.  The Boss's level of intelligence varies from near-vegetative to perceptive and clever, depending on the strip's comic needs; his utter lack of ethics, however, is perfectly consistent.  The Boss believes Sociopath means the employees think he majored in Sociology; in fact he has alternately been credited with majoring in Art History (to look at naked statues) and Anthropology.  The latter claim was made by the Boss himself.

:Although he is often characterized by his minions as an &quot;idiot&quot;, he alone among them has succeeded socially, by marrying and fathering children. Not unexpectedly, his son is much like him. 

; [[Wally (Dilbert character)|Wally]] : One of the oldest engineers. He hates work and avoids it whenever he can. He is often seen carrying a cup of [[coffee]].  Wally is even more socially inept than Dilbert, and reference to his lack of personal hygiene are not uncommon.  Like the Pointy Haired Boss, Wally is utterly lacking in ethics and will take advantage of any situation to maximize his personal gain while doing the least possible amount of honest work.  Squat and balding, Wally is almost invariably portrayed wearing a short sleeved dress shirt and tie.  Adams has stated that Wally was based on a man who, due to a legal screw-up at work, could never be fired but would never get promoted.  This man was able to then become very lazy as he would not be punished for doing a bad job and would get no benefit from working hard.

; [[Alice (Dilbert character)|Alice]] : The company's most competent, and highest paid, engineer.  Alice has a huge, triangular hairstyle.  She is often frustrated at her work not getting proper recognition, which she believes (with some justification) is due to her gender. She also has a short, often violent temper, sometimes putting her &quot;Fist of Death&quot; to use, even against the Pointy Haired Boss.  Alice originally depicted a series of female characters, like Ted the Generic guy, and appeared for a time as the current Alice with a somewhat more normal hair style before, like the Boss, she finally developed her signature triangular hair.  Alice is claimed to be based upon a woman that Scott Adams worked with named Anita, who is described as sharing Alice's 'pink suit, fluffy hair, and take-no-crap attitude.'

; [[Asok (Dilbert character)|Asok]] : Pronounced &quot;Ah-shook.&quot;  A young intern. He works very hard but does not always get proper recognition.  Asok is intensely intelligent but naive about corporate life; the shattering of his illusions are frequent comic fodder.  Asok is Indian, and graduated from the [[Indian Institute of Technology]] (IIT). He does not eat, at least, beef.  The others, especially the Boss, often unwittingly trample on his cultural beliefs.  If Asok mentions this, he is normally ignored.   If Asok's reported test scores and college accomplishments are correct, he is the smartest member of the engineering team.

; [[Phil, the Prince of Insufficient Light]] : A minor [[demon]] who punishes people for small crimes by &quot;darning them to heck&quot; with his &quot;pitchspoon&quot;, a parody of [[Satan]]. Ostensibly, Phil is eventually revealed to be the Pointy-Haired Boss's brother. Adams is inconsistent with his depictions of Phil; he sometimes has horns and sometimes does not, and sometimes carries a pitchfork rather than a spoon. Adams has stated that the inconsistency is because he sometimes forgets that Phil is not supposed to have a cape, or a pitchfork.

; [[Elbonia]]ns : People from a fictional [[Fourth World]] nation, used as a parody of outsourcing. Their culture is radically different from western culture, and their [[patriarchy]] often annoys Alice. Their country is covered in waist-deep mud which they keep wet using expensive bottled water as revealed in one strip.

{{seealso|List of minor characters in Dilbert}}

==''Dilbert'' in popular culture==
The popularity of the comic strip within the corporate sector has led to the character of Dilbert being used in many business magazines and publications (he has made several appearances on the cover of ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'').

The ''[[Toronto Star]]'', Montreal's ''[[La Presse]]'', the ''[[Indianapolis Star]]'', the ''[[Providence Journal]]'', the ''[[Washingtond, purporting to show that the two countries speak different languages.  Linguists of the [[Romanian Academy]] reacted by declaring that all the Moldovan words were also Romanian words; while in Moldova, the head of the [[Academy of Sciences' Institute of Linguistics (Moldova)|Academy of Sciences' Institute of Linguistics]], [[Ion Bărbuţă]], described the dictionary as a politically motivated &quot;absurdity&quot;.

In contrast, [[spoken languages of China|spoken languages]] of [[Han Chinese]] are usually referred as dialects of one Chinese language, to promote national unity. ''The article &quot;[[Chinese_language#Language_or_language_family.3F|Is Chinese a language or a family of languages?]]&quot; has more details''.

The significance of the political factors in any attempt at answering the question &quot;what is a language? is great enough to cast doubt on whether any strictly linguistic definition, without a socio-cultural approach, is possible. This is illustrated by the frequency with which the [[Language-dialect aphorism|army-navy aphorism]] discussed at the end of the preceding section is cited.

=== The historical linguistics point of view ===

Many [[historical linguistics|historical linguists]] view every speech form as a dialect of the older medium of communication from which it developed.  This point of view sees the modern [[Romance languages]] as dialects of [[Latin]], modern [[Greek language|Greek]] as a dialect of ancient Greek, and [[Tok Pisin]] as a dialect of English.  This paradigm is not entirely problem-free.  It sees genetic relationships as paramount; the &quot;dialects&quot; of a &quot;language&quot; (which itself may be a &quot;dialect&quot; of a yet older tongue) may or may not be mutually intelligible.  Moreover, a parent language may spawn several &quot;dialects&quot; which themselves subdivide any number of times, with some &quot;branches&quot; of the tree changing more rapidly than others.  This can give rise to the situation where two dialects (defined according to this paradigm) with a somewhat distant genetic relationship are mutually more readily comprehensible than more closely related dialects.  This pattern is clearly present among the modern Romance tongues, with [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] having a high degree of mutual comprehensibility, which neither language shares with [[French language|French]], despite both languages being ''genetically'' closer to French than to each other: French has undergone more rapid change than have Spanish and Italian.

== Concepts in dialectology ==
Concepts in dialectology include:

===Mutual intelligibility===

Some have attempted to distinguish dialects from languages by saying that dialects are [[mutually intelligible languages|mutually comprehensible]] while languages are not. But this concept may not be as clear-cut as it may at first seem. [[Italian language|Italian]] speakers and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speakers, for example, may be able to understand a considerable proportion of each other's closely-related Romance languages, whereas [[Lombard]]s and [[Sicily|Sicilians]], speaking what are described as dialects of the same language, may encounter considerable barriers to mutual comprehension.

===Diglossia===

Another problem occurs in the case of [[diglossia]], used to describe a situation where, in a given society, there are two closely-related languages, one of high-prestige, which is generally used by the government and in formal texts, and one of low-prestige, which is usually the spoken [[vernacular]] tongue.  An example of this is [[sanskrit]], which was considered the proper way to speak in northern India, but only accessible by the upper class, and [[prakrit]] which was the common (and informal or [[slang]]) speech at the time.

===Dialect continuum===

A [[dialect continuum]] is a network of dialects in which geographically adjacent dialects are mutually comprehensible, but with comprehensibility steadily decreasing as distance between the dialects increases. A well-known example is the [[Afrikaans]]-[[Dutch language|Dutch]]-[[Frisian language|Frisian]]-[[German language|German]] dialect continuum, a vast network of dialects with four recognized literary standards. Although standard Dutch and German are not mutually intelligible, a chain of dialects connects them, with no break in intelligibility between any geographically adjacent dialects along the continuum. A network of dialects similarly exists among the [[Eastern Slavic languages]], among which [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] are recognized as three literary standards. The [[Serbo-Croatian language]] can also be viewed as a network of four major dialects and three literary standards. The Romance languages -- [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], Castilian [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Provençal]], [[French language|French]], [[Occitan]], [[Corsican]], [[Sardinian]], [[Sicilian]], [[Romansh]], [[Friulian]], other [[Italian_Language|Italian]] dialects, [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and others -- form another well-known continuum.

===Diasystem===

A [[diasystem]] refers to a single genetic language which has two or more standard forms. An example is [[Hindi-Urdu]] or [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which encompasses two main standard varieties, [[Urdu]] and [[Hindi]].

===Pluricentrism===

A [[pluricentric language]] is a language with several standard versions.

=== The Ausbausprache - Abstandsprache - Dachsprache framework ===

One analytical paradigm developed by professional linguists is known as the  [[Ausbausprache - Abstandsprache - Dachsprache]] framework. It has proved popular among linguists in Continental Europe, but is not so well known in English-speaking countries, especially among people who are not trained linguists.  Although only one of many possible paradigms, it has the advantage of being constructed by trained linguists for the particular purpose of analyzing and categorizing varieties of speech, and has the additional merit of replacing such [[loaded words]] as &quot;language&quot; and &quot;dialect&quot; with the [[German language|German]] terms of [[Ausbausprache]], [[Abstandsprache]], and [[Dachsprache]], words that are not (yet) loaded with political, cultural, or emotional connotations.  It may prove to be a tool helpful for enabling people to see some ancient and poisoned linguistic controversies through a different lens of perception.

'''''Digitalis''''' is a genus of about 20 species of [[herb]]aceous biennials, perennials and shrubs that was traditionally placed in the figwort family [[Scrophulariaceae]]. Due to new genetic research, it has now been placed in the much enlarged family [[Plantaginaceae]].

The term '''digitalis''' is also used for preparations containing [[cardiac glycoside]]s, particularly [[digoxin]], extracted from plants of this genus.

==General description==
The members of this genus are known in English as '''foxgloves'''. They are native to [[Europe]], northwest [[Africa]] and west and central [[Asia]]. The scientific name means &quot;finger&quot;, and refers to the ease which a [[flower]] of ''Digitalis purpurea'' can be fitted over a human fingertip. &quot;Foxglove&quot; has a similar origin, seen as a suitable glove for a [[fox]] paw.

The flowers are produced on a tall spike, are tubular, and vary in colour with species, from purple to pink, white and yellow.

The best-known species is the [[Common Foxglove]], ''Digitalis purpurea''. It is a biennial, often grown as an [[ornamental plant]] due to its [[violet (color)|violet]] [[flower]]s. The first year of growth produces only the long, basal leaves, while in the second year the erect leafy stem 0.5-2.5 m tall develops.

The [[larva]]e of the [[Foxglove Pug]] feed on the flowers of ''Digitalis purpurea''. Other [[Lepidoptera]] species feed on the leaves including [[Lesser Yellow Underwing]].

== Medicinal use ==
The use of ''[[Digitalis purpurea]]'' extract containing [[cardiac glycoside]]s for the treatment of [[heart]] conditions was first described by [[William Withering]]. In contemporary [[medicine]], a purer form of digitalis is used to strengthen cardiac contractility (it is a positive [[inotrope]]) and as an [[antiarrhythmic agent]] to regulate heart rhythm. It is therefore often prescribed for patients in [[heart failure]].

A group of pharmacologically active compounds are extracted mostly from the leaves of the second year's growth, and in pure form are referred to by common chemical names such as '''''[[digitoxin]]''''' or '''''[[digoxin]]''''', or by brand names such as ''Lanoxin'', or ''Purgoxin''.

Digitalis works by inhibiting [[sodium-potassium ATPase]], which increases intracellular [[calcium]]. The increased intracellular calcium gives a positive inotropic effect.
It also has a vagal effect on the [[parasympathetic nervous system]], and as such is used in reentrant [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s and to slow the ventricular rate during [[atrial fibrillation]]. The dependence on the vagal effect means that digitalis is not effective when a patient has a high [[sympathetic nervous system]] drive, which is the case with acutely ill persons.

Digitalis toxicity (''Digitalis intoxication'') results from an overdose of digitalis and can result in jaundiced (yellow) vision and the appearance of blurred outlines (halos), as well as [[bradycardia]] in extreme cases. Because a frequent side effect of digitalis is reduction of appetite, some individuals have abused the drug as a weight loss aid.

Digitalis is a classic example of a drug derived from a plant formerly used by folklorists and herbalists: herbalists have largely abandoned its use because of its narrow [[therapeutic index]] and the difficulty of determining the amount of active drug in herbal preparations.  Once the usefulness of digitalis in regulating pulse was understood, it was employed for a variety of purposes, including the treatment of [[epilepsy]] and other seizure disorders, now considered inappropriate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">(''The term '''dendrite''' may also refer to the metallurgical [[dendrite (metal)|dendrite]]''.)

''[http://www.dendrite.com Dendrite]'' ''is also the name of a New Jersey based provider of sales, marketing, clinical and compliance solutions and services for pharmaceutical and life sciences companies.''


In [[biology]], a '''dendrite''' is a slender, typically branched projection of a nerve cell, or [[neuron]], which conducts the electrical stimulation received from other cells to and from the cell body, or [[Soma (biology)|soma]], of the neuron from which it projects. These stimulations arrive through [[synapse]]s, which are located at various points throughout the dendritic arbor.
Dendrites were once believed to merely convey stimulation passively, without [[action potential]]s and without activation of voltage-gated [[ion channel]]s. In such dendrites the [[transmembrane potential|voltage change]] that results from stimulation at a synapse will depend on the passive cable properties of the dendrite. In excitable dendrites, [[voltage gated ion channel]]s help propagate excitatory synaptic stimulation whether or not an action potential is present in the [[axon]]. Additionally, action potentials can propagate back into the dendrites once initiated in the axon in most neurons. This backpropagating action potential is mediated by the activation of voltage-gated ion channels and can interact with synaptic input to alter the synaptic activity.

The structure and branching of a neuron's dendrites strongly influences how it integrates the input from many other neurons, particularly those that input only weakly. This integration is both &quot;temporal&quot; -- involving the summation of stimuli that arrive in rapid succession -- as well as &quot;spatial&quot; -- entailing the aggregation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs from separate branches or &quot;arbors.&quot;

The term &quot;dendrite&quot; comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''dendron'', meaning &quot;tree&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:'' This article describes the Dalai Lama lineage.  For information on the present Dalai Lama see [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso]]. For the song see [[Dalai Lama (song)]].''
[[Image:HH wave.jpg|right|thumb|260px|The [[14th Dalai Lama|14th and current Dalai Lama]], Tenzin Gyatso (born 1935) ]]
[[Image:DalaiLama-13 lg.jpg|thumb|260px|The 13th Dalai Lama, [[Thubten Gyatso]] (1876-1933)]]
In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the successive '''Dalai Lamas''' (''taa-la'i bla-ma'') form a [[tulku]] lineage of [[Gelugpa]] leaders which trace back to [[1391]]. Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama to be the present incarnation of [[Avalokitesvara]] (&quot;Chenrezig&quot; [''spyan ras gzigs''] in Tibetan), the [[bodhisattva]] of compassion. Between the [[17th century]] and [[1959]], the Dalai Lama was the head of the Tibetan government, controlling a large portion of the country from the capital [[Lhasa]].  The Dalai Lamas never had authority over every region of [[Tibet]] nor over the other sects of Tibetan Buddhism. The current Dalai Lama (the 14th) is a respected [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] religious leader and figurehead of the [[International Tibet Independence Movement]]; in English, he is often granted the [[style (manner of address)|style]] &quot;His Holiness&quot; (or HH) before his title. 

The Dalai Lama is often thought to be the head of the Gelug school, but this position officially belongs to the [[Ganden Tripa]] (''dga' ldan khri pa'') (Holder of the Throne of Ganden [''dga' ldan''], the first monastery established by [[Je Tsongkhapa|Tsongkhapa]] [''btsong-ka-pa''], founder of the Gelug). 

The [[5th Dalai Lama]], with the support of [[Gushri Khan]], a Mongol ruler of Khökh Nuur, united Tibet by force. The Dalai Lamas continued to rule in Tibet until the [[People's Republic of China]] took direct control of the region in [[1959]].  The 14th Dalai Lama then fled to [[India]] and has since maintained a [[government in exile]].  See [[History of Tibet]] for further information.

&quot;Dalai&quot; means &quot;ocean&quot; in Mongolian, and &quot;[[Lama]]&quot; (''bla ma'') is the Tibetan equivalent of the [[Sanskrit]] word &quot;[[guru]]&quot;, and so may mean &quot;teacher&quot; or &quot;[[monk]].&quot; The actual title &quot;Dalai Lama&quot; is best translated as &quot;Ocean of Wisdom&quot;; it was first bestowed by the [[Mongolia|Mongolian]] ruler [[Altan Khan]] upon Sonam Gyatso, an abbot at the Drepung monastery who was widely considered the most eminent lama of his time. Although Sonam Gyatso became the first lama to hold the title &quot;Dalai Lama&quot;, due to the fact that he was the third member of his lineage, he became known as the &quot;3rd Dalai Lama&quot;. The previous two titles were conferred posthumously upon his earlier incarnations. The title &quot;Dalai Lama&quot; is presently granted to each of the spiritual leader's sucessive incarnations (for example, The 14th Dalai Lama's next incarnation will hold the title &quot;the 15th Dalai Lama&quot;). Tibetans call the Dalai Lama ''Gyawa Rinpoche'' (''rgya ba rin po che'') meaning &quot;Precious Victor,&quot; or ''Yeshe Norbu'' (''ye shes nor bu'') meaning &quot;Wisdom Jewel&quot;. The 14th Dalai Lama, as well as each of his predecessors, are considered to be the incarnations of the Buddha of Compassion.

Upon the death of the Dalai Lama, his monks institute a search for the Lama's [[reincarnation]], or ''tulku'' (''sprul sku''), a small child. Familiarity with the possessions of the previous Dalai Lama is considered the main sign of the reincarnation.   The search for the reincarnation typically requires a few years, which results in a gap in the list of the Dalai Lamas. The reincarnation is then brought to Lhasa to be trained by the other Lamas. 

Despite its officially secular stance, the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] has claimed the power to approve the naming of high reincarnations in Tibet.  This decision cites a precedent set by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] of the [[Qing Dynasty]], who instituted a system of selecting the Dalai Lama and the [[Panchen Lama]] by means of a lottery which utilised a golden urn with names wrapped in barley balls.  Recently, this precedent was called upon to name the Panchen Lama, who is empowered to recognize the new Dalai Lama.  There is some speculation that with the death of the current Dalai Lama, the PRC will direct the selection of a successor.  The current Dalai Lama has repeatedly stated that he will never be reborn inside territory controlled by the People's Republic of China [http://www.tibet.com/DL/next-reincarnation.html], and has occasionally suggested that he might choose to be the last Dalai Lama by not being reborn at all. However, he has also stated that the purpose of his repeated incarnations is to continue unfinished work and, as such, if the situation in Tibet remains unchanged, it is very likely that he will be reborn to finish his work [http://dalailama.com/page.54.htm]. Additionally, in the draft constitution of future Tibet, the institution of the Dalai Lama can be revoked at any time by a democratic majority vote of two-thirds of the Assembly. It is also worth mentioning that the 14th Dalai Lama has stated &quot;Personally, I feel the institution of the Dalai Lama has served its purpose.&quot;[http://dalailama.com/page.54.htm].

Starting with the 5th Dalai Lama, until the 14th Dalai Lama's exile in 1959, the Dalai Lamas resided in Lhasa in the [[Potala Palace]] during winter and in the [[Norbulingka]] residence during summer. Since 1959, the Dalai Lama has resided in [[Dharamsala]] in Northern India, and the Tibetan Government in Exile has its headquarters there.

'''Danish''' (''dansk'') belongs to the [[North Germanic languages]] (also called Scandinavian languages), a sub-group of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] branch of the [[Indo-European languages]]. It is spoken by around 5.5 million people mainly in [[Denmark]] including some 50,000 people in the northern parts of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] in [[Germany]], where it holds the status of minority language. Danish also holds official status and is a mandatory subject in school in the former Danish colonies of [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]], that now enjoy limited autonomy. In [[Iceland]], which was a part of Denmark until [[1944]], Danish is still the second foreign language taught in schools (although a few learn Swedish or Norwegian instead).

The language started diverging from the common ancestor language [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] sometime during the [[13th century]] and became more distinct from the other emerging Scandinavian national languages with the first bible translation in [[1550]], establishing an [[orthography]] differing from that of [[Swedish language|Swedish]], though written Danish is usually far easier for Swedes to understand than the spoken language. Modern spoken Danish is characterized by a very strong tendency of reduction of many sounds making it particularly difficult for foreigners to understand and properly master, not just by reputation but by sheer phonetic reality.

==Classification and related languages==

Danish belongs to the East Scandinavian languages, together with Swedish. Though Norwegian is classified as a West Scandinavian language together with [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], a more recent classification based on mutual intelligibility places Icelandic and Faroese in a separate ''Insular Scandinavian'' branch while Norwegian is considered to be a ''Mainland Scandinavian'' language and grouped with Danish and Swedish. Written Danish and Norwegian [[Bokmål]] are particularly close, though the phonology and prosody of all three languages differ somewhat. Proficient speakers of any of the three languages can understand the others, though studies have shown that speakers of Norwegian generally understand both Danish and Swedish far better than Swedes or Danes understand any of the other languages.

==History==

[[Image:Old norse, ca 900.PNG|right|250px|thumb|This is the approximate extent of [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] and related languages in the early [[10th century]]. The red area is the distribution of the dialect '''Old West Norse'''; the orange area is the spread of the dialect '''Old East Norse'''. The pink area is [[Old Gutnish]] and the green area is the extent of the other [[Germanic languages]] with which Old Norse still retained some mutual intelligibility.]] In the [[8th century]], the common [[Germanic language]] of [[Scandinavia]], [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]], had undergone some changes and evolved into [[Old Norse]]. This language began to undergo new changes that did not spread to all of Scandinavia, which resulted in the appearance of two similar dialects, ''Old West Norse'' ([[Norway]] and [[Iceland]]) and ''Old East Norse'' ([[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]]). 

Old East Norse is in Sweden called ''Runic Swedish'' and in Denmark ''Runic Danish'', but until the [[12th century]], the dialect was the same in the two countries. The dialects are called ''runic'' due to the fact that the main body of text appears in the [[runic alphabet]]. Unlike [[Proto-Norse]], which was written with the [[Elder Futhark]] alphabet, Old Norse was written with the [[Younger Futhark]] alphabet, which only had 16 letters. Due to the limited number of runes, some runes were used for a range of [[phoneme]]s, such as the rune for the [[vowel]] ''u'' which was also used for the vowels ''o'', ''ø'' and ''y'', and the rune for ''i'' which was also used for ''e''.

A change that separated Old East Norse (Runic Swedish/Danish) from Old West Norse was the change of the [[diphthong]] ''æi'' (Old West Norse ''ei'') to the [[monophthong]] ''e'', as in ''stæin'' to ''sten''. This is reflected in runic inscriptions where the older read ''stain'' and the later ''stin''. There was also a change of ''au'' as in ''dauðr'' into ''ø'' as in ''døðr''. This change is shown in runic inscriptions as a change from ''tauþr'' into ''tuþr''. Moreover, the ''øy'' (Old West Norse ''ey'') diphthong changed into ''ø'' as well, as in the Old Norse word for &quot;island&quot;.

From [[1100]] and onwards, the dialect of Denmark began to diverge from that of Sweden. The innovations spread unevenly from Denmark which created a series of minor dialectal boundaries, [[isogloss]]es, ranging from [[Zealand]] to [[Svealand]].

Some famous authors of works in Danish are [[existentialism|existential]] [[philosopher]] [[Søren Kierkegaard]], prolific [[fairy tale]] author [[Hans Christian Andersen]], and playwright [[Ludvig Holberg]]. Three [[20th century]] Danish authors have become [[Nobel Prize]] laureates in [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Literature]]: [[Karl Adolph Gjellerup]] and [[Henrik Pontoppidan]] (joint recipients in [[1917]]) and [[Johannes Vilhelm Jensen]] (awarded [[1944]]).

Danish was once widely spoken in the northeast counties of England.  Many Danish derived words such as gate (gade) for street, still survive in [[Yorkshire]] and other parts of eastern England colonized by Danish [[Vikings]].  The city of [[York]] was once the Danish settlement of Jorvik.

The first translation of the [[Bible]] in Danish was published in [[1550]].

==Geographical distribution==

Danish is the [[official language]] of [[Denmark]], one of two official languages of [[Greenland]] (the other is [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]]), and one of two official languages of the [[Faroe Islands|Faeroes]] (the other is [[Faroese language|Faeroese]]). In addition, there is a small community of Danish speakers in [[Schleswig]], the portion of [[Germany]] bordering Denmark, where it is an officially recognized and protected [[regional language]]. Furthermore, it is one of the official languages of the [[European Union]].

== Dialects ==
Standard Danish (''rigsdansk'' or ''rigsmål'') is the language based on dialects spoken in and around the capital of [[Copenhagen]]. Unlike Swedish and Norwegian, Danish does not have more than one regional speech norm. More than 20% of all Danish speakers live in the metropolitan area and most government agencies, institutions and major businesses keep their main offices in Copenhagen, something that has resulted in a very homogeneous national speech norm. Though [[Oslo]] and [[Stockholm]] are quite dominant in terms of speech standards, cities like [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]], [[Gothenburg]] and the [[Malmö]]-[[Lund]] region are large and influential enough to create secondary regional norms, making the standard language more varied than is the case with Danish. The general agreement is that Standard Danish is based on a form of Copenhagen dialect, but the specific norm is, as with most language norms, difficult to pinpoint for both laymen and linguists. More distinct &quot;genuine&quot; [[dialect]]s still exist in smaller communities, but most speakers in these areas generally speak a regionalized form of Standard Danish. Usually an adaption of the local dialect to ''rigsdansk'' is spoken, though code-changing between the neutralized norm and a distinct dialect is common. 

Danish dialects are divided into three general dialect groups:

*''Østdansk'' (&quot;Eastern Danish)
*''Ødansk'' (&quot;Island Danish&quot;)
*''Jysk'' (&quot;Jutlandish&quot;)

Historically, Eastern Danish includes what is today considered Southern Swedish dialects like [[Scanian (linguistics)|Scanian]] and the dialect spoken on the island of [[Bornholm]] in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] between the coasts Sweden and Germany. The background for this lies in the loss of originally Danish provinces like [[Blekinge]], [[Halland]] and [[Skåne]] to Sweden in 1658. While many similarities can be found in Southern Swedish and the Bornholm-dialect, they are more similar to the modern national standards than to each other. The Bornholm-dialect has also maintained a distinction between three [[grammatical gender]]s, rather than just two in Standard Danish and lacks the diphthongs used in the standard language.

==Sound system==
{{main|Danish phonology}}

The sound system of Danish is in many ways unique among the world's languages. It is quite prone to considerable reduction and [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of both consonants and vowels even in very formal standard language. A rare feature is the presence of a prosodic feature called ''[[stød]]'' in Danish (lit. &quot;push; thrust&quot;), absent in some southern dialects. This is a form of laryngealization or [[creaky voice]], occasionally realized as a [[glottal stop]] (especially in emphatic pronunciation). It can be the only distinguishing feature between certain words, thus creating [[minimal pair]]s (e.g. ''bønder'' &quot;peasants&quot; with stød vs. ''bønner'' &quot;beans&quot; without). The distribution of stød in the lexicon is obviously related to the distribution of the common Scandinavian [[tone (linguistics)|tonal]] word accents found in most dialects of [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], including the national [[standard language]]s. Most linguists today believe that stød is a development of the word accents, rather than the other way round. Stød generally occurs in words that have &quot;accent 1&quot; in Swedish and Norwegian and that were monosyllabic in [[Old Norse]], while no-stød occurs in words that have &quot;accent 2&quot; in Swedish and Norwegian and that were polysyllabic in Old Norse.

Unlike the neighboring Continental Scandinavian languages, the [[prosody]] of Danish does not have phonemic pitch. [[stress (linguistics)|Stress]] is phonemic in and distinguishes words 
such as ''billigst'' ['bilist] &quot;cheapest&quot; and ''bilist'' [bi'list] &quot;car driver&quot;.

Modern Standard Danish has 26 vowel [[phoneme]]s, out of which all but two can be both long and short, [[Schwa]] and {{IPA|/ɐ/}}. The long and short realizations often differ in [[vowel#Articulation|quality]] and there are several [[allophones]] that differ if they occur together with an /r/. For example, /ø/ is lowered when it occurs either before or after /r/ and /a/ is pronounced {{IPA|[ɛ]}} when it's long.

{{IPA|/b, d, g/}} are [[phonation|devoiced]] in all contexts. {{IPA|/v, ð/}} often have slight frication, but are usually pronounced as [[approximant]]s. No distinction between {{IPA|/pʰ~b/}} and /{{IPA|tˢ~d/}} is made in certain contexts, such as after {{IPA|/s/}}, between short vowels and in word-final position. Hence ''lappe'' and ''labbe'' are rendered {{IPA|[labə]}}. The combination of {{IPA|/sj/}} is realized as a [[voiceless alveolo-palatal fricative|alveolo-palatal fricative]], {{IPA|[ɕ]}}, making it possible to postulate a tentative {{IPA|/ɕ/}}-phoneme in Danish. {{IPA|/r/}} can be described as &quot;tautosyllabic&quot;, meaning that it take the form of either a phonetic consonant or vowel. At the beginning of a word, it is pronounced as a [[voiced uvular fricative|uvular fricative]], {{IPA|[ʁ]}}, with less friction between syllables, and as a non-syllabic [[near-open central vowel|low central vowel]], {{IPA|[ɐ]}}. The latter is almost identical to how /r/ is often pronounced in [[German language|German]].

==Grammar==
{{main|Danish grammar}}

The infinitive forms of most Danish verbs end in a vowel, which in almost all cases is the letter ''e''.  Verbs are conjugated according to [[Grammatical tense|tense]], but otherwise do not vary according to [[Grammatical person|person]] or [[Grammatical number|number]].  For example the present tense form of the Danish infinitive verb ''spise'' (&quot;to eat&quot;) is ''spiser''; this form is the same regardless of whether the subject is in the first, second, or third person, or whether it is singular or plural. This extreme ease of conjugating verbs is made up for by the many [[Irregular verb|irregular verbs]] in the language.

Danish nouns fall into two grammatical genders: ''common'' and ''neuter''. While the majority of nouns (ca. 90%) have the ''common'' gender and ''neuter'' is often used for inanimate objects, the genders of nouns are not generally predictable and must in most cases be memorized. A distinctive feature of the Scandinavian languages, including Danish, is an enclitic definite article.
To demonstrate: The ''common'' gender word &quot;a man&quot; (indefinite) is ''en mand'' but &quot;the man&quot; (definite) is ''manden''. The ''neuter'' equivalent would be &quot;a house&quot; (indefinite) ''et hus'', &quot;the house&quot; (definite) ''huset''. Even though the definite and indefinite articles have separate origins, they have become homographs. In the plural the definite articles is ''-ene'', whereas there is no indefinite article in the plural. The enclitic article is not used when an adjective is added to the noun; here the demonstrative pronoun is used instead: ''den store mand'' &quot;the big man&quot; and &quot;the big house&quot;, ''det store hus''

Like most Germanic languages, Danish joins compound nouns. The example ''kvindehåndboldlandsholdet'', &quot;the female handball national team&quot;, illustrates that it does so to a significantly higher degree than [[English language|English]]. In some cases, nouns are joined with an extra ''s'', like ''landsmand'' (from ''land'', &quot;country&quot;, and ''mand'', &quot;man&quot;, meaning &quot;compatriot&quot;), but ''landmand'' (from same roots, meaning &quot;farmer&quot;). Some words are joined with an extra ''e'', like ''gæstebog'' (from ''gæst'' and ''bog'', meaning &quot;guest book&quot;).

==Vocabulary==

Most Danish words are derived from the [[Old Norse language]], with new words formed by compounding. A large percentage of Danish words, however, hails from [[Middle Low German]] (for example, betale = to pay, måske = maybe). Later on, [[German language|standard German]] and [[French language|French]] and now [[English language|English]] have superseded Low German influence. Because English and Danish are related languages, many common words are very similar in the two languages.  For example, the following Danish words are easily recognizable in their written form to English speakers: ''have'', ''over'', ''under'', ''for'', ''kat''. When pronounced, these words sound quite different from their English equivalents, however. In addition, the suffix ''by'', meaning &quot;town&quot;, occurs in several English placenames, such as ''Whitby'' and ''Selby'', as remnants of the [[Viking]] occupation.

===Numerals===
In Danish numerals, the tens and units digits of numbers above 20 are reversed when spoken or written, such that 21 is rendered ''enogtyve'' or ''en-og-tyve'', i.e. one and twenty. (The dashes in ''en-og-tyve'' and in the similar examples below are not commonly used, but are included here for clarity.) This is similar to [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and also to some variants of [[Bokmål]] Norwegian (sometimes known as [[Riksmål]]). Danish numerals from 50 to 90 are based on a [[vigesimal]] system similar to that of [[French language|French]] not shared with the other Scandinavian languages. This means that the [[score]] (i.e. 20, ''tyve'' or, archaically, ''snes'') is used as a base number: ''Tres'' (short for ''tre-sinds-tyve'' or ''tre snese'') means 3 times 20, that is 60. Similarly, ''halvtreds'' (short for ''halvtred-sinds-tyve'') means 2.5 times 20, that is 50. The numeral ''halvanden'' means 1.5 (literally &quot;half second&quot;, i.e. the first plus half of the second). The numerals ''halvtredje'' (2.5) and ''halvfjerde'' (3.5), likewise constructed by &quot;overcounting&quot;, are obsolete, but still implicitly used in the vigesimal system. The ending ''-indstyve'' is archaic in [[cardinal number]]s, but still often used in [[ordinal number]]s. Thus, &quot;fifty-two&quot; is usually rendered ''to-og-halvtreds'', whereas &quot;fifty-second&quot; is either ''to-og-halvtredsende'' or ''to-og-halvtredsindstyvende''. Many Danes are unaware of the vigesimal roots of such numerals.

==Writing system==

Danish is written using the [[Latin alphabet]], with three additional letters: ''[[Æ|æ]]'', ''[[Ø|ø]]'', and ''[[Å|å]]'', which come at the end of the [[Danish alphabet]], in that order.  A [[spelling reform]] in [[1948]] introduced the letter ''å'', already in use in Norwegian and Swedish, into the Danish alphabet to replace the letter ''aa''; the old usage still occurs in some personal and geographical names and old documents (for example, the name of the city of ''Ålborg'' is often spelled ''Aalborg''). When representing the ''å'' sound, ''aa'' is treated just like ''å'' in alphabetical sorting, even though it looks like two letters.

The same spelling reform changed the spelling of a few common words, such as ''vilde'', ''kunde'' and ''skulde'', to their current forms of ''ville'', ''kunne'' and ''skulle'', and did away with the practice of capitalising all nouns, which [[German language|German]] still does. Modern Danish and Norwegian use the same alphabet, though spelling differs somewhat.

'''Dêmêtêr''' (or '''Demetra''') (DEH-MEH-ter) (&amp;Delta;&amp;eta;&amp;mu;&amp;eta;&amp;tau;&amp;eta;&amp;rho;, &quot;mother-goddess&quot; or perhaps &quot;distribution-mother&quot;) is the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[goddess]] of [[agriculture]], the pure nourisher of youth and the green earth, the health-giving cycle of life and death, and preserver of [[marriage]] and the sacred law. She is invoked as the &quot;bringer of [[season]]s&quot; in the [[Homeric hymn]], a subtle sign that she was worshiped long before the Olympians arrived. The Homeric Hymn to Demeter has been dated to sometime around the Seventh Century BC.{{ref|Nilsson1}}  She and her daughter [[Persephone]] were the central figures of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] that also predated the Olympian pantheon.

The Roman equivalent is [[Ceres]].

Demeter is easily confused with [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] or [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], and with [[Cybele]]. The goddess's [[epithet]]s reveal the span of her functions in Greek life. Demeter and Kore (&quot;the maiden&quot;) are usually invoked as ''to theo'' ('&quot;The Two Goddesses&quot;), and they appear in that form in Linear B graffiti at Mycenaean [[Pylos]] in pre-[[History of Hellenistic Greece|Hellenic]] times.  A connection with the goddess-cults of [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]] is quite possible.  

It has been reported that [[Isocrates]] in his Panegyricus wrote that the greatest gifts which Demeter gave the Athenians were corn, which made man different from wild animals, and the Mysteries which give man higher hopes in this life and the afterlife.{{ref|Nilsson2}}

== Titles and functions ==
In various contexts, Demeter is invoked with many epithets:
*'''Potnia''' (&quot;mistress&quot; in the ''[[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn]] to Demeter'')
*'''Chloe''' (&quot;the green shoot&quot;, Pausanias 1.22.3, for her powers of fertility and eternal youth)
*'''Anesidora''' (&quot;sending up gifts&quot; from the earth Pausanias 1.31.4, as Demeter)
*'''Malophoros''' (&quot;apple-bearer&quot; or &quot;sheep-bearer&quot;, Pausanias 1.44.3)
*'''Kidaria''' (Pausanias 8.13.3),
*'''Chthonia''' (&quot;in the ground&quot;, Pausanias 3.14.5)
*'''Erinys''' (&quot;implacable&quot;, Pausanias 8.25.50)
*'''Lusia''' (&quot;bathing&quot;, Pausanias 8.25.8)
*'''Thermasia''' (&quot;warmth&quot;, Pausanias 2.34.6)
*'''[[Cabiri|Kabeiraia]]''', a pre-Greek name of uncertain meaning
*'''Thesmophoros''' (&quot;giver of customs&quot; or even &quot;legislator&quot;, a role that links her to the even more ancient goddess [[Themis]]. This title was connected with the [[Thesmophoria]], a festival of secret women-only rituals in [[History of Athens|Athens]] connected with marriage customs.)

[[Theocritus]] remembered an earlier role of Demeter:
:''For the Greeks Demeter was still a poppy goddess''
:''Bearing sheaves and poppies in both hands.'' &amp;mdash; ''Idyll'' vii.157
In a clay statuette from Gazi (Heraklion Museum, Kereny 1976 fig 15), the Minoan poppy goddess wears the seed capsules, sources of nourishment and narcosis, in her diadem. &quot;It seems probable that the Great [[Mother Goddess]], who bore the names Rhea and Demeter, brought the poppy with her from her Cretan cult to [[Eleusinian mysteries|Eleusis]], and it is certain that in the Cretan cult sphere, opium was prepared from poppies&quot; (Kerenyi 1976, p 24).

In honor of Demeter of Mysia a seven-day festival was held at Pellené in [[Arcadia]] (Pausan. 7. 27, 9). It lasted for seven days. Pausanias passed the shrine to Demeter at Mysia on the road from [[Mycenae]] to [[Argos]] but all he could draw out to explain the archaic name was a myth of an eponymous Mysius who venerated Demeter.

Major sites for the [[cult (religion)|cult]] of Demeter were not confined to any localized part of the Greek world: there were sites at Eleusis, in Sicily, Hermion, in Crete, Megara, Celeae, Lerna, Aegila, Munychia, Corinth, Delos, Priene, Akragas, Iasos, Pergamon, Selinus, Tegea, Thorikos, Dion, Lykosoura, Mesembria, Enna, and Samosthrace.

She was associated with the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] goddess [[Ceres (god)|Ceres]]. When Demeter was given a genealogy, she was the daughter of [[Cronos]] and Rhea, and therefore the elder sister of [[Zeus]].  Her priestesses were addressed with the title [[Melissa]].

Demeter taught mankind the arts of agriculture: sowing seeds, ploughing, harvesting, etc.  She was especially popular with rural folk, partly because they most benefited directly from her assistance, and partly because rural folk are more conservative about keeping to the old ways. Demeter herself was central to the older religion of Greece. Relics unique to her cult, such as votive clay pigs, were being fashioned in the Neolithic. In Roman times, a sow was still sacrificed to Ceres following a death in the family, to purify the household.

== Demeter and Poseidon ==
Demeter and [[Poseidon]]'s names are linked in the earliest scratched notes in [[Linear B]] found at Mycenaean [[Pylos]], where they appear as PO-SE-DA-WO-NE and DA-MA-TE in the context of sacralized lot-casting. The 'DA' element in each of their names is seemingly connected to an [[Indo-European]] root relating to distribution of land and honors (compare Latin ''dare'' &quot;to give&quot;). Poseidon (his name seems to signify &quot;consort of the distributor&quot;) once pursued Demeter, in her archaic form as a mare-goddess.  She resisted Poseidon, but she could not disguise her divinity among the horses of King [[Onkios]]. Poseidon became a stallion and covered her. Demeter was literally furious (&quot;Demeter Erinys&quot;) at the assault, but washed away her anger in the River [[Ladon]] (&quot;Demeter Lousia&quot;). She bore to Poseidon a [[Persephone|Daughter]], whose name might not be uttered outside the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], and a steed named Arion, with a black mane. In [[Arcadia]], Demeter was worshiped as a horse-headed deity into historical times.

''Disagreement:''
The etymology of &quot;Demeter&quot; is well attested as &quot;Deus Mater&quot;, or ''Divine Mother'' or ''God Mother''.  The root &quot;De&quot; is the same as found in &quot;Zeus&quot;, &quot;Deus&quot;, and &quot;Theos&quot;, all of which are cognates.  The &quot;-us&quot; suffix may denote masculine gender, as with the translation of &quot;Yeshua&quot; into Greek as &quot;Ieso''us''&quot;, or with Odysse''us'' and Achille''us'', etc.

Edit: &quot;Zeus&quot; and &quot;Theos&quot; are not real cognates. Greek &quot;Zeus&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;Dyaús&quot; and Latin genitive &quot;Iovis&quot; all derive from the same Proto-Indo-European root *Di&amp;#275;us. The Greek &quot;Theos&quot; doesn't fit in this cognate set, in fact, the etymology of the word is still unclear. (cf. Beekes, 1995)

== Demeter's Relationship With Persephone ==
The central myth of Demeter, which is at the heart of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] is her relationship with [[Persephone]], her daughter and own younger self. In the Olympian pantheon, Persephone became the consort of [[Hades]] (Roman [[Pluto (god)|Pluto]], the underworld god of wealth). Persephone became the goddess of the underworld when Hades abducted her from the earth and brought her into the underworld. She had been playing with some [[nymph]]s (or [[Leucippe]]) whom Demeter changed into the [[Siren|Sirens]] as punishment for not having interfered. Life came to a standstill as the depressed Demeter (goddess of the earth) searched for her lost daughter (resting on the stone, [[Agelasta]]). Finally, Zeus could not put up with the dying earth and forced Hades to return Persephone by sending [[Hermes]] to retrieve her. But before she was released, Hades tricked her into eating three [[pomegranate]] seeds, which forced her to return three months each year. When Demeter and her daughter were together, the earth flourished with vegetation. But for three months each year, when Persephone returned to the underworld, the earth once again became a barren realm. The three months when the earth is barren are the summer months, since in Greece this is when all vegetation dies from heat and lack of rainfall. The winter by comparison has heavy rainfall and mild temperatures in which plant life flourishes. It was during her trip to retrieve Persephone from the underworld that she revealed the Eleusinian Mysteries. In an alternate version, [[Hecate]] rescued Persephone. In other alternative versions, Persephone was not tricked into eating the pomegranate seeds but chose to eat them herself. Some versions say that she ate six seeds rather than three. Regardless, the end result is the occurrence of summer, spring, winter, and fall.

==Demeter's stay at Eleusis==
While Demeter was searching for her daughter Persephone, having taken the form of an old woman called [[Doso]], she received a hospitable welcome from [[Celeus]], the King of [[Eleusis]] in [[Attica, Greece|Attica]] (and also [[Phytalus]]).  He asked her to nurse [[Demophon]] and [[Triptolemus]], his sons by [[Metanira]].

As a gift to Celeus, because of his hospitality, Demeter planned to make Demophon as a god, by coating and anointing him with [[Ambrosia]], breathing gently upon him while holding him in her arms and bosom, and making him immortal by burning his mortal spirit away in the family hearth every night. She put him in the fire at night like a firebrand or ember without the knowledge of his parents.

Demeter was unable to complete the ritual because his mother Metanira walked in and saw her son in the fire and screamed in fright, which angered Demeter, who lamented that foolish mortals do not understand the concept and ritual.

Instead of making Demophon immortal, Demeter chose to teach Triptolemus the art of agriculture and, from him, the rest of Greece learned to plant and reap crops. He flew across the land on a winged [[chariot]] while Demeter and Persephone cared for him, and helped him complete his mission of educating the whole of Greece on the art of agriculture.

Later, Triptolemus taught [[Lyncus]], King of the [[Scythia]]ns the arts of agriculture but he refused to teach it to his people and then tried to kill Triptolemus.  Demeter turned him into a [[lynx]].

Some scholars believe the Demophon story is based on an earlier prototypical folk tale.{{ref|Nilsson3}}

==Portrayals and Miscellanea==
Demeter was usually portrayed on a chariot, and frequently associated with images of the harvest, including flowers, fruit, and grain.  She was also sometimes pictured with Persephone.

Demeter is not generally portrayed with a consort: the exception is [[Iasion]], the youth of Crete who lay with Demeter in a thrice-ploughed field, and was sacrificed afterwards&amp;mdash; by a jealous Zeus with a thunderbolt, Olympian mythography adds, but the Cretan site of the myth is a sign that the Hellenes knew this was an act of the ancient Demeter.

Demeter placed [[Aethon]], the god of famine, in [[Erysichthon]]'s gut, making him permanently famished.  This was a punishment for cutting down trees in a sacred grove.

==Notes==
#{{note|Nilsson1}} Martin P. Nilsson, ''Greek Popular Religion'', p.45: &quot;We have a document concerning the Eleusinian cult which is older and more comprehensive than anything concerning any other Greek cult, namely, the Homeric Hymn to Demeter composed in Attica before Eleusis was incorporated into the Athenian state, not later than the end of the seventh century B.C. We know that the basis of the Eleusinian Mysteries was an old agrarian cult celebrated in the middle of the month Boedromion (about October) and closely akin to the Thesmophoria, a festival of the autumn sowing celebrated by the women not quite a month later. I need not dwell upon this connection, which is established by internal evidence as well as by direct information.&quot;
#{{note|Nilsson2}} Martin P. Nilsson, ''Greek Popular Religion'', p.56: &quot;Isocrates speaks in his ''Panegyricus'' of the two greatest gifts granted the Athenians by Demeter-- the Corn, which is the reason why men do not live like wild beasts, and the Mysteries, from which they derive higher hopes in regard to their life and all time&quot;.
#{{note|Nilsson3}} Martin P. Nilsson, ''Greek Popular Religion'', p.50: &quot;The Demophon story in Eleusis is based on an older folk-tale motif which has nothing to do with the Eleusinian Cult. It is introduced in order to let Demeter reveal herself in her divine shape&quot;.

'''Death metal''' is a sub-genre of [[Heavy metal music|Heavy Metal]] that evolved out of [[Thrash Metal]] during the early 1980s. Commonly recognized characteristics include rhythmic, chromatic progressions and a narrative or &quot;story telling&quot; song structure such that there is not a verse-chorus cycle as much as an ongoing development of themes and motifs. Aesthetically, it is usually identified by violent rhythm guitar, fast percussion and dynamic intensity. &quot;[[Blast beat]]s&quot; are frequently used to add to the ferocity of theAntilles. The Dutch Language Union defines what is AN and what is not, for example in terms of orthography. 
''Algemeen Nederlands'' replaced the older name ''Algemeen Beschaafd Nederlands'' ('Common Civilized Dutch', abbreviated to ABN) when it was no longer considered politically correct, because it implied that people who didn't speak ABN were not civilized.

===Dialects===
[[Flemish (linguistics)|Flemish]] (Vlaams in [[Dutch]]) is the collective term often used for the Dutch [[dialect]]s spoken in Belgium.  It is not a separate language (though the term is often also used to distinguish the standard Dutch spoken in Flanders from that of the Netherlands) nor are the dialects in Belgium more closely related to each other than to the dialects in The Netherlands. The forms of Dutch spoken in Flanders and in the Netherlands differ somewhat and are instantly recognisable. One could draw a parallel with the [[American and British English differences]] (spoken form only). The Americans and the English use slightly divergent vocabularies, though both officially correct. However, while American English is considered a derivative of English by some, Dutch in Flanders and Dutch spoken in the Netherlands are historically equal.

In [[Flanders]], there are roughly four dialect groups: [[West Flemish]], [[East Flemish]], [[Brabantian]] and [[Limburgish]]. They have all incorporated French loanwords in everyday language. An example is ''fourchette'' in various forms (originally a French word meaning fork), instead of ''vork''. Brussels, especially, is heavily influenced by French because roughly 85% of the inhabitants of [[Brussels]] speak French. The Limburgish in Belgium is closely related to Dutch Limburgish. An oddity of West Flemish (and to a lesser extent, East Flemish) is that the pronunciation of the &quot;soft g&quot; sound (the [[voiced velar fricative]]) is almost identical to that of the &quot;h&quot; sound (the [[voiced glottal fricative]]), thus, the words ''held'' (hero) and ''geld'' (money) sound nearly the same. Some Flemish dialects are so distinct that they might be considered as separate language variants. [[West Flemish]] in particular has sometimes been considered as such. Dialect borders of these dialects do not correspond to present political boundaries, but reflect older, medieval divisions. The [[Brabantian]] dialect group, for instance, also extends to much of the south of the Netherlands, and so does [[Limburgish]]. West-Flemish is also spoken in the Dutch province of Zeeland, in a variant called Zeeuws (or Zealandic, in English) and even in a small part near [[Dunkirk, France]], bordering on Belgium. 

The Netherlands also has different dialect regions. In the east there is an extensive [[Low German]] dialect area: the provinces of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] ([[Gronings]]), [[Drenthe]] and [[Overijssel]] are almost exclusively Low Saxon. [[Zuid-Gelders]] is a dialect also spoken in the German land of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. Brabantian ([[Noord-Brabant]]) fade into the dialects spoken in the adjoining provinces of Belgium. Same thing applies to [[Limburgish]] ([[Limburg (Netherlands)]]), but this variant also has the status of official Minority Language in the [[Netherlands]] (but not in [[Belgium]]). It receives protection by chapter 2 of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. [[Limburgish]] is Low Franconian, as is Dutch, but is so much more distant (it has been influenced by the [[Rhinelandic]] dialects like the [[Cologne]] dialect: [[Kölsch Platt]], and has had a very different development since the late Middle Ages) that it is less and less classified as being Dutch.

[[Zealandic]] of most of [[Zeeland]] is a transitional regional language between West Flemish and Hollandic, with the exception of the eastern part of [[Zealandic Flanders]] where East Flemish is spoken. In [[Holland]] proper, [[Hollandic]] is spoken, though the original forms of this dialect, heavily influenced by a Frisian [[substrate]], are now relatively rare; the urban dialects of the [[Randstad]], which are Hollandic dialects, do not diverge from standard Dutch very much, but there is a clear difference between the city dialects of [[Rotterdam]], [[The Hague]], [[Amsterdam]] or [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. 

In some rural Hollandic areas more authentic Hollandic dialects are still being used, especially north of Amsterdam. Limburgish and [[Low German]] have been elevated by the Netherlands (and by Germany) to the legal status of ''streektaal'' ([[regional language]]) according to the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], which causes some native speakers to consider them separate languages. Some dialects are unintelligible to some speakers of Hollandic.

Dutch dialects are not spoken as often as they used to be. Nowadays in The Netherlands only older people speak these dialects in the smaller villages, with the exception of the Low Saxon and Limburgish ''streektalen'', which are actively promoted by some provinces and still in common use. Most towns and cities stick to standard Dutch - although many cities have their own ''city dialect'', which continues to prosper. In Belgium dialects are very much alive however; many senior citizens there are unable to speak standard Dutch. In both the Netherlands and Belgium, many larger cities also have several distinct smaller dialects.

By many native speakers of Dutch, both in Belgium and the Netherlands, [[Afrikaans]] and [[Frisian language|Frisian]] are often assumed to be very deviant dialects of Dutch. In fact, they are two different languages, Afrikaans having evolved mainly from Dutch. There is no dialect continuum between the Frisian and adjoining Low Saxon. A Frisian standard language has been developed.

Until the early [[20th century]], variants of Dutch were still spoken by some descendants of [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch colonies in the United States]]. [[New Jersey]] in particular had an active Dutch community with a highly divergent dialect that was spoken as recently as the [[1950s]].  See [[Jersey Dutch]] for more on this dialect.

===Accents===
In addition to the many dialects of the Dutch language many provinces and larger cities have their own [[Accent (linguistics)|accents]], which sometimes are also called dialects. Ethnic communities tend to have varying accents: for example many people from the Dutch Antilles or Suriname speak with a &quot;[[Surinaams]]&quot; accent, and the Dutch-Moroccan and Dutch-Turkish youth have also developed their own accents, which in some cases are enhanced by a debased Dutch [[slang]] with [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or [[Turkish language|Turkish]] words thrown in, which serves in making their speech nearly unintelligible to some older speakers of standard Dutch.

===Derived languages===

A close relative of the Dutch language is [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], a language spoken in [[South Africa]] and [[Namibia]], originating primarily from [[17th century]] Dutch dialects, and a great deal of mutual intelligibility still exists. One who can speak Dutch is usually able to read and understand Afrikaans. There are also [[Dutch-based creole languages]].

==Sounds==
{{IPA notice}}
===Vowels===
The [[vowel]] inventory of Dutch is large, with 14 simple vowels and four diphthongs. The vowels {{IPA|/e&amp;#720;/}}, {{IPA|/ø&amp;#720;/}}, {{IPA|/o&amp;#720;/}} are included on the diphthong chart because they are actually produced as narrow closing diphthongs in many dialects, but behave phonologically like the other simple vowels. When unstressed, /a/ and {{IPA|/&amp;#593;/}} are usually pronounced like {{IPA|[ɐ]}} (a near-open central vowel), but this change is not phonemic.

Where symbols for consonants occur in pairs, the left represents the [[voiceless consonant]] and the right represents the [[voiced consonant]].

Notes:

1) {{IPA|[g]}} is not a native phoneme of Dutch and only occurs in borrowed words, like ''goal''.

2) {{IPA|[&amp;#660;]}} is not a separate phoneme in Dutch, but is inserted before vowel-initial syllables within words after {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/&amp;#601;/}}.

3) In some dialects, the voiced fricatives have almost completely merged with the voiceless ones, and {{IPA|[v]}} is usually realized as {{IPA|[f]}}, {{IPA|[z]}} is usually realized as {{IPA|[s]}}, and {{IPA|[&amp;#611;]}} is usually realized as {{IPA|[x]}}.

4) {{IPA|[&amp;#643;]}} and {{IPA|[&amp;#658;]}} are not native phonemes of Dutch, and usually occur in borrowed words, like ''show'' and ''bagage'' (baggage). However, {{IPA|/s/}} + {{IPA|/j/}} phoneme sequences in Dutch are often realized as {{IPA|[&amp;#643;]}}, like in the word ''huisje'' (='little house'). {{IPA|[&amp;#658;]}} often is realized as {{IPA|[&amp;#643;]}}.

5) The realization of the {{IPA|/r/}} phoneme varies considerably from dialect to dialect. In the so-called &quot;standard&quot; Dutch of [[Amsterdam]]&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, {{IPA|/r/}} is realized as indicated here&amp;#8212;as the voiced uvular fricative {{IPA|[&amp;#641;]}}. In other dialects, however, it is realized as the uvular trill {{IPA|[&amp;#640;]}} or as the alveolar trill {{IPA|[r]}}.

6) The realization of the {{IPA|/ʋ/}} varies considerably from the Northern to the Southern and Belgium dialects of the Dutch language. In the South, including Belgium, it is realized as {{IPA|[w]}}. Note that in the South {{IPA|/ʋ/}} is usually considered an allophone of {{IPA|[v]}}.

7) The &quot;standard&quot; Dutch is that as spoken in Haarlem, ''not'' the Amsterdams dialect. Amsterdams dialect is different from standard Dutch in that {{IPA|[z]}} is replaced by {{IPA|[s]}}

===Phonology===
Dutch [[Final devoicing|devoices all consonants at the ends of words]] (e.g. a final ''d'' sound becomes a ''t'' sound; to become 'ents of worts'), which presents a problem for Dutch speakers when learning English. This is partly reflected in the spelling, the singular ''hui'''s''''' has the plural ''hui'''z'''en'' (house(s)) and ''dui'''f''''' becomes ''dui'''v'''en'' (dove). The other cases, viz. ‘p’/‘b’ and ‘d’/‘t’ are always written with the voiced consonant, although a devoiced one is actually pronounced, e.g. sg. ''baar'''d''''' (beard), pronounced as ''baar'''t''''', has plural ''baar'''d'''en'' and sg. ''ri'''b''''' (rib), pronounced as ''rip'' has plural ''ribben''.

Because of assimilation, often the initial consonant of the next word is also devoiced, e.g. ''het vee'' (the cattle) is {{IPA|/(h)&amp;#601;tfe/}}. This process of devoicing is taken to an extreme in some regions (Amsterdam, Friesland) with almost complete loss of {{IPA|/v/}},{{IPA|/z/}} and {{IPA|/&amp;#611;/}}. Further south these phonemes are certainly present in the middle of a word. Compare e.g. ''logen'' and ''loochen'' {{IPA|/lo&amp;#611;&amp;#601;n/}} vs. {{IPA|/lox&amp;#601;n/}}. In the South (i.e. Zeeland, Brabant and Limburg) and in Flanders the contrast is even greater because the g becomes a palatal. ('soft g').

The final 'n' of the plural ending -en is normally not pronounced (as in Afrikaans), except in the North East (Low Saxon) and the South West (West Flemish) where the ending becomes a syllabic n sound.

Dutch is a stress language, the stress position of words matters. Stress can occur on any syllable position in a word. There is a tendency for stress to be at the beginning of words. In composite words, secondary stress is often present. There are some cases where stress is the only difference between words. For example ''vóórkomen'' (occur) and ''voorkómen'' (prevent). Marking the stress in written Dutch is optional, never obligatory, but sometimes recommended.

===Historical sound changes===
Dutch (with the exception of the Limburg dialects) did not participate in the second (High German) sound shifting - compare German ''machen'' {{IPA|/-x-/}} Dutch ''maken'', English ''make'', German ''Pfanne'' {{IPA|/pf-/}}, Dutch ''pan'', English ''pan'', German ''zwei'' {{IPA|/ts-/}}, Dutch ''twee'', English ''two''.

It also underwent a few changes of its own. For example, words in -old or -olt lost the l in favor of a [[diphthong]]. Compare English ''old'', German ''alt'', Dutch ''oud''. A word like ''hus'' with {{IPA|/u/}} (English &quot;house&quot;) first changed to ''huus'' with {{IPA|/y/}}, then finally to ''huis'' with a diphthong that resembles the one in French ''l'oeil''. The phoneme /g/ was lost in favor of a (voiced) velar [[fricative]] {{IPA|/&amp;#611;/}}, or a voiced palatal fricative (in the South: Flanders, Limburg).

==Grammar==
:''Main article: [[Dutch grammar]]''

Like all other continental West Germanic languages, Dutch has a word order that is markedly different from English, which presents a problem for some Anglophones learning Dutch.

The Dutch written grammar has simplified over the past 100 years: cases are now mainly used for the pronouns, such as ''ik'' (I), ''mij, me'' (me), ''mijn'' (my), ''wie'' (who), ''wiens, wier'' (whose), although the latter is quite formal and rarely used in speech, comparable to English ‘whom’. Nouns and adjectives are not case inflected (except for the genitive of nouns: -'s or -'). In the spoken language cases and case inflections had already gradually disappeared from a much earlier date on (probably the 15th century) as in many continental West Germanic dialects.

Inflection of adjectives is a little more complicated: nothing with indefinite neuter nouns in singular and -e in all other cases:
:''een mooi huis'' (a beautiful house)
:''het mooi'''e''' huis'' (the beautiful house)
:''mooi'''e''' huizen'' (beautiful houses)
:''de mooi'''e''' huizen'' (the beautiful houses)
:''een mooi'''e''' vrouw'' (a beautiful woman)

More complex inflection is still found in certain lexicalized expressions like ''de heer de'''s''' hui'''zes''''' (litt.: the man of the house), etc. These are usually remnants of cases (in this instance, the genitive case which is still used in German, cf. ''Der Herr des Hauses'') and other inflections no longer in general use today. In such lexicalized expressions remnants of strong and weak nouns can be found too, e.g. ''in het jaar des Her'''en''''' (Anno Domini), where “-en” is actually the genitive ending of the weak noun. Also in this case, German [[German_grammar#Irregular_declensions|retains this feature]].

Dutch nouns can take endings for size: -je for singular [[diminutive]] and -jes for plural diminutive. Between these [[suffix]]es and the radical can come extra letters depending on the ending of the word:
:''boom'' (tree) - ''boom'''pje'''''
:''ring'' (ring) - ''ring'''etje'''''
:''koning'' (king) - ''konin'''kje'''''
:''tien'' (ten) - ''tien'''tje'''''

Like most Germanic languages, Dutch forms left-branching noun [[compound (linguistics)|compound]]s, where the first noun modifies the category given by the second, for example: ''hondenhok'' (doghouse). Unlike English, where newer compounds or combinations of longer nouns are often written in open form with separating spaces, Dutch (like the other Germanic languages) always uses the closed form without spaces, for example: boomhuis (eng. tree house). Like German, Dutch allows arbitrarily long compounds, but these are rare. The longest serious entry in the Van Dale dictionary is ''wapenstilstandsonderhandeling'' (ceasefire negotiation). Sometimes ''hottentottensoldatententententoonstellingsterreinen'' (hottentot soldiers tents exhibition terrains) is jocularly quoted as the longest Dutch word (note the four times consecutive ''ten''), but outside this usage it actually never occurs. Notwithstanding these rules, many Dutch people tend to write words which should be compound words, separately, which is sometimes dubbed “the English disease”.

==Vocabulary==
:''See the [[Wiktionary:Category:Dutch language|list of Dutch words]] and [[Wiktionary:Category:Dutch derivations|list of words of Dutch origin]] at [[Wiktionary]], the free dictionary and Wikipedia's sibling project''

Dutch has more French [[loanword]]s than German, but much fewer than English. The number of English loanwords in Dutch is substantial and steadily increasing, especially on the streets and some professions. New loanwords are almost never pronounced as the original English word, or are spelled differently. Like English, Dutch also has words of Greek and Latin origin. There are also some German loanwords, like ''überhaupt'' and ''sowieso''. Even though few true loanwords are present, German has had a considerable effect upon the lexicon of the language, mainly by the change of German words into words that seem Dutch (so called ''germanisme''), a process probably to be ascribed to the likeness of the two languages. Most of these forms have become so integral to Dutch that few Dutch notice them; they include words like ''opname'' (from German ''Aufnahme''), ''aanstalten'' (''Anstalten'') and many more.

==Writing system==
Dutch is written using the [[Latin alphabet]], see [[Dutch alphabet]]. One of the clues to recognise that a piece of text is written in Dutch, is the occurrence of many doubled letters. This happens both to vowels and consonants. One cause is the many compound words where the same letter ends one part and begins the next part. Another cause is formed by spelling devices used to distinguish the many more vowel sounds in the Dutch language, than there are vowel letters in the Latin alphabet (see [[Dutch orthography]]). A prime example is the word ''voorraaddoos'' (supply box).

The [[diaeresis]] is used to mark vowels that are pronounced separately, and called [[diaeresis|trema]]. In the most recent spelling reform, a hyphen has replaced the trema in a few words where it had been previously used: ''zeeëend'' (seaduck) is now spelled ''zee-eend''.

The [[acute accent]] (accent aigu) occurs mainly on loanwords like ''café'', but can also be used for emphasis or to differentiate between two forms. Its most common use is to differentiate between the indefinite [[article (grammar)|article]] 'een' (a, an) and the numeral 'één' (one).
The [[grave accent]] (accent grave) is used to clarify pronunciation ('hè' (what?, what the ...?), 'bèta') and in loanwords ('caissière' (cashier), 'après-ski'). In the recent spelling reform, the accent grave was dropped as stress sign on short vowels in favour of the accent aigu (e.g. 'wèl' was changed to 'wél').
Other [[Diacritic|diacritical marks]] such as the [[circumflex]] only occur on a few words, most of them loanwords from [[French language|French]].

The most important dictionary of the modern Dutch language is the ''Van Dale groot woordenboek der Nederlandse taal''[http://www.vandale.nl], more commonly referred to as the ''Dikke van Dale'' (&quot;dik&quot; is Dutch for &quot;fat&quot; or &quot;thick&quot;), or as linguists nicknamed it: De Vandaal (the [[vandal]]). However, it is dwarfed by the &quot;Woordenboek der Nederlandsche taal&quot;, a scholarly endeavour that took 147 years from initial idea to first edition, resulting in over 45,000 pages.

The semi-official spelling is given by the ''Woordenlijst Nederlandse taal'', more commonly known as &quot;het groene boekje&quot; (i.e. &quot;the green booklet&quot;, because of its colour.)

==Dutch as a foreign language==

The number of non native speakers of Dutch who voluntarily learn the language is small. This is partly because Dutch is not geographically widespread and because in its home countries [[The Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] most of the population is proficient in other [[European]] [[languages]]. In [[The Netherlands]] German is spoken with a high level of proficiency (especially in the regions bordering [[Germany]]) and the language is part of the core curriculum in schools for 2-5 years. In Belgium, German is less widely spoken, and not always required, but it still spoken by a considerable number of people.

[[French language|French]] is also taught for 3-6 years in the Netherlands, but it is not as widely spoken. In Flanders ([[Belgium]]) French is required from age 10 to 18 and is very widely spoken, not so strange when one considers that the southern half of Belgium, [[Wallonia]], is Francophone.

In both [[The Netherlands]] and [[Flanders]] [[English language|English]] is taught in schools from a young age - occasionally from age 11 or 12, but typically until the completion of secondary education. Most universities in the two countries, recognising the importance of the English language in the modern world, continue to teach the language to those students who need to improve their skills. As a result English is spoken throughout [[The Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] with members of the younger generation sometimes being fluent or near fluent speakers. The majority of the [[population]] of both countries speak some English, some in an advanced form of [[Globish]].

Some non native residents of [[The Netherlands]] or [[Belgium]] have never learnt to speak Dutch - perhaps put off by its guttural sound or by a perception of its difficulties. Moreover, and especially in Belgium, the difference between the standard language and the language people speak (their local dialect or, more often, a version of the standard language heavily influenced by it) can be very important and cause difficulties. There is also the problem that because the native Dutch speakers themselves are often so linguistically proficient they will try and help a struggling Dutch learner by addressing them in their own language!

The Dutch often make fun of their own language — for example Tom Meyer, a radio commentator, used to say on air that &quot;Dutch isn't a language; it's a disease of the throat.&quot; Pronunciation can be a challenge as many of the Dutch vowel sounds are difficult for non native speakers. [[Diphthong]]s such as the &quot;ui&quot; sound in such words as &quot;huis&quot; (house) and &quot;muis&quot; (mouse), the &quot;eu&quot; in sleutel (key), and the &quot;ij&quot; sound in words like &quot;fijn&quot; (fine) or &quot;wijn&quot; (wine) present difficulties and even though some of these words are superficially like their English equivalents the correct sound is very different. Its cohesiveness sometimes also produces words that might baffle speakers of other languages due to the high amount of consecutive consonants, such as the word &quot;angstschreeuw&quot; (scream in fear), which has grand total of eight in a row (ngstschr). Native speakers of German usually have the biggest advantage of all people when learning Dutch from a grammar and vocabulary point of view but almost always struggle with the pronunciation. However those residents or visitors who do learn some Dutch will be rewarded, not only by the extra fillip this gives to their understanding of Dutch history and culture, but also because it will enable them to converse with people in areas away from the big cities where other languages are less commonly spoken and experience that other Dutch [[culture]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{terrorism}}
'''Domestic terrorism''' is a phrase used to describe some acts of political [[violence]] within a [[state]] that are carried out or commissioned by forces inside or originating from that state, as opposed to external attacks.

Examples of recent domestic terrorism are the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], the [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing|Atlanta Olympics pipebombing]], the [[Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway]], and [[David Copeland]]'s nailbombing campaign against ethnic minorities and gays in [[London]]. Older examples are the [[Gunpowder Plot]], the [[Haymarket Riot|Haymarket Square bombing]], and [[John_Brown (abolitionist)#Raid_on_Harpers_Ferry|Harper's Ferry]].

Domestic terrorism is considered rare in the [[United States]]. As a result, the Oklahoma City bombing was at first thought by some [[Journalism|journalists]] to be the work of external actors, possibly from the [[Middle East]]. The revelation that the attack had been carried out by an American came as a shock to the country and the rest of the world, and served as an embarrassment to some sections of the [[news media]].

The [[Patriot Act]] designates domestic terrorism as a crime.  However, the Patriot Act does not give the meaning of domestic terrorism as designated as a crime, leaving the intepretation of the acts, statements or preparations which may constitute domestic terrorism to whomever may wish to interpret them.  For this reason, such acts as [[civil disobedience]] and [[political incorrectness]] can be interpreted as domestic terrorism, thus having a [[chilling effect]] on [[public participation]] and [[freedom of expression]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Westermann 1911 Sudansprachen cover.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Westermann's 1911 ''Die [[Sudanic languages|Sudansprachen]]''.]]'''Diedrich Hermann Westermann''' ([[June 24]], [[1875]]&amp;ndash;[[May 31]], [[1956]]) was a [[Germany|German]] missionary, [[Africanist]], and [[linguistics | linguist]]. He substantially extended and revised the work of [[Carl Meinhof]], his teacher, although he rejected some of Meinhof's theories only implicitly. Westermann is seen as one of the founders of modern [[Africa|African]] linguistics. 

He carried out extensive linguistic and anthropological research in the area ranging from Senegal eastwards to the Upper Nile. His linguistic publications cover a wide range of African languages, including the [[Gbe languages]], [[Nuer language|Nuer]], [[Kpelle language|Kpelle]], [[Shilluk language|Shilluk]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], and [[Guang language|Guang]]. His comparative work, establishing a basic division between the East and West [[Sudanic languages]] laid the basis for much of today's [[Niger-Congo]] and [[Nilo-Saharan]] language families.

In [[1927]] Westermann published a ''Practical Orthography of [[African Languages]]'' which became later known as the ''Westermann script''. Subsequently he published the influential and oft-reprinted ''[[Practical Phonetics for Students of African Languages]]'' in collaboration with [[Ida C. Ward|Ida Ward]] (1933).

He was born in [[Baden, Lower Saxony|Baden]] near [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] and also died there.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Diacritical marks}}
A '''diacritical mark''' or '''diacritic''', sometimes called an '''accent mark''', is a mark added to a [[letter (alphabet)|letter]] to alter a word's pronunciation or to distinguish between similar words. The word derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word διακριτικός (''distinguishing''). Note that ''diacritic'' is a noun and ''diacritical'' is the corresponding adjective.

A diacritical mark can appear above or below the letter to which it is added, or in some other position; however, note that not all such marks are diacritical. For example, in [[English language|English]], the [[tittle]] (dot) on the letters ''i'' and ''j'' is not a diacritical mark, but rather part of the letter itself. Further, a mark may be diacritical in one language, but not in another; for example, in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''u'' and ''ü'' are considered the same letter, while in  [[German language|German]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] or [[Azeri language|Azeri]] they are considered to be separate letters.

The main usage of a diacritic is to change the phonetic meaning of the letter, but the term is also used in a more general sense of changing the meaning of the letter or even the whole word.  Examples are writing numerals in [[numeral system]]s, such as early [[Greek numerals]] and marking abbreviations with the [[titlo]] in old [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] texts.

== Types of diacritic ==

* [[Dot (diacritic)|dot]]
* (''' ˙ ''') ''[[anunaasika]]'' superdot
* (''' . ''') ''[[anusvaara]]'' subdot, used in [[Sanskrit]]
* (''' ¸ ''') ''[[cedilla]]''
* (''' ˛ ''') ''[[ogonek]]'' or &quot;Polish hook&quot;
* (''' ° ''') ''[[kroužek]]'' or [[ring (diacritic)|ring]]; unlike in [[Czech language|Czech]], in the [[Scandinavian languages]] this is not considered a diacritic but an integral part of the character ''å''.
* (''' ˘ ''') [[breve]]; part of the character when used in [[Esperanto]]
* (''' ˇ ''') [[caron]] or ''[[háček]]'' (&quot;little hook&quot; in Czech). In Slovak it is called ''mäkčeň'' (&quot;softener&quot; or &quot;palatalization mark&quot;), in Slovenian ''strešica'' (&quot;little roof&quot;), in Croatian ''kvačica'' (&quot;little hook&quot;).
* (''' ^ ''') [[circumflex]], part of the character when used in [[Esperanto]], also in Slovak is used on &quot;o&quot; and it is called ''vokáň'' 
* (''' ¯ ''') [[macron]]
* (''' ¨ ''') [[diaeresis]] (also dieresis) or [[umlaut]], a diacritic in some languages (such as [[German language|German]]), but part of the character in the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Russian language]]s.
* accent
** (''' ` ''') [[grave accent]]
** (''' ´ ''') [[acute accent]]
** (''' ˝ ''') [[double acute accent]]
* (''' {{polytonic |&amp;nbsp;&amp;#788;}} ''') ''[[spiritus asper]]'' or rough breathing mark
* (''' {{polytonic |&amp;nbsp;&amp;#787;}} ''') ''[[spiritus lenis]]'' or smooth (or soft) breathing mark
* [[hook (diacritic)|hook]] (dấu hỏi), as used in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]

Marks that are sometimes diacritics, but also have other uses, are:

* (''' | ''') [[bar (diacritic)|bar]] through the basic letter
* (''' , ''') [[comma (punctuation)|comma]]
* (''' ~ ''') [[tilde]]
* ( {{unicode|&amp;#1155;}} ) [[titlo]], used to indicate abbreviation in the [[early Cyrillic alphabet]]
* (''' ' ''') [[apostrophe (punctuation)|apostrophe]]
* (''' : ''') [[colon (punctuation)|colon]], used to attach native affixes (such as [[declension|case]] markers) to foreign words and abbreviations
* (''' - ''') [[hyphen]] - in English, hyphens can be used to break words between syllables, to resolve ambiguities in pronunciation:
** repair (fix) compared to re-pair (pair again).
** Kuringgai  becomes  Ku-ring-gai.

==Usage==

* [[Catalan language|Catalan]] has grave, acute, cedilla and diaeresis. 

* Several [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[romanization]]s use umlaut, but only on ''u'' (''ü''). In [[Hanyu Pinyin]], the four [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]] of [[Mandarin Chinese]] are denoted by the macron, acute, caron and grave diacritics.

* [[Czech language|Czech]] has acute, caron and ring. 

* [[Dutch language|Dutch]] uses diaeresis. For example in ''ruïne'' it means that the u and i are separately pronounced in their usual way, and not in the way that the combination ui is normally pronounced. Thus it works as a separation sign and not as an indication for an alternative version of the i. Diacritics can be used for emphasis (''érg koud'' for ''very'' cold) or for disambiguation between the numeral one (''één appel'', one apple) and the indefinite article (''een appel'', an apple). Grave and acute accents are used on a very small number of words, mostly loanwords.

* In [[Estonian language|Estonian]], carons in ''š'' or ''ž'' may appear only in foreign proper names and [[loanwords]], but may be also substituted with ''sh'' or ''zh'' in some texts. Apostrophe can be used in declension of some foreign names to separate the stem from any [[declension]] endings; e.g., ''Monet' '' or ''Monet'sse'' for the [[genitive case]] and [[illative case]], respectively, for (the famous painter) &quot;Monet&quot;. 

* [[French language|French]] uses grave, acute, circumflex, cedilla and diaeresis. However, not all diacritics occur on all vowels in French: 
** Acute (''accent aigu'') only occurs on ''e'' (''é'', pronounced /e/)
** Grave (''accent grave'') occurs on ''e'' (''è'', pronounced /ε/), ''a'' (''à''), and ''u'' (''ù'')
** Circumflex (''accent circonflexe'') occurs on all vowels: ''e'' (''ê'', pronounced /ε/), ''a'' (''â'', pronounced /α/), ''i'' (''î''), ''o'' (''ô'', pronounced /o/), and ''u'' (''û''; if occurring in the combination ''eû'', pronounced /ø/)
** Cedilla (''cédille'') is used only under the ''c'' (''ç'', pronounced /s/). It is used in cases in which a ''c'' is soft before ''a'', ''o'', or ''u'', such as ''ça'' (pronounced /sa/, not /ka/).
** Diaeresis (''tréma'') occurs on ''e'' (''ë''), ''i'' (''ï''), ''u'' (''ü''), and ''y'' (''ÿ''). The diaeresis only occurs on ''y'' in a few proper nouns, including ''Louÿs'' and ''[[L'Haÿ-les-Roses]]''. The mark's function is to indicate that the vowel is pronounced separately from the one just before it.
** Diacritics are sometimes omitted from [[majuscule|capitalized]] letters, especially in France.
** Not all French diacritics affect pronunciation. However, all cases in which they do have been noted in the foregoing.

* [[Finnish language|Finnish]] uses a colon to decline loanwords and abbreviations; e.g., ''USA:han'' for the illative case of &quot;USA&quot;. Also characters ''ä'' and ''ö'' are part of the Finnish alphabet (''a'' and ''o'' with ''Umlaut'').

*[[German language|German]] has the ''Umlaut'' (¨). This can be used over ''a'', ''o'', or ''u'' to indicate vowel modification. For instance: ''Ofen'' (/'o:fən/); ''Öfen'' (/'ø:fən/), which in this case makes the difference between singular and plural (“oven”/“ovens”). The sign originated in a superscript ''e''; a handwritten [[Sütterlin]] ''e'' resembles two parallel vertical lines, like an umlaut.

* [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] has [[kahako]]s (macrons) and [[okina]]s ({{unicode|&amp;#699;}}); often rendered as (‘).

* [[Irish language|Irish]] uses acute accent to indicate that the vowel is [[vowel length|long]].  It is known as ''síneadh fada'' in Irish.

* [[Italian language|Italian]] uses acute and grave to indicate irregular stress patterns (as in ''più'', which would otherwise be stressed on the ''i'') and to distinguish words that would otherwise be [[homograph]]s (such as ''te'' [&quot;you&quot;] and ''tè'' [&quot;tea&quot;]).  In many words, acute and grave are interchangeable.

* Romanized [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ([[Romaji]]) uses diacritics to mark long vowels. The [[Hepburn romanization]] system uses a [[macron]] to mark [[long vowels]], and the [[Kunrei-shiki]] and [[Nihon-shiki]] systems use a [[circumflex]].

* [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] uses the [[acute]], [[grave]] and [[tilde]] in dictionaries to indicate stress types in the language's [[pitch stress]] system.  In general usage, where letters appear with the [[caron]] (''č, š'' and ''ž'') they are considered as separate letters from ''c, s'' or ''z'' and collated separately; letters with the [[ogonek]] (''ą, ę, į'' and ''ų''), the [[macron]] (''ū'') and the [[anunaasika|superdot]] (''ė'') are considered as separate letters as well, but not given a unique collation order.

* [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] uses acute (to mark stressed vowels), grave (to mark the assimilation of two identical vowels into one, now used only on A), circumflex (marks both the stress and the roundness, being deprecated in this second use), cedilla (to mark the pronunciation of C as /s/ instead of /k/ before A, O and U and tilde (to mark the nasalisation of A and O). In [[Brazil]] diaeresis is also used to differ the pronunciation of groups like ''qüe'', and ''güi'' (respetively /kwe/ and /gwi/) from ''que'' and ''gui'' (/ke/ and /gi/).

* Many [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] and [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] languages use caron to signify either [[palatalisation]] or [[iotation]].

* Many Slavic languages that use the Latin alphabet have [[ogonek]] and [[bar (diacritic)|bar]].

* [[Slovak language|Slovak]] has acute, caron, circumflex (only above ''o'') and diaresis (only above ''a'').

* [[Spanish language|Spanish]] uses acute, diaeresis and tilde. Acute is used on a vowel in a stressed syllable in words with irregular stress patterns. It can also be used to &quot;break&quot; a [[diphthong]] as in ''tío'' (pronounced /'tio/, and not /tjo/ as it would be without the accent). Moreover, the acute can be used to distinguish words that otherwise are spelt alike, such as ''mas'' ( = &quot;but&quot;} and ''más'' ( = &quot;more&quot;), and also to distinguish interrogative and relative words otherwise spelt alike, such as ''donde/¿dónde?'' ( = &quot;where&quot;) or ''como/¿cómo?'' ( = &quot;as&quot;/&quot;how?&quot;). Tilde is used on ''n'', forming [[Ñ|a separate letter (''ñ'')]] in the Spanish alphabet. Diaeresis is used only over u (ü) so that it is pronounced /w/ in the combinations ''gue'' and ''gui'' (where ''u'' is normally silent), for example ''ambigüedad''. In poetry, diaeresis may be used on ''i'' and ''u'' as a way to force [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]].
*[[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] uses a hyphen after a consonant to indicate a syllable break (''nag-alis'' /nag·a·lís/ as opposed to ''nagalis'' /na·ga·lís/). A hyphen is not necessary between two vowels, vowels being distinctly pronounced in Tagalog (''tauhan'' /ta·ú·han/, ''buo'' /bu·ô/).
*[[Tamil language|Tamil]] does not have any diacritics in itself, but uses the [[Arabic numerals|Western numerals]] 2, 3 and 4 as diacritics to represent aspirated, voiced, and voiced-aspirated consonants when the [[Tamil script]] is used to write to long passages in Sanskrit.
* [[Turkish language|Turkish]] uses a [[G-breve]] (''Ğ''), a diaeresis on two vowels (''[[Ö]]'' and ''[[Ü]]'') to represent rounding, a cedilla on two consonants (''[[Ç]]'' and ''[[S-cedilla|Ş]]'', to represent the affricates &lt;tt&gt;/tS/&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;/S/&lt;/tt&gt;) and also possesses a dotted capital ''[[I-dot|İ]]'' (and a dotless lowercase ''ı''). Turkish considers each of these a separate letter, rather than a modification of existing characters, however; see [[Turkish alphabet]] for more details.

* [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] uses acute (dấu sắc), grave (dấu huyền), tilde (dấu ngã), dot below (dấu nặng) and hook (dấu hỏi) on vowels as [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] indicators. 

* [[Welsh language|Welsh]] uses the circumflex, diaeresis, acute and grave accents on its seven vowels ''a, e, i, o, u, w, y''. The most common is the circumflex (which it calls ''to bach'', meaning &quot;little roof&quot;) to denote a long vowel, usually to disambiguate it from a similar word with a short vowel. The rarer grave accent has the opposite effect, shortening vowel sounds which would usually be pronounced long. The acute accent and diaeresis are also occasionally used, to denote stress and vowel separation respectively. The w-circumflex and y-circumflex are among the most common accented characters in Welsh, but unusual in languages generally, and were until recently very hard to obtain in word-processed and HTML documents.

* Modern [[English language|English]] does not usually have diacritics, which appear only in foreign and loanwords. The letter '''è''' is an exception, used to modify the pronunciation of words ending in -ed within poetry and songs, though this is considered, by some, to be archaic. Occasionally, especially in older literature, and notably in [[The New Yorker]]'s [[house style]], the diaeresis is used (as in Dutch) to indicate a syllable break. For instance, in &quot;coördinate&quot; it indicates that the second &quot;o&quot; starts a new syllable.

== Non-diacritic usage ==

* [[Esperanto language|Esperanto]] has a separate letter which is a ''u'' with a [[breve]] over it, and letters which are ''c'', ''g'', ''h'', ''j'' and ''s'' with  the [[circumflex]] over them.  These are not diacritic marks, but necessary parts of entirely separate letters.

* [[Estonian language|Estonian]] has a distinct letter ''õ'' which contains a non-diacritical tilde. Estonian &quot;dotted vowels&quot; ''ä'', ''ö'', ''ü'' are similar to German, but these are also distinct letters, not containing umlauts. All these four letters have their own place in the alphabet (between ''w'' and ''x''). 

* [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic (language)|Icelandic]] use acute accents, digraphs, and other special letters. All are considered separate letters, and have their own place in the alphabet:
** Faroese: ''á'', ''ð'', ''í'', ''ó'', ''ú'', ''ý'', ''æ'' and ''ø''
** Icelandic: ''á'', ''ð'', ''é'', ''í'', ''ó'', ''ú'', ''ý'', ''æ'', ''ö'' and ''þ''

* [[Finnish language|Finnish]] uses dotted vowels (''ä'' and ''ö'') similar to in Swedish, and ''å'', ''š'' and ''ž'' in foreign names and loanwords; they are considered distinct letters and collate after ''z''.  

* [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] uses the acute and double acute accent (unique to Hungarian): ''áéíóú'' and ''őű''. The diacritic marks over the letters ''ö'' and ''ü'' are not [[umlaut]]s. The acute accent indicates the long form of a vowel, while the double acute performs the same function for ''ö'' and ''ü''. Both long and short forms of the vowels are listed separately in the [[Hungarian alphabet]].

* [[Maltese language|Maltese]] uses a C, G, and Z with a dot over them (Ċ, Ġ, Ż), and also has a H with an extra horizontal bar. For upper case H, the extra bar is written slightly above the usual bar. For lower case H, the extra bar is written crossing the vertical, like a ''t'', and not touching the lower part (Ħ, ħ). The above letters are considered separate letters, not dicritics. Maltese sometimes uses diacritics on some vowels to indicate stress or long vowels, especially in dictionaries.

* [[Romanian language|Romanian]] uses a breve on the letter ''a'' ('''ă''') to indicate the sound [[schwa]] (/ə/), as well as a circumflex over the letters ''a'' ('''â''') and ''i'' ('''î''') for the sound /{{unicode|&amp;#616;}}/. Romanian also writes a [[comma]] below the letters ''s'' ('''{{polytonic|&amp;#537;}}''') and ''t'' ('''{{polytonic|&amp;#539;}}''') to represent the sounds /{{unicode|&amp;#643;}}/ and /{{unicode|&amp;#678;}}/, respectively.

* Among the [[Scandinavian languages]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] have long used [[Æ|ash]] (''æ'', actually a ligature) and [[Ø|o-slash]] (''ø''), but have more recently incorporated a-ring (''å'') after Swedish example. Historically the ''å'' has developed from a ligature by writing a small a on top of the letter a; if an ''å'' character is unavailable, some Scandinavian languages allow the substitution of a doubled ''a''. The Scandinavian languages collate these letters after z, but have different [[collation]] standards. In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], the order  å, ä, ö is used, while [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] follow the order æ, ø, å instead.

* [[Swedish language|Swedish]] uses characters identical to a-diaeresis (''ä'') and o-diaeresis (''ö'') in the place of ash and o-slash in addition to the a-circle (''å''). Historically the diaresis for the Swedish letters ''ä'' and ''ö'', like the German umlaut, has developed from a small gothic ''e'' written on top of the letters.

* [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] uses the [[horn (diacritic)|horn]] for the letters ơ and ư; [[circumflex]] for the letters â, ê, and ô; [[breve]] for the letter ă; and a bar through the letter đ.  See [[Vietnamese alphabet]] for their collation order.

In all these cases they are not seen as additional marks over the vowel, but are actually a necessary part of these characters, as they represent entirely different sounds to the basic forms.

* [[Cyrillic alphabet]]s
** [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] has a letter ''[[U short |ў]]''.
** [[Russian language|Russian]] has the letter ''[[Yo (Cyrillic) |ё]]'', usually replaced in print by ''[[E (Cyrillic) |е]]'', although it has a different pronunciation. ''Ё'' is still used in children's books and in handwriting. A [[minimal pair]] is ''все'' (''vse'', &quot;all&quot; pl.) and ''всё'' (''vsio'', &quot;everything&quot; n. sg.). 
** Bulgarian, Russian and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] have the letter ''[[Short I |й]]''. 
** Ukrainian also has the letter ''[[Yi (Cyrillic) |ï]]''.  
** Acute accents are also used in [[Slavic language]] dictionaries and textbooks to indicate [[lexical stress]], placed over the vowel of the stressed syllable.  This can also serve to disambiguate meaning (e.g., in Russian ''писа&amp;#769;ть'' (''pisát'') means &quot;to write&quot;, but ''пи&amp;#769;сать'' (''písat'') means &quot;to piss&quot;).

==Non-alphabetic scripts==

Some non-alphabetic scripts also employ symbols that function essentially as diacritics.

* Non-pure [[abjad]]s (such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] script) and [[abugida]]s use diacritics for denoting [[vowel]]s. Hebrew and Arabic also indicate consonant doubling and change with diacritics; Hebrew and [[Devanagari]] use them for foreign sounds. Devanagari and related abugidas also use a diacritical mark called a ''virama'' to mark the absence of a vowel.

* The Japanese [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] [[syllabary|syllabaries]] use the ''[[dakuten]]'' (゛) and ''[[handakuten]]'' (゜) symbols, also known as ''ten-ten'' and ''maru'', to indicate [[voiced consonant]]s.

== Alphabetization or collation ==

Different languages use different rules to put diacritic characters in [[alphabet]]ical order. French treats letters with diacritical marks the same as the underlying letter for purposes of ordering and dictionaries. The same is true in German, and in cases where two words differ only by an umlaut, the word without it is sorted first in German dictionaries (''eg'' &quot;schon&quot; and then &quot;schön&quot;, or &quot;fallen&quot; and then &quot;fällen&quot;). However, when names are concerned (''eg'' in phone books or in author catalogues in libraries), umlauts are often treated as combinations of the vowel with a suffixed 'e'; Austrian phone books now treat umlauts as separate letters (immediately following the underlying letter). 

The Scandinavian languages, by contrast, treat the diacritic characters ''ä'', ''ö'' and ''å'' as new and separate letters of the alphabet, and sort them after ''z''. Usually ''ä'' is sorted as equal to ''æ'' (ash) and ''ö'' is sorted as equal to ''ø'' (o-slash). Other diacritically marked letters are treated as variants of the underlying letter.

Other languages treat diacritically marked letters as variants of the underlying letter, but alphabetize them following the unmarked letter. In Spanish ''ñ'' is considered a new letter different from ''n'' and placed between ''n'' and ''o'', however, acute accents and diaeresis are ignored. 

The technical term for alphabetization is [[collation]].

==Generation with computers==

Modern computer technology was developed mostly in the English speaking countries, so data formats, keyboard layouts, etc. were developed with an English bias; a &quot;simple&quot; alphabet without diacritical marks.   This has led to fears internationally that the marks and accents may become obsolete to facilitate the worldwide exchange of data.   Efforts have been made to create [[domain names]] that extend further than the English alphabet: the [[Internationalized domain names]], example: &quot;pokémon.com&quot;.

Depending on the [[keyboard layout]], which differs amongst countries, it is more or less easy to enter letters with diacritics on computers and typewriters. Some have their own keys, some are created by first pressing the key with the diacritic mark followed by the letter to place it on. Such a key is sometimes referred to as a [[dead key]], as it produces no output of its own, but modifies the output of the key pressed after it.

On computers with the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system, one can also enter each character of the current [[codepage]], e.g. [[ISO 8859-1|windows-1252]], by holding the Alt key and entering the respective decimal position on the Num pad, e.g. Alt+0210 is Ò. Additionally, on Windows XP, it is possible to enter any [[Unicode]] character from the Basic Multilingual Plane (i.e. up to U+FFFF) by pressing Alt and then, with Alt still pressed, the plus sign and the digits of the Unicode number each after the other. Alt with plus, D and 2 yields U+00D2: Ò.

In modern Microsoft Windows operating systems, the keyboard layout ''US International'' allows one to type almost all diacritics directly: &quot;+e gives ë, ~+o gives õ etc.. In addition to this, the layout provides many 'special characters' behind the AltGr modifier: AltGr+t is þ, AltGr+z is æ, etc..

Using the [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=FB7B3DCD-D4C1-4943-9C74-D8DF57EF19D7&amp;displaylang=en Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC)] people using Windows 2000, Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 can edit or create any keyboard layout.

On [[Apple Macintosh]] computers, there are keyboard shortcuts for the most common diacritics:

* Option-e followed by a vowel: places an acute accent.
* Option-u followed by a vowel: places a diaeresis.
* Option-n followed by a vowel or n: places a tilde.
* Option-` followed by a vowel: places a grave accent.
* Option-i followed by a vowel: places a circumflex.
* Option-c: places a c cedilla

On computers it is also a matter of available [[codepage]]s, whether you can use certain diacritics. [[Unicode]] tries to solve this problem, among others.

In [[GNOME]] applications (found on many [[Linux]] and [[Unix|UNIX]] computers) arbitrary [[Unicode]] characters may be entered by holding down the ctrl and shift keys while typing the [[hexadecimal]] codepoint.  After releasing ctrl-shift the digits will be converted into the symbol.  For example ctrl-shift 	1E3 produces {{unicode|&amp;#x1E3;}}.

Diacritics can be [[Compose|composed]] in most [[X Window System|X Window Systems]].

With Unicode it is also possible to [[Combining diacritical mark|combine diacritical marks]] with most characters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Didgeridoo Entier1.jpg|frame|A didgeridoo. This particular instrument is more ornate than most.]]The '''didgeridoo''' (or '''didjeridu''') is a unique wind [[musical instrument|instrument]] of the [[Indigenous Australians]] of northern [[Australia]]. It is sometimes described as a natural wooden [[trumpet]] or &quot;drone pipe&quot;. Musicologists classify it as an [[aerophone]].

A didgeridoo is usually cylindrical or conical in shape and can measure anywhere from 1 to 2 [[metre]]s, with most instruments measuring around 1.5 meters. Instruments shorter or longer than this are less common. Generally, the longer the instrument, the lower the pitch or key of the instrument. Keys from D to F♯ are the preferred pitch of traditional Aboriginal players.

There are no reliable sources stating the didgeridoo's exact age, though it is commonly claimed to be the world's oldest wind instrument. Archaeological studies of rock art in northern Australia suggests that the Aboriginal people of the [[Kakadu]] region of the [[Northern Territory]] have been using the didgeridoo for about 1500 years, based on the dating of paintings on cave walls and shelters from this period.

== The name ==
&quot;Didgeridoo&quot; is usually considered to be an [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoetic]] word of Western invention, but it has been suggested that it may be derived from the [[Irish language|Irish]] words ''dúdaire'' or ''dúidire'', meaning variously 'trumpeter; constant smoker, puffer; long-necked person, eavesdropper; hummer, crooner' and  ''dubh'', meaning 'black' (or ''duth'', meaning 'native').[http://www.flinders.edu.au/news/articles/?fj09v13s02]  The earliest occurrences of the word in print include the ''Australian National Dictionary'' [[1919]], ''[[The Bulletin]]'' in [[1924]] and the writings of [[Herbert Basedow]] in [[1926]]. There are numerous names for this instrument among the Aboriginal people of northern Australia, with &quot;yirdaki&quot; one of the better known words in modern Western society. &quot;Yirdaki&quot;, also sometimes spelt &quot;yidaki&quot;, refers to the specific type of instrument made and used by the [[Yolngu]] people of north-east [[Arnhem Land]]. This name is not a substitute for &quot;didgeridoo&quot;. In Western Arnhem Land, one is more likely to hear of &quot;mago&quot;, and again, this is a specific term not to be used loosely. There is a general consensus that it is a matter of etiquette to reserve tribal names for tribal instruments, though retailers and businesses have been quick to exploit these special names for generic tourist-oriented instruments.

== Construction and play ==
Authentic Aboriginal didgeridoos produced in traditionally-oriented communities in northern Australia are typically made from [[hardwood]]s, especially the various [[eucalyptus]] species that are [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to the region. The main trunk of the tree is often harvested, though branches are sometimes used as well. Aboriginal craftsmen spend considerable time searching for a suitable tree to make into a didgeridoo. The difficult part is in finding a tree that has been suitably hollowed out by [[termite]]s. If the hollow is too big or too small, it will make a poor quality instrument.

A termite-bored didgeridoo has a resulting internal surface that creates non-harmonic resonant frequencies. (Unlike the regular [[harmonics]] produced by a bored or plastic pipe.)  The first [[overtone]] is usually around an 11th higher than the fundamental frequency.  This quality gives a distinct [[timbre]]: the classical didgeridoo sound.

[[Image:Didgeridoo Embout1.jpg|frame|The wax mouthpiece often softens during play, forming a more perfect seal.]]When a suitable tree is found and cut down, a length of the main trunk or a segment of a branch is removed that will become the didgeridoo. The bark is taken off, the ends trimmed, and some shaping of the exterior then results in a finished instrument. This instrument may be painted or left undecorated. A rim of [[beeswax]] may be applied to the [[mouthpiece]] end.

The didgeridoo is played with continuously vibrating lips to produce the drone while using a special breathing technique called [[circular breaashington, D.C.:  Three Continents, 1993.  ISBN 0-89410-142-0

'''Decipherment''' is the analysis of documents written in ancient [[language]]s, where the language is unknown, or knowledge of the language has been lost.

It is closely related to [[cryptanalysis]] &amp;mdash; the difference being that the original document was not deliberately written to be difficult to decipher.

The term has also been used to describe the analysis of the [[genetic code]] information encoded in [[DNA]] - see the [[Human Genome Project]] article for more on this.  

Some people have also used the word metaphorically to mean something like 'understanding'.

Examples of document decipherment:
* [[Cuneiform (script)|Cuneiform]] writing
* [[Harappan writing]]
* [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]ic writing
* [[Indus script]]
* [[Kharoshthi|Kharoshthi script]]
* [[Linear A]]
* [[Linear B]]
* [[Maya writing]]
* [[Olmec writing]]

Famous documents that have been the subject of actual or attempted decipherment:
* the [[Dresden Codex]]
* the [[Phaistos Disc]]
* the [[Rosetta Stone]]
* the [[Behistun Inscription]]
* the [[Voynich Manuscript]]
* the [[Rohonczi Codex]]

Famous decipherers:
* [[Michael Ventris]]
* [[Jean-François Champollion]]
* [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]]
* [[Yuri Knorosov]]

      <comment>/* Types */ Bold &quot;threats' to clarify it's part of the list of seven types of IPV as currently listed</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Domestic violence''', broadly defined, is [[violence]] within a [[home]].  Beyond this, the term has a range of definitions, some more and some less formal, that are frequently used with little awareness that a range of definitions exists.  Domestic violence can be physical, sexual and/or psychological.

Domestic violence is perpetrated by, and on, both men and women, and occurs in same-sex and opposite-sex relationships.

According to the [[Center for Disease Control]] [http://www.cdc.gov/], domestic violence is a serious, preventable public health problem affecting more than 32 million Americans (Tjaden and Thoennes 2000). 

Domestic violence can vary in frequency and severity. It occurs on a continuum, ranging from non-physical psychological abuse to one hit that may or may not physically injure the victim to chronic, severe violence.  The term &quot;initimate partner violence&quot;, or IPV, is often used more or less synonymously.  Repeated abuse is also known as battering.

==Types==
There are seven main types of intimate partner violence:

'''Physical [[violence]]''' is the intentional use of physical force with the potential for causing death, disability, injury, or harm, for example, hitting, shoving, biting, restraint, or use of a weapon.

'''[[Sexual violence]]''' is divided into three categories: 1) use of physical force to compel a person to engage in a sexual act against his or her will, whether or not the act is completed; 2) attempted or completed sex act involving a person who is unable to understand the nature or condition of the act, to decline participation, or to communicate unwillingness to engage in the sexual act, e.g., because of illness, disability, or the influence of alcohol or other drugs, or because of intimidation or pressure; and 3) abusive sexual contact. 

'''Threats''' of physical or sexual violence use words, gestures, or weapons to communicate the intent to cause death, disability, injury, or physical harm.

'''Psychological/emotional violence''' involves trauma to the victim caused by acts, threats of acts, or coercive tactics. Psychological/emotional abuse can include, but is not limited to, humiliating the victim, controlling what the victim can and cannot do, withholding information from the victim, deliberately doing something to make the victim feel diminished or embarrassed, isolating the victim from friends and family, and denying the victim access to money or other basic resources. It is considered psychological/emotional violence when there has been prior physical or sexual violence or prior threat of physical or sexual violence.

[[Relational aggression]] is form of Psychological/Social aggression the uses various forms of falsehood, secrecy and gossip to commit covert violence.  Also known (incorrectly) as 'Female Bullying', it is often a spectactularly successful tactic because so few people know how to detect it.  Women, and also men, often use it because it is covert, leaves no visible scars and can be done with a smile.  It destroys or damages the target's reputation and ruins the targets relationships.

[[Parental alienation]] is another form of covert violence where children are used as a weapon of war by one parent to alienate the other parent.  This covert form of domestic violence is often used by women, and sometimes men too, in high-conflict marriages.  It is often devastating to the alienated spouse/parent and to the alienating/alienated children caught in the middle.  In effect, it uses innocent, unwitting children to commit relational aggression by one parent against the other.

In addition, [[stalking]] is often included among the types of IPV. Stalking generally refers to repeated behavior that causes victims to feel a high level of fear (Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000).

==[[CAFCASS]] Definition==
CAFCASS, whilst mentioning in its Domestic Violence Policy [http://www.cafcass.gov.uk/English/Publications/consultation/04DecDV%20Policy.pdf] that it uses the term ''domestic violence'' to refer to a range of violent and abusive behaviours, defines it as:

*Patterns of behaviour characterised by the misuse of power and control by one person over another who are or have been in an intimate relationship. It can occur in mixed gender relationships and same gender relationships and has profound consequences for the lives of children, individuals, families and communities. It may be physical, sexual, emotional and/or psychological. The latter may include intimidation, harassment, damage to property, threats and financial abuse.

==Other definitions==
The New York State Coalition defines domestic violence as &quot;abusive behavior - emotional, psychological, physical, or sexual - that one person in an intimate relationship uses in order to control the other. It takes many different forms and includes behaviors such as threats, name-calling, preventing contact with family or friends, withholding money, actual or threatened physical harm and sexual assault. Stalking can also be a form of domestic violence.&quot;  [http://www.nyscadv.org/domesticviolence.htm]

''Domestic''
*[[Family]] relationship, explicit and formal or informal, usually between adults of similar age, else it is labeled [[child abuse]] or [[child sexual abuse|child molestation]] for children, and [[elder abuse]] for older adults.  

*[[Romantic relationship]]s including [[marriage]]s, cohabitation, and dating relationships, sexual and nonsexual, exclusive or nonexclusive, heterosexual or homosexual.

[[Image:images.encarta.msn.com/xrefmedia/sharemed/targets/images/pho/t629/T629092A.jpg|frame|A victim of Domestic Violence]]

''Violence''
*Physical violence 
**Direct physical violence, ranging from [[murder]] and [[rape]] to unwanted [[physical contact]]. 
**Indirect physical violence, including [[destruction]] of objects, [[throwing]] objects near the victim, harm to animals
*Mental/emotional violence
**Verbal [[threat]]s of physical violence to the victim, the self, or others including children, ranging from explicit, detailed and impending to implicit and vague as to both content and time frame 
**Verbal violence, including threats, [[insult]]s, put-downs, attacks
**Nonverbal threats, including [[gesture]]s, [[facial]] expressions, [[body]] [[posture]]s
*Economic/social abuse
**Controlling victim's money and other economic resources, preventing victim from seeing friends and relatives, actively sabotaging victim's social relationships and isolating victim from social contacts. 

The term &quot;domestic violence&quot; replaced &quot;wife beating&quot; or &quot;wife battering&quot; which came before. In its turn, it has begun to be replaced with more descriptive terms such as &quot;relationship violence&quot;, &quot;domestic abuse&quot;, &quot;intimate partner violence&quot;, &quot;[[spousal abuse]]&quot;, and &quot;family violence&quot;.  The term has been defined legally in some jurisdictions, which can add further confusion when members of the justice system interact with domestic violence advocates.

===Cycle of violence===
Frequently, domestic violence is used to describe specific violent and overtly abusive incidents, and legal definitions will tend to take this perspective.  However, when violent and abusive behaviors happen within a relationship, the effects of those behaviors continue after these overt incidents are over.  Advocates and counselors will refer to domestic violence as a pattern of behaviors, including those listed above.  

[[Lenore Walker]] presented the model of a [[Cycle of violence|Cycle of Violence]] which consists of three basic phases:

;''Honeymoon Phase'':Characterized by affection, apology, apparent end of violence.
;''Tension Building Phase'':Characterized by poor communication, tension, fear of causing outbursts,
;''Acting-out Phase'':Characterized by outbursts of violent, abusive incidents.

Although it is easy to see the outbursts of the Acting-out Phase as abuse, even the more pleasant behaviors of the Honeymoon Phase serve to perpetuate the abuse. See also the [[cycle of abuse]] article.

=Cause=
There are many different theories as to the cause of domestic violence. One of the leading theories is that domestic violence is fueled by a need for power and control over another person. The Domestic Abuse Intervention Project illustrated this by creating the  [http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Power_and_Control_wheel_NCDSV.pdf &quot;Power and Control Wheel&quot;] which shows power and control at the center, surrounded by spokes referring to techniques used, the titles of which include:

* Coercion and threats
* Intimidation
* Emotional abuse
* Isolation
* Minimizing, denying and blaming 
* Using Children
* Economic Abuse
* Male Privilege 

The simplest theory that explains the cause for domestic violence comes from people who deal with bullies.  It is a means to an end that is easier than other means.  The heading on the UK National Website for Bullying in the Family states that 'Those Who Can, Do.  Those Who Can't Bully.'  It seems reasonable to add that those who ''won't'' also prefer violence too.

Given the complexity of human beings and human societies, it seems likely that the full scope of possible intentions for violence occur in domestic violence too.  One film which shows some of these intentions is [[The Piano]] (1994).  Domestic violence often seems to be intended to intimidate, deter, avenge, punish and/or to torture.   Anthropologist Michael Ghigleiri, in his scientific study of male violence suggests that anger in insecure and jealous men who abuse women is associated with prior physical and verbal abuse by their mothers.  These men who fear abandonment and cuckoldry by their wives, use abuse as the best way to stop them.

Though not by any means a cause, substance abuse and mental illness can act as fuel for domestic violence.



=Purpose=

Whilst purposelessness might be a better heading for this section, a [[causality|causalist]] view is that the purpose of domestic violence is not primarily to hurt or harm the victim.  Rather, it is to gain or maintain power and control over the victim.

''Note that power in a relationship is often a matter of perception. A person may perceive themselves to be put-upon when a less involved observer would disagree.''

An alternative view is that abuse arises more from an attempt to 'export' feelings of power''less''ness to the victim. The purpose of an attempt to 'gain or maintain power and control over the victim' is to develop and enforce a permanent channel for such attempted 'export' to the other. Since feelings are personal, and cannot be resolved via others as proxies, this 'export' is inherently impossible to achieve, hence such behaviours are inherently addictive, leading to cycles of abuse. Mutual cycles develop when each party attempts to 'pass the buck' back and forth, usually through varying mechanisms of abuse. Since preferences for abuse-mechanisms are somewhat gendered, with females strongly favouring non-physical forms of abuse, selective 'snapshots' of such interactions may create an illusion of a gendered pattern of violence. Models such as the Duluth framework which attempt to resolve abuse by disempowering the alleged 'perpetrator' actually exacerbate the problems and all but guarantee failure. Resolution is only achieved when ''all'' parties acknowledge their responsibilities, and identify and respect mutual purpose. [http://www.nuancejournal.com.au/documents/one/graves-duluth.pdf]

=Gender=
It is impossible to have a discussion of domestic violence that does not include a discussion of the role gender does or doesn't have to play in the problem.  Sometimes, the discussion of gender can overwhelm any other topic, due to the degree of emotion with which the discussion of gender can attain. The topic is also itself emotive because of the revulsion that is evoked by the idea of vulnerable people powerless and hurt at the hands of a partner, spouse or other relative.

Attention to domestic violence began in the women's movement as concern about wives being beaten by their husbands, and has remained a major focus in the modern [[feminism|feminist]] movement, particularly under the label &quot;violence against women&quot;. [[Erin Pizzey]], the founder of an early women's shelter in [[Chiswick]], London, has since expressed her dismay at how the issue has become a gender-[[political football]], and expressed an unpopular view in her book ''Prone to Violence'' that some women in the refuge system had a predisposition to seek abusive relationships. She also expressed the view that domestic violence can occur against any vulnerable intimates, regardless of their sex. Given the violence that she herself experienced in the UK for voicing her views, one might be suspicious of some of those who opposed her views, which remain very relevant. Political balance in light of pressure from the feminist movement has been helped by noting that there are women who were violent with their husbands and partners, and with the realisation that where the prevailing culture ceases to be predominantly patriarchal there is no corresponding lessening in the incidence of domestic violence. Pizzey never claimed that the sample of victims she described is  representative of the majority of female victims of violence, only that ''some'' erstwhile victims are actually perpetrators or collaborators in violent relationships to which they are addicted.

There continues to be discussion about whether men are more abusive than women, whether men's abuse of women is worse than women's abuse of men, and whether abused men should be provided resources similar to those available for abused women.  What is often missing in such discussions is that, being equal, both genders commit more or less equal aggression, the difference being in the form that aggression takes (See External links). 
Males often prefer physical aggression while women often prefer psychological aggression.  Unlike physical violence, psychological violence leaves no visible scars but it's consequences, to the target, can be just as terrible.

Domestic violence is clearly an enormous problem. Many studies have reported the high frequency of women as victims: The Council of Europe found in a [[1992]] study that 1 in 4 women experience domestic violence over their lifetimes and between 6-10% of women suffer domestic violence in a given year.  Every minute in the UK, the Police receive a call from the public for assistance for domestic violence.  However, they estimate that only around 35% of domestic violence is actually reported. A [[2002]] Women's Aid study found that 74% of separated women suffered from post-separation violence. Until recently, very few studies even asked about female-on-male (or female-on-female) domestic violence; so while these figures are apallingly high, the prevalence of violence against men is typically not included in these figures.

Studies based on &lt;i&gt;reported&lt;/i&gt; assaults or on police records typically find much greater male-on-female violence, than the reverse. The British Crime Survey for the year 2001-2 [http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs04/hors276.pdf] reported, &quot;There were an estimated 12.9 million incidents of domestic violence acts (nonsexual threats or force) against women [84%] and 2.5 million against men [16%] in England and Wales in the year prior to interview.&quot; The same report states, &quot;Four per cent of women and two per cent of men were subject to domestic violence (non-sexual domestic threats or force) during the last year.&quot; However, men are known to be far less likely to file complaints. 

Many publications claim a grave disparity in general: Women's Aid (the UKs leading domestic violence charity) say &quot;Crime statistics and research both show that domestic violence is gender specific - usually the perpetrator of a pattern of repeated assaults is a man. Women experience the most serious physical and repeated assaults.&quot;  42% of all female homicide victims compared with 4% of male homicide victims, were killed by current or former partners in England and Wales in the year [[2000]]-[[2001]]. This equates to 102 women, an average of 2 women each week (Home Office, [[2001]]). Ahimsa [http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/news/032001/03/abuse.shtml], a UK based DV project, says: &quot;Research findings consistently report that over 90% of domestic violence is perpetrated by men within heterosexual relationships&quot;. This, however, is simply untrue. Although it is true that many studies report only male-on-female violence because that is all they ask about, those studies that do examine prevalence in both directions overwhelmingly find little difference by gender. This is particularly true when questions are specific: for example, men typically do not report being slapped if they are simply asked about &quot;violence&quot;; women do.

Martin S. Fiebert of the Department of Psychology at California State University, Long Beach, provides an annotated bibliography of 174 scholarly studies that have found significant prevalence of female-on-male domestic violence[http://www.csulb.edu/~mfiebert/assault.htm].

When it comes to domestic violence towards children involving physical abuse, research in the UK by the [[NSPCC]] indicated that &quot;most violence occurred at home (78 per cent) with mothers being primarily responsible in 49 per cent of cases and fathers in 40 per cent of cases.&quot;[http://www.aifs.gov.au/nch/pubs/nl2001/winter2.html]

Studies have been carried out to explore these issues, and results have seemed somewhat contradictory.  A problem in conducting such studies is the amount of silence, fear and shame that results from abuse within families and relationships.  Another is that abusive patterns can tend to seem normal to those who have lived in them for a length of time.  Similarly, subtle forms of abuse can be quite transparent even as they set the stage for further abuse seeming normal.  Finally, inconsistent definition of what domestic violence is makes strong conclusions hard to reach when compiling the available studies.  

Both men and women have been arrested and convicted of assaulting their partners in both heterosexual and homosexual relationships.  The bulk of these arrests has been men being arrested for assaulting women, but that has been shifting somewhat over time and clearly arrest records are not the whole story. Actual studies of behaviour show that whilst half of male/female intimate violence is best described as mutual brawling, a quarter is the male attacking the female and the remaining quarter being females attacking their male partner. Determining how many instances of domestic violence actually involve male victims is difficult. Male domestic violence victims may be reluctant to get help for a number of reasons (see [http://www.batteredmen.com/bathelpwhymen.htm this article]) (Article checked [[August 8]], [[2004]].) A man who calls for help may even risk being arrested as the &quot;perpetrator&quot; even though he was the victim. 

The general consensus seems to be that male on female domestic violence is more likely to result in serious injury or death, whereas female on male (which, under the definition used by the UK Government if no others, includes preventing the father seeing the children), is more likely to result in male [[suicide]].  Men on average have more upper body strength and socialization that predisposes them to resort to violence more than women do, and that can give them a higher average lethality than women.  However, women can and do use weapons to equalize whatever deficit in physical power which may be present, and can also use social constraints against men hitting women even in self-defense, to provide them with sufficient lethality to be dangerous in conflict situations.  The US National Family Violence Survey has consistently indicated, in repeated surveys over more than 30 years, that women are more than twice as likely as men to initiate domestic assault, and more than twice as likely to use weapons.  The oft-repeated claim that all violence by women is self-defence has similarly been proven to be based on [[Begging the question|circular reasoning]].  Women also are at least as well equipped to use psychologicAspirated {{IPA|/ d̪ /}}

At the end of the traditional table of alphabets, three cosonantal clusters are also added: &amp;#2325;&amp;#2381;&amp;#2359; {{IPA|/kʃə/}} (in Hindi), &amp;#2340;&amp;#2381;&amp;#2352; {{IPA|/t̪rə/}} and &amp;#2332;&amp;#2381;&amp;#2334; {{IPA|/gjə/}} (in Hindi). Other than these, sounds borrowed from the other languages like Persian and Arabic are written with a dot (''bindu'' or ''nukta'') beneath the nearest approximate alphabet. They are not included in the traditional listing. Many native Hindi speakers, especially those who come from rural backgrounds and do not speak really good khariboli or Urdu, confused these sounds (except {{IPA|/ɽ/ and /ɽ&lt;sup&gt;ɦ&lt;/sup&gt;/}}) and pronounce them as the nearest equivalents in Sanskritized Hindi (listed in column 4). These are:

Additional points:
*The &quot;r&quot; of Sanskrit is as in Standard American English. In modern Sanskrit pronunciation, the vowel &quot;ṛ&quot; is pronounced as / ri /. In Hindi, / r / is as pronounced in Spanish pe'''rr'''o.
*There is no retroflex flap in Sanskrit. In modern Hindi and other Indo-Aryan languages, they have sprung up as the allophonic flap variants of Sanskrit's simple voiced retroflex plosives. The / ɳ / (ṇ or ण) in Sanskrit is not a flap but a simple nasal stop, although it is pronounced by modern pundits while chanting as a nasal variant of the voiced retroflex flap. Hindi has two proper retroflex flaps. 
*Aspiration is actually a puff of breath that may follow a plosive consonant. English speakers could try pronouncing the words &quot;kite&quot;, &quot;take&quot;, &quot;chip&quot; and &quot;pat&quot; with a greater-than-usual puff of breath after the first consonant. The corresponding unaspirated plosives must be pronounced with no significant puff of breath at all.
*For practicing the voiced aspirates, one could try: &quot;drag him&quot;, &quot;said him&quot;, &quot;enrage him&quot;, &quot;grab him&quot;. The voiced aspirated plosives (also called as murmur stops) are extremely important and frequent in Sanskrit. Sanskrit (and its daughters) is the only language that has faithfully preserved these original Proto-Indo-European stops.
*The dental consonants in Sanskrit are as in Spanish or French. They can be pronounced by pronouncing / t / and / d / (of English) by pressing the tip of the tongue against the back of the teeth rather than against the back of the alveolar ridge as done by English speakers. The normal &quot;t&quot; and &quot;d&quot; in IAST transliteration are the dental stops; and they occur much, much more frequently than the retroflex stops.
*The retroflex consonants are the most difficult to pronounce. They are pronounced by curling the tongue such that its tip touches the roof of the mouth, like how the Americans pronounce their &quot;r&quot;. The retroflex flaps are pronounced in a similar way, by bringing the tongue's tip to the roof of the mouth and giving it a sharp flap downwards. However, bringing the tip of the tongue a bit above the normal alveolar ridge would also work fine. The normal alveolar plosives of English / t / and / d / do not exist as such in Sanskrit/Hindi. 
*The palatal plosives of Sanskrit/Hindi do not have a sharp frictional sound following them, as what happend in English '''ch'''ips and '''j'''am. These are more of pure plosives than affricates.
*Sanskrit/Hindi has no / v /. Its nearest equivalent is / ʋ /, which is very close to / v /, but does not a friction or buzzing sound associated with it. But in consonant clusters, this may allophonically change to / w /.
*The palatal sibilant of Sanskrit (IAST: ś) is very close to like the English ''sh'' in '''sh'''ip (although the Sanskrit phoneme is the voiceless alveolo-palatal fricative / ɕ /) while the English phoneme is the voiceless postalveolar fricative / ʃ / with lip rounding). Today, speakers of Sanskrit vary the palatal fricative from / ɕ / to / ʃ /. In Hindi, it is always pronounced as in '''sh'''ip.
*The retroflex sibilant / ʂ / is pronounced like / ʃ /, but with the tongue curled upwards towards the roof of the mouth. In Mādhyandini branch of Yajurveda, this phoneme is allowed to be pronounced at certain places as / kh /. In Hindi, this is pronounced as the English ''sh'' in '''sh'''ip.
*The Sanskrit / ɦ / is a voiced allophone of the normal h. In Hindi, it is pronounced as in '''h'''ome.
Another consonant is &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14pt;&quot;&gt;ळ&lt;/span&gt; is not used in [[Hindi language|Hindi]].  It is retroflex, and used in [[Vedic Sanskrit]], and [[Marathi language|Marathi]].

==== [[Ligature (typography)|Ligatures]] ====
Consonant clusters of two or more phonemes are realized by combining the aksharas into ligatures. Typically, the preceding akshara loses its vertical stroke and is put in direct contact with the succeeding one. In cases of aksharas that do not have vertical strokes in their independent form, the following aksharas are usually placed underneath the preceding one. In some cases, the ligatures take forms not readily recognizable as composed of the individual aksharas (e.g. &amp;lt;jñ&amp;gt;). Consonant clusters involving &amp;lt;r&amp;gt; are treated as a special case: preceding &amp;lt;r-&amp;gt; is realized as a right-facing hook above the following akshara, and following &amp;lt;-r&amp;gt; appears as a slanted stroke attached to the vertical stroke of the preceding akshara. Similarly for a cluster /XYZa/, both X and Y would be &quot;halved&quot;. There are many variants for this consonant cluster writing in devanagari script. The most common system is shown below for the traditional table. Here the second vowel is taken to be /n/, followed by the [[schwa]].

A '''diplomatic mission''' is a group of people from one [[state]] present in another state to represent the sending state in the receiving state.  In practice, a diplomatic mission usually denotes the '''permanent mission''', namely the office of a country's diplomatic representatives in the [[capital]] city of another country. Under [[international law]], diplomatic missions enjoy an [[extraterritoriality|extraterritorial status]] and thus, although remaining part of the host country's territory, they are exempt from local law and in almost all respects treated as being part of the territory of the home country. They are also only required to pay taxes equal to their respective countries' guidelines.

==Naming==
A permanent diplomatic mission is usually known as an '''embassy''', and the head of the mission is known as an [[ambassador]].  Missions between [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries are known as '''High Commissions''' and their heads are [[High Commissioner]]s.  All missions to the [[United Nations]] are known simply as '''Permanent Missions''', and the head of such a mission is typically both a ''Permanent Representative'' and an ambassador.  Some countries have more idiosyncratic naming for their missions and staff: a [[Holy See|Vatican]] mission is headed by a [[Nuncio]] and consequently known as an ''Apostolic Nunciature'', while [[Libya]]'s missions were for a long time known as ''People's Bureaus'' and the head of the mission was a ''Secretary''.  (Libya has since switched back to standard nomenclature.)

In the past a diplomatic mission headed by a lower ranking official (an ''envoy'' or ''minister resident'') was known as a '''legation'''. Since the ranks of envoy and minister resident are effectively obsolete, the designation of ''legation'' is no longer used today. (See [[diplomatic rank]].)

In cases of dispute, it is not uncommon for a country to recall its head of mission as a sign of its displeasure.  This is less drastic than cutting diplomatic relations completely, and the mission will still continue operating more or less normally, but it will now be headed by a [[chargé d'affaires]] who may have limited powers.  Note that for the period of succession between two heads of missions, a ''chargé d'affaires per interim'' may be appointed as caretaker; this does not imply any hostility to the host country.

A [[Consul (representative)|Consulate]] is similar to (but not the same as) a diplomatic office, but with focus on dealing with individual persons and businesses, as defined by the [[Vienna Convention on Consular Relations]]. A Consulate is generally a representative of the Embassy in locales outside of the capital city. For instance, The British Embassy to the United States is in [[Washington, D.C.]], and there are British Consulates in Los Angeles, New York City, Houston, etc. 

The term &quot;embassy&quot; is often used to refer to the building or compound housing an ambassador's offices and staff.  Technically, &quot;embassy&quot; refers to the diplomatic delegation itself, while the office building in which they work is known as a '''chancery''', but this distinction is rarely used in practice.  Ambassadors reside in [[ambassadorial residence]]s, which enjoy the same rights as missions.

==Role==
The role of such a mission is to protect in the receiving State the interests of the sending State and of its nationals, within the limits permitted by international law; negotiating with the Government of the receiving State as directed by the sending State; ascertaining by lawful means conditions and developments in the receiving State, and reporting thereon to the Government of the sending State; promoting friendly relations between the sending State and the receiving State, and developing their economic, cultural and scientific relations.

Between members of the Commonwealth of Nations embassies sometimes have an additional role. It is generally expected that an embassy of a Commonwealth country in a non-Commonwealth country will do its best to provide diplomatic services to citizens from other Commonwealth countries if the citizen's country does not have an embassy in that country. (eg. If a South African citizen found him/herself in need of the services of an embassy in Thailand, it is generally understood that he/she could go to the Canadian Embassy and be provided with some help in obtaining the necessary services.) The same kind of procedure is also followed multilaterally by the memberstates of [[European Union]]. European citizens in need of consular help in a country without diplomatic or consular representation of their own country may turn to any consular or diplomatic mission of another EU memberstate.

The rights and immunities (such as [[diplomatic immunity]]) of diplomatic missions are codified in the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]].

==Non-recognized states==

Nations that are [[Non-recognized nations|not recognized]] have legations overseas but these are not recognized as having official diplomatic status as defined by the Vienna Convention.  These ''de facto embassies'' are usually referred to as '''Representative Offices'''. Some examples of these types of missions:  the [[TRNC Representative Office to the United States|Representative Office]] of the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] in Washington, D.C.; [[Somaliland]]'s representatives in [[London]], [[Addis Ababa]], [[Rome]], and Washington, D.C.; the [[Nagorno-Karabakh|Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh]] has a representative office in Washington, D.C.;  the [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Office]] in Washington, D.C. (representing the [[Republic of China]]); and the [[American Institute in Taiwan]] (representing the United States in the Republic of China).  Under United States law, such offices are regarded by the [[State Department]] officially as 'information centers' and the persons working in them do not have diplomatic visas, nor are [[Letter of Credence|credentials]] from their chiefs of mission accepted.

'''Economics''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] &amp;#959;&amp;#943;&amp;#954;&amp;#959;&amp;#962; [''oikos''], 'house', and  &amp;#957;&amp;#959;&amp;#956;&amp;#959;&amp;#962; [''nomos''], 'rule', hence ''&quot;household management&quot;'') is a [[social science]]  that studies the [[production]], [[distribution (business)|distribution]], [[trade]] and [[consumption]] of [[Good (economics)|goods]] and services. Economics is said to be [[normative]] when it recommends one choice over another, or when a [[subjective]] value judgment is made. Conversely, economics is said to be [[positive (social sciences)|positive]] when it tries objectively to predict and explain consequences of choices, given a set of [[assumption]]s and/or a set of [[observation]]s. The choice of which assumptions to make in building a model as well as which observations to highlight is, however, normative.    

Economics, which focuses on measurable variables, is broadly divided into two main branches: '''[[microeconomics]]''', which deals with individual agents, such as households and businesses, and '''[[macroeconomics]]''', which considers the economy as a whole, in which case it considers [[aggregate supply]] and [[aggregate demand|demand]] for [[money]], [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[commodity|commodities]]. Aspects receiving particular attention in economics are [[resource allocation]], production, distribution, trade, and [[competition]]. Economic logic is increasingly applied to any problem that involves choice under scarcity or determining economic [[value (economics)|value]].  

The mainstream economic paradigm is a combination of [[neoclassical economics]] and macroeconomics called the [[neoclassical synthesis]]. Various schools of [[heterodox economics]] seek to explain economic phenomena using different assumptions, formalisms or basic paradigmatic assumptions.

A professional working inside one of the many fields of economics or having an [[academic degree]] in this subject, is an [[economist]].

== Definitions of economics ==

Broadly speaking, economics is a social science, and its area of study is human activity involved in meeting needs and wants. Economists generally aspire to be the dominant social science by pretending to apply physical science rigor to &quot;soft&quot; real world phenomena. Economists' works are typically poached from sociology, political science or anthropology, using a method that seeks to apply the narrowest and most complex (albeit usually completely unrealistic) explanations to human beings' passionate and often highly irrational efforts to meet their oftentimes equally irrational needs and wants.

The supreme prize in modern economics is given for bucking the conventional wisdom, no matter how esoteric and convoluted the resulting logic. The best explanations of such phenomena usually begin with an instance of supposed irrationality and then explain it away as the result of sampling error (For this, most economists are awarded the Nobel prize at some point in their career: as a result of their keen understanding of supply and demand, economists more than one century ago managed to convince war profiteer Alfred Nobel to give one award per year in a field that had only a handful of practitioners).

John Maynard Keynes once remarked that &quot;Economics is the science of thinking.&quot; Clearly this oft-repeated historical anecdote illustrates that economists have long had big, swollen heads. But as though they purposefully set out to prove the impossibility of the endeavor, few of these proud &quot;thinkers&quot; have recently tried the practice. Instead they stick to their time-honored methodological shortcut of appropriating and generally over-simplifying the findings of other social sciences, cloaking them in ridiculous mathematical scribblings that obfuscate their origins and are further undermined by the complete epistemological unawareness of the modern economist. Modern economics has largely foresworn Keynes' original goals, and most would agree that economics today is the art of running regressions, seeing what the models spit out, and explaining it all away.


=== Wealth definition ===

The earliest definitions of political economy were simple, elegant statements defining it as the study of wealth. [[Adam Smith]], generally regarded as the Father of Economics, author of ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'' (generally known as ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'') defines economics simply as &quot;The science of wealth.&quot; Smith offered another definition, &quot;The Science relating to the laws of production, distribution and exchange.&quot; Wealth was defined as the specialization of labor which allowed a nation to produce more with its supply of labor and resources. This definition divided Smith and Hume from previous definitions which defined wealth as gold. Hume argued that gold without increased activity simply serves to raise prices.

[[John Stuart Mill]] defined economics as &quot;The practical science of production and distribution of wealth&quot;; this definition was adopted by the ''Concise Oxford Dictionary''. For Mill, wealth is defined as the stock of useful things.

Definitions in terms of wealth emphasize production and consumption, and do not deal with the economic activities of those not significantly involved in these two processes (for example, retired people, beggars). For economists of this period, non-productive activity is a cost on society. This interpretation gave economics a narrow focus that was rejected by many as placing wealth in the forefront and man in the background; [[John Ruskin]] referred to political economy as a &quot;Bastard science, the science of getting riches.&quot;

=== Welfare definition ===

Later definitions evolved to include human activity, advocating a shift toward the modern view of economics as primarily a study of man and of human welfare, not of money. [[Alfred Marshall]] in his 1890  book ''Principles of Economics'' wrote, &quot;Political Economy or Economics is a study of mankind in the ordinary business of Life; it examines the part of the individual and social action which is most closely connected with the attainment and with the use of material requisites of well-being.&quot;

The welfare definition was still criticized as too narrowly materialistic. It ignores, for example, the non-material aspects of the services of a doctor or a dancer. A theory of wages which ignored all those sums paid for immaterial services was incomplete. Welfare could not be quantitatively measured, because the [[marginal value|marginal]] significance of money differs from rich to the poor (i.e. $100 is relatively more important to the well-being of a poor person than to that of a wealthy person). Moreover, the activities of production and distribution of goods such as alcohol and tobacco may not be conducive to human welfare, but these scarce [[Good (economics)|goods]] do satisfy human wants.  

[[Marxist]] economics still focuses on a welfare definition. In addition several critiques of mainstream economics begin from the argument that current economic theory does not adequately measure welfare, but only monetized activity.

=== Scarcity definition ===

This definition allowed a potentially broader field of study, but it, too, has its critics. It is most amenable to those who consider economics a pure science, but others object that it reduces economics merely to a valuation theory. It ignores how values are fixed, prices are determined and national income is generated. It also ignores unemployment and other problems arising due to abundance. This definition cannot apply to such [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynesian]] concerns as cyclical instability, [[full employment]], and [[economic growth]]. 

The focus on scarcity continues to dominate [[neoclassical economics]], which, in turn, predominates in most academic economics departments. It has been criticized in recent years from a variety of quarters, including [[institutional economics]] and [[evolutionary economics]]).

== Areas of study in economics ==
Economics is usually divided into two main branches:

* [[Microeconomics]], which examines the economic behavior of individual actors such as businesses, households, and individuals, with a view to understand decision making in the face of scarcity and the consequences of these decisions.
* [[Macroeconomics]], which examines an economy as a whole with a view to understanding the interaction between economic aggregates such as [[measures of national income and output|national income]], [[employment]] and [[inflation]]. Note that [[general equilibrium]] theory combines concepts of a macro-economic view of the economy, but does so from a strictly constructed microeconomic viewpoint.

Attempts to join these two branches or to refute the distinction between them have been important motivators in much of recent economic thought, especially in the late [[1970s]] and early [[1980s]]. Today, the consensus view is arguably that good macroeconomics has solid microeconomic foundations. In other words, its premises ought to have theoretical and evidential support in microeconomics. Some authors (e.g. [[Kurt Dopfer]] and [[Stuart Holland]]) also argue that '[[mesoeconomics]]', which considers the intermediate level of economic organization such as [[market]]s and other [[institutional]] arrangements, should be considered a third branch of economic study.

Economics can also be divided into numerous sub-disciplines that do not always fit neatly into the macro-micro categorization. These sub-disciplines include: [[international economics]], [[labour economics]], [[welfare economics]], [[neuroeconomics]], [[information economics]], [[resource economics]], [[ecological economics]], [[environmental economics]], [[managerial economics]], [[financial economics]], [[urban economics]], [[mathematical economics]], [[development economics]], [[industrial organization]], [[retail economics]], [[war economics]], [[public finance]], [[agricultural economics]], [[transport economics]], [[media economics]], [[monetary economics]], [[economic history]], [[economic psychology]], [[economic sociology]], [[economic anthropology]], [[economic archaeology]], and [[economic geography]].

There are also methodologies used by economists whose underlying theories are important.
* The most significant example may be [[econometrics]], which applies statistical techniques to the study of [[economic data]]. [[Computational economics]] relies on mathematical methods, including econometrics.
* Another trend which is more recent, and closer to microeconomics, is to use [[social psychology]] concepts ([[behavioural economics]]) and methods ([[experimental economics]]) to understand deviations from the predictions of neoclassical economics.  
* [[Evolutionary economics]] often deals with the otherwise difficult questions related to the role of 'routines' and 'capabilities' in explaining heterogeneity in firm outcomes. It is arguably an even older theory than biological evolution, and differs from biological evolution in many details. Innovation can be the product of rational thought. Recombination can be continuous and can involve many 'parents'. And selection is not only natural but also rational, since economic agents can decide to abandon an inferior technology or behavior, rather than die with it.

Other subdivisions are possible. [[Finance]] has traditionally been considered a part of economics &amp;ndash; as its body of results emerges naturally from microeconomics &amp;ndash; but has today effectively established itself as a separate, though closely related, discipline.

There has been an increasing trend for ideas and methods from economics to be applied in wider contexts. Since economic analysis focuses on decision making, it can be applied, with varying degrees of success, to any field where people are faced with alternatives &amp;ndash; [[education]], [[marriage]], [[health]], etc. [[Public choice theory]] studies how economic analysis can apply to those fields traditionally considered outside of economics. The areas of investigation in economics therefore overlap with other social sciences, including [[political science]] and [[sociology]]. The most prevalent political economy is loosely called [[capitalism]].

''See [[political economy]] for the study of economics in the context of political science, and [[socioeconomics]] for the study of economics in the context of sociology.''

== Economic assumptions ==

=== Supply and demand ===
[[Image:Supply-demand-P.png|thumb|right|240px| The [[supply and demand]] model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between product availability and demand. The graph depicts an increase in demand from D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; along with the consequent increase in price and quantity required to reach a new equilibrium point on the supply curve (S).]]

''Main article: [[Supply and demand]].''

In [[microeconomics|microeconomic]] [[theory]] '''supply and demand''' attempts to describe, explain, and predict the [[price]] and quantity of goods sold in competitive [[market]]s. It is one of the most fundamental economic [[model (economics)|models]], ubiquitously used as a basic building block in a wide range of more detailed economic models and theories.

To define, '''Demand is the utility maximizing choice of a consumer'''. It is a strong desire backed by purchasing power with the willingness to purchase within a given period of time. '''Supply on the other hand is the quantity of goods that a producer or a supplier is willing to bring into the market for the purpose of sale, at a given price in a given period of time'''.

In general, the theory claims that where [[good (economics)|goods]] are traded in a market at a price where consumers demand more goods than businesses are prepared to supply, this shortage will tend to increase the price of the goods. Those consumers that are prepared to pay more will lead to an increase in the market price. Conversely, prices will tend to fall when the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded. This process continues until the  market approaches an equilibrium point, a point at which there is no longer any impetus to change. When producers are willing to supply the same quantity as buyers are willing to buy, the market is at equilibrium point where both the buyers as well as the sellers are agreeable to the price level. At this point the market is said to &quot;clear&quot;.

The theory of supply and demand is important in the functioning of a [[market economy]] in that it explains the mechanism by which many decisions about resource allocation are made.

=== Price ===
''Main Article:'' [[Price]]

In order to measure the ebb and flow of supply and demand, a measurable value is needed. The oldest and most commonly used is ''price'', or the going rate of exchange between buyers and sellers in a market. Price theory, therefore, charts the movement of measurable quantities over time, and the relationship between price and other measurable variables. In [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'', this was the trade-off between price and convenience. A great deal of economic theory is based around prices and the theory of [[supply and demand]]. In economic theory, the most efficient form of communication comes about when changes to an economy occur through price, such as when an increase in supply leads to a lower price, or an increase in demand leads to a higher price.

[[Image:Moneybillscoins3.jpg|thumb|right|145px|[[Exchange rate]]s are determined by the relative supply and demand of different [[currency|currencies]] &amp;mdash; an important issue in [[international trade]].]]

In many practical economic models, some form of &quot;price stickiness&quot; is incorporated to model the fact that prices do not move fluidly in many markets. Economic policy often revolves around arguments about the cause of &quot;economic friction&quot;, or price stickiness, and which is, therefore, preventing the supply and demand from reaching equilibrium.

Another area of economic controversy is about whether price measures value correctly. In mainstream market economics, where there are significant scarcities not factored into price, there is said to be an [[externality|externalization]] of cost. Market economics predicts that scarce goods which are under-priced are over-consumed (See [[social cost]]). This leads into [[public good]]s theory.

=== Scarcity ===
''Main article: [[Scarcity]]''

Scarcity is central to economic theory, known more commonly as the [[Economic Problem]], or Basic Economic Problem. Economic analysis is fundamentally about the maximization of something (leisure time, wealth, health, happiness - all commonly reduced to the concept of [[utility]]) subject to constraints. These constraints - or scarcity - inevitably define a trade-off. For example, one can have more money by working harder, but less time (there are only so many hours in a day, so time is scarce). One can have more radishes only at the expense of, for example, fewer carrots (you only have so much land on which to grow food - land is scarce).

Scarcity is defined as: when the price is zero, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied.  Price is a measure of relative scarcity.  When the price is rising, the commodity is becoming relatively scarcer.  When the price is falling, the commodity is becoming relatively less scarce.

Adam Smith considered, for example, the trade-off between time, or convenience, and money. He discussed how a person could live near town, and pay more for rent of his home, or live farther away and pay less, &quot;paying the difference out of his convenience&quot;.

[[Image:NYSE-floor.jpg|thumb|right|140px| [[Trade]]s on the floor of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] always involve a face-to-face interaction. There is one podium/desk on the trading floor for each of the exchange's three thousand or so [[stock]]s.]]

=== Marginalism ===
''Main article: [[marginalism]]''

In [[marginalism|marginalist economic theory]], the price level is determined by the [[marginal cost]] and [[marginal utility]]. The price of all goods will be the cost of making the last one that people will purchase, and the price of all the employees in a company will be the cost of hiring the last one the business needs. Marginalism looks at decisions based on &quot;the margins&quot;, what the cost to prodespecially when the two vowels are the same, as in ''heroo'' (hero) and ''praavo'' (great-grandfather).

=== Grammar ===
{{seesubarticle|Esperanto grammar}}
Esperanto words are [[Derivation (linguistics)|derived]] by stringing together [[prefix]]es, [[Root (linguistics)|roots]], and [[suffix]]es. This is very regular, so that people can create new words as they speak and be understood. [[Compound (linguistics)|Compound]] words are formed with modifier-first, head-final order, i.e. the same way as in English ''birdsong'' vs. ''songbird''.

The different [[Part of speech|parts of speech]] are marked by their own suffixes: all [[noun]]s end in ''-o'', all [[adjective]]s in ''-a'', adverbs in ''-e'', and [[verb]]s end in one of six [[Grammatical tense|tense]] and [[Grammatical mood|mood]] suffixes, such as [[present tense]] ''-as''. 

[[Grammatical number|Plural]] nouns end in ''-oj'' (pronounced &quot;oy&quot;), whereas [[direct object]]s end in ''-on''. Plural direct objects end in ''-ojn'' (pronounced to rhyme with &quot;coin&quot;). Adjectives [[Grammatical number#Effect of number on verbs and other parts of speech|agree]] with their nouns; their endings are plural ''-aj'' (pronounced &quot;eye&quot;), direct-object ''-an'', and plural direct-object ''-ajn'' (pronounced to rhyme with &quot;fine&quot;). 

&lt;table border=0 align=center&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;table border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr align=center style=&quot;background: #cccccc&quot;&gt;&lt;th&gt;[[Adjective]]&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th style=&quot;background: #efefef&quot;&gt;Subject&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th style=&quot;background: #efefef&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=center&gt;&lt;th style=&quot;background: #efefef&quot;&gt;Singular&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;-'''a'''&lt;td&gt;-'''an'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=center&gt;&lt;th style=&quot;background: #efefef&quot;&gt;Plural&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;-'''aj'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;-'''ajn'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The six verb [[inflection]]s are three tenses and three moods. They are [[present tense]] ''-as'', [[future tense]] ''-os'', [[past tense]] ''-is'', [[infinitive|infinitive mood]] ''-i'', [[conditional mood]] ''-us'', and [[jussive mood]] ''-u''. Verbs are not marked for person or number. For instance: ''kanti'' - to sing; ''mi kantas'' - I sing; ''mi kantis'' - I sang; ''mi kantos'' - I will sing.

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot;&gt;[[Future tense|Future]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''-os''' (kantos)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Verbal Mood&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Suffix&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot;&gt;[[Infinitive]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''-i''' (kanti)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot;&gt;[[Jussive mood|Jussive]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''-u''' (kantu)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot;&gt;[[Conditional mood|Conditional]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''-us''' (kantus)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Word order is comparatively free: adjectives may precede or follow nouns, and subjects, verbs and objects (marked by the suffix ''-n'') can occur in any order.  However, the [[article (grammar)|article]] ''la'' (the) and  the [[demonstrative]]s almost always come before the noun, and a [[preposition]] ''must'' come before it. Similarly, the negative ''ne'' (not) and [[conjunction]]s such as ''kaj'' (both, and) and ''ke'' (that) must precede the [[phrase]] or [[clause]] they introduce. In [[copula]]r (A = B) clauses, word order is just as important as it is in English clauses like ''people are dogs'' vs. ''dogs are people''.

=== Vocabulary ===
{{seesubarticle|Esperanto vocabulary}}
:''See the lists of [[Wiktionary:Category:Esperanto language|Esperanto words]] and [[Wiktionary:Category:Esperanto 1894 Universala Vortaro|Esperanto words from Universala Vortaro]] at [[Wiktionary]], the free dictionary and Wikipedia's sibling project.''

The core vocabulary of Esperanto was defined by ''Lingvo internacia'', published by Zamenhof in 1887.  It comprised 900 roots, which could be expanded into the tens of thousands of words with prefixes, suffixes, and compounding. In 1894, Zamenhof published the first Esperanto [[dictionary]], ''Universala Vortaro'', with a larger set of roots. However, the rules of the language allowed speakers to borrow new roots as needed, recommending only that they look for the most international forms, and then derive related meanings from these. 

Since then, many words have been borrowed, primarily but not solely from the western European languages. Not all proposed borrowings catch on, but many do, especially [[technical terminology|technical]] and [[science|scientific]] terms. Terms for everyday use, on the other hand, are more likely to be derived from existing roots—for example ''komputilo'' (a computer) from ''komputi'' (to compute) plus the suffix ''-ilo'' (tool)—or to be covered by extending the meanings of existing words (for example ''muso'' (a mouse), now also means a computer input device, as in English). There are frequent debates among Esperanto speakers about whether a particular borrowing is justified or whether the need can be met by deriving from or extending the meaning of existing words.

In addition to the root words and the rules for combining them, a learner of Esperanto must learn some idiomatic compounds that are not entirely straightforward. For example, ''eldoni'', literally &quot;to give out&quot;, is used for &quot;to publish&quot; (a [[Calque|calque]] of words in several European languages with the same derivation), and ''vortaro'', literally &quot;a collection of words&quot;, means &quot;a glossary&quot; or &quot;a dictionary&quot;. Such forms are modeled after usage in the ethnic European languages, and speakers of other languages may find them illogical. Fossilized derivations inherited from Esperanto's source languages may be similarly obscure, such as the opaque connection the root word ''centralo'' &quot;power station&quot; has with ''centro'' &quot;center&quot;. Compounds with ''-um-'' are overtly arbitrary, and must be learned individually, as ''-um-'' has no defined meaning. It turns ''dekstren'' &quot;to the right&quot; into ''dekstrumen'' &quot;clockwise&quot;, and ''komuna'' &quot;common/shared&quot; into ''komunumo'' &quot;community&quot;, for example.

Nevertheless, there are not nearly as many truly idiomatic or [[slang]] words in Esperanto as in ethnic languages, as these tend to make international communication difficult, working against Esperanto's main goal.

=== Writing system ===
{{seesubarticle|Esperanto orthography}}

Esperanto is written with a modified version of the [[Latin alphabet]], including six [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] with [[diacritic]]s: [[c-circumflex|ĉ]], [[g-circumflex|ĝ]], [[h-circumflex|ĥ]], [[j-circumflex|ĵ]], [[s-circumflex|ŝ]] and [[u-breve|ŭ]] (that is, ''c, g, h, j, s'' [[circumflex]], and ''u'' [[breve]]). The alphabet does not include the letters ''q, w, x, y'' except in unassimilated foreign names. 

The 28-letter alphabet is: 
&lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;a b c ĉ d e f g ĝ h ĥ i j ĵ k l m n o p r s ŝ t u ŭ v z&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

All letters are pronounced approximately as their [[Minuscule|lower-case]] equivalents in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], with the exception of ''c'' and the accented letters:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;&quot;
! Letter 
! Pronunciation
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! c  
| {{IPA|[ʦ]}}
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! ĉ 
| {{IPA|[ʧ]}}
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! ĝ 
| {{IPA|[ʤ]}}
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! ĥ 
| {{IPA|[x]}}
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! ĵ 
| {{IPA|[ʒ]}}
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! ŝ 
| {{IPA|[ʃ]}}
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''ŭ'''&lt;br&gt;(as ''aŭ, eŭ'')
| {{IPA|[u̯]}}
|}

Two [[ASCII]]-compatible writing conventions are in use. These substitute [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s for the accented letters. The original &quot;h-convention&quot; (''ch, gh, hh, jh, sh, u'') is based on English 'ch' and 'sh', while a more recent &quot;x-convention&quot; (''cx, gx, hx, jx, sx, ux'') is useful for alphabetic word sorting on a [[computer]] (''cx'' comes correctly after ''cu'', ''sx'' after ''sv'', etc.) as well as for simple conversion back into the standard [[orthography]].

Esperanto has been a 'clear' language for [[Morse code]] communication since the [[1920s]], and [[code]]s exist for all accented Esperanto characters

== The Esperanto speaker community ==
=== Geography and demography ===
Esperanto speakers are more numerous in Europe and East [[Asia]] than in the Americas, [[Africa]], and [[Oceania]], and more numerous in [[urban area|urban]] than in [[rural]] areas ([[#References|Sikosek 2003]]). Esperanto is particularly prevalent in the northern and eastern countries of Europe; in China, [[Korea]], Japan, and [[Iran]] within Asia; in [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], and [[Mexico]] in the Americas; and in [[Togo]] and [[Madagascar]] in Africa. 

An estimate of the number of Esperanto speakers was made by [[Sidney S. Culbert]], a [[retirement|retired]] [[psychology]] [[professor]] of the [[University of Washington]] and a longtime Esperantist, who tracked down and tested Esperanto speakers in sample areas of dozens of countries over a period of twenty years. Culbert concluded that between one and two million people speak Esperanto at [[ILR or Foreign Service Level language ability measures|Foreign Service Level 3]], &quot;professionally proficient&quot; (able to communicate moderately complex ideas without hesitation, and to follow speeches, radio broadcasts, etc.) ([[#References|Wolff 1996]]). Culbert's estimate was not made for Esperanto alone, but formed part of his listing of estimates for all languages of over 1 million speakers, published annually in the [[World Almanac|World Almanac and Book of Facts]].  Culbert's most detailed account of his methodology is found in a [http://www.panix.com/~dwolff/docs/culbert-methods.html 1989 letter to David Wolff]. Since Culbert never published detailed intermediate results for particular countries and regions, it is difficult to independently gauge the accuracy of his results. 

In the Almanac, his estimates for numbers of language speakers were rounded to the nearest million, thus the number for Esperanto speakers is shown as 2 million. This latter figure appears in ''[[Ethnologue]]''. Assuming that this figure is accurate, that means that about 0.03% of the world's population speaks the language.  This falls short of Zamenhof's goal of a [[international auxiliary language|universal language]], but it represents a level of popularity unmatched by any other constructed language. Ethnologue also states that there are 200 to 2000 [[native Esperanto speakers]] (''denaskuloj''), who have learned the language from birth from their Esperanto-speaking parents (this happens when Esperanto is the family language in an international family or sometimes in a family of devoted Esperantists).

Marcus Sikosek has challenged this figure of 1.6 million as exaggerated.  Sikosek estimated that even if Esperanto speakers were evenly distributed, assuming one million Esperanto speakers worldwide would lead one to expect about 180 in the city of [[Cologne, Germany|Cologne]]. Sikosek finds only 30 [[fluency|fluent]] speakers in that city, and similarly smaller than expected figures in several other places thought to have a larger-than-average concentration of Esperanto speakers. He also notes that there are a total of about 20,000 members of the various Esperanto organizations (other estimates are higher). Though there are undoubtedly many Esperanto speakers who are not members of any Esperanto organization, he thinks it unlikely that there are fifty times more speakers than organization members ([[#References|Sikosek 2003]]).  Others think such a [[ratio]] between members of the organized Esperanto movement and speakers of the language is not unlikely. 

The [[Finnish people|Finnish]] [[linguistics|linguist]] Jouko Lindstedt, an expert on native-born Esperanto speakers, presented the following scheme ([[#References|1996]]) to show the overall proportions of language capabilities within the Esperanto community:

* ''1,000 have Esperanto as their native language
* ''10,000 speak it fluently
* ''100,000 can use it actively
* ''1,000,000 understand a large amount passively
* ''10,000,000 have studied it to some extent at some time.''

In the absence of Dr. Culbert's detailed sampling data, or any other census data, it is impossible to state the number of speakers with certainty. Few observers, probably, would challenge the following statement from the [[website]] of the [[World Esperanto Association]]:
:Numbers of [[textbook]]s sold and membership of local societies put the number of people with some knowledge of the language in the hundreds of thousands and possibly millions. [http://www.uea.org/info/angle/an_ghisdatigo.html]

=== Culture ===
:''For a more detailed treatment of these topics, see the subarticles: [[Esperanto culture]], [[Esperanto literature]], and [[Esperanto music]].''

Esperanto is often used to access an international culture, including a large corpus of original as well as translated [[Esperanto literature|literature]]. There are over a hundred regularly published [[Esperanto magazine|magazines in Esperanto]]. Many speakers use the language for free travel throughout the world using the [[Pasporta Servo]], or for international [[pen pal]]s. Penpals are even possible for [[Primary education|elementary school]] students, something that is far more difficult when using an ethnic language like English. To some extent there are also shared [[tradition]]s in the Esperanto community, like [[Zamenhof Day]]. 

It is frequently criticised that &quot;Esperanto has no culture&quot;. However, Esperanto is intentionally culturally neutral: It was intended to be a facilitator ''between'' cultures, not the carrier of any one culture. (See ''[[Esperanto as an international language]]''.)

Two [[film]]s were produced with [[dialogue]] entirely in Esperanto. The films were ''[[Angoroj]]'' in 1964 and ''[[Incubus (film)|Incubus]]'' starring [[William Shatner]] in 1965.

The [[anime]] [[RahXephon]] makes use of Esperanto for the [[acronym]] of TERRA, which stands for &quot;Tereno Empireo Rapidmova Reakcii Armeo.&quot; This can be translated as &quot;[[Earth]] Empire Rapid Response [[Army]],&quot; though pedants might note that a better Esperanto rendition of this name would be &quot;Rapid-Reaga Armeo de la Tera Imperio&quot;.

[[United States|American]] [[composer]] [[Lou Harrison]], who incorporated styles and [[Musical instrument|instruments]] from many world cultures in his [[music]], used Esperanto titles and/or texts in several of his works.

=== Goals of the Esperanto movement ===
Zamenhof's intention was to create an easy-to-learn language to foster international understanding. It was to serve as an international auxiliary language, that is, as a universal second language, not to replace ethnic languages.  This goal was widely shared among Esperanto speakers in the early decades of the movement.  Later, Esperanto speakers began to see the language and the culture that had grown up around it as ends in themselves, even if Esperanto is never adopted by the United Nations or other international organizations. 

Those Esperanto speakers who want to see Esperanto adopted officially or on a large scale worldwide are commonly called ''finvenkistoj'', from ''fina venko'', meaning &quot;final victory&quot;.  Those who focus on the intrinsic value of the language are commonly called ''raŭmistoj'', from [[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]], [[Finland]], where a declaration on the near-term unlikelihood of the &quot;fina venko&quot; and the value of Esperanto culture was made at the International Youth Congress in [[1980]]. These categories are, however, not mutually exclusive.

The [http://www.esperanto.se/dok/praguemanifesto.html Prague Manifesto] (1996) presents the views of the mainstream of the esperanto movement and of its main organisation, the World Esperanto Association ([[World Esperanto Association|UEA]]).

== Esperanto and education ==
Relatively few [[school]]s teach Esperanto officially outside of China, [[Hungary]], and [[Bulgaria]]; the majority of Esperanto speakers continue to learn the language through self-directed study or correspondence courses.  Several Esperanto paper correspondence courses were early on adapted to [[e-mail]] and taught by corps of volunteer instructors.  In more recent years, teaching websites like ''[[lernu!]]'' have become popular. Various educators have estimated that Esperanto can be learned in anywhere from one quarter to one twentieth the amount of time required for other languages.{{fact}}

[[Claude Piron]], a psychologist formerly at the [[University of Geneva]] and Chinese-English-Russian-Spanish translator for the United Nations, argued that it is easier to think clearly in Esperanto than in many ethnic languages (see [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]] for an explanation on this theory). &quot;Esperanto relies entirely on innate reflexes [and] differs from all other languages in that you can always trust your natural tendency to generalize patterns. [...] The same [[neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] law [— called by] [[Jean Piaget]] ''generalizing assimilation'' — applies to word formation as well as to grammar.&quot; ([[#References|published lecture notes]]) 

Several [[research]] [[experiment|studies]] demonstrate that, at least for native Indo-European-language speakers, studying Esperanto before another [[foreign language]] speeds and improves [[learning]] the other language. This is presumably because learning subsequent foreign languages is easier than learning one's first, while the use of a grammatically simple and culturally flexible auxiliary language like Esperanto lessens the first-language learning hurdle. In one study ([[#References|Williams 1965]]), a group of European [[high school]] students studied Esperanto for one [[year]], then French for three years, and ended up with a significantly better command of French than a control group, who studied French for all four years. Similar results were found when the second language was [[Japanese language|Japanese]], or when the course of study was reduced to two years, of which six [[month]]s was spent learning Esperanto. ''See [[Propaedeutic value of Esperanto]] for other relevant studies.''

== Criticism and Modifications of Esperanto ==
:''For a more detailed treatment of these topics, see the subarticles: [[Esperanto as an international language]] and [[Esperantido]] (Esperanto-inspired projects)''.

Common criticisms of the language are that its vocabulary and grammar are too Western European; that its vocabulary, accented letters, and grammar are not Western European enough (a critique addressed by [[Ido]] and [[Interlingua]]); that it is [[sexism|sexist]], artificial, or has failed to live up to expectations.

Though Esperanto itself has changed relatively little since the publication of the ''[[Fundamento de Esperanto]]'' (&quot;Foundation of Esperanto&quot;), a number of reform projects have been proposed over the years, starting with [[Reformed Esperanto|Zamenhof's proposals in 1894]] and  [[Ido]] in 1907. Several later constructed languages, such as [[Novial]] and [[Fasile]], were based on Esperanto.

'''English''' is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] which is the dominant language in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations including [[Australia]] and [[Canada]], and other former [[British overseas territories|British colonies]]. It is also a dominant or official language in many countries formerly [[British Empire|under British rule]].  

English is now the fourth (or possibly third depending on the source) most widely spoken [[first language|native language]] worldwide (after [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Hindi]] and debatably [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), with some [[List of languages by number of native speakers|380 million speakers]]. English is also the dominant member of the [[Germanic languages]]. It has ''[[lingua franca]]'' status in many parts of the world, due to the military, economic, scientific, political and cultural influence of the [[British Empire]] in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries and that of the [[United States]] from the early 20th century to the present. 

Through the global influence of native English speakers in [[film|cinema]], [[airline]]s, [[broadcasting]], [[science]], and the [[Internet]] in recent decades, English is now the most widely learned [[second language]] in the world, although other languages such as [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish]] also retain much importance worldwide.

Many students worldwide are required to learn at least some English, and a working knowledge of English is required in many fields and occupations.

==History==
{{main|History of the English language}}
English is an [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian language]] brought to [[Britain]] by [[Germanic tribes|Germanic settlers]] from various parts of northwest Germany. The original [[Old English language]] was subsequently influenced by two successive waves of invasion. The first was by speakers of languages in the Scandinavian branch of the Germanic family, who colonised parts of Britain in the 8th and 9th centuries. The second wave was of the [[Normans]] in the 11th century, who spoke [[Norman language|Norman]] (an [[Langues d'oïl|oïl language]] closely related to [[French language|French]]).

According to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', around the year [[449]], [[Vortigern]], King of the [[British Isles]], invited the Angles to help him against the [[Picts]]. In return, the Angles were granted lands in the south-east. Further aid was sought, and in response came Saxons, Angles, and Jutes. The ''Chronicle'' talks of a subsequent influx of settlers who eventually established [[heptarchy|seven kingdoms]]. Modern scholarship considers most of this story to be legendary and politically motivated.

These Germanic invaders dominated the original [[Celtic languages|Celtic-speaking]] inhabitants, whose languages survived largely in [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], and [[Ireland]]. The dialects spoken by the invaders formed what would be called [[Old English language|Old English]], which resembled some coastal dialects in what are now north-west Germany and the Netherlands. Later, it was strongly influenced by the [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] language [[Old Norse language|Norse]], spoken by the [[Viking]]s who settled mainly in the north-east (see [[Jórvík]]).

For the 300 years following the [[Norman Conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] in [[1066]], the Norman kings and the high nobility spoke only [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. A large number of Norman words were assimilated into Old English. The Norman influence reinforced the continual evolution of the language over the following centuries, resulting in what is now referred to as [[Middle English]]. 

During the [[15th century]], Middle English was transformed by the [[Great Vowel Shift]], the spread of a standardised London-based dialect in government and administration, and the standardising effect of printing. [[Modern English]] can be traced back to around the time of [[William Shakespeare]].

==Classification and related languages==
The English language belongs to the western subbranch of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic branch]] of the [[Indo-European]] family of languages. Apart from English-lexified [[creole language]]s such as [[Tok Pisin]] and [[Bislama]], the nearest living relative of English is [[Scots language|Scots (Lallans)]], spoken mostly in Scotland and parts of Northern Ireland. Like English, Scots is a direct descendant of Old English, also known as Anglo-Saxon.

After Scots, the next closest relative is [[Frisian language|Frisian]]—spoken in Germany and the Netherlands. Other less closely related living languages include [[German language|German]], [[Low German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[North Germanic language|Scandinavian languages]] and [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]. Many [[French language|French]] words are also intelligible to an English speaker (pronunciations are not always identical, of course) because English absorbed a tremendous amount of vocabulary from French, via the [[Norman language]] after the [[Norman Conquest of England|Norman conquest]] and directly from French in further centuries; as a result, a substantial share of English vocabulary is quite close to the French, with some minor spelling differences (word endings, use of old French spellings etc.), as well as occasional differences in meaning.

==Geographic distribution==
[[Image:English dialects1997.png|thumb|right|250px|Distribution of native English speakers by country (Crystal 1997)]]
English is the second or third most widely spoken language in the world today. A total of 600&amp;ndash;700 million people use the various dialects of English regularly. About 377 million people use one of the versions of English as their mother tongue, and an equal number of people use them as their second or foreign language. English is used widely in either the public or private sphere in more than 100 countries all over the world. In addition, the language has occupied a primary place in international academic and business communities. The current status of the English language at the start of the new millennium compares with that of [[Latin]] in the past. English is also the most widely used language for young [[Backpacking (travel)|backpackers]] who travel across continents, regardless of whether it is their mother tongue or a secondary language.

English is the primary language in [[Anguilla]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Australia]] ([[Australian English]]), the [[Bahamas]], [[Barbados]] ([[Caribbean English]]), [[Bermuda]], [[Belize]], the [[British Virgin Islands]], [[Canada]] ([[Canadian English]]), the [[Cayman Islands]], [[Dominica]], the [[Falkland Islands]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Grenada]], [[Guernsey]], [[Guyana]], [[Isle of Man]], [[Jamaica]] ([[Jamaican English]]), [[Jersey]], [[Montserrat]], [[New Zealand]] ([[New Zealand English]]), [[Ireland]] ([[Hiberno-English]]), [[Saint Helena]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], the [[United Kingdom]] (various forms of [[British English]]), the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]] and the [[United States]] ([[American English]])

English is also an important [[minority language]] of [[South Africa]] ([[South African English]]), and in several other former [[colony|colonies]] and current [[dependent territory|dependent territories]] of the United Kingdom and the United States, for example [[Guam]] and [[Mauritius]].

In [[Hong Kong]], English is an [[official language]] and is widely used in business activities. It is taught from [[infant school]], and is the medium of instruction for a few [[primary education | primary schools]], many [[secondary education | secondary schools]] and all [[university|universities]]. Substantial numbers of students acquire [[native-speaker]] level. It is so widely used that it is inadequate to say that it is merely a second or [[foreign language]], though there are still many people in Hong Kong with poor or no command of English.

The majority of English native speakers (67 to 70 per cent) live in the United States. Although the [[United States federal government|U.S. federal government]] has no official languages, it has been given official status by 27 of the 50 state governments, most of which have declared English their sole official language. [[Hawaii]], [[Louisiana]], and [[New Mexico]] have also designated [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], [[French language|French]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], respectively, as official languages in conjunction with English.

In many other countries, where English is not a major first language, it is an official language; these countries include [[Cameroon]], [[Fiji]], the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], [[Ghana]], [[The Gambia|Gambia]], [[India]], [[Kiribati]], [[Lesotho]], [[Liberia]], [[Kenya]], [[Namibia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Malaysia]], [[Malta]], the [[Marshall Islands]], [[Pakistan]], [[Papua New Guinea]], the [[Philippines]], [[Rwanda]], the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Samoa]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Singapore]], [[Swaziland]], [[Tanzania]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]].

English is the most widely learned and used foreign language in the world, and as such, some linguists believe that it is no longer the exclusive cultural emblem of 'native English speakers', but rather a language that is absorbing aspects of cultures world-wide as it grows in use. Others believe that there are limits to how far English can go in suiting everyone for communication purposes. Many people feel that the use of English through media such as the Internet and its constant, informal use by others has led to a diminution in the importance of using the language correctly, thus resulting in a 'dumbing down' of the English language. English is the language most often studied as a foreign language in [[Europe]] (32.6 per cent), followed by French, German, and Spanish. It is also the most studied in [[Japan]], [[South Korea]] and in the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]), where it is compulsory for most [[secondary school]] students. See [[English as an additional language]].

===English as a global language===
''See also: [[English on the Internet]]''

Because English is so widely spoken, it has been referred to as a &quot;[[global language]]&quot;. While English is not an official language in many countries, it is the language most often taught as a [[second language]] around the world. It is also, by international treaty, the official language for aircraft/airport communication. Its widespread acceptance as a first or second language is the main indication of its worldwide status.

There are numerous arguments for and against English as a global language. On one hand, having a global language aids in communication and in pooling information (for example, in the scientific community). On the other hand, it leaves out those who, for one reason or another, are not fluent in the global language. It can also marginalise populations whose first language is not the global language, and lead to a [[cultural hegemony]] of the populations speaking the global language as a first language. Most of these arguments hold for any candidate for a global language, though the last two counter-arguments do not hold for languages not belonging to any ethnic group (like [[Esperanto]]).

A secondary concern with respect to the spread of global languages (including major non-English languages such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) is the resulting disappearance of [[minority language]]s, often along with the cultures and religions that are primarily transmitted in those languages.  English has been implicated in a number of historical and ongoing so-called '[[language death]]s' and '[[linguicide]]s' around the world, many of which have also led to the loss of cultural heritage.  Language death caused by English has been particularly pronounced in areas such as [[Australia]] and [[North America]] where speakers of [[indigenous language]]s have been displaced or absorbed by speakers of English in the process of [[colonisation]].

===Dialects and regional variants===
{{main|List of dialects of the English language}}
{{English dialects}}

The expansiveness of the British and the Americans has spread English throughout the globe. Because of its global spread, it has bred a variety of [[List of dialects of the English language|English dialects]] and English-based [[creole language]]s and [[pidgin]]s.

The major varieties of English in most cases contain several subvarieties, such as [[Cockney]] slang within [[British English]], [[Newfoundland English]] within [[Canadian English]], and [[African American Vernacular English]] (&quot;[[Ebonics]]&quot;) within [[American English]]. English is considered a [[pluricentric language]], with no variety being clearly considered the only standard.

Some consider [[Scots language|Scots]] as an English dialect. Pronunciation, grammar and lexis differ, sometimes substantially.

Because of English's wide use as a second language, English speakers can have many different [[accent (language)|accent]]s, which may identify the speaker's native dialect or language. For more distinctive characteristics of regional accents, see [[Regional accents of English speakers]]. For more distinctive characteristics of regional dialects, see [[List of dialects of the English language]].

Just as English itself has borrowed words from many different languages over its history, English [[loanword]]s now appear in a great many languages around the world, indicative of the technological and cultural influence wielded by English speakers.  Several pidgins and creole languages have formed on an English base - [[Tok Pisin]] was originally one such example.  There are a number of words in English coined to describe forms of particular non-English languages that contain a very high proportion of English words - [[Franglais]], for example, is used to describe [[French language|French]] with a very high English content.

===Constructed variants of English===
*[[Basic English]] is simplified for easy international use. It is used by some aircraft manufacturers and other international businesses to write manuals and communicate. Some English schools in the Far East teach it as an initial practical subset of English.
*[[Special English]] is a simplified version of English used by the [[Voice of America]]. It uses a vocabulary of 1500 words.
*[[English reform]] is an attempt to improve collectively upon the English language.
*[[Seaspeak]] and the related [[Airspeak]] and [[Policespeak]], all based on restricted vocabularies, were designed by Edward Johnson in the [[1980s]] to aid international co-operation and communication in specific areas.  There is also a [[tunnelspeak]] for use in the [[Channel Tunnel]].
*[[European English]] is a new variant of the English language created to become the common language in Europe, spoken in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.
*[[Manually Coded English]] — a variety of systems have been developed to represent the English language with hand signals, designed primarily for use in deaf education.

'''Notes:'''

It is the vowels that differ most from region to region.

Where symbols appear in pairs, the first corresponds to the sounds used in North American English, the second corresponds to English spoken elsewhere.
#North American English lacks this sound; words with this sound are pronounced with {{IPA|/ɑ/}} or {{IPA|/ɔ/}}. According to The Canadian Oxford Dictionary (1998), this sound is present in Standard Canadian English.
#Many dialects of North American English do not have this vowel. See [[Phonological history of the low back vowels#Cot-caught merger|''Cot-caught merger'']].
#The North American variation of this sound is a [[r-colored vowel|rhotic vowel]].
#Many speakers of North American English do not distinguish between these two unstressed vowels. For them, ''roses'' and ''Rosa's'' are pronounced the same, and the symbol usually used is [[schwa]] {{IPA|/ə/}}.
#This sound is often transcribed with {{IPA|/i/}} or with {{IPA|/ɪ/}}.
#The letter ''U'' can represent either /u/ or the [[iotation|iotated]] vowel /ju/.

#The [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[ŋ]}} is a non-phonemic allophone of /n/ in some northerly British accents, appearing only before /g/. In all other dialects it is a separate phoneme, although it only occurs in [[syllable coda]]s.
#The [[alveolar flap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}} is an allophone of /t/ and /d/ in unstressed syllables in [[North American English]] and increasingly in [[Australian English]]. This is the sound of &quot;tt&quot; or &quot;dd&quot; in the words ''latter'' and ''ladder'', which are homophones in North American English. This is the same sound represented by single &quot;r&quot; in some varieties of [[Spanish language|Spanish]].
#In some dialects, such as [[Cockney]], the interdentals /θ/ and /ð/ are usually merged with /f/ and /v/, and in others, like [[African American Vernacular English]], /ð/ is merged with /d/. In some Irish varieties, /θ/ and /ð/ become the corresponding dental plosives, which then contrast with the usual alveolar plosives.
#The sounds {{IPA|/ʃ/, /ʒ/, and /ɹ/}} are labialised in some dialects. Labialisation is never contrastive in initial position and therefore is sometimes not transcribed.
#The [[voiceless velar fricative]] /x/ is used only by Scottish or Welsh speakers of English for Scots/Gaelic words such as ''loch'' {{IPA|/lɒx/}} or by some speakers for loanwords from German and Hebrew like ''Bach'' {{IPA|/bax/}} or ''Chanukah'' /xanuka/, or in some dialects such as Scouse ([[Liverpool]]) where the [[affricate]] [kx] is used instead of /k/ in words such as ''docker'' {{IPA|/dɒkxə/}}. Most native speakers have a great deal of trouble pronouncing it correctly when learning a foreign language. Most speakers use the sounds [k] and [h] instead.
#Voiceless w {{IPA|[ʍ]}} is found in Scottish and Irish English, as well as in some varieties of American, New Zealand, and English English. In all other dialects it is merged with /w/.

====Voicing and aspiration====
[[Voiced consonant|Voicing]] and [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] of [[stop consonant]]s in English depend on dialect and context, but a few general rules can be given:

* [[Voiceless consonant|Voiceless]] [[plosive]]s and [[affricate]]s (/{{IPA|p}}/, /{{IPA|t}}/, /{{IPA|k}}/, and /{{IPA|tʃ}}/) are aspirated when they are word-initial or begin a stressed syllable and are not part of a consonant cluster&amp;mdash;compare ''pin'' [{{IPA|pʰɪn}}] and ''spin'' [{{IPA|spɪn}}].
** In some dialects, aspiration extends to unstressed syllables as well.
** In other dialects, such as [[Indian English]], most or all voiceless stops may remain unaspirated.
* Word-initial voiced plosives may be devoiced in some dialects.
* Word-terminal voiceless plosives may be unreleased or accompanied by a glottal stop in some dialects (e.g. many varieties of [[American English]])&amp;mdash;examples: ''tap'' [{{IPA|tʰæp̚}}], ''sack'' [{{IPA|sæk̚}}].
* Word-terminal voiced plosives may be devoiced in some dialects (e.g. some varieties of [[American English]])&amp;mdash;examples: ''sad'' [{{IPA|sæd̥}}], ''bag'' [{{IPA|bæɡ̊}}]. In other dialects they are fully voiced in final position, but only partially voiced in initial position.

==Supra-segmental Features==


===Tone groups===
English is an [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation language]]. This means that the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of the [[human voice|voice]] is used [[Syntax|syntactically]], for example, to convey [[surprise]] and [[irony]], or to change a [[statement]] into a [[question]].

In English, intonation patterns are on groups of words, which are called [[tone group]]s, tone units, intonation groups or sense groups. Tone groups are said on a single breath and, as a consequence, are of limited length, more often being on average five words long or lasting roughly two seconds. The structure of tone groups can have a crucial impact on the meaning of what is said. For example:
:-{{IPA|/duː juː niːd ˈɛnɪˌθɪŋ/ ''Do you need anything?''}}
:-{{IPA|&lt;nowiki&gt;/aɪ dəʊnt | nəʊ/ ''I don't, no''&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
:-{{IPA|/aɪ dəʊnt nəʊ/ ''I don't know''}}

===Characteristics of intonation (stress accent)===
English is a ''stress times language'', i.e., certain syllables in each multi-syllablic word get a relative prominence/loudness during pronunciation while the others do not. The former kind of syllables are said to be ''accentuated/stressed'' and the latter are ''unaccentuated/unstressed''. All good dictionaries of English mark the accentuated syllable(s) by either placing an apostrophe-like ( ˈ ) sign either before (as in [[IPA]], [[Oxford]] [[dictionary]]) or after (as in [[Webster's dictionary]]) the syllable where the stress accent falls. In general, for a two-syllable word in English, it can be broadly said that if it is a noun or an adjective, the first syllable is accentuated; but if it is a verb, the second syllable is accentuated.

Hence in a sentence, each tone group can be subdivided into syllables, which can either be stressed (strong) or unstressed (weak). The stressed syllable is called the nuclear syllable. For example:
:''That | was | the | &lt;u&gt;'''best'''&lt;/u&gt; | thing | you | could | have | '''done'''!''
Here, all syllables are unstressed, except the syllables/words &quot;best&quot; and &quot;done&quot;, which are stressed. &quot;Best&quot; is stressed harder and, therefore, is the nuclear syllable.

The nuclear syllable carries the main point the speaker wishes to make. For example:
:'''''John''' had stolen that money''. (... not I)
:''John '''had''' stolen that money''. (... you said he hadn't)
:''John had '''stolen''' that money''. (... he wasn't given it)
:''John had stolen '''that''' money''. (... not this money)
:''John had stolen that '''money'''''. (... not something else)

The nuclear syllable is spoken louder than all the others and has a characteristic '''change of pitch'''. The changes of pitch most commonly encountered in English are the '''rising pitch''' and the '''falling pitch''', although the '''fall-rising pitch''' and/or the '''rise-falling pitch''' are sometimes used. For example:
:''When do you want to be paid?''
:''Nów?'' (rising pitch. In this case, it denotes a question: can I be paid now?)
:''Nòw'' (falling pitch. In this case, it denotes a statement: I choose to be paid now)

==Grammar==
{{main|English grammar}}

English grammar displays minimal [[inflected language|inflection]] compared with some other [[Indo-European]] languages.  For example, Modern English, unlike Modern [[German language|German]] or [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and the [[Romance languages]], lacks [[grammatical gender]] and [[agreement (grammar)|adjectival agreement]].  [[case (grammar)|Case]] marking has almost disappeared from the language and mainly survives in [[pronoun]]s.  The patterning of [[strong verbs|strong]] (eg. ''speak/spoke/spoken'') versus [[weak verbs|weak]] verbs inherited from Germanic has declined in importance and the remnants of inflection (such as [[plural]] marking) have become more regular.

At the same time as inflection has declined in importance in English, the language has developed a greater reliance on features such as [[modal verb]]s and [[word order]] to convey grammatical information. [[Auxiliary verb]]s are used to mark constructions such as questions, negatives, the [[passive voice]] and progressive [[tense]]s.

==Vocabulary==
Almost without exception, Germanic words (which include all the basics such as [[pronoun]]s and [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]]s) are shorter and more informal. Latinate words are regarded as more elegant or educated. However, the excessive use of Latinate words is often mistaken for either pretentiousness (as in the stereotypical policeman's talk of &quot;apprehending the suspect&quot;) or [[obfuscation]] (as in a military document which says &quot;neutralise&quot; when it means &quot;kill&quot;). [[George Orwell]]'s [[essay]] &quot;[[Politics and the English Language]]&quot; gives a thorough treatment of this feature of English.

An English speaker is often able to choose between Germanic and Latinate [[synonym]]s: &quot;come&quot; or &quot;arrive&quot;; &quot;sight&quot; or &quot;vision&quot;; &quot;freedom&quot; or &quot;liberty&quot;&amp;mdash;and sometimes also between a word inherited through French and a borrowing direct from Latin of the same root word: &quot;oversee&quot;, &quot;survey&quot; or &quot;supervise&quot;. The richness of the language is that such synonyms have slightly different meanings, enabling the language to be used in a very flexible way to express fine variations or shades of thought. See: [[List of Germanic and Latinate equivalents]].

An exception to this and a peculiarity arguably unique of English is that the nouns for meats are commonly different from and unrelated to those for the animals from which they are produced, the animal commonly having a Germanic name and the meat having a French derived noun. Examples include deer and venison, ox or cow and beef, or swine and pork. This is assumed to be a result of the aftermath of the Norman invasion where a French speaking elite were the consumers of the meat, produced by English speaking lower classes.

In everyday speech, the majority of words will normally be Germanic. If a speaker wishes to make a forceful point in an argument in a very blunt way, Germanic words will usually be chosen. A majority of Latinate words (or at least a majority of content words) will normally be used in more formal speech and writing, such as a [[court]]room or an [[encyclopedia]] article.

English is noted for the vast size of its active vocabulary and its fluidity. English easily accepts technical terms into common usage and imports new words which often come into common usage. In addition, [[slang]] provides new meanings for old words. In fact this fluidity is so pronounced that a distinction often needs to be made between formal forms of English and contemporary usage. See also [[sociolinguistics]].

===Number of words in English===
As the ''General Explanations'' at the beginning of the Oxford English Dictionary state:

:The Vocabulary of a widely diffused and highly cultivated living language is not a fixed quantity circumscribed by definite limits ... there is absolutely no defining line in any direction: the circle of the English language has a well-defined centre but no discernible circumference.

The vocabulary of English is undoubtedly vast, but assigning a specific number to its size is more a matter of definition than of calculation. Unlike other languages, there is no [[Language Academy|Academy]] to define officially accepted words. [[Neologism]]s are coined regularly in medicine, science and technology&amp;mdash;some enter wide usage; others remain restricted to small circles. Foreign words used in immigrant communities often make their way into wider English usage. Archaic, dialectal, and regional words might be considered as &quot;English&quot; or not.

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (2nd edition) includes over 500,000 [[headword]]s, following a rather inclusive policy:

:It embraces not only the standard language of literature and conversation, whether current at the moment, or obsolete, or archaic, but also the main technical vocabulary, and a large measure of dialectal usage and slang (Supplement to the OED, 1933).

The difficulty of defining the number of words is compounded by the emergence of new versions of English, such as [[Asian English]].

One of the consequences of the French influence is that the vocabulary of English is, to a certain extent, divided between those words which are [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] (mostly [[Old English language|Old English]]) and those which are &quot;Latinate&quot; ([[Latin]]-derived, either directly or from Norman French or other Romance languages).

A computerised survey of about 80,000 words in the old ''Shorter Oxford Dictionary'' (3rd ed.) was published in ''Ordered Profusion'' by Thomas Finkenstaedt and Dieter Wolff (1973) which estimated the origin of English words as follows:
* [[French language|French]], including Old French and early Anglo-French: [[List of English words of French origin|28.3%]]
* [[Latin]], including modern scientific and technical Latin: 28.24%
* [[Old English|Old]] and [[Middle English]], [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]], and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: 25%
* [[Greek Language|Greek]]: 5.32%
* No etymology given: 4.03%
* Derived from proper names: 3.28%
* All other languages contributed less than 1% 

[[James D. Nicoll]] made the oft-quoted observation: &quot;The problem with defending the purity of the English language is that English is about as pure as a cribhouse whore. We don't just borrow words; on occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and riffle their pockets for new vocabulary.&quot;

==Writing system==
{{main|English alphabet}}

English is written using the [[Latin alphabet]]. The spelling system or [[orthography]] of English is historical, not [[phonology|phonological]]. The spelling of words often diverges considerably from how they are spoken, and English spelling is often considered to be one of the most difficult to learn of any language that uses an alphabet. See [[English spelling|English orthography]].

===Written accents===
&lt;!-- If this grows, it may be better off on its own page [[List of accented English words]] --&gt;

English includes some words which can be written with accent marks. These words have mostly been imported from other languages, usually French. But it is increasingly rare for writers of English to actually use the accent marks for common words, even in very formal writing. The strongest tendency to retain the accent is in words that are atypical of English morphology and therefore still perceived as slightly foreign. For example, ''café'' has a pronounced final ''e'', which would be silent by the normal English pronunciation rules.

Some examples: ångström, appliqué, attaché, blasé, bric-à-brac, café, cliché, crème, crêpe, façade, fiancé(e), flambé, naïve, né(e), papier-mâché, passé, piñata, protégé, raison d'être, résumé, risqué, über-, vis-à-vis, voilà. For a more complete list, see [[List of English words with diacritics]].

Some words such as ''rôle'' and ''hôtel'' were first seen with accents when they were borrowed into English, but now the accent is almost never used. The words were considered very French borrowings when first used in English, even accused by some of being foreign phrases used where English alternatives would suffice, but today their French origin is largely forgotten. The accent on &quot;élite&quot; has disappeared from most publications today, but [[Time Magazine|''Time'']] magazine still uses it. For some words such as &quot;soupçon&quot; however, the only spelling found in English dictionaries (the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] and others) uses the diacritic.

[[Italic type|Italic]]s, with appropriate accents, are generally applied to foreign terms that are uncommonly used in or have not been assimilated into English: for example, ''[[adiós]]'', ''[[coup d'état]]'', ''[[crème brûlée]]'', ''[[pièce de résistance]]'', ''[[raison d'être]]'', ''[[über]]'' (''[[Übermensch|übermensch]]''), ''[[vis-à-vis]]''.

It is also possible to use a [[diaeresis]] to indicate a syllable break, but again this is often left out or a hyphen used instead. Examples: coöperate (or co-operate), daïs, naïve, noël, reëlect (or re-elect). One publication that still uses a diaeresis to indicate a syllable break is the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' magazine.

Written accents are also used occasionally in [[poetry]] and scripts for [[drama]]tic performances to indicate that a certain normally unstressed syllable in a word should be stressed for dramatic effect, or to keep with the meter of the poetry. This use is frequently seen in archaic and pseudoarchaic writings with the &quot;-ed&quot; suffix, to indicate that the &quot;e&quot; should be fully pronounced, as with ''cursèd''.

In certain older texts (typically in [[Commonwealth English]]), the use of [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]] is common in words such as archæology, œsophagus, and encyclopædia. Such words have [[Latin]] or [[Greek language|Greek]] origin. Nowadays, the ligatures have been generally replaced in Commonwealth English by the separated letters &quot;ae&quot; and &quot;oe&quot; (&quot;archaeology&quot;, &quot;oesophagus&quot;) and in [[American English]] by &quot;e&quot; (&quot;esophagus&quot;). However, the spellings &quot;oeconomy&quot; and &quot;oecology&quot; are now generally replaced by &quot;economy&quot; and &quot;ecology&quot; in Commonwealth English, making these spellings the same as in American English.

The two major English language keyboard layouts, namely United States and United Kingdom, normally do not fully permit these accents to be typed into the computer. However, the United States-International and United Kingdom-International keyboard layouts permit such accents to be keyed in. See [[British and American keyboards]], [[keyboard layouts]]

'''Engineering''' is the application of [[science|scientific]] and [[technology|technical]] knowledge to solve human problems. Engineers use imagination, judgment, reasoning and experience to apply [[science]], technology, [[mathematics]], and practical [[experience]]. The result is the [[design]], [[production|production]], and operation of useful [[object (philosophy)|object]]s or [[process]]es.  

==Methodology==
The crucial and unique task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and integrate the [[constraint]]s on a design in order to produce a successful result. It is usually not enough to build a technically successful product; it must also meet further requirements. Constraints may include available resources, physical or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost, [[producibility]], and [[serviceability]]. By understanding the constraints, engineers derive [[specifications]] for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated.

===Problem solving===
Engineers use their knowledge of [[science]], [[mathematics]], and [[empirical knowledge|appropriate experience]] to find suitable solutions to a [[problem]].  Creating an appropriate [[mathematical model]] of a problem allows them to analyze it (sometimes definitively), and to test potential solutions. Usually multiple reasonable solutions exist, so engineers must evaluate the different [[design choice]]s on their merits and choose the solution that best meets their requirements.  [[Genrich Altshuller]], after gathering statistics on a large number of [[patent]]s, suggested that [[compromise]]s are at the heart of &quot;[[level of invention|low-level]]&quot; engineering designs, while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core [[contradiction]] causing the [[problem]].

Engineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production. They use, among other things: [[prototype]]s, [[scale model]]s, [[simulation]]s, [[destructive testing|destructive test]]s, [[nondestructive testing|nondestructive tests]], and [[stress test]]s. Testing ensures that products will perform as expected. Engineers as professionals take seriously their responsibility to produce designs that will perform as expected and will not cause unintended harm to the public at large. Engineers typically include a [[factor of safety]] in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure. However, the larger the safety factor, the less efficient the design may be.

===Computer use===
As with all modern scientific and technological endeavours, computers and software play an increasingly important role. Numerical methods and simulations can help predict design performance more accurately than previous approximations.

Using [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software, engineers are able to more easily create drawings and models of their designs. Computer models of designs can be checked for flaws without having to make expensive and time-consuming prototypes. The computer can automatically translate some models to instructions suitable for automatic machinery (e.g., [[CNC]]) to fabricate (part of) a design. The computer also allows increased reuse of previously developed designs, by presenting an engineer with a library of predefined parts ready to be used in designs.

Of late, the use of [[FEM|finite element method analysis]] (FEM analysis or FEA) software to study stress, temperature, flow as well as electromagnetic fields has gained importance. In addition, a variety of software is available to analyse dynamic systems.

Electronics engineers make use of a variety of circuit [[schematic]]s software to aid in the creation of  circuit designs that perform an electronic task when used for a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) or a computer chip.

The application of computers in the area of engineering of goods is known as [[Product Lifecycle Management]] (PLM).

==Etymology==
It is a myth that ''engineer'' originated to describe those who built [[engine]]s. In fact, the words ''engine'' and ''engineer'' (as well as ''ingenious'') developed in parallel from the Latin root ''ingeniosus'', meaning &quot;skilled&quot;. An engineer is thus a clever, practical, problem solver. The spelling of ''engineer'' was later influenced by back-formation from ''engine''. The term later evolved to include all fields where the skills of application of the [[scientific method]] are used. In some other languages, such as Arabic, the word for &quot;engineering&quot; also means &quot;geometry&quot;.

The fields that became what we now call engineering were known as the [[mechanic arts]] in the 19th century.

==Engineering in a Social Context==
Engineering is a subject that ranges from large collaborations to small individual projects.  Almost all engineering projects are beholden to some sort of financing agency: a company, a set of investors, or a government. The result of this is that large-scale engineering projects often lose much of their original purpose to some form of bureaucracy.  The few types of engineering that are minimally constrained by such issues are [[pro bono]] engineering and [[open design]] engineering.

==Cultural presence==
Historically, engineering has been seen as a somewhat dry, uninteresting field in [[popular culture]], and has also been thought to be the domain of [[nerd]]s (with little of the romance that attaches to [[hacker]] culture). For example, the cartoon character [[Dilbert]] is an engineer. 

This has not always been so - most British school children in the 1950s were brought up with stirring tales of 'the Victorian Engineers', chief amongst whom where the Brunels, the Stephensons, Telford and their contemporaries.

In [[science fiction]] engineers are often portrayed as highly knowledgeable and respectable individuals who understand the overwhelming future technologies often portrayed in the genre. The ''[[Star Trek]]'' characters [[Montgomery Scott]] and [[Geordi La Forge]] are famous examples.

Engineers are often respected and ridiculed for their intense beliefs and interests. Perhaps because of their deep understanding of the interconnectedness of many things, engineers such as Governor [[John H. Sununu]], 
New York City Mayor [[Michael_Bloomberg#Personal_life_and_business_career | Michael Bloomberg]] and 
Nuclear Physicist [[Edward_Teller#Early_life_and_education | Edward Teller]], are often driven into politics to &quot;fix things&quot; for the public good.

Occasionally, engineers may be recognized by the &quot;[[Iron Ring]]&quot;--a stainless steel or iron ring worn on the little (fourth) finger of the dominant hand.  This tradition was originally developed in Canada in [[the Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer]] as a symbol of pride and obligation for the engineering profession.  Some years later this practice was adopted in the United States.  Members of the US [[Order of the Engineer]] accept this ring as a pledge to uphold the proud history of engineering.  A [[Professional Engineer]]'s name often has the [[post-nominal letters]] PE or P.Eng.

Engineers still only need a [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's degree]] to obtain a lucrative position that receives respect from the public. This is not the case in many other professions.

==Legislation==
In most modern countries, certain engineering tasks, such as the design of bridges, electric power plants, and chemical plants, must be approved by a [[Professional Engineer]] or a [[Chartered Engineer]].  

Laws protecting public health and safety mandate that a [[professional]] must provide guidance gained through [[education]] and experience. In the United States, each state tests and licenses [[Professional Engineer]]s.

The federal government, however, supervises aviation through the Federal Aviation Regulations administrated by the Dept. of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration. Designated Engineering Representatives approve data for aircraft design and repairs on behalf of the Federal Aviation Administration.

Even with strict testing and licensure, engineering disasters still occur. Therefore, the [[Professional Engineer]] or [[Chartered Engineer]] adheres to a strict code of [[ethics]]. Each engineering discipline and professional society maintains a code of ethics, which the members pledge to uphold.

In Canada the profession in each province is governed by its own engineering association.  For instance, in the Province of British Columbia an engineering graduate with 5 or more years of experience in an engineering-related field will need to be certified by the Association for Professional Engineers and Geoscientists (APEGBC) in order to become a Professional Engineer.

Refer also to the [[Washington accord]] for international accreditation details of professional engineering degrees.

==Comparison to other disciplines==
===Science===
:''You see things; and you say &quot;Why?&quot; But I dream things that never were; and I say &quot;Why not?&quot;'' ''&amp;mdash;[[George Bernard Shaw]]'' 

Engineering is concerned with the design of a solution to a practical problem. A [[scientist]] may ask ''why'' a problem arises, and proceed to research the answer to the question or actually solve the problem in his first try, perhaps creating a [[mathematical model]] of his observations. By contrast, engineers want to know ''how'' to solve a problem, and ''how'' to implement that solution. In other words, scientists attempt to ''explain'' phenomena, whereas engineers use any available knowledge, including that produced by science, to ''construct'' solutions to problems. This is no contradiction. 

There is an overlap between science (fundamental and applied) and engineering. It is not uncommon for scientists to become involved in the practical application of their discoveries; thereby becoming, for the moment, engineers. Scientists may also have to complete engineering tasks, such as designing experimental apparatus or building prototypes. Conversely, in the process of developing technology engineers sometimes find themselves exploring new phenomena, thus becoming, for the moment, scientists.

However, engineering research has a character different from that of scientific research. First, it often deals with areas in which the basic physics and/or chemistry are well understood, but the problems themselves are too complex to solve in an exact manner. The purpose of engineering research is then to find approximations to the problem that can be solved. Examples are the use of numerical approximations to the [[Navier-Stokes equations]] to solve aerodynamic flow over an aircraft, or the use of [[metal fatigue|Miner's rule]] to calculate fatigue damage to an engineering structure. Second, engineering research employs many semi-empirical methods that are foreign to pure scientific research, one example being the [[Method of variation of parameters|method of parameter variation]].

In general, it can be stated that a scientist builds in order to learn, but an engineer learns in order to build.

===Other fields===
There are significant parallels between engineering and [[medicine]]. Both professions are well known for their pragmatism &amp;mdash; the solution to real world problems often requires moving forward before phenomena are completely understood in a more rigorous [[scientific]] sense.

There are also close connections between the workings of engineers and artists; they are direct in some fields, for example, [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]] and [[industrial design]]; and indirect in others. Artistic and engineering creativity may be fundamentally connected.

==Note on spelling==
Owing to [[American and British English spelling differences|differences in American and British English orthographic conventions]], the spellings &quot;encyclopaedia&quot; and &quot;encyclopedia&quot; both see common use in [[Commonwealth English|British and Commonwealth]]- and [[American English|American]]-influenced sources, respectively. (The spelling ''encyclopædia'', with the ''[[æ]]'' [[ligature (typography)|ligature]], is obsolete, although it is preserved in the proper name of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.) The [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''ae'', the normal Latin rendering of the Greek [[diphthong]] ''αι,'' is usually changed to ''e'' [[Medieval Latin]], and remains so in American orthography, for example in other words from the root ''paid-'' such as ''paediatrician'' (American ''pediatrician''). Both the British ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' and the U.S. ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]'' permit both spellings. The citations given in the ''OED'' are roughly evenly divided between the two spellings.

In the [[history of cryptography]], the '''Enigma''' was a portable [[cipher]] [[machine]] used to [[encryption|encrypt]] and decrypt secret messages. More precisely, Enigma was a family of related electro-mechanical [[rotor machine]]s &amp;mdash; there were a variety of different models.

The Enigma was used commercially from the early 1920s on, and was also adopted by the military and governmental services of a number of nations &amp;mdash; most famously by [[Nazi Germany]] before and during [[World War II]].

The German military model, the '''[[Wehrmacht]] Enigma''', is the version most commonly discussed. The machine has gained notoriety because [[Allied]] [[cryptologist]]s were able to [[cryptanalysis|decrypt]] a large number of messages that had been [[encipher]]ed on the machine. The [[Military espionage|intelligence]] gained through this source &amp;mdash; codenamed [[ULTRA]] &amp;mdash; was a significant aid to the Allied war effort. The exact influence of ULTRA is debated, but a typical assessment is that the [[Victory in Europe Day|end of the European war]] was hastened by two years because of the decryption of German ciphers. 

Although the Enigma cipher has cryptographic weaknesses, it was, in practice, only their combination with other significant factors which allowed codebreakers to read messages: mistakes by operators, procedural flaws, and the occasional captured machine or [[codebook]].

This article discusses the Enigma machine itself: its components and its procedures. For the history and techniques of how Enigma was broken, see '''[[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma]]'''. For a discussion of how Enigma-derived intelligence was put to use, see '''[[ULTRA]]'''.

==Description==
[[Image:Enigma wiring kleur.png|thumb|left|250px|Enigma wiring diagram showing the current flow when pressing the 'A' key is encoded to the 'D' lamp, also D yields A, but A never A]]
Like other rotor machines, the Enigma machine is a combination of mechanical and electrical systems. The mechanical mechanism consists of a [[alphanumeric keyboard|keyboard]]; a set of rotating disks called ''rotor''s arranged adjacently along a [[spindle]]; and a stepping mechanism to turn one or more of the rotors with each key press. The exact mechanism varies, but the most common form is for the right-hand rotor to step once with every key stroke, and occasionally the motion of neighbouring rotors is triggered. The continual movement of the rotors results in a different cryptographic transformation after each key press.

The mechanical parts act in such a way as to form a varying [[electrical circuit]] &amp;mdash; the actual encipherment of a letter is performed electrically. When a key is pressed, the circuit is completed; current flows through the various components and ultimately lights one of many [[lamp]]s, indicating the output letter. For example, when encrypting a message starting &lt;tt&gt;ANX...&lt;/tt&gt;, the operator would first press the &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt; key, and the &lt;tt&gt;Z&lt;/tt&gt; lamp might light; &lt;tt&gt;Z&lt;/tt&gt; would be the first letter of the ciphertext. The operator would then proceed to encipher &lt;tt&gt;N&lt;/tt&gt; in the same fashion, and so on.

[[Image:Enigma-action.png|right|thumbnail|200px|The scrambling action of the Enigma rotors shown for two consecutive letters &amp;mdash; current is passed into set of rotors, around the reflector, and back out through the rotors again.

Note: The greyed-out lines represent other possible circuits within each rotor, which are hard-wired to contacts on each rotor.

Letter &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt; encrypts differently with consecutive key presses, first to &lt;tt&gt;G&lt;/tt&gt;, and then to &lt;tt&gt;C&lt;/tt&gt;. This is because the right hand rotor has stepped, sending the signal on a completely different route.]]
To explain the Enigma, we use the wiring diagram on the left. To simplify the example, only four components of each are shown. In reality, there are 26 lamps, keys, plugs and wirings inside the rotors. The current flows from the battery (1) through the depressed bi-directional letter-switch (2) to the plugboard (3). The plugboard allows rewiring the connections between keyboard (2) and fixed entry wheel (4). Next, the current proceeds through the - unused, so closed - plug (3) via the entry wheel (4) through the wirings of the three (Wehrmacht Enigma) or four (Kriegsmarine M4) rotors (5) and enters the reflector (6). The reflector returns the current, via a different path, back through the rotors (5) and entry wheel (4), and proceeds through plug 'S' connected with a cable (8) to plug 'D', and another bi-directional switch (9) to light-up the lamp.&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

The rotors (alternatively ''wheels'' or ''drums'' &amp;mdash; ''Walzen'' in German) form the heart of an Enigma machine. Approximately 10&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter, each rotor is a [[disk (mathematics)|disk]] made of hard [[rubber]] or [[bakelite]] with a series of [[brass]] spring-loaded pins on one face arranged in a circle; on the other side are a corresponding number of circular electrical contacts. The pins and contacts represent the [[alphabet]] &amp;mdash; typically the 26 letters A&amp;ndash;Z (this will be assumed for the rest of the description). When placed side-by-side, the pins of one rotor rest against the contacts of the neighbouring rotor, forming an electrical connection. Inside the body of the rotor, a set of 26 wires connects each pin on one side to a contact on the other in a complex pattern. The wiring differs for every rotor. 

[[Image:enigma-rotors.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Three Enigma rotors and the shaft on which they are placed when in use.]]

By itself, a rotor performs only a very simple type of [[encryption]] &amp;mdash; a simple [[substitution cipher]]. For example, the pin corresponding to the letter &lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt; might be wired to the contact for letter &lt;tt&gt;T&lt;/tt&gt; on the opposite face. The complexity comes from the use of several rotors in series &amp;mdash; usually three or four &amp;mdash; and the regular movement of the rotors; this provides a much stronger type of encryption.

When placed in the machine, a rotor can be set to one of 26 positions. It can be turned by hand using a grooved finger-wheel which protrudes from the internal cover when closed, as shown in [[#Procedures for using the Enigma|Figure 2]]. So that the operator knows the position, each rotor has an ''alphabet tyre'' (or letter ring) attached around the outside of the disk, with 26 letters or numbers; one of these can be seen through a window, indicating the position of the rotor to the operator. In early Enigma models, the alphabet ring is fixed; a complication introduced in later versions is the facility to adjust the alphabet ring relative to the core wiring. The position of the ring is known as the ''Ringstellung'' (&quot;ring settings&quot;). 

The rotors each contain a notch (sometimes multiple notches), used to control the stepping of the rotors. In the military versions, the notches are located on the alphabet ring.

The Army and Air Force Enigmas came equipped with several rotors; when first issued there was a total of three. On [[15 December]] [[1938]], this changed to five, from which three were chosen for insertion in the machine. These were marked with [[Roman numeral]]s to distinguish them: I, II, III, IV and V, all with single notches. The Naval version of the [[Wehrmacht]] Enigma had always been issued with more rotors than the other services: at first, five, then seven and finally eight. The additional rotors were named VI, VII and VIII, all with different wiring, and had two notches cut into them, resulting in a more frequent turnover.

The four-rotor Naval Enigma (M4) accommodated an extra rotor in the same space as the three-rotor version. This was accomplished by replacing the original reflector with a thinner reflector and adding a special fourth rotor. The fourth rotor can be one of two types: ''Beta'' or ''Gamma''.   
This 4th rotor never steps, but can be manually placed in any of the 26 positions.

===Stepping motion===
[[Image:Enigma ratchet.png|right|thumb|220px|Stepping motion of the Enigma. All three ratchet pawls (green) push in unison. In the first rotor (1), the ratchet (red) is always engaged, and steps with each keypress. Here, the second rotor (2) is engaged because the notch in the first rotor is aligned with the pawl; it will step with the next keypress. The third rotor (3) is not engaged, because the notch in the second rotor is not aligned; the pawl will simply slide over the curved ring.]]
To avoid merely implementing a simple substitution cipher, some rotors turn with consecutive presses of a key. This ensures that the cryptographic transformation is different at each position, producing a formidable [[polyalphabetic substitution]] cipher. 

The most common arrangement utilises a [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]] and [[pawl]] mechanism. Each rotor is affixed with a ratchet with 26 teeth; a group of pawls engage the teeth of the ratchet. The pawls are pushed forward in unison with each keypress on the machine. If a pawl engages the teeth of a ratchet, that rotor advances by one step.

In the Wehrmacht Enigma, each rotor is affixed with an adjustable notched ring. The five basic rotors (I-V) have one notch each, while the additional naval rotors VI, VII and VIII have two notches. At a certain point, a rotor's notch will align with the pawl, allowing it to engage the ratchet of the next rotor with the subsequent key press. When a pawl is not aligned with the notch, it will simply slide over the surface of the ring without engaging the ratchet. In a single-notch rotor system, the second rotor is advanced one position every 26 advances of the first rotor. Similarly, the third rotor is advanced one position for every 26 advances of the second rotor. The second rotor also advances at the same time as the third rotor, meaning the second rotor can step twice on subsequent key presses &amp;mdash; &quot;double stepping&quot; &amp;mdash; resulting in a reduced period&lt;ref&gt;David Hamer, &quot;Enigma: Actions Involved in the ‘Double-Stepping’ of the Middle Rotor,&quot; ''Cryptologia'', 21(1), January 1997, pp. 47&amp;ndash;50, [http://www.eclipse.net/~dhamer/downloads/rotorpdf.zip Online version (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

This double stepping causes the rotors to deviate from a normal [[odometer]]. A double step occurs as follows: the first rotor steps, and takes the second rotor one step further. If the second rotor has moved by this step into its own notch-position, the third pawl can drop down. On the next step this pawl pushes the ratchet of the third rotor and advances it, but will also push into the second rotor's notch, advancing the second rotor a second time in a row.

With three wheels and only single notches in the first and second wheels, the machine has a period of 26 × 25 × 26 = 16,900. Historically, messages were limited to a couple of hundred letters, and so there was no risk of repeating any position within a single message.

To make the use of the naval fourth rotors &quot;Beta&quot; and &quot;Gamma&quot; possible, introduced in 1942, the reflector was changed to a thin model and the special thin fourth rotor was placed against it. No changes were made to the mechanism. Since there are only three pawls, the fourth rotor never steps, but can be manually set into one of its 26 positions. 

When pressing a key, the rotors step before the electrical circuit is connected.

[[Image:Enigma-rotor-stack.jpg|left|thumbnail|320px|The Enigma rotor assembly. The three movable rotors are sandwiched between two fixed wheels: the entry wheel on the right and the reflector (here marked &quot;B&quot;) on the left.]]

===Entry wheel===
The entry wheel (''Eintrittswalze'' in German), or entry [[stator]], connects the plugboard, if present, or otherwise the keyboard and lampboard to the rotor assembly. While the exact wiring used is of comparatively little importance to the security, it proved an obstacle in the progress of [[Poland | Polish]] cryptanalyst [[Marian Rejewski]] during his deduction of the rotor wirings. The commercial Enigma connects the keys in the order of their sequence on the keyboard: &lt;tt&gt;Q&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;&lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;W&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;&lt;tt&gt;B&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;&lt;tt&gt;C&lt;/tt&gt; and so on. However, the military Enigma connects them in straight alphabetical order: &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;&lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;B&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;&lt;tt&gt;B&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;C&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;&lt;tt&gt;C&lt;/tt&gt; etc. It took an inspired piece of guesswork for Rejewski to realise the modification, and he was then able to solve the [[equation]]s.

===Reflector===
With the exception of the early models A and B, the last rotor is followed by a ''reflector'' (German: ''Umkehrwalze''), a patented feature distinctive of the Enigma family amongst the various rotor machines designed in the period. The reflector connects outputs of the last rotor up in pairs, redirecting current back through the rotors by a different route. The reflector ensures that Enigma is [[involution|self-reciprocal]]: conveniently, encryption is the same as decryption. However, the reflector also gives Enigma the property that no letter can encrypt to itself. This was a severe conceptual flaw and a cryptological mistake subsequently exploited by codebreakers.

In the commercial Enigma model C, the reflector can be inserted in one of two different positions. In Model D the reflector can be set in 26 possible positions, although it does not move during encipherment. In the Abwehr Enigma, the reflector is stepped during encryption in a similar way to the other wheels.

In the Wehrmacht Enigma, the reflector is fixed and does not rotate, and appeared in four versions. The original version was marked ''A'', and was replaced by ''Umkehrwalze B'' on [[1 November]] [[1937]]. A third version, ''Umkehrwalze C'' appeared in 1941. The fourth version, first observed on [[2 January]] [[1944]] is a rewireable reflector, called ''Umkehrwalze D'', allowing the Enigma operator to alter the connections as part of the key settings.&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

===Plugboard===
[[Image:Enigma-plugboard.jpg|right|thumbnail|280px|The plugboard (''Steckerbrett'') is positioned at the front of the machine, below the keys. When in use, there can be up to 13 connections.

See: [[wikt:England|Wiktionary:England]] for a further list of non-English names for England.

&quot;England&quot; is sometimes mistakenly used to refer to the entire [[United Kingdom]], the island of [[Great Britain]], or the [[British Isles]]. This will offend people from other parts of the UK. Frequently the English use the less-specific &quot;Britain&quot; or &quot;the UK&quot;, even when &quot;England&quot; is technically correct and commonly also use &quot;England&quot; when &quot;Britain&quot; would be correct.

Alternative names include:

*the slang &quot;Blighty&quot;, from the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] &quot;bila yati&quot; meaning &quot;foreign&quot;
* &quot;[[Albion]]&quot;, an ancient name popularised by [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Ptolemy]] in the 1st century. Supposedly referring to the white ([[Latin]] ''alba'') cliffs of [[Dover, England|Dover]], this term has also been interpreted as a relative of [[Alba]], today the [[Scots Gaelic]] name for Scotland. Whatever its origins, &quot;Albion&quot; originally referred to the whole island of [[Great Britain]] and is still sometimes seen that way today &amp;mdash; but is more often used for England.
*More poetically, England has been called &quot;this sceptred isle...this other Eden&quot; and &quot;this green and pleasant land&quot;, quotations respectively from the poetry of [[William Shakespeare]] (in ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'') and [[William Blake]] (''[[And did those feet in ancient time]]'').

The inhabitants of England are the '''English'''. The slang terms sometimes used for them include &quot;Sassenachs&quot; (from the [[Scots Gaelic]]), &quot;Limeys&quot; (in reference to the [[citrus fruit]]s carried aboard English sailing vessels to prevent [[scurvy]]) and &quot;Pom/Pommy&quot; (used in [[Australian English#Vocabulary|Australian English]] and [[New Zealand English]]), but these may be perceived as offensive. Also see [[alternative words for British]].

==Symbols and insignia==

[[Image:England crest.png|thumb|right|The logo of the [[England national football team]] combines the ''Three Lions'' with the [[Tudor rose]].]]

The two traditional symbols of England are the [[St. George's cross]] (the [[English flag]]) and the ''Three Lions'' [[coat of arms of England|coat of arms]] (see above), both derived from the great Norman powers that formed the monarchy &amp;ndash; the Cross of [[Aquitaine]] and the Lions of [[Anjou]]. The three lions were first definitely used by [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] (''Richard the Lionheart'') in the late 12th century (although it is also possible that [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] may have bestowed it on his son Henry before then). Historian [[Simon Schama]] has argued that the Three Lions are the true symbol of England because the English throne descended down the [[Angevin]] line.

A red cross acted as a symbol for many [[crusade|Crusaders]] in the 12th and 13th centuries. It became associated with [[St George]] and England, along with other countries and cities (such as [[Georgia (country)| Georgia]], [[Milan]] and the [[Republic of Genoa]]), which claimed him as their [[patron saint]] and used his cross as a banner. It remained in national use until 1707, when the [[Union Jack]] (more properly known as the Union Flag, except when used at sea) which English and Scottish ships had used at sea since 1606, was adopted for all purposes to unite the whole of Great Britain under a common flag. The flag of England no longer has much of an official role, but it is widely flown by [[Church of England]] properties and at sporting events. (Paradoxically, the latter is a fairly recent development; until the late 20th century, it was commonplace for fans of English teams to wave the Union Flag, rather than the St George's Cross).

The [[rose]] is widely recognised as the [[national flower]] of England and is used in a variety of contexts. Predominantly, this is a red rose (which also symbolises [[Lancashire]]), such as the badge of the [[England national rugby union team|English Rugby Union team]]. However, a white rose (which also symbolises [[Yorkshire]]) or a &quot;[[Tudor rose]]&quot; (symbolising the end of the [[Wars of the Roses|War of the Roses]]) may also be used on different occasions.

The Three Lions badge performs a similar role for the [[English national football team]] and [[English national cricket team]].

==National anthems==
Although England does not have an official anthem of its own, the following are widely regarded as English national hymns:

*&quot;[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]:&quot; Words by [[William Blake]], Music by [[Hubert Parry]]
*&quot;[[I Vow to Thee, My Country]]&quot;: Words by [[Cecil Spring-Rice]], Music by [[Gustav Holst]]
*&quot;[[Land of Hope and Glory]]&quot;: Words by [[A C Benson]], Music by [[Edward Elgar]] (although this refers to all of [[Great Britain]], not only England)
*&quot;[[Enigma Variations|Nimrod]]&quot;: Music by [[Edward Elgar]]

&quot;[[God Save The Queen]]&quot; (the national anthem for the UK as a whole) is usually played for English sporting events (e.g. football matches), although &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; has also been used as the English anthem for the [[Commonwealth Games]]. &quot;[[Rule Britannia]]&quot; despite being a song about Britain as a whole was often used for the [[English national football team]] when they play against another of the [[home nations]] but more recently 
&quot;[[God Save The Queen]]&quot; has been used by both the rugby and football teams. Many believe that English teams should use their own anthems, most popular of which is the use of &quot;Jerusalem&quot;.

The '''European Union''' or the '''EU''' is an [[Intergovernmentalism|intergovernmental]] and [[Supranationalism|supranational]] union of 25 democratic countries known as [[European Union member states|member states]]. The European Union was established under that name in 1992 by the ''Treaty on European Union'' (the [[Maastricht Treaty]]). However, many aspects of the Union existed before that date through a series of predecessor relationships, dating back to 1951.

The European Union's activities cover all areas of public policy, from [[health]] and [[economics|economic]] policy to [[foreign affairs]] and [[defense (military)|defence]]. However, the extent of its powers differs greatly between areas. Depending on the area in question, the EU may therefore resemble:

*a [[federation]] (for example, on monetary affairs, agricultural, trade and environmental policy, economic and social policy)
*a [[confederation]] (for example, on home affairs)
*an [[international organization|international organisation]] &lt;!-- Organisation is spelt how it is th EU--&gt;(for example, in foreign affairs)

A key activity of the EU is the establishment and administration of a common [[single market]], consisting of a [[customs union]], a [[Euro| single currency]] (adopted by 12 of the 25 member states), a [[Common Agricultural Policy]], a common trade policy, and a [[Common Fisheries Policy]].

The most important EU institutions are the [[Council of the European Union]], the [[European Commission]], the [[European Parliament]] and  the [[European Court of Justice]].

==Status==   
The members of the European Union have transferred to it considerable [[sovereignty]], more than that of any other non-sovereign [[International organisation#List of Regional Organisations|regional organisation]]. As has been mentioned, in certain areas the EU begins to take on the character of a [[federation]] or [[confederation]]. However, in legal terms, member states remain the ''masters of the Treaties'', which means that the Union does not have the power to transfer additional powers from states onto itself without their agreement through further international treaties. Further, in many areas member states have given up relatively little national sovereignty, particularly in key areas of national interest such as foreign relations and defence. This unique structure means the European Union is perhaps best seen as a ''[[sui generis]]'' entity. 

On [[29 October]], [[2004]], European heads of government and state [[signature|sign]]ed the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]]. This has been ratified by 13 member states and is currently awaiting ratification by the other states.  However, this process faltered on [[May 29]] [[2005]] when the majority of French voters rejected the constitution in a referendum by 54.7%. [[French referendum on the European Constitution|The French rejection]] was followed three days later by a [[Dutch referendum on the European Constitution|Dutch one]] on [[June 1]] when in the [[Netherlands]] 61.6% of voters refused the constitution as well.

The current and future status of the European Union therefore continues to be subject of political controversy, with widely differing views both within and between member states. For example, in the [[United Kingdom]] one poll suggested that around 50% of the population are indifferent to the European Union. However, other countries are more in favour of European integration &amp;mdash; soon after the Netherlands and the French voted &quot;no&quot; on the constitution, the tiny Grand Duchy of [[Luxembourg]] voted &quot;yes.&quot;  What the term &quot;European integration&quot; itself means is also the subject of much debate.

==Current issues==
Major issues currently facing the European Union cover its membership, structure, procedures and policies; they include the adoption, abandonment or adjustment of the new [[European Constitution|constitutional treaty]], the [[Enlargement of the European Union|Union's enlargement]] to the south and east (see below), resolving the Union's problematic fiscal and [[democratic deficit|democratic accountability]], revision of the rules of the [[Stability and Growth Pact]], and the future budget and the [[Common Agricultural Policy]].

At the December 2005 [[Intergovernmental Conference]] (IGC), which is a semi-annual meeting of EU member states'
heads of state and government, EU member states decided on how it should allocate the EU budget for the next seven years (2007-2013). Also, the &quot;[[Financial Perspective]]&quot; was defined as EU members agreed to fix the common budget to 1.045% of the European [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]. UK Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] agreed to review the [[UK rebate|British rebate]], negotiated by [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1984, despite a promise to the contrary made to the UK Parliament. French President [[Jacques Chirac]] declared that this increase in budget will permit Europe to &quot;finance common policies&quot; such as the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] or the [[Sixth Framework Programme|Research and Technological Development Policy]]. However, France's demand to lower the [[Value added tax|VAT]] in catering was refused.

Issues controversial during upcoming budget debates were the [[UK rebate|British rebate]], France's benefits from the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], Germany and the Netherlands' large contributions to the EU budget, and reform of the [[European Regional Development Fund]]s. Many commentators have envisaged these debates to yield a major split between governments such as France and Germany, who call for a broader budget and a more federal union, and governments such as that of the UK, who demand a slimmer budget with more funding transferred to science and research (and whose watchword is ''[[modernisation]]'').

==Origins and history==
{{main|History of the European Union}}

Attempts to unite the disparate nations of Europe precede the modern [[nation state]]s; they have occurred repeatedly throughout the history of Europe. Three thousand years ago, Europe was dominated by the [[Celt]]s, and then conquered and ruled by the Mediterranean centred [[Roman Empire]]. These early unions were created by force. The [[Franks|Frankish]] empire of [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] united large areas under a loose administration for hundreds of years. More recently the 1800s [[customs union]] under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and the 1940s conquests of [[Germany]] had only transitory existence.

Given Europe's collections of [[European languages|languages]] and cultures, these attempts usually involved [[Occupation|military subjugation]] of unwilling nations, leading to instability, others have lasted hundreds of years and large spells of peace and economical and technological progress as in the Roman Empire's [[Pax Romana]]. One of the first proposals for peaceful unification through cooperation and equality of membership was made by the [[pacifism|pacifist]] [[Victor Hugo]] in 1851. Following the catastrophes of the [[World War I|First World War]] and the [[World War II|Second World War]], the impetus for the founding of (what was later to become) the European Union greatly increased, driven by the determination to rebuild Europe and to eliminate the possibility of another war. This sentiment eventually led to the formation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] by [[Germany|(West) Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and the [[Benelux]] countries.  This was accomplished by the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)|Treaty of Paris]], signed in April, 1951, and taking effect in July, 1952.

The first full customs union was originally known as the '''European Economic Community''' (informally called the '''Common Market''' in the UK), established by the [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957 and implemented on [[1 January]] [[1958]]. This later changed to the '''European Co>

      <comment>/* Other long words */ sp</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are seemingly endless debates over which is the '''longest word in [[English language|English]]''', demonstrating that the idea of what constitutes a [[word (linguistics)|word]] is not as straightforward as it seems.  Hyphenated or space-delimited [[compound (linguistics)|compound]]s and proper nouns are linguistically considered words, but as they can grow with few limits, they are not counted here.

==&quot;Official&quot; longest word==
The ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'', in its [[1992]] and subsequent editions, declared the &quot;longest real word&quot; in the English language to be '''[[floccinaucinihilipilification]]''' at 29 letters. Defined as ''the act of estimating (something) as worthless'', its usage has been recorded as far back as [[1741]]. In recent times its usage has been recorded in the proceedings of the [[United States]] [[United States Senate|Senate]] by Senator [[Jesse Helms]], and at the [[White House]] by [[Bill Clinton]]'s press secretary [[Mike McCurry]], albeit sarcastically. It is the longest non-technical word in the first edition of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. The acceptability of the 33-letter adverbial form '''floccinaucinihilipilificastically''' is subject to controversy. &lt;/br&gt;

== Popular usage ==
'''[[Antidisestablishmentarianism]]''' (a [[19th century]] movement in [[England]] opposed to the [[separation of church and state]]) at 28 letters is often popularly accepted as English's longest word, and is probably the best-known &quot;longest  word.&quot; Other versions such as ''Antidisestablishmentarianistically'' and ''Pseudoantidisestablishmentarianism'' are demonstrably longer, though, showing that &quot;popular acceptance&quot; is not a guarantee of accuracy. (''See also the &quot;Constructions&quot; section below.'')

The word '''[[pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis]]''', also spelled pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanokoniosis, is defined as &quot;a [[lung disease]] caused by the inhalation of very fine [[silica]] or quartz dust.&quot; At 45 letters (a [[P45|p45]] word for [[logology|logologists]]), it is certainly the longest word ever to appear in a non-technical dictionary of English, the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]. However, there are strong indications that the word was coined by puzzler [[Everett Smith]] in [[1935]] as a hypothetical long word that could result from the protraction of medical terms. The actual name of the disease is ''[[pneumoconiosis]]'', which is 14 letters long.

== Words that do exist but are often considered non-words ==

[[James Joyce]], known for his distinctive style, made up nine 100- and one 101-letter long words in his novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', the most famous of which is '''Bababadalgharaghtakamminarronnkonnbronntonnerronntuonnthunntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoohoordenenthurnuk'''. Appearing on the first page, it allegedly is the symbolic thunderclap representing the fall of [[Adam and Eve]]. As this word appears nowhere else except in reference to this passage, it is generally not accepted as a &quot;real&quot; word. [[Sylvia Plath]] made mention to that word in her semi-[[autobiographical]] novel &quot;[[The Bell Jar]]&quot; as Esther Greenwood, the protagonist, was reading [[Finnegans Wake]].

The well-known song title from the movie ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', &quot;'''[[Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious]]'''&quot;, with 34 letters, does appear in several dictionaries, but only as a [[proper noun]], and defined in reference to the song title. Hence it may well be dismissed as not a &quot;real&quot; word, particularly since the song assigns no meaning to it other than to say it's impressive.

== Other long words ==
The longest word cited by the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'', which allegedly represents the name for human [[mitochondrial DNA]], is 207,000+ letters long. Some types of DNA could have as many as 1,000,000,000 letters if fully written out.

The longest hypothetically legal [[Scrabble]] word (hypothetical because it exceeds 15 letters, the width of a Scrabble board) in [[North America]]n play is [[EDTA|ethylenediaminetetraacetate]]s (28 letters). It is the plural of a word found in [[Merriam-Webster]]'s [[Collegiate]] [[Dictionary]], 10th edition, which was the dictionary of reference in North American [[Scrabble]] play for base words of at least 10 letters, and their inflections of at least 10 letters, until [[June 16]], [[2003]].

The longest word which appears in [[William Shakespeare]]'s works is the 27-letter '''[[honorificabilitudinitatibus]]''', appearing in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]''. This is arguably an English word (rather than [[Latin]]), but only because he used it.

The '''[[humuhumu-nukunuku-a-pua‘a]]''', or reef triggerfish, is [[Hawaii]]'s unofficial state fish.  At 21 letters (22 counting the [[okina|ʻokina]]) it is one of the best known very long one-word names for an animal.  It is often asserted that &quot;the name is longer than the fish.&quot;

The character [[Big Bird]] of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' sings the [[Latin alphabet]], thinking it is a word. He reads '''Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz''' aloud as /{{IPA|æbkəd&amp;#603;fgi&amp;#676;&amp;#603;kl&amp;#809;mn&amp;#809;&amp;#596;pkw&amp;#605;&amp;#720;&amp;#712;stu&amp;#720;vw&amp;#618;ks&amp;#618;z}}/ and breaks into song ([[ABC-DEF-GHI]]).

In the [[1970s]], there were advertisements for '''Lip&amp;shy;smackin&amp;shy;thirst&amp;shy;quenchin&amp;shy;acetastin&amp;shy;motivatin&amp;shy;good&amp;shy;buzzin&amp;shy;cool&amp;shy;talkin&amp;shy;high&amp;shy;walkin&amp;shy;fast&amp;shy;livin&amp;shy;ever&amp;shy;givin&amp;shy;cool&amp;shy;fizzin''' [[Pepsi]], coining a 100-letter term.
Later, the 71-letter '''[[Twoallbeefpattiesspecialsaucelettucecheesepicklesonionsonasesameseedbun|Two&amp;shy;all&amp;shy;beef&amp;shy;patties&amp;shy;special&amp;shy;sauce&amp;shy;lettuce&amp;shy;cheese&amp;shy;pickles&amp;shy;onions&amp;shy;on&amp;shy;a&amp;shy;sesame&amp;shy;seed&amp;shy;bun]]''' was used in a [[McDonald's Corporation|McDonald's Restaurant]] [[advertisement]] to describe the [[Big Mac]].

The longest word whose letters are in alphabetical order is the eight-letter ''[[Aegilops]]'', a grass genus. The seven-letter ''addeems'' (from the archaic verb ''addeem'', meaning to award), ''alloquy'' (an archaic or literary word for an address), ''beefily'' (in a beefy manner), ''billowy'' (like a wave or surge), ''[[dikkops]]'' (a South African bird) and ''gimmors'' (plural of ''gimmor'', an old-fashioned word for a mechanical contrivance) are also close.

=== Words with certain characteristics of notable length ===
The longest word in the English language containing only one [[vowel]] is '''strengths''', while '''scraunched''' is the longest monosyllabic word in current usage. '''Twyndyllyngs''' is the longest word without any of the common vowel letters a, e, i, o, or u (although y is certainly a vowel in that and many other words). '''Euouae''', at six letters long, is the longest English word consisting only of vowels, and the word with the most consecutive vowels. It is a [[medieval]] musical term. However, ''u'' was often used interchangeably with ''v'', and the variant &quot;evovae&quot; is occasionally used.

The longest words with no repeated letters are '''dermatoglyphics''', '''misconjugatedly''' and '''uncopyrightable''' [http://rinkworks.com/words/oddities.shtml].

The longest medical term typable with only the left hand (using conventional hand placement on a [[QWERTY]] keyboard) is '''aftercataracts''', and the longest &quot;common&quot; word is '''[[Flight attendant|stewardesses]]''' or '''reverberated'''. Conversely, using the right hand alone, the longest word that can be typed is '''[[Heartsease|johnny-jump-up]]''', or excluding [[hyphen]]s, '''[[polyphony]]'''. The longest word typable using only the top row of letters is ''not'' '''[[typewriter]]''', as is assumed by many: '''proterotype''' and '''rupturewort''' are longer, though not in common usage.

The longest words typable by alternating left and right hands are '''dismantlement''' and '''neuroticisms''', starting with the left and right side respectively.

Word with the most double letters: Racoonnookkeeper.

Word with the vowels in order: Facetiously, abstemiously

==Constructions==
English is a language which permits the legitimate extension of existing words to serve new purposes by the addition of prefixes and suffixes. This is sometimes referred to as [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] construction. This process can create arbitrarily long words: for example, the prefixes ''pseudo-'' (false, spurious) and ''anti-'' (against, opposed to) can be added as many times as desired. Multiple observers have played on this in noting that a word like ''[[anti-aircraft]]'' (pertaining to the defense against aircraft) is easily extended to ''anti-anti-aircraft'' (pertaining to counteracting the defense against aircraft, a legitimate concept) and can from thereon be prefixed with an endless stream of &quot;anti-&quot;s, each time creating a new level of counteraction. It also must be noted that the concept of double negatives does not apply here; for instance, ''anti-anti-aircraft'' does not reduce to simply ''aircraft'', it specifically pertains to counteracting the defense against aircraft.

The earlier mentioned &quot;antidisestablishmentarianism&quot; is the longest common example of a word formed by [[agglutinative]] construction. The stepwise construction is as follows:

;''[[establish]]'': to set up, put in place, or institute (originally from the Latin ''stāre'', to stand)
;'''''[[disestablish|dis'''-establish]]'': ending the [[established]] status of a body, in particular a church, given such status by law, such as the [[Church of England]]
;''[[disestablishment|disestablish-'''ment''']]'': the separation of church and state (specifically in this context it is the political movement of the [[1860s]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]])
;'''''anti'''-disestablishment'': opposition to disestablishment
;''antidisestablishment-'''arian''''': an advocate of opposition to disestablishment (alternatively, but less likely and quite similar in meaning, &quot;opposed to disestablishmentarians&quot;, depending on what &quot;anti-&quot; is taken to belong to)
;''antidisestablishmentarian-'''[[ism]]''''': the movement or ideology of advocates of opposition to disestablishment; the movement or ideology that opposes disestablishment

Of course, the process need not stop there: prefixes like ''neo-'' and ''contra-'' can be added, and ''-istically'' can be used in place of ''-ism''. The words so created are increasingly more contrived, however, and given that there is essentially no limit to their length (unless artificial constraints are introduced, such as not using any prefix more than once), it is dubious whether any of them can lay a claim to being the &quot;longest&quot; word.

Constructing long words in [[agglutinative language]]s for humorous effect is a practice as old as the languages themselves. In his play ''[[Assemblywomen]]'', the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] comedic poet [[Aristophanes]] created [[wiktionary:Lopadotemachoselachogaleokranioleipsanodrimhypotrimmatosilphioparaomelitokatakechymenokichlepikossyphophattoperisteralektryonoptekephalliokigklopeleiolagoiosiraiobaphetraganopterygon|a word of 183 letters describing a dish]] by stringing together its ingredients.

[[Henry Carey]]'s farce ''[[Chrononhotonthologos]]'' ([[1743]]) holds the opening line: &quot;Aldiborontiphoscophornio! Where left you Chrononhotonthologos?&quot;

==Technical terms ==
A number of scientific naming schemes can be used to generate arbitrarily long words.

''Gammaracanthuskytodermogammarus loricatobaicalensis'' is possibly the longest [[binomial name]], which stands for a kind of [[amphipod]].

[[John Horton Conway]] and [[Landon Curt Noll]] developed an open-ended system for naming powers of 10, in which ''one sexmilliaquingentsexagintillion'', coming from the Latin name for 6560, is the name for 10&lt;sup&gt;3(6560+1)&lt;/sup&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;19683&lt;/sup&gt;.

Names of chemical compounds can be extremely long if written as one word, which is sometimes done. An example of this is '''[[Neosalvarsan|sodiummetadiaminoparadioxyarsenobenzoemethylenesulphoxylate]]''', an arsenic-containing drug. There are also other chemical naming systems, using numbers instead of &quot;meta&quot;, &quot;para&quot; etc. as descriptive dividers, breaking up the name, which then no longer can be considered a single long word.

The [[IUPAC nomenclature]] for [[organic chemical compound]]s is open-ended, giving rise to such words as ''[[Methionylthreonylthreonyl...isoleucine]]'' (189,819 letters), ''[[Methionylalanylthreonyl...leucine]]'' (64,060 letters), ''[[Methionylglutaminyl...serine]]'' (1913 letters), and ''[[Acetylseryltyrosylserylisol...serine]]'' (1185 letters).

==Place names==
There is some debate as to whether or not a place name is a legitimate word. Without entering that debate, the longest officially recognized place name in an English-speaking country is
'''[[Taumatawhakatang&amp;shy;ihangakoauauot&amp;shy;amateaturipukaka&amp;shy;pikimaunga&amp;shy;horonuku&amp;shy;pokaiwhenuak&amp;shy;itanatahu]]''' (85 letters) which is a hill in New Zealand.

The longest place name in the United States (45 letters) is '''[[Chargoggagoggmanchauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg|Chargoggagogg&amp;shy;manchauggagogg&amp;shy;chaubunagungamaugg]]''', a lake in [[Massachusetts]]. The longest hyphenated names in the U.S. are '''[[Winchester-on-the-Severn]]''', a town in [[Maryland]], and '''[[Washington-on-the-Brazos]]''', a notable place in [[Texas]] history.

[[Image:Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch station sign (cropped version 1).jpg|thumb|right|The station sign at [[Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch|Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrn- drobwllllantysiliogogogoch]] in North [[Wales]]]]
The 58 character  name '''[[Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch|Llanfair&amp;shy;pwllgwyngyll&amp;shy;gogerychwyrndrobwll&amp;shy;llantysiliogogogoch]]''' is the famous name of a town in [[Anglesey]] in the [[United Kingdom]].  This place name is actually 51 letters long, as certain character groups in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] are considered as one letter, for instance ll, ng and ch. It is generally agreed, however, that this invented name, adopted in the mid-[[19th century]], was contrived solely to be the longest name of any town in Britain. The official name of the place is [[Llanfair PG|Llanfairpwllgwyngyll]], commonly abbreviated to &quot;Llanfairpwll&quot; or the somewhat jocular &quot;Llanfair PG&quot;. The longest station name in the UK, at 68 letters, is also in Wales: '''[[Gorsafawddacha'idraigodanheddogleddollônpenrhynareurdraethceredigion]]''' was specifically contrived to &quot;beat&quot; Llanfairpwllgwyngyll.

In [[Ireland]], the longest English placename at 22 letters is [[Muckanaghederdauhaulia]] (from the [[Irish language]], ''Muiceanach idir dhá sháile'', meaning pig-marsh between two saltwater inlets) in [[County Galway]]. If this is disallowed for being derived from Irish, or not a town, the longest at 19 letters is [[Newtownmountkennedy]] in [[County Wicklow]].

It is questionable whether any of the above (with the exception of Newtownmountkennedy) are properly considered English words, being derived from [[Māori language|Māori]], [[Nipmuck]], Welsh and Irish words respectively, or being a conjunction of individual English words.

{{See also|List of short place names}}

==Jokes==
A popular joke answer to the &quot;longest word&quot; question is the word '''smiles''', credited as the longest word because there is a ''[[mile]]'' between each ''s''.
Of course, by this reckoning the word '''beleaguered''', which contains a ''[[league (unit)|league]]'', is even longer.

A popular [[playground]] joke in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] states that the longest word in the English language is [[Rubber band|elastic]] because it will always stretch.

According to some, the longest word is the &quot;word&quot; after the sentence &quot;And now, a word from our sponsors,&quot; because in radio [[advertisements]], this phrase is conventionally followed by a rapid string of explanation equivalent to [[fine print]] in paper ads.

Although only fourteen letters long, ''sesquipedalian'' deserves a mention. It is derived from a [[nonce word]] used by the [[Rome|Roman]] author [[Horace]], in his work &quot;[[Ars Poetica]]&quot; (The Art of Poetry). The quote is as follows: &quot;Proicit ampullas et sesquipedalia verba,&quot; which means, &quot;He throws aside his paint pots and his words that are a foot and a half long&quot;. The [[Oxford English dictionary]] lists ''sesquipedalianism'' (&quot;the practice of using words one and a half feet long&quot;), and further derivations can be created as described in the &quot;Constructions&quot; section above.

==Morphemes==
A [[morpheme]] is the smallest part of a word that retains an individual significance.

For example, the word 'antidisestablishmentarianism' can be broken down into the following morphemes:  anti/dis/establish/ment/ari/an/ism  (7 morphemes).

The morphemes in this word that are perhaps less obvious in their individual meanings are: 
* &quot;ari&quot; (makes the antidisestablishment an adjective)
* &quot;an&quot; (an individual who subscribes to antidisestablishmentary views)

For the purposes of this article, any word which has appeared in a recognised general [[English language|English]] dictionary published in the 20th century or later is considered a candidate. For interest, some archaic words, non-standard words and proper names are also included.

The treatment of words of foreign origin can be problematic. The entire history of English involves influence and loanwords from other languages, and this process continues today (see [[Foreign language influences in English]]). However, there is a gray area between foreign words and words accepted as English.  Everyone would accept that the formerly foreign ''[[ballet]]'' ([[French language|French]]), ''[[ketchup]]'' ([[Malay language|Malay]]) and ''[[safari]]'' ([[Swahili language|Swahili]]) are now English words.  The status of words such as ''[[zeitgeist]]'', ''[[Weltanschauung]]'', and ''[[schadenfreude]]'' is less clear-cut.  The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' calls such words &quot;resident aliens&quot;. Generally, a word of foreign origin is legitimate here if it may be encountered in an English text without translation.

== Combinations of letters ==

===Many vowels===

''Euouae'' (a type of cadence in mediæval music) contains six [[vowel]] letters in a row. However this is often considered erroneous given the semantics of the word which demonstrate it to be [[elision]].

There is only one common word in English that has five vowels in a row: ''queueing'' (two vowel sounds). More unusual examples are ''cooeeing'' (making a &quot;cooee&quot; sound), ''miaoued'' or ''miaouing'' (from ''miaou'', to make a sound like a cat), and ''zoaeae'' ((a plural of ''zoaea''). However, this is a graphalogically incorrect variant owing to the simplification by Americanization of the [[diphthong]] [[æ]]). ''[[Zoea]]'' means a crustacean larva and is the term commonly known by [[scrabble]] enthusiasts). The final &quot;ae&quot; as transcribed above represents the same diphthong and, as such, purists may consider &quot;zoaeae&quot; to have only three vowels.
Proper names include ''Rousseauian'' (pertaining to the philosopher [[Rousseau]]), ''[[Aeaea]]'' or ''Aiaia'' (a location in Greek mythology), and the related adjectives ''Aeaean''/''Aiaian''. 

The list of common words with four vowels in a row is fairly short, comprising ''[[aqueous]]'', ''[[Hawaiian]]'', ''obsequious'', ''[[onomatopoeia]]'', ''[[pharmacopoeia]]'', ''queue'' (and derivatives ''[[queue]]d'' and ''queues''), and ''[[sequoia]]''.

Examples of words consisting entirely of vowels, including proper names and some words already mentioned, are: ''a'' (the indefinite article), ''[[lava|aa]]'' (a type of lava, of Hawaiian origin), ''ae'' (a [[Scots language|Scots]] adjective form of &quot;one&quot;), ''[[ai (animal)|ai]]'' (the three-toed sloth), ''[[aia]]'' (a Brazilian bird), ''[[Aiea]]'' (a town in Hawaii), ''[[Aeaea]]'' or ''Aiaia'' (a location in Greek mythology), ''au'' (French for &quot;to&quot; or &quot;with&quot;, encountered in English in compounds such as ''[[au pair]]'' and ''[[au fait]]''), ''[[Enki|Ea]]'' (a Babylonian god), ''euouae'' (a type of cadence in mediaeval music), ''euoi'' (a Greek exclamation of joy), ''eau'' (French for &quot;water&quot;, encountered in English in compounds such as ''eau de cologne''), ''I'' (first person pronoun), ''Iao'' (a Polynesian god), ''[[I'i]]'' (a figure in Polynesian mythology), ''[[Io (mythology)|Io]]'' (a figure in Greek mythology, also a moon of Jupiter), ''oi'' (an impolite exclamation used to gain someone's attention), and ''oo'' (a Hawaiian bird). Exclamations such as ''oooo'', ''aaaa'' and ''eeee'' are not normally considered legitimate words.

The shortest word containing the five regular vowels is ''[[eunoia]]'' at six letters, followed by ''[[sequoia]]'' (and a variety of rarer words such as ''[[Aeonium]]'', ''eulogia'', ''miaoued'') at seven. There are many words that feature all five vowels in alphabetical order, the commonest being ''[[Wiktionary:abstemious|abstemious]]'', ''adventitious'', ''[[Wiktionary:facetious|facetious]]'', and ''sacreligious''. One of the shortest, at eight letters, is ''[[wiktionary:caesious|caesious]]''.  Considering ''y'' as a vowel, the [[suffix]] ''[[Wiktionary:-ly|-ly]]'' can be added to a number of these words; thus the shortest word containing six unique vowels in alphabetical order is ''[[Wiktionary:facetiously|facetiously]]'' (11 letters). 

''Subcontinental'', ''uncomplimentary'' and ''unnoticeable'' are common words having the five vowels in reverse order. One of the shortest such words, at eight letters, is ''[[Muroidea]]'', a taxonomical grouping of rodents.

Some words not already mentioned that have a high proportion of vowels, including some proper names, are as follows. 6 letters, 5 vowels: ''[[Euboea]]'' (a Greek island), ''[[Aeolia]]'' (a region now in Turkey), ''ooecia'' (plural of ''ooecium'', part of the reproductive system of some primitive animals); 8 letters, 6 vowels: ''aboideau'' or ''aboiteau'' (a sluice gate), ''epopoeia'' (variant of ''epopee'', an epic poem), ''quiaquia'' (a type of fish); 9 letters, 7 vowels: ''[[Aizoaceae]]'' (a plant family), ''[[Aloeaceae]]'' (a plant family); 11 letters, 8 vowels: ''Aecidiaceae'' (a plant family), ''[[Ouagadougou]]'' (capital of Burkina Faso), ''[[Paeoniaceae]]'' (a plant family), ''[[Outaouais]]'' (a region of western Quebec); 9 letters, 7 vowels.

===Many consonants===

The longest word with only one vowel is ''strengths'' (9 letters), packing six consonant sounds into a single syllable.  The words ''[[Wiktionary:psychorhythm|psychorhythm]]s'' (13), ''[[polyrhythm]]s'' (11) and ''[[Wiktionary:rhythmlessly|rhythmlessly]]'' (12) are longer, but each clearly uses the letter ''y'' as a vowel. There are also a variety of onomatopoeic words, such as the nine-letter ''tsktsking'' (making a &quot;tsktsk&quot; sound), which appears in Chambers Dictionary. Eight-letter words with just one vowel are also fairly rare &amp;ndash; as well as ''strength'' itself, some examples are ''schmaltz'', ''schnapps'' and ''twelfths''.

Candidates for words with seven consonants in a row are ''Twelfthstreet'' (normally two words but sometimes written as one, as in a song title; ''eighthstreet'' is feasible by analogy), and ''Hirschsprung'', as in ''[[Hirschsprung's disease]]'' (though this is after a Danish surname).

The place-name ''[[Knightsbridge]]'' has six consonants in a row (with four [[consonant]] sounds), as do the compound words ''[[Catch phrase|catchphrase]]'', ''[[Wiktionary:latchstring|latchstring]]'', ''sightscreen'', ''watchspring'' and ''watchstrap'', and the somewhat more obscure ''borschts'' (plural of ''[[borscht]]'', a type of soup from Eastern Europe), and the [[German language|German]]-derived ''[[festschrift]]'' (a collection of writings honouring a noted academic), ''[[Eschscholzia]]'' (a plant genus) and ''[[bergschrund]]'' (a glacier crevasse).

Apart from words already mentioned (and their plurals), long words with just two, three, and four vowels include ''Christchurch'', ''spendthrifts'', ''stretchmarks'' (2 vowels, 12 letters); ''farthingsworths'', ''shillingsworths'', ''strengthfulness'' (3, 15); and ''handcraftsmanship'', ''splanchnemphraxis'' (4, 17). Exclamations such as ''mmmmm'' and ''grrrrrrrr'' are not normally considered legitimate words.

===Alternating vowels and consonants===

The superlatively long word ''[[honorificabilitudinitatibus]]'' (27 letters) alternates consonants and vowels, as do the slightly more prosaic medical terms ''hepatoperitonitis'' and ''mesobilirubinogen'' (both 17 letters). The longest such words that are reasonably well known may be ''overimaginative'', ''parasitological'' and ''verisimilitudes'' (all 15 letters).

The longest alternating words beginning with a vowel are possibly the 16-letter ''adenolipomatosis'' (a glandular condition), ''aluminosilicates'' (a class of chemical compounds containing aluminium and silicon) and ''anatomicomedical'' (relating to anatomy and medicine). 

''Theopneustia'' (an obscure word for Christian divine inspiration) alternates pairs of vowels and consonants.

=== Repeated letters ===
A number of English words have three of the same letter in sequence, but almost all are constructions involving a suffix, and could arguably be hyphenated or, in some cases, written as two words. They include ''brasssmith'', ''headmistressship'', ''wallless'' (lacking walls), and ''bulllike'' (like a bull).

Other candidates are the archaic ''agreeeth'' (third person singular present tense of the verb to agree), and ''tweeer'' (comparative adjective of the qualifier ''twee'' meaning infantilely kitsch). There are also many possessives ending in ''-ss's'' (e.g. ''actress's'').

Place-names include ''[[Rossshire]]'' and ''[[Invernessshire]]'', both in Scotland, UK (though both of these counties are usually hyphenated in official documentation), and ''[[Kaaawa]]'' in {{Unicode|Hawaiʻi}} (although this is a common misspelling of ''{{Unicode|Kaʻaʻawa}}'' in [[Hawaiian]], the {{Unicode|ʻokina}} being a [[glottal stop]]). The famous Welsh placename ''[[Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch]]'' contains the letter ''l'' four times in a row, but the ''llll'' is considered by some to be the single Welsh [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''ll'' twice, rather than the English ''l'' four times

Constructions such as ''zzzzzz'' (sound of a person snoring, representing sleep), ''shhhhhh'' (quiet!), and ''aaaaargh'' (cry of distress) are not normally recognised as legitimate words.

''[[Bookkeeper]]'' has three consecutive doubled letters (some also allow ''subbookkeeper'' which has four).

Words in which no letter is used more than once are called ''isograms'' (though its use in this sense is [[slang]] restricted to those who enjoy recreational linguistics, and not commonly found in dictionaries). ''Uncopyrightable'', with fifteen letters, is the longest common isogram in English (some also allow ''uncopyrightables''). ''Dermatoglyphics'' shares the distinction but is a less well-known word; ''subdermatoglyphic'' is two letters longer but even more obscure &amp;mdash; it has only one report of alleged live use (an article in ''Annals of Dermatology''), and supposedly means &quot;of or pertaining to the patterns on the lower [[skin]] layers&quot;. The words ''blepharoconjunctivitis'' and ''pneumoventriculography'' (as well as several others) contain 16 of the 26 letters of the alphabet, though they are not isograms as some letters are repeated.

Long words with just two, three, four... distinct letters include ''booboo'', ''deeded'', ''muumuu'' (2 distinct letters, 6 letters in total); ''assesses'', ''referrer'' (3, 8); ''senselessness'' (4, 13); ''defenselessness'' (6, 15); ''disinterestedness'' (7, 17); and ''institutionalisation'' (8, 20).

The following table lists words that repeat the given letter many times. The number of repetitions is shown in brackets. If the word with the most repetitions is dubious (for example, it is hyphenated, arguably should be hyphenated, is a proper name, or seems artificial) then further candidates with fewer repetitions are offered. Where there are many candidate words with the same number of repetitions only the shortest or commonest (judged subjectively) is listed.

Ignoring the 20-letter play title ''[[Chrononhotonthologos]]'', the longest words containing only one of the five regular vowels (overlooking y) may be the 17-letter ''proctocolonoscopy'' and ''synchrocyclotrons''. A candidate for longest word containing only one type of consonant is the 10-letter ''coucicouci'', a word apparently included in at least one version of ''Roget's Thesaurus'' to mean &quot;imperfect&quot;, but otherwise almost unknown. 9-letter words are ''[[allolalia]]'' (a type of speech disturbance) and ''Coccaceae'' (an obsolete name for a family of bacteria).

===Unusual word endings===

''[[Wiktionary:dreamt|Dreamt]]'' and its derivatives are the only common English words that end in ''mt''. In American English, which prefers ''dreamed'', there are none. Derivatives include ''undreamt'' (typically used only in the phrase &quot;undreamt of&quot;), ''daydreamt'', and the rarer ''outdreamt'' and ''redreamt''. Other ''-mt'' words include the [[Scots language|Scots]] word ''fremt'' (usually ''fremd'' or ''fremmit''[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/dsl/getent4.php?query=fremd&amp;sset=1&amp;fset=20&amp;printset=20&amp;searchtype=full&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=both]) meaning &quot;foreign&quot; or &quot;estranged&quot; and, familiar but of foreign origin, ''[[Klimt]]'', the Austrian painter.

Despite the assertions of a well-known puzzle, modern English does not have three common words ending in ''-gry''.  ''[[Angry]]'' and ''[[hungry]]'' are the only ones. There are, however, a number of rare and obsolete words; see [[Gry]] for a further discussion.

''-mt'' and ''-gry'' are possibly the best-known unusual word endings, but there are many others exhibited by only one or two everyday words. Some examples, excluding derivative words, are ''-ln'' (''kiln'', ''Lincoln''), ''-bt'' (''doubt'', ''debt''), ''-igy'' (''effigy'', ''prodigy''), ''-nen'' (''linen''), and ''cay'' (''decay'', ''Biscay'').

===Unusual word beginnings===
Words beginning with a double letter are generally very rare. The most common combination is probably ''oo-'' (''oodles'', ''oolong'', ''oomph'', ''oops'', ''ooze'', and a number of less familiar examples, mostly technical words incorporating the prefix ''oo-'', meaning &quot;egg&quot;), followed by ''aa-'' (familiar examples being ''aardvark'' and ''Aaron''), and ''ee-'' (''eel'', ''eerie'', ''eek'', ''eesome'' (attractive)).

Otherwise such words are unlikely to be considered part of the English vocabulary, and almost entirely of foreign origin. Some examples are ''Ccoya'' (Inca queen), ''ʻiʻiwi'' (a Hawaiian bird), ''llama'', ''llano'' (a grassy plain), and ''llanero'' (someone who lives on a ''llano''). There are, however, numerous Welsh placenames beginning ''Ll-'' (e.g. ''[[Llandudno]]'', ''[[Llanberis]]'') &amp;ndash; plus the familiar personal names ''Llewellyn'' and ''Lloyd'' &amp;ndash; and a smaller number beginning ''Ff-'' (e.g. ''[[Ffestiniog]]'', ''[[Ffrith]]''). A number of Japanese names begin ''Ii-'' when transliterated into the Roman alphabet.

The words ''euouae'', ''Aeaea'' and ''euoi'', mentioned earlier under &quot;Many vowels&quot;, start with six, five and four vowels respectively. There are very few other words starting with four vowels. Some proper name examples are: ''[[El Aaiún]]'' (a city in Western Sahara), 
''Aeaetes'' (a character in Greek mythology), ''ʻAiea'' (a town in Hawaiʻi), ''Aouad'' (personal name), ''Aouita'' (personal name), ''Euaechme'' (a character in Greek mythology), and ''Ueueteotl'' (an Aztec god).

The list of words starting with three vowels is rather longer, but most are obscure. Some of the more familiar examples are: ''[[aeolian]]'' (relating to the wind), ''[[aeon]]'' (an age), 
''aoudad'' (a sheep-like animal of northern Africa), ''eau'' (French for &quot;water&quot;, encountered in English in compounds such as ''[[eau de Cologne]]''), ''Iain'' (personal name), ''oeuvre'' (an artist's body of work), ''[[Ouagadougou]]'' (capital of the African country Burkina Faso), and ''[[ouija]]'' (a board used by mediums to reveal spirit messages). ''Aeolian'' and ''aeon'' are British spellings.

There are similarly few English words beginning with a large number of consonants. ''Tsktsks'' appears in [[Collins Dictionary]]. Also, ''cwrth'' and ''cwtch'' (of Welsh origin) are five consonants, although the &quot;w&quot; functions as a vowel. There is also a surname ''Schkrohowsky'' of Russian origin.

There are a reasonable number of words beginning with four consonants. The commonest beginnings are ''phth-'' (''phthalein'', ''phthisis'', ''Phthirus'') and ''sch-'' (mostly words of German/Yiddish origin such as ''schlep'', ''schmaltz'', ''schnapps''). Other examples are ''chthonic'', ''pschent'', ''sphragide'' and ''tshwala''.

A partial list of words with other unusual initial letter combinations follows. Unsurprisingly, many are of foreign origin: ''[[bdellium]]'', ''[[bwana]]'', ''[[Wiktionary:cnemis|cnemis]]'', ''ctenoid'' (comb-like), ''[[czar]]'', ''dghaisa'' (a Maltese rowing boat), ''[[dvandva]]'', ''dziggetai'' (a Mongolian wild ass), ''[[fjord]]'', ''Gbari'' (an African language), ''[[gmelina arborea|gmelina]]'', ''[[jnana]]'', ''kgotla'' (in southern Africa, a meeting place), ''[[kshatriya]]'', ''[[Wiktionary:kvetch|kvetch]]'', ''[[mbaqanga]]'', ''[[mho]]'', ''[[mnemonic]]'', ''[[mridanga]]'', ''[[Mwera]]'' (an African language), ''mzungu'' (in East Africa, a white person), ''[[Ndebele]]'', ''[[ngaio]]'', ''[[oquassa]]'' (a type of North American trout), ''[[pfennig]]'', ''[[pneumonia]]'', ''[[ptarmigan]]'', ''pzazz'' (glamour), ''[[qawwali]]'', ''[[qintar]]'', ''[[qoph]]'', ''[[sforzando]]'', ''[[sfumato]]'', ''[[sjambok]]'', ''[[Wiktionary:svelte|svelte]]'', ''[[tmesis]]'', ''[[tsunami]]'', ''[[tzar]]'', ''vlei'' (in southern Africa, a seasonally flooded area), ''vroom'' (a revving sound), ''[[Xhosa]]'', ''[[xiphoid]]'', ''xoanan'' (a carved wooden icon), ''[[Yggdrasil]]'', ''[[ylem]]'', ''ynambu'' (a South American bird), ''[[yttrium]]'', ''[[zloty]]'', ''[[zwitterion]]''.

=== &quot;Q&quot; without &quot;U&quot; ===
''See main article:  [[List of English words containing a Q not followed by a U]].''

=== Other unusual spellings ===

Most people are aware that the letter ''y''  can serve as both a consonant and a vowel. ''w'' can also be an [[orthography|orthographic]] vowel, since ''how'' is pronounced /hau/ (with ''w'' representing the second half of the [[diphthong]].)

However, ''[[cwm]]'' (pronounced &quot;koom&quot;, defined as a steep-walled hollow on a hillside) is a rare case of a word using ''w'' to represent a [[Syllable nucleus|nucleus]] vowel, as is ''[[crwth]]'' (pronounced &quot;krooth&quot;, a type of stringed instrument). Both words are in [[Merriam-Webster]]'s Collegiate Dictionary. They derive from the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] use of ''w'' as a vowel. The word ''cwm'' is commonly applied to Welsh place names; [[cwm]]s of [[glacier|glacial]] origin are a common feature of Welsh geography. It is also used to describe features in the [[Himalaya]].

Both these examples may belong in 'Words of Foreign Origin', as they are actual words in the Welsh language which have been absorbed into English. See ''coombe'' as the south-west English equivalent of ''cwm''.

===Containing the letters a,b,c,d...===

''Boldface'' and ''feedback'' both contain all the letters from ''a'' to ''f'' (there are many such words, but these are the shortest at eight letters). There is probably no common English word that contains all letters ''a'' through ''g''. Feedbacking may be acceptable is some usage. ''Black-figured'' (referring to a type of pottery decoration) and ''double-refracting'' are hyphenated examples.

The longest word consisting entirely of letters from the first half of the alphabet (''a'' through ''m'') may be ''[[Hamamelidaceae]]'' (a plant family) at 14 letters. Long common words include ''fiddledeedee'' (12 letters), ''blackballed'' (11) and ''blackmailed'' (11).

''Soupspoons'' (10) consists entirely of letters from the second half of alphabet, as does the hyphenated ''topsy-turvy'' and a number of rarer 10-letter words such as ''nonsupport'' (failure to support), ''puttyroots'' (plural of ''[[puttyroot]]'', a species of orchid), and ''zoosporous'' (relating to a ''[[zoospore]]'', a type of fungal or algal spore).

===Letters in alphabetic order===

Words whose letters are in alphabetical order include the eight-letter ''[[Aegilops]]'' (a grass genus), and the seven-letter ''addeems'' (from the archaic verb ''addeem'', meaning to award), ''alloquy'' (an archaic or literary word for an address), ''beefily'' (in a beefy manner), ''billowy'' (like a wave or surge), ''[[dikkops]]'' (a South African bird) and ''gimmors'' (plural of ''gimmor'', an old-fashioned word for a mechanical contrivance). 

In reverse alphabetical order are the nine-letter ''spoonfeed'' and the eight-letter ''spoonfed'' and ''trollied''.

There are a number of words that contain a string of four consecutive letters of the alphabet. The commonest combination is ''rstu'', with most examples having the prefix ''under-'', ''over-'' or ''super-'' (e.g. ''understudy'', ''overstuff'', ''superstud''). Words with the combination ''mnop'' include ''cremnophobia'' (a fear of steep slopes), ''gymnopaedic'' (of birds, having unfeathered young), ''limnophilous'' (marsh-loving) and ''[[Prumnopitys]]'' (a genus of conifers). ''[[Chelmno]]'', a town in Poland, has the unusual combination ''lmno''.

===Palindromes===
:''See main articles [[Palindrome]] and [[Semordnilap]].''

===First and last words by reversed spelling===

In a dictionary that lists the reversed spellings of words alphabetically, some of the first entries (excluding proper names) would be:

*''a'' (=''a'', the indefinite article)
*''aa'' (=''aa'', a type of lava)
*''aab'' (=''baa'', the sound made by a sheep)
*''aahc'' (=''chaa'', a variant of ''char'', British slang for tea)
*''aakkram'' (=''markkaa'', plural of ''[[markka]]'', a former Finnish unit of currency)
*''aam'' (=''maa'', a dialect word for a seagull)
*''aamaju'' (=''Ujamaa'', a political system in East Africa)
*''aaupaukunukunumuhumuh'' (=''[[humuhumunukunukuapuaa]]'', a type of Hawaiian fish)
*...

Some proper names would appear earlier: ''aabbirem'' (=''Meribbaa'', a Biblical name); ''aabmup'' (=''[[Pumbaa]]''); ''aabre'' (=''Erbaa'', a town in Turkey); ''aacisuan'' (=''[[Nausicaa]]''); ''aaemu'' (=''[[Umeaa]]''); ''aagsin'' (=''[[Nisga'a]]'').

The first entries that correspond to common words (including some proper names) would be, in normal letter order, ''casaba'', ''Abba'', ''Sheba'', ''amoeba'', ''[[Toshiba]]'', ''[[Elba]]'', ''melba'', ''mamba'', ''samba''.

The last few entries all come from words ending ''-uzz'', including:

*''zzuh'' (=''huzz'', to buzz or murmur)
*''zzuks'' (=''skuzz'', variant of ''scuzz'')
*''zzul'' (=''luzz'', British slang, meaning to chuck)
*''zzum'' (=''muzz'', British slang, meaning to confuse)
*''zzurf'' (=''fruzz'', to brush hair the wrong way)

===First and last words in anagram dictionary===

Suppose that, in a dictionary of anagrams, the letters of each word are sorted into alphabetical order (for example, &quot;alphabet&quot; becomes &quot;aabehlpt&quot;), and then the resulting strings are themselves sorted alphabetically. After the usual culprits ''a'' and ''aa'', some of the first few words in the dictionary (including only the singular form of nouns) would be:

*''aaaaaacceglllnorst'' (=''astragalocalcaneal'')
*''aaaaaaccegllnorrst'' (=''calcaneoastragalar'')
*''aaaaaalmrsstt'' (=''[[taramasalata]]'', a fish roe paste)
*''aaaaaannrstyy'' (=''Satyanarayana'', another name for [[Vishnu]])
*''aaaaabbcdrr'' (=''[[abracadabra]]'', a word said when performing a magic trick)

The end of the list might appear something like:

*''utx'' (=''tux'', contraction of ''tuxedo'', a dinner jacket)
*''uty'' (=''Tuy'', a city in Spain)
*''uw'' (=''[[Wu (linguistics)|Wu]]'', a Chinese dialect (and region))
*''ux'' (=''xu'', a Vietnamese unit of currency)
*''uy'' (=''yu'', Chinese jade)
*''uz'' (=''Zu'', a Sumerian god)
*''uzz'' (=''zuz'', an ancient Hebrew coin)

== Pairs and groups of words ==

===Homophones===

''[[Sheep|Ewe]]'' and ''[[you]]'' are a pair of words with identical pronunciations that have no letters in common.  Another example is the pair ''[[eye]]'' and ''[[I]]''.  However, such word pairs are often dependent on the accent of the speaker.  For instance, Americans might well believe that ''[[a]]'' and ''[[eh]]'' form such a pair whereas other English speakers might not.

See also [[Homophone]], [[List of homophones]] and [[List of commonly confused homonyms]].

=== Homographs ===

[[Homograph]]s are words with identical spellings but different meanings. A famous example is the town of ''[[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]'' (pronounced to rhyme with ''threading'') vs. the gerund ''reading'', as in reading a book (pronounced to rhyme with ''feeding'').  At one time the bookseller [[Blackwell's]] had a branch in Reading, signed &quot;Blackwells Reading Book Shop&quot;, in which either pronunciation made sense. 

See also [[List of English homographs]].

=== Self-antonymns ===

''Main article: [[Auto-antonym]].''

A few English words have such disparate definitions that one meaning is the opposite of another. These are called &quot;self-antonyms&quot;, &quot;auto-antonyms&quot; or &quot;contronyms&quot;. Examples include ''cleave'' or ''clip'' (joining things together or taking them apart), ''fast'' (move quickly or fix in one spot), ''enjoin'' (to cause something to be done, to forbid something from being done), and ''inflammable'' (able to be burned or fire-proof).

===Sequences of words formed by the addition of letters===

The nine-word sequence ''I'', ''in'', ''sin'', ''sing'', ''sting'', ''string'', ''staring'', ''starting'' (or ''starling''), ''startling'' can be formed by successively adding one letter to the previous word. 
There are a number of other nine-word sequences that use only common words, and numerous shorter sequences, such as the seven-word ''a'', ''at'', ''rat'', ''rate'', ''irate'', ''pirate'', ''pirates''.

If rare words, proper names and/or obsolete words are allowed then sequences of at least eleven words are possible. One example is: ''a'', ''ma'' (mother), ''mac'' (raincoat, British), ''[[mace (spice)|mace]]'' (spice), ''[[macle]]'' (mineral), ''[[macule]]'' (skin spot), ''maculae'' (plural of ''macula'', variant of ''macule''), ''maculate'' (blotchy), ''masculate'' (to make strong, obsolete), ''emasculate'', ''emasculated''. 

''Al'', ''Ala'', ''Alan'', and ''Alana'' is a sequence consisting only of first names.

A seven-word sequence in which letters are added to the ''end'' of the previous word is: ''ma'', ''max'' (used in phrases such as ''to the max''), ''maxi'' (a long skirt), ''maxim'', ''maxima'' (plural of ''[[maximum]]''), ''maximal'', ''maximals'' (plural of ''[[maximal]]'', used as noun in mathematics). An eight-word sequence including proper nouns is: ''ta'' (thanks, British), ''tam'' (Scottish cap), ''[[Tama]]'' (asteroid), ''[[Tamar]]'' (English river), ''[[tamari]]'' (soy sauce), ''[[tamarin]]'' (monkey), ''[[tamarind]]'' (tree), ''tamarinds'' (plural).

The one-syllable word ''are'', with the addition of one letter, becomes ''[[area]]'', a word with three syllables.

A six-word sequence in which letters are added to the ''beginning'' of the words is: ''hes'' (plural of ''he'', used as a noun to mean a male), ''shes'' (plural of ''she''), ''ashes'', ''lashes'', ''plashes'' (plural of ''plash'', a splashing sound), ''splashes''.

===&quot;ough&quot; words===

The most notorious group of letters in the English language, ''ough'', is commonly pronounced at least ten different ways. Ough is in fact a word in its own right; it is an exclamation of disgust similar to &quot;ugh&quot;.

The original pronunciation in all cases was the last one.  However the ''kh'' sound has disappeared from most modern English dialects.  As it faded, different speakers replaced it by different near equivalents in different words.  Thus the present confusion resulted.

The two &quot;ough&quot;s in the English place name [[Loughborough]] are pronounced differently, resulting in ''Luffburruh''.

''Tough'', ''though'', ''through'', and ''thorough'' are formed by adding an additional letter each time, yet none of them rhymes with another.

== Long words ==
''Main article: [[Longest word in English]].''

''[[Antidisestablishmentarianism]]'' listed in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', was considered the longest English word for quite a long time, but today the medical term ''[[Longest word in English#A coined term | pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis]]'' is usually considered to have the title, despite the fact that it was coined to provide an answer to the question 'What is the longest English word?'. 

The ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'', in its [[1992]] and subsequent editions, declared the &quot;longest real word&quot; in the English language to be '''[[floccinaucinihilipilification]]''' at 29 letters. Defined as ''the act of estimating (something) as worthless'', its usage has been recorded as far back as [[1741]].

[[Chemical nomenclature]] of [[organic compound]]s and especially [[protein]]s can easily beat any record, as offical nomenclature rules lead to legitimate names thousands of letters long.

=== Longest one-syllable word ===
''Main article: [[List of the longest English words with one syllable]].''

The longest one-[[syllable]] word in the English language is either ''squirrelled'', ''scraunched'', or one of several 9-letter words. The first two words may be pronounced using more than one syllable in some [[accent]]s.  ''Rhythmlessly'' is the longest with only one [[vowel]].

== Unrhymable words ==
In the most common form of [[rhyme]], words rhyme if they end in identically or nearly-identically sounding syllables, and match in stress. If a word has an unusual or unique ending syllable and no other word has a [[stress pattern]] to match, it does not rhyme. Excluding disputed loan words, whose foreign sounds make them obviously difficult, unrhymable English words include ''chimney'', ''depth'', ''month'', ''orange'', ''pint'', ''purple'', and ''wasp''. Of these, ''[[orange (word)|orange]]'' is arguably the one most famous for being unrhymable.

''Silver'' is commonly considered unrhymable, however it rhymes with [[chilver]], a young fish.

Note that some words rhyme if we allow prefixed derivatives of them (like ''empurple'' or ''desilver''), but this is not commonly considered proper rhyme.

The most common way to concoct a &quot;rhyme&quot; for such words &amp;mdash; usually in humorous poetry &amp;mdash; is to rhyme it with the first syllable of a word that is split over two lines. An example is rhyming ''orange'' with ''car eng/ine'', noted by [[Douglas Hofstadter]]. Likewise, [[Stephen Sondheim]] rhymed ''silver'' with &quot;will, ver-/bosity, and time&quot;, and [[Willard R. Espy]] managed the couplet &quot;I might distil Ver-/ona's silver&quot;. On a similar note, ''orange'' has been rhymed with &quot;door hinge&quot;.

== Words with large numbers of meanings ==
Scanning the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' reveals an astounding 76 definitions of the word ''run''. The top five words with large numbers of meanings are:
# ''[[run]]'' (76)
# ''[[Set_(disambiguation)|set]]'' (63)
# ''[[point]]'' (49)
# ''[[strike]]'' (48)
# ''[[light]]'' (47)

==Acronyms as words ==

Some acronyms have attained the status of words. Many are company names  that were either deliberately created for marketing reasons or have morphed from true acronyms over time, such as [[Compaq]], a computer company; [[Qantas]], an Australian airline; and [[Nasdaq]], the US electronic stock market. Others are organizations, such as [[Nato]], the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (spelled with all capital letters in the U.S.). 

Other examples include [[qwerty]] &amp;ndash; the name of the most common keyboard layout, [[WYSIWYG]], pronounced 'Wizzywig', describing a computer program which displays accurate previews of work.

==Typewriter words==

The longest words spelt solely with the left hand when typing properly using a [[QWERTY]] keyboard may be the 14-letter ''[[aftercataract]]s'' (secondary cataracts of the eye) and ''sweaterdresses'' (plural of ''[[sweaterdress]]'', a knitted dress). The longest common words are the 12-letter ''desegregated'', ''desegregates'', ''reverberated'', ''reverberates'' and ''stewardesses''.

The 13-letter chemical name ''[[phyllophyllin]]'' can be typed solely with the right hand. The longest such word that is reasonably common is the 9-letter ''[[polyphony]]''.

Common words of ten letters that can be spelled solely with the top line of letters on a [[QWERTY]] keyboard include ''perpetuity'', ''proprietor'', ''repertoire'' and, fittingly, ''[[typewriter]]''. There are at least two eleven-letter words, both rare: ''proterotype'' and ''[[rupturewort]]''.

The eight-letter words ''ashfalls'', ''Falashas'', ''[[Hadassah]]'', ''[[Haggadah]]'' and ''[[Haskalah]]'' can all be typed on the middle row of letters on the keyboard. The longest such common word is probably the seven-letter ''[[alfalfa]]''.

'''Eric Steven Raymond''' (born [[December 4]], [[1957]]), often referred to as '''ESR''', is the author of &quot;[[The Cathedral and the Bazaar]]&quot; and the present maintainer of the &quot;[[Jargon File]]&quot; (also known as &quot;The New Hacker's Dictionary&quot;). Though the Jargon File established his original reputation within [[hacker culture]], after [[1997]] he became a figure in the [[open source movement]], and is today one of its most controversial characters.

Raymond is an avowed [[libertarian]]. He is known to have strong interests in [[science fiction]] and [[firearms]], is an enthusiastic amateur musician, and claims to have a black belt in [[taekwondo]]. His advocacy of [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] gun rights and support for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] has nettled many, but he seems to enjoy the controversy those positions engender.{{ref|dancingwithgods}}  Raymond suffers from a mild form of congenital [[cerebral palsy]].

== Hacker ==
Born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in [[1957]], Raymond lived on three continents before settling in [[Pennsylvania]] in [[1971]]. His involvement with hacker culture began in [[1976]] and he contributed to his first [[open source software]] project in [[1982]]. Since then, his primary contribution to open source software has been maintaining the [[fetchmail]] email client. Minor contributions have included [[Emacs]] editing modes and portions of libraries like [[ncurses|GNU ncurses]], giflib/libungif, and [[libpng]]. He has also written a number of [[How-to]] documents that are now included in the [[Linux Documentation Project]] corpus.
Raymond's public claim to be a &quot;Core Linux Developer&quot; has been disputed since he has never had code accepted into the Linux kernel. His sole attempt to contribute to Linux (the [[Configuration Menu Language|CML2]] configuration system) was rejected by [[Linux kernel]] developers.
[http://kerneltrap.org/node/view/17][http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-ivesr.html?ca=dgr-lnxw09EricRaymond][http://kerneltrap.org/node/view/340]

Raymond initially became known by hackers for his adoption of the [[Jargon File]]. Some have become dissatisfied with the resulting character of the work due to the inclusion of material invented by Raymond or reflecting his own political views. Objectors to Raymond's stewardship are of the opinion that the Jargon File should be an impartial record of &quot;hacker culture&quot;.[http://slashdot.org/articles/03/06/08/1534249.shtml]

== &quot;Open source&quot; ==
Raymond coined the [[aphorism]] &quot;Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.&quot; He credits [[Linus Torvalds]] with the inspiration for this quotation, which he dubs &quot;[[Linus's law]]&quot;. The quotation appears in ''[[The Cathedral and the Bazaar|The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary]]'', Sebastopol, California: O'Reilly &amp; Associates.[http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html]  In 1997, Raymond became a prominent voice in the open source movement and was a co-founder of the [[Open Source Initiative]]. He also took on the self-appointed role of ambassador of [[open source]] to the press, business and public.  The release of the [[Mozilla]] (then [[Netscape (web browser)|Netscape]]) source code in [[1998]] was an early accomplishment.  He has agreed to lecture at [[Microsoft]] [http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB19990615S0032], has accepted stock options from [[VA Software]] to provide credibility to the company and act as a hired &quot;corporate conscience&quot;[http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=1999-12-10-001-05-NW-LF] [http://lwn.net/2001/0222/a/esr-hard-times.php3] and has spoken in more than fifteen countries on six continents.

Raymond has had a number of public disputes with other figures in the free software movement. His disagreement with [[Richard Stallman]] and the [[Free Software Foundation]]'s views on the ethics of free software in favour of a more market-driven stance has exacerbated some pre-existing tensions in the community. In 1999, Raymond published an article entitled &quot;Shut Up And Show Them The Code&quot;[http://linuxtoday.com/stories/7196.html#talkback_area].  The article criticized [[Richard Stallman]] over tactics to promote free and [[open source]] software, implying Stallman spent too much time proselytizing and not producing code. Stallman is the original author of some of the most widely used and sophisticated pieces of free software in the world, including [[EMACS|Emacs]], [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]], [[GNU Debugger|GDB]], and [[Make|GNU Make]].

Raymond addressed some of his critics from the software development community in his 1999 essay &quot;Take My Job, Please!&quot; [http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/take-my-job-please.html], stating that he was willing to &quot;back to the hilt&quot; anyone qualified and willing to take his job and present the case for open source to the world. In February 2005, Raymond stepped down as the president of the [[Open Source Initiative]].

== Commentator ==
Raymond is a prolific writer of political and technical opinion pieces through his website and blog.  Since the summer of 2003, Raymond has used his [[web log]][http://esr.ibiblio.org/] to promote his views on politics, race and the Iraq war. Controversial opinions he has attempted to defend include that African Americans are responsible for a disproportionate percentage of crimes because they have lower [[IQ]]s [http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=129], and that the United States should embark on a campaign of &quot;deliberate cultural genocide&quot; against the Islamic world

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''European Telecommunications Standards Institute''' ('''ETSI''') is an independent, non-profit, [[standardization]] organization of the [[telecommunication]]s industry (equipment makers and network operators) in [[Europe]], with worldwide projection.  ETSI has been successful in standarier [[periphrasis|periphrases]] for excretion used to excuse oneself from company, such as to ''powder one's nose'' or to ''[[see a man about a horse]]'' (or ''dog''). Slang expressions which are neither particularly euphemistic nor [[dysphemistic]], such as ''take a leak'', form a separate category.

===Sexual euphemisms===

The Latin term ''pudendum'' and the Greek term ''αιδοίον'' (''aidoion'') for the genitals literally mean &quot;shameful thing&quot;. ''Groin'' and ''crotch'' refer to a larger region of the body, but are euphemistic when used to refer to the genitals. Euphemisms are more common in reference to sexual practices or orientations, particularly non-heterosexual ones, as shown in this quote from the UK version of ''[[Queer as Folk (UK)|Queer as Folk]]'', which includes both euphemisms and dysphemisms regarding male homosexuality:

:Because I'm queer I'm gay I'm homosexual I'm a poof I'm a poofta I'm a ponse I'm a bum boy batty boy backside artist bugger I'm bent, I am that arse bandit, I lift those shirts, I'm a faggot-assed fudgepackin' shitstabbin' uphill gardener I dine at the downstairs restaurant I dance at the other end of the ballroom I'm Moses and the parting of the red cheeks I fuck and am fucked, I suck and am sucked, I rim them and wank them and every single man has had the fucking time of his life, and I'm not a pervert.

Virtually all other [[sexual slang|sexual terms]] are still considered profane and unacceptable for use even in a euphemistic sense.

==Euphemisms for death==

The English language contains numerous euphemisms related to dying, [[death]], [[burial]], and the people and places which deal with death. The practice of using euphemisms for death is likely to have originated with the [[Magical thinking|&quot;magical&quot;]] belief that to speak the word 'death' was to invite death (where to &quot;draw Death's attention&quot; is the ultimate bad-fortune -- a common theory holds that death is a taboo subject in most English-speaking cultures for precisely this reason).
It may be said that one is not dying, but ''fading quickly'' because ''the end is near''. People who have died are referred to as having ''passed away'' or ''passed'' or ''departed''. ''Deceased'' is a euphemism for 'dead', and sometimes the ''deceased'' is said to have ''gone to a better place'', but this is used primarily among the religious with a concept of [[heaven]].

There are many euphemisms for the dead body, some polite and some profane, as well as [[dysphemism]]s such as ''worm food'', or ''dead meat''. The corpse was once referred to as ''the shroud (or house or tenement) of clay'', and modern funerary workers use terms such as ''the loved one'' (title of a [[novel]] about [[Hollywood]] undertakers by [[Evelyn Waugh]]) or ''the dearly departed''. (They themselves have given up the euphemism ''funeral director'' for ''grief therapist'', and hold ''arrangement conferences'' with relatives.) Among themselves, mortuary technicians often refer to the corpse as the ''client''.

Contemporary euphemisms and dysphemisms for death tend to be quite colorful, and someone who has died is said to have ''passed away'', ''passed on'', ''bit the big one'', ''bought the farm'', ''croaked'', ''given up the ghost'' (originally a more respectful term), ''kicked the bucket'', ''gone south'', ''tits up'', ''shuffled off this mortal coil'' (from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]''), or ''assumed room temperature''.  When buried, they may be said to be ''pushing up daisies'' or ''taking a dirt nap'' or ''six feet under''.  There are hundreds of such expressions in use. (Old [[Burma-Shave]] jingle: &quot;If daisies are your favorite flower, keep pushin' up those miles per hour!&quot;)

Euthanasia also attracts euphemisms.  One may ''put him out of his misery'', ''put him to sleep'', or ''have him put down'', the latter phrases being used primarily with non-humans.

There are a few euphemisms for killing which are neither respectful nor playful, but rather clinical and detached.  Some examples of this type are ''terminate'', ''wet work'', to ''take care of'' one or to ''take them for a ride'', to ''do them in'', to ''off'', ''frag'', ''smoke'', ''whack'' or ''waste'' someone. To ''cut loose'' (from U.S. Sgt. Massey's account of activities during the American occupation of Iraq) or ''open up'' on someone, means 'to shoot at with every weapon available'.

The [[Dead Parrot|Dead Parrot Sketch]] from [[Monty Python's Flying Circus]] contains an extensive list of euphemisms for death, referring to the deceased parrot that the character played by [[John Cleese]] purchases (the sketch has led to another euphemism for death: &quot;pining for the fjords&quot;, although in the sketch it was used by the shop owner to mean the parrot was ''not'' dead, but was merely quiet and contemplative).  A similar passage occurs near the beginning of ''[[The Twelve Chairs]]'', where Bezenchuk, the undertaker, astonishes Vorobyaninov with his classification of people by the euphemisms used to speak of their deaths.

==Doublespeak==

What distinguishes [[doublespeak]] from other euphemisms is its deliberate usage by governmental, military, or corporate institutions. Doublespeak is in turn distinguished from [[jargon]] in that doublespeak attempts to confuse and conceal the truth, while jargon often provides greater precision to those that understand it (while inadvertently confusing those who do not).  An example of the distinction is the use by the military of the word ''casualties'' instead of ''deaths'' &amp;mdash; what may appear to be an attempt to hide the fact that people have been killed is actually a precise way of saying &quot;personnel who have been rendered incapable of fighting, whether by being killed, being badly wounded, psychologically damaged, incapacitated by disease, rendered ineffective by having essential equipment destroyed, or disabled in any other way.&quot;  &quot;Casualties&quot; is used instead of &quot;deaths,&quot; not for propagandistic or squeamish reasons, but because most casualties are not dead, but nevertheless useless for waging war.

Proper examples of doublespeak included ''taking friendly fire'' as a euphemism for being attacked by your own troops.

Commentators such as [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[George Orwell]] have written at length about the dangers of allowing such euphemisms to shape public perceptions and national policy.

Violent countercultural groups and their apologists have doublespeak of their own, such as replacing &quot;sabotage&quot; and &quot;vandalism&quot; with &quot;direct action.&quot;

==Common examples==

Other common euphemisms include:
* ''restroom'' for ''[[toilet]] room'' (the word ''toilet'' was itself originally a euphemism). This is an [[Americanism (general)|Americanism]].  
* ''making love to'', ''getting it on'', ''doing it'', or ''sleeping with'' for ''having sexual intercourse with''
* ''motion discomfort bag'' and ''air-sickness bag'' for ''vomit bag'' or ''barf bag''
* ''sanitary landfill'' for ''garbage dump'' (and a temporary garbage dump is a ''transfer station'')
*''pre-owned vehicles'' for ''used cars''
* ''the big C'' for ''cancer'' (in addition, some people whisper the word when they say it in public, and doctors have euphemisms to use in front of patients, e.g. &quot;c.a.&quot;)
* ''bathroom tissue'', ''t.p.'', or ''bath tissue'' for [[toilet paper]] (Usually used by toilet paper manufacturers)
* ''[[custodian]]'' for ''[[janitor]]'' (also originally a euphemism&lt;!-- for shit cleaner --&gt;&amp;mdash;in Latin, it means ''doorman''.)
* ''sanitation worker'' (or, sarcastically, ''sanitation engineer'') for &quot;garbage man&quot; (also known as ''dustman'' in the U.K.)
* ''Where can I wash my hands?'' or ''Where can I powder my nose?'' for ''Where can I find a toilet?''. (This is also an [[Americanism]]. If this question is asked in Europe to someone not used to American habits the person who asks the question might actually end up at a place where there is only a washbasin and not at a place equipped according to their needs.)

These lists might suggest that most euphemisms are well-known expressions.  Often euphemisms can be somewhat situational; what might be used as a euphemism in a conversation between two friends might make no sense to a third person.  In this case, the euphemism is being used as a type of [[innuendo]].  As an example, in the [[television]] series ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', the Banks family (who are black) discuss Hilary's new boyfriend, who happens to be white, using ''tall'' as a euphemism for ''white''.  Will, who apparently doesn't catch on, remarks that he is the only one who seems to notice the new boyfriend is white.

The inflation of occupational titles is similar to the euphemism treadmill. For instance, the [[engineering]] professions have traditionally resisted the tendency by other technical trades to appropriate the prestige of the title ''engineer''. Most people calling themselves ''[[software engineering|software engineers]]'' or ''network engineers'' are not, in fact, accredited in engineering. Extreme cases, such as ''sanitation engineer'' for ''janitor'' are cited humorously more often than they are used seriously.

In the [[television]] [[cartoon]] series &quot;[[The Flintstones]]&quot;, Fred takes a job as the live-in [[janitor|superintendent]] of a large apartment building and is given a title using the word ''engineer'' to make his job sound more important than it actually is.  As he and his wife are moving in, a policeman is about to write him a [[parking ticket]] for being illegally parked in front of the building.  He informs the officer that he is (as the building's owner referred to him) the &quot;''Resident Stationary Engineer''&quot; for the building.  The cop turns to him and says, &quot;I don't care if you ''are'' the janitor, move this car now!&quot;

Less extreme cases, such as ''custodian'' for ''[[janitor]]'', are considered more terms of respect than euphemisms.

The word euphemism itself can be used as a euphemism.  In the animated short ''It's Grinch Night'' (See [[Dr. Seuss]]), a child asks to go to the ''euphemism'', where ''euphemism'' is being used as a euphemism for ''[[outhouse]]''. This euphemistic use of &quot;euphemism&quot; originally occurred in the play ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' where a character requests, &quot;Martha, will you show her where we keep the, uh, euphemism?&quot;.  It is analogous to the 18th-century use of ''unmentionables'' for ''underpants''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:EdmundSpenser.jpg|right|framed|Edmund Spenser]]

'''Edmund Spenser''' (c. [[1552]] - [[13 January]], [[1599]]) was an [[England|English]] [[poet]] and [[Poet Laureate]]. Spenser is a controversial figure due to his zeal for the destruction of the [[Culture of Ireland|Irish culture]].       

==Life==

Spenser was born circa 1552, and educated in London at the [[Merchant Taylors' School]]. He went to [[Ireland]] in the 1570s, during the [[Elizabethan]]  re-conquest of the country, to acquire land and wealth there. 

From 1579 to 1580, he served with the English forces during the second of the [[Desmond Rebellions]], and afterwards was awarded lands in [[Cork]] that had been confiscated from the rebels in the [[Plantations_of_Ireland#The_Munster_Plantation|Munster Plantation]]. Amongst his acquaintances in the area was [[Walter Raleigh]] who, like Spenser, had been granted land in [[Munster]]. 

In the early [[1590s]] he wrote a prose pamphlet titled, ''A View on the Present State of Ireland''. This piece has become quite famous since it was published in the mid [[seventeenth century]], although it was not published in Spenser's lifetime, being thought too inflammatory. The pamphlet argued [[Ireland]] would never be totally 'pacified' until its indigenous language and customs had been destroyed, if necessary by violence. 

He recommended using scorched earth tactics, such as he had seen used in the Desmond Rebellions, to create famine. Although it has been highly regarded as a polemical piece of prose and valued as a historical source on [[16th century]] Ireland, the &quot;View&quot; is seen today as [[genocidal]] in intent. He also siphoned Ireland's Celtic tradition for poetic source material. Spenser was driven from his home by Irish rebels during the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]] in 1598. He died in 1599, aged approximately 46.

==Poetry==

The first poem to earn Spenser notability was a collection of [[eclogues]] called ''[[The Shepheardes Calendar]],'' written from the point of view of various [[shepherds]] throughout the months of the year. The poem is an allegory symbolizing the state of humanity.  The diversity of forms and meters, ranging from accentual-syllabic to purely accentual, and including such departures as the [[sestina]] in &quot;August,&quot; gave Spenser's contemporaries a clue to the range of his powers and won him praise in his day.

''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' is his major contribution to English [[poetry]]. The poem is a long, dense [[allegory]], in the [[Epic poetry|epic]] form, of [[Christianity|Christian]] virtues, tied into [[England]]'s [[mythology]] of [[King Arthur]].  

Spenser intended to complete twelve books of the poem, but managed only six before his death. The work remains the longest epic poem in the English language, and has inspired writers from [[John Milton]] and [[John Keats]] through [[James Joyce]] and [[Ezra Pound]]. He devised a verse form for ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' that has come to be known as the &quot;[[Spenserian stanza]],&quot; and which has since been applied in poetry by the likes of [[William Wordsworth]], [[John Keats]], and [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]].

The language of his poetry is purposely archaic. It reminds readers of earlier works as ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], whom Spenser greatly admired. Spenser's '''Epithalamion''' is the most admired of its type in the English language. It was written for his wedding to his young bride, Elizabeth Boyle. Spenser is often overshadowed by  [[William Shakespeare]]. For a modern take at Spenser, see Camille Paglia's [[Sexual Personae]].

'''Poetic Extracts'''

''Faerie Queene. Book v. Proem. St. 3.''

:Let none then blame me, if in discipline
:Of vertue and of civill uses lore,
:I doe not forme them to the common line
:Of present dayes, which are corrupted sore,
:But to the antique use which was of yore,
:When good was onely for it selfe desyred,
:And all men sought their owne, and none no more;
:When Justice was not for most meed out-hyred,
:But simple Truth did rayne, and was of all admyred.

''Faerie Queene. Book iii. Canto xi. St. 54.''

:And as she lookt about, she did behold,
:How over that same dore was likewise writ,
:Be bold, be bold, and every where be bold,
:That much she muz'd, yet could not construe it
:By any ridling skill, or commune wit.
:At last she spyde at that roomes upper end,
:Another yron dore, on which was writ,
:Be not too bold; whereto though she did bend
:Her earnest mind, yet wist not what it might intend.

==Trivia==
*''Blatant Beast'' was a phrase Spenser coined for the ignorant, slanderous, clamour of the mob. However, the Blatant Beast from ''The Faerie Queene'' is clearly shown to indicate slander in general, and a large part of the final complete book (Book VI, although the Blatant Beast first appears towards the end of Book V) is showing how thoroughly the Blatant Beast ravages the world, first spreading from the Court (not the villages or slums) and causing havoc everywhere it goes until it even penetrates into the monestaries and causes great distress there. Only Calidore, the most courteous of knights, was able to tame, chain, and imprison the Blatant Beast, which eventually would break free and, as ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' concludes by saying, still ravages the world today since only two Arthurian knights ever even came close to doing what Calidore did and even ''The Faerie Queene'', the text asserts, shall become a target for the Blatant Beast.

      <comment>/* The Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám of Naishápur */ +moving finger</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Edward Marlborough FitzGerald''' ([[March 31]], [[1809]]&amp;ndash;[[June 14]], [[1883]]) was an [[England|English]] [[writer]], best known as the [[poet]] of the first and most famous English translation of [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám]].

He was born '''Edward Purcell''', at [[Bredfield House]] in [[Suffolk]].  His father, John Purcell, assumed in 1818 the name and arms of his wife's family, the FitzGeralds. From 1816 the family lived at [[St Germain]] and at [[Paris]], but in 1821 Edward was sent to school at [[Bury St Edmunds]]. In [[1826]] he went to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he joined the [[Cambridge Apostles]]. He became acquainted with [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] and [[William Hepworth Thompson]]. His friendship with [[Alfred Tennyson]], also an Apostle, began in about 1835. In 1830 FitzGerald left for Paris, but in 1831 was living in a farm-house on the [[Battle of Naseby|battlefield of Naseby]].

With no employment, FitzGerald lived quietly, moving to his native county of Suffolk, and never again leaving it for more than a week or two. Until 1835 the FitzGeralds lived at Wherstead; from that year until 1853 the poet resided at Boulge, near [[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge]]; until 1860 at [[Farlingay Hall]]; until 1873 in the town of Woodbridge; and then until his death at his own house close by, called Little Grange.  During most of this time FitzGerald was preoccupied with flowers, music and literature. He allowed friends like Tennyson and Thackeray to surpass him, and for a long time showed no intention of emulating their literary success. In [[1851]] he published his first book, ''Euphranor'', a [[Plato]]nic dialogue, born of memories of the old happy life at Cambridge. In 1852 he published ''Polonius'', a collection of &quot;saws and modern instances&quot;, some of them his own, the rest borrowed from the less familiar English classics. FitzGerald began the study of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] poetry in 1850 at [[Elmsett]] and that of [[Persian language|Persian]] at the [[University of Oxford]] with Professor [[Edward Byles Cowell]] in 1853. In middle life, he married Lucy, the daughter of [[Bernard Barton]], the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] poet. 

In [[1853]], he issued ''Six Dramas of Calderon'', freely translated. He now turned to Oriental studies, and in [[1856]] he anonymously published a version of the ''Sálamán'' and ''Absál'' of Jámi in [[John Milton|Miltonic]] verse. In March [[1857]] Cowell discovered a set of Persian quatrains by [[Omar Khayyám]] in the [[Asiatic Society]] library, [[Calcutta]], and sent them to FitzGerald. At this time the name with which he has been so closely identified first occurs in FitzGerald's correspondence--&quot;Hafiz and [[Omar Khayyám]] ring like true metal.&quot; On [[January 15]] [[1859]] a little anonymous pamphlet was published as ''The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam''. In the world at large, and in the circle of FitzGerald's particular friends, the poem seems at first to have attracted no attention. The publisher allowed it to gravitate to the fourpenny or even (as he afterwards boasted) to the penny box on the bookstalls.

But in [[1860]] [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]] discovered it, and [[Algernon Swinburne|Swinburne]] and Lord Houghton quickly followed. The ''Rubaiyat'' became slowly famous, but it was not until 1868 that FitzGerald was encouraged to print a second and greatly revised edition. Meanwhile he had produced in 1865 a version of the ''Agamemnon'', and two more plays from [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón]]. In 1880&amp;ndash;1881 he issued privately translations of the two [[Oedipus]] tragedies; his last publication was ''Readings'' in Crabbe, 1882. He left in manuscript a version of Attar's ''Mantic-Uttair'' under the title of ''The Bird Parliament''.

From [[1861]] onwards FitzGerald's greatest interest had been in the sea. In June 1863 he bought a [[yacht]], &quot;The Scandal,&quot; and in 1867 he became part-owner of a herring-lugger, the &quot;Meum and Tuum.&quot; For some years, till [[1871]], he spent the summer months &quot;knocking about somewhere outside of [[Lowestoft]].&quot; In this way, and among his books and flowers, FitzGerald gradually became an old man. He passed away painlessly in his sleep.  He was &quot;an idle fellow, but one whose friendships were more like loves.&quot; In [[1885]] his fame was increased by the f* [[Old Russian language]]&amp;nbsp;†

== Current status ==

All these languages are nowadays considered to be separate languages in their own right, though in the 19th century it was usual to call Ukrainian (&quot;Little Russian&quot;) and Belarusian (&quot;White Russian&quot;) dialects of one common &quot;Russian&quot; language (the most prestigious dialect of which was called &quot;Great Russian&quot;).  Despite the vast territory occupied by the East Slavs, their languages are astonishingly similar to one another, with transitional dialects in border regions.

All these languages use the [[Cyrillic]] [[alphabet]], but with particular modifications.

== History ==

When the common [[Old East Slavic language]] became separated from the ancient Slavic tongue common to all Slavs is difficult to ascertain ([[6th century|6th]]&amp;ndash;[[11th century]]).

The history of the East Slavic languages is a very 'hot' subject, because it is interpreted from various political perspectives by the East Slavs &quot;like all mortals, wishing to have an origin as ancient as possible&quot; (&quot;sicut ceteri mortalium, originem suam quam vetustissimam ostendere cupientes&quot;), as [[Pope Pius II|Aeneas Sylvius]] observed in his ''Historia Bohemica'' in [[1458]].

Therefore, a crucial differentiation has to be made between the history of the East Slavic ''dialects'' and that of the ''literary languages'' employed by the Eastern Slavs. Although most ancient texts betray the dialect their author(s) and/or scribe(s) spoke, it is also clearly visible that they tried to write in a language different from their dialects and to avoid those mistakes that enable us nowadays to locate them.

In both cases one has to keep in mind that the history of the East Slavic languages is of course a history of written [[text|texts]]. We do not know how the writers of the preserved texts would have spoken in every-day life, let alone how an illiterate East Slavic peasant spoke to his family.

What follows is a short overview over the Old and Middle periods. For more detail see [[Old East Slavic language]], [[Ruthenian language]], and [[History of the Russian language]].

After the conversion of the East Slavic region to Christianity the people used service books borrowed from [[Bulgaria]], which were written in &quot;Old Bulgarian&quot; or [[Old Church Slavonic]]. They continued to use this language, or rather a variant thereof, usually called (Middle) [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]], not only in liturgy, but also generally as the language of learning and written communication. This left a large imprint even on the rare secular texts.

Throughout the Middle Ages (and in some way up to the present day) there existed a duality between the Church Slavonic language used as some kind of 'higher' register (not only) in religious texts and the popular tongue used as a 'lower' register for secular texts. It has been suggested to describe this situation as [[diglossia]], although there do exist mixed texts where it is sometimes very hard to determine why a given author used a popular or a Church Slavonic form in a given context.

The first divergence among the Old East Slavic texts is evident during the [[12th century]], during the era of Kievan Rus', i.e. some texts can be linguistically located to areas that are now in Russia, Ukraine or Belarus. This leads many Russian scholars to speak of the existence of a separate [[Russian language]] as early as the [[12th century]].

'''Epicurus''' ('''Epikouros''' or '''Επικουρος''' in [[Greek language|Greek]]) (341 BC, [[Samos Island|Samos]] &amp;ndash; 270 BC, [[Athens]]) was an  [[Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosopher]], the founder of [[Epicureanism]], one of the most popular schools of [[Greek philosophy|Hellenistic Philosophy]].

==Biography==
{{Confusing}}
Epicurus was born into an Athenian émigré family &amp;mdash; his parents, Neocles and Chaerestrate, both Athenian citizens, were sent to an Athenian settlement on the Aegean island of [[Samos Island|Samos]]. According to Apollodorus (reported by Diogenes Laertius at X.14-15), he was born on the seventh day of the month [[Gamelion]] in the third year of the 109th [[Olympiad]], in the [[Archon|archonship]] of Sosigenes (about February 341 BC). He returned to Athens at the age of eighteen to serve in military training. The playwright [[Menander]] served in the same age-class of the ephebes as Epicurus.

He joined his father in [[Colophon]] after the Athenian settlers at Samos were expelled by [[Perdiccas]] due to their revolt after [[Alexander the Great]] died (c. 320 BC). He spent the next several years in Colophon, [[Lampsacus]], and [[Mytilene]], where he founded his school at the age of 32 and gathered many disciples.  In the archonship of Anaxicrates (307-306 BC), he returned to Athens where he formed his school known as The Garden, named for the garden he owned about halfway between the [[Stoa]] and the [[Academy]] that served as the school's meetingplace.

Epicurus died in the second year of the 127th Olympiad, in the archonship of Pytharatus, at the age of 72. He reportedly suffered from [[kidney stone|kidney stones]], and despite the prolonged pain involved, he is reported as saying in a letter to Idomeneus:

&quot;We have written this letter to you on a happy day to us, which is also the last day of our life. For strangury has attacked me, and also a dysentery, so violent that nothing can be added to the violence of my sufferings. But the cheerfulness of my mind, which arises from their collection of all my philosophical contemplation, counterbalances all these afflictions. And I beg you to take care of the children of Metrodorus, in a manner worth of the devotion shown by the youth to me, and to philosophy&quot; ([[Diogenes Laertius ]], X.22, trans. C.D. Yonge).

==The School==
Epicurus' school had a small but devoted following in his lifetime. The primary members were [[Hermarchus]], the financier [[Idomeneus of Lampsacus|Idomeneus]], [[Leonteus]] and his wife [[Themista]], the satirist [[Colotes]], the mathematician [[Polyaenus of Lampsacus]], and [[Metrodorus]], the most famous popularizer of Epicureanism. This original school was based in Epicurus' home and garden. An inscription on the gate to the garden is recorded by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] in his Epistle XXI:
:Stranger, here you will do well to tarry; here our highest good is pleasure.

The school's popularity grew and it became, along with [[Stoicism]] and [[Skepticism]], one of the three dominant schools of Hellenistic Philosophy, lasting strongly through the later [[Roman Empire]]. In Rome, [[Lucretius]] was the school's greatest proponent, composing [[On the Nature of Things]], an epic poem, in six books, designed to recruit new members. The poem mainly deals with Epicurean philosophy of nature. Another major source of information is the Roman politician and amateur philosopher [[Cicero]], although he was highly critical of Epicureanism. Another ancient source is [[Diogenes of Oenoanda]], who composed a large inscription at [[Oenoanda]] in [[Lycia]].

A library, dubbed the [[Villa of the Papyri]], in [[Herculaneum]], owned by [[Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar's]] father-in-law, [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus]], was preserved by the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in [[79 AD]], and was found to contain a large number of works by [[Philodemus]], a late Hellenistic Epicurean, and Epicurus himself, attesting to the school's enduring popularity. The task of unrolling and deciphering the charred papyrus scrolls continues today.

After the official approval of [[Christianity]] by [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]], Epicureanism was repressed. Epicurus' theory that the gods were unconcerned with human affairs had always clashed strongly with the Judeo-Christian God, and the philosophies were essentially irreconcilable. For example, the word for a heretic in the Talmudic literature is &quot;Apikouros&quot;.   [[Lactantius]] criticizes Epicurus at several points throughout his &lt;i&gt;Divine Institutes&lt;/i&gt;. The school endured a long period of obscurity and  decline. However, there was a resurgance of [[atomism]] among scientists in the [[18th Century|18th]] and [[19th Century|19th]] Centuries, and in the late 20th Century, the school was revived. A directory of contemporary followers of Epicurus can be found on gardenofepicurus.com.

==Teachings==
Epicurus' teachings represented a departure from the other major Greek thinkers of his period, and before, but was nevertheless founded on many of the same principles as [[Democritus]]. Like Democritus, he was an atomist, believing that the fundamental constituents of the world were uncuttable little bits of matter (atoms) flying through empty space (void). Everything that occurs is the result of the atoms colliding, rebounding, and becoming entangled with one another, with no purpose or plan behind their motions. 

He admitted women and slaves into his school, emphasized the senses in his [[epistemology]], and was one of the first Greeks to break from the god-fearing and god-worshipping tradition common at the time, even while affirming that religious activities are useful as a way to contemplate the gods and to use them as an example of the pleasant life.

Epicurus' philosophy is based on the theory that all good and bad derive from sensation.  Pleasureable sensations are good.  Painful sensations are bad.  Although Epicurus was commonly misunderstood to advocate the rampant pursuit of pleasure, what he was really after was the absence of pain (both physical and mental, i.e., anxiety). 

Although Epicurus believed in pursuing pleasure, he was by no means a hedonist in our modern sense of the word. He explicitly warned against overindulgence because it often leads to pain.  For instance, in what might be described as a &quot;hangover&quot; theory, Epicurus warned against pursuing love too ardently, as it often leads to pain. However, having a circle of friends you can trust is one of the most important means for securing a tranquil life.

Epicurus also believed (in contradistinction to [[Aristotle]]) that death was not bad.  According to Epicurus, good and bad derive from sensation.  Bad cannot exist without sensing pain.  When man is alive, he does not feel the pain of death because he is not experiencing death.  When a man dies, he does not feel the pain of death because he is dead and, since death is annihilation, he feels nothing.  Therefore, as Epicurus famously said, &quot;death is nothing to us.&quot; 

In contrast to the [[Stoics]], Epicureans showed little interest in participating in the politics of the day, since doing so leads to trouble. &quot;Live in seclusion!&quot; was the advice of Epicurus. His garden can be compared to  present day communes. There are many people in our own time who have sought a safe harbor away from society. 

The most known Epicurean verse, which epitomizes the Epicurean philosophy, is ''lathe bi&amp;#333;sas'' &amp;#955;&amp;#940;&amp;#952;&amp;#949; &amp;#946;&amp;#953;&amp;#974;&amp;#963;&amp;#945;&amp;#962; ([[Plutarchus]] ''De latenter vivendo'' 1128c; [[Flavius Philostratus]] ''Vita Apollonii'' 8.28.12), meaning &quot;live secretly&quot;, &quot;get through life without drawing attention to yourself&quot;, i. e. live  without pursuing glory or wealth or power, but anonymously, enjoying little things like food, the company of friends etc.

==Legacy==
Elements of Epicurean philosophy have resonated and resurfaced in various diverse thinkers and movements throughout Western intellectual history. The [[Problem of evil|Epicurean paradox]] is a famous argument against the existence of God.

Epicurus was one of the first thinkers to develop the notion of justice as a social contract. He defined justice as an agreement &quot;neither to harm nor be harmed.&quot; The point of living in a society with laws and punishments is to be protected from harm so that one is free to pursue happiness. Because of this, laws that do not help contribute to promoting human happiness are not just. 

This was later picked up by the democratic thinkers of the [[French Revolution]], and others, like [[John Locke]], who wrote that people had a right to &quot;life, liberty, and property.&quot;  To Locke, one's own body was part of their property, and thus one's right to property would theoretically guarantee safety for their persons, as well as their possessions.

This triad was carried forward into the American freedom movement and [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]], by American founding father, [[Thomas Jefferson]], as &quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&quot;

Epicurus was also a significant source of inspiration and interest for [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].  Nietzsche cites his affinities to Epicurus in a number of his works, including [[The Gay Science]], [[Beyond Good and Evil]], and his private letters to Peter Gast.  Nietzsche was attracted to, among other things, Epicurus' ability to maintain a cheerfuling system is highly irregular, but it is regular to some degree and mastery only requires knowledge of the 26 letters of the alphabet, whereas mastering written [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is much more difficult, requiring the memorization of thousands of different characters. Studies have shown that [[dyslexia]] occurs more often (or at least is more noticeable) among speakers of languages such as English whose orthography differs heavily from the phonology than speakers of languages where the letter-sound correspondence is more regular.

'''Ethelred the Unready''' (c. [[968]] &amp;ndash; [[April 23]], [[1016]]), also know as '''Ethelred II''' and ''Æðelred Unræd'' was [[Kingdom of England|King of England]] ([[978]] &amp;ndash; [[1013]], and [[1014]] &amp;ndash; [[1016]]).

==Early life and family==

According to [[William of Malmesbury]], Ethelred defecated in the [[baptismal font]] as a child, which led St. [[Dunstan]] to prophesy that the English monarchy would be overthrown during Ethelred's reign.  This story is, however, almost certainly a fabrication.

Ethelred succeeded to the throne aged about 10 following the death of his father [[Edgar of England|King Edgar]] and subsequent murder of his half-brother [[Edward the Martyr]].  His nickname &quot;The Unready&quot; does not mean that he was ill-prepared, but derives from the [[Anglo-Saxon]] ''unræd'' meaning &quot;without counsel&quot; or &quot;indecisive&quot;.   This could also be interpreted as a pun on his name, Æðelred, which may be understood to mean &quot;noble counsel&quot;.

Ethelred married firstly to Ælflaed, daughter of Thored, the [[ealdorman]] of [[Northumbria]]; she was the mother of four sons, including [[Edmund II of England|Edmund Ironside]]. In [[997]], he remarried to Ælfgifu, daughter of ealdorman Aethelberht, who gave him two sons, Edwig and Edgar. His third and final marriage, in [[1002]], was to [[Emma of Normandy]], whose grandnephew, [[William I of England]], would later use this relationship as the basis of his claim on the throne.

==Conflict with the Danes==

England had experienced a long period of peace after the reconquest of the [[Danelaw]] in the first half of the 10th Century.  However in [[991]] Ethelred was faced with a Viking fleet larger than any since Guthrum's &quot;Summer Army&quot; a century earlier.  This fleet was led by [[Olaf Trygvasson]], a Norwegian with ambitions to reclaim his country from Danish domination.  After initial military setbacks including the defeat of his Ealdorman [[Byrhtnoth]] at the [[Battle of Maldon]], Ethelred was able to come to terms with Olaf, who returned to [[Norway]] to gain his kingdom with mixed success.  While this arrangement won him some respite, England faced further depredations from [[Viking]] raids. Ethelred fought these off, but in many cases followed the practice of earlier kings including [[Alfred the Great]] in buying them off by payment of what was to become known as [[Danegeld]].

Ethelred ordered the massacre of the Danes living in England on [[St Brice]]'s Day ([[November 13]]) [[1002]] (as described in the chronicles of [[John of Wallingford]]), in response to which [[Sweyn Haraldsson]] started a series of determined campaigns to conquer England. In this he succeeded, but after his victory, he lived for only another five weeks.

==Death and legacy==

In 1013, Ethelred fled to [[Normandy]], seeking protection by his brother-in-law, [[Robert the Magnificent|Robert]] of Normandy, when England was over-run by [[Sweyn Haraldsson]] of Denmark and his forces. He returned in February, [[1014]], following the death of Sweyn Haraldsson. Ethelred died on [[April 23]], [[1016]], in [[London]], where he was buried.  He was succeeded by his son, [[Edmund II of England]].

Despite the steady stream of [[Viking]] attacks, Ethelred's reign was far from the disaster described by chroniclers writing well after the event.  Ethelred introduced major reforms to the machinery of government in Anglo-Saxon England, and is responsible for the introduction of Shire Reeves or [[Sheriff]]s.  The quality of the coinage, always a good indicator of the prevailing economic conditions, remained very high during his reign.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Edward_Elgar.jpg|right|frame|Sir Edward Elgar]]
'''Sir Edward Elgar, 1st Baronet''', [[Order of Merit|OM]], [[Royal Victorian Order|GCVO]] ([[2 June]] [[1857]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; [[23 February]] [[1934]]) was an [[England|English]] [[composer]].  His first [[orchestra]]l work, ''[[Enigma Variations]]'', was greeted with acclaim.  He also composed [[oratorio]]s, [[chamber music]], [[symphony|symphonies]] and instrumental [[concerto]]s.  His compositions also include the ''[[Pomp and Circumstance Marches]]'' of which No. 1 is often sung to the words &quot;[[Land of Hope and Glory]]&quot;, notably at The Last Night of [[the Proms]].  He was appointed [[Master of the King's Musick]] in 1924.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Edward William Elgar was born in the small village of [[Lower Broadheath]] outside [[Worcester]], [[Worcestershire]], to William Elgar, a [[piano]] tuner and [[music]] dealer, and his wife Ann.  The fourth of six children, Edward Elgar had three brothers, Henry, Frederick and Francis, and two sisters, Lucy and Susannah. His mother, Ann, had converted to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] shortly before Edward's birth, so Edward was baptised and brought up as a Roman Catholic.

Surrounded by sheet music and instruments in his father's shop in [[Worcester, England|Worcester]]'s High Street, the young Elgar became self-taught in music. On warm summer days, he would take manuscripts into the countryside to study them (he was a passionate and adventurous early [[bicycle|cyclist]] who learnt to cycle from the very early age of 5).  Thus there began for him a strong association between music and nature. As he was later to say, &quot;There is music in the air, music all around us, the world is full of it and you simply take as much as you require.&quot;

Having left school at the age of 15, he began work for a local [[solicitor]], but after a year embarked on a musical career, giving piano and violin lessons. At 22 he took up the post of bandmaster at the Worcester and County Lunatic Asylum in Powick, three miles south-west of Worcester. He composed here too; some of the pieces for the asylum orchestra (music in dance forms) were rediscovered and performed locally in 1996.

In many ways, his years as a young Worcestershire violinist were his happiest. He played in the first violins at the Worcester and Birmingham Festivals, and one great experience was to play [[Antonin Dvorak]]'s [[Symphony No. 6 (Dvorak)|Sixth Symphony]] and ''Stabat Mater'' under the composer's baton. Elgar was thrilled by Dvorak's orchestration and this remained an influence on his own style for more than a decade.

At 29, through his teaching, he met (Caroline) Alice Roberts, a Major-General's daughter (shades of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]) and an author of verse and prose fiction. He married her three years later against the wishes of her family, giving her as an engagement present the short [[violin]] and piano piece ''Salut d'amour''. The Elgars moved to [[London]] to be closer to the centre of British musical life, and Edward started composing in earnest. The stay was unsuccessful, however, and they were obliged to return to [[Great Malvern]], where Edward could earn a living teaching.

===Growing reputation===
During the 1890s Elgar gradually built up a reputation as a composer, chiefly of works for the great choral festivals of the [[Midlands]]. ''The Black Knight'','' King Olaf'' ([[1896]]), ''The Light of Life'' and ''[[Caractacus]]'' were all modestly successful and he obtained a long-standing publisher in Novello and Company.

In [[1899]], at the age of 42, his first major orchestral work, the ''[[Enigma Variations]]'', was premiered in London under the baton of the eminent German conductor [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]]. It was received with general acclaim, establishing Elgar as the pre-eminent British composer of his generation.  This work is formally titled ''Variations on an Original Theme (Enigma)''.  The enigma is that although there are thirteen variations on the &quot;original theme&quot;, the 'enigma' theme, which Elgar said 'runs through and over the whole set' is never heard. Many later commentators have observed that although Elgar is today regarded as a characteristically English composer, his orchestral music and this work in particular share much with the Central European tradition typified at the time by the work of [[Richard Strauss]]. Indeed, the ''Enigma Variations'' were well-received in Germany.

The [[1900|following year]] saw the production in [[Birmingham]] of his choral setting of [[John Henry Newman|Cardinal Newman's]] poem ''[[The Dream of Gerontius]]''. Despite a disastrous first performance, the work was established within a few years as one of Elgar's greatest, and it is now regarded as one of the finest examples of English choral music from any era.

Elgar is probably best known for the ''[[Pomp and Circumstance Marches]]'' ([[1901]]).  Shortly after their composition, Elgar was asked to set the first march to words by [[A C Benson]] as a Coronation [[Ode]] to mark the coronation of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]].  The suggestion had already been made (allegedly by the future King himself) that words should be fitted to the broad tune which formed the [[trio]] section of this march. Against the advice of his friends, Elgar suggested that Benson furnish further words to allow him to include it in the new work.  The result was ''[[Land of Hope and Glory]]'', which formed the finale of the ode and was also issued (with slightly different words) as a separate song.

Between [[1902]] and [[1914]] Elgar enjoyed phenomenal success, made four visits to the USA including one [[conducting]] tour, and earned considerable fees from the performance of his music. Between [[1905]] and [[1908]] Elgar held the post of Professor of Music at the [[University of Birmingham]]. His lectures there caused controversy owing to remarks he made about other English composers and English music in general; he was quoted as saying &quot;English music is white -- it evades everything&quot;.  The University of Birmingham's Special Collections contain an archive of letters written by Elgar.

Elgar's [[Symphony No. 1 (Elgar)|Symphony No. 1]] ([[1908]]) was given one hundred performances in its first year, and in [[1911]], the year of the completion of his [[Symphony No. 2 (Elgar)|Symphony No. 2]], he had the [[Order of Merit]] bestowed upon him.

Elgar's musical legacy is primarily orchestral, but he did write for soloists and groups of other instruments. His one work for [[brass band]], ''The [[Severn]] Suite'' (later arranged by the composer for orchestra), remains an important part of the brass band repertoire. It is occasionally performed in its arrangement by [[Sir Ivor Atkins]] for [[organ (music)|organ]] as the composer's second Organ Sonata; Elgar's first, much earlier (1895) Organ Sonata was written specifically for the instrument in a highly orchestral style, and remains a frequently-performed part of the English Romantic organ repertoire.

===Later years===
With the advent of [[World War I]] his music began to fall out of fashion, and after the death of his wife in 1920 he wrote little of importance. Shortly before her death he composed the elegiac [[Cello Concerto (Elgar)|Cello Concerto]].

Elgar lived in the village of [[Kempsey, England|Kempsey]] from [[1923]] to [[1927]], during which time he was made [[Master of the King's Musick]].

At the end of his life Elgar began work on an [[opera]], ''The Spanish Lady'', and accepted a commission from the [[BBC]] to compose a Third Symphony.  His final illness prevented their completion.

== Posthumous recognition ==
The house in Lower Broadheath where Elgar was born is now a museum devoted to him.

The statue of him at the end of Worcester High Street stands facing the cathedral, only yards from where his father's shop once stood.  

Another statue of the composer is at the top of Church Street in Malvern, overlooking the town and giving visitors an opportunity to stand next to the composer in the shadow of the Hills which he so often regarded.

A portrait of Sir Edward Elgar can be found on the [[British banknotes|Bank of England twenty pound note]].

Elgar's sketches for his third symphony were elaborated in the 1990s by the composer [[Anthony Payne]].

'''E-Prime''', short for '''English Prime''', refers to a modification of the [[English language]] that prohibits the use of the [[verb]] &amp;quot;[[Copula|to be]]&amp;quot; in all its forms. 

== History ==
One of Korzybski's students, D. David Bourland, Jr. proposed E-prime as an addition to [[Alfred Korzybski]]'s [[general semantics]] some years after Korzybski's [[death]] in [[1950]]. Bourland coined the term in an [[essay]] in [[1965]] entitled ''A Linguistic Note: Writing in E-Prime'' (originally published in the ''General Semantics Bulletin'').  It quickly became controversial within general semantics, partly because sometimes practioners of General Semantics saw Bourland as attacking the verb 'to be' as such, and not just certain usages.

Korzybski had found two forms of the verb 'to be' - the 'is' of identity and the 'is' of predication - to have structural problems. For example, the sentence &quot;The coat is red&quot; has no observer, but &quot;We see the coat as red&quot; (here &quot;we&quot; indicates observers) appears more correct as to the facts about light waves and colour as determined by [[modern science]], i.e., [[colour]] results from a reaction in the [[human brain]]. Korzybski advocated raising one's awareness of  structural issues generally through training in general semantics.

== The different functions of 'to be' ==
In use, the verb 'to be' has several distinct functions:

* '''Identity''', of the form &quot;''noun'' be ''noun''&quot; ''[The cat is an animal]''
* '''Predication''', of the form &quot;''noun'' be ''adjective''&quot; ''[The cat is furry]''
* '''Auxiliary''', of the form &quot;''noun'' be ''verb''&quot; ''[The cat is sleeping]''; ''[The cat is bitten by the dog]''
* '''Existence''', of the form &quot;''noun'' be&quot; ''[There is a cat]''
* '''Location''', of the form &quot;''noun'' be ''place''&quot; ''[The cat is on the mat]''

Bourland sees specifically the &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;predication&amp;quot; functions as [[:wikt:pernicious|pernicious]], but advocates eliminating all forms for the sake of simplicity. In the case of the &quot;existence&quot; form (and less [[idiomatic]]ally, the &quot;location&quot; form), one can simply substitute the verb &quot;exists&quot;.

== Criticism ==

Note that E-Prime forces a writer to choose verbs and meanings carefully:  the elimination of &quot;to be&quot; implicitly eliminates the [[passive voice]] and [[Imperfective aspect|progressive aspect]].  Since many stylists argue that these occur too frequently in sloppy English writing, this constraint alone accounts for much of the appeal of E-Prime to some of its advocates.  Of course it may also generate difficulties for some writers as they learn to use E-Prime.  

E-Prime's advocates may also assert that its use leads to a less dogmatic style of [[language]] that reduces the possibility for misunderstanding and for [[conflict]]. Detractors might observe that some languages already treat equivalents of the verb &quot;to be&quot; very differently without giving any obvious advantages to their speakers. For instance, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], like [[Russian language|Russian]], already lacks a verb form of &quot;to be&quot; or &quot;is&quot; in the present tense. If one wanted to assert, in Arabic, that &quot;an apple is red&quot;, one would not literally say &quot;the apple looks red&quot;, but &quot;the apple red&quot;. In other words, speakers can communicate the verb form of &quot;to be&quot; - and/or its E-Prime equivalents - with their semantic advantages and disadvantages, even without the existence of the word itself (though without resolving the ambiguities that E-Prime seeks to alleviate).  Similarly, the [[Ainu language]] consistently does not distinguish between &quot;be&quot; and &quot;become&quot;; thus ''ne'' means both &quot;be&quot; and &quot;become&quot;, and ''pirka'' means &quot;good&quot;, &quot;be good&quot;, and &quot;become good&quot; equally. Many languages &amp;mdash; for instance [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] &amp;mdash; already distinguish &quot;existence&quot;/&quot;location&quot; from &quot;identity&quot;/&quot;predication&quot;. 

Less compatibility exists between E-Prime and [[Charles Kay Ogden]]'s [[Basic English]] because Basic English has a closed set of verbs - excluding verbs such as &quot;become&quot;, &quot;remain&quot;, and &quot;equal&quot; that E-Prime uses to replace or precisify states of &quot;being&quot;. Changes such as those proposed for E-Prime also might eliminate enough ways to express [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] in [[African American Vernacular English]] to prove unworkable if applied indiscriminately to such language.

==Discouraged forms==

''To be'' falls in the set of [[irregular verb]]s in English; some individuals, especially those who have learned English as a second language, may have difficulty recognizing all its forms. In addition, speakers of [[colloquial]] English frequently [[Contraction (linguistics)|contract]] ''to be'' after [[pronoun]]s or before the word ''[[Negation#Grammar|not]]''. E-Prime would prohibit the following words as forms of ''to be'':

*''be''
*''being''
*''been''
*''am''
*''is''; ''isn't''
*''are''; ''aren't''
*''was''; ''wasn't''
*''were''; ''weren't''
*[[Contraction (linguistics)|Contractions]] formed from a [[pronoun]] and a [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] of ''to be'':
**''I'm''
**''you're''; ''we're''; ''they're''
**''he's''; ''she's''; ''it's''
*E-Prime likewise prohibits contractions of ''to be'' found in nonstandard [[dialect]]s of English, such as the following:
**''[[ain't]]''
**''[[hain't]]'' (when derived from ''ain't'' rather than ''haven't'')

===Allowed words===

E-prime does not prohibit the following words, because they do not derive from forms of ''to be''. Some of these serve similar grammatical functions (see [[auxiliary verb]]s).
*''become''
*''has''; ''have''
*''I've''; ''you've''
*''do''; ''does''; ''doing''; ''did''
*''can''; ''could''
*''will''; ''would''
*''shall''; ''should''
*''ought''

===Allowed words with prohibited homophones or homographs===

The following words may either look ([[homograph]]) or sound ([[homophone]]) like a form of the word ''to be'', but they do not have the same meaning.

*''its'', the [[possessive case]] of the singular [[gender-neutral pronoun]]
*''it's'' and more generally ''’s'' when derived from 'has'
*''hain't'' (in nonstandard dialects when derived from ''haven't'' rather than ''ain't'')
*[[Noun]]s that sound like forms of the verb ''to be'':
**''[[bee]]'', meaning an insect or [[spelling bee|a contest]]
**''[[being]]'' when used as a noun, as in [[Virginia Woolf]]'s statement, &quot;The artist after all is a solitary ''being''&quot;
**''[[B]]'', ''[[M]]'', and ''[[R]]'', names of the letters (although ''M'' is pronounced distinctly from ''am'' in many [[dialect]]s)

== Examples of Literal Translation vs. Translation &quot;in the spirit&quot; of E-Prime ==


In the original verse (''Roses are red/Violets are blue/Honey is sweet/And so are you'') the speaker expresses a belief in absolutes: &quot;just as it is true that roses are red and honey is sweet, it is true that you are as sweet as honey&quot;. But E-Prime seeks to avoid this type of thinking and writing. 

''First Example of Literal Translation''
An E-Prime translation attempting to preserve the literal meaning of the original might read:

Roses look red;&lt;br /&gt;Violets look blue.&lt;br /&gt;Honey pleases me,&lt;br /&gt;And so do you.

''Second Example of Literal Translation''

The following example sacrifices the metaphor implied in line 4 of the original (&quot;You are honey-sweet&quot;) to preserve one literal meaning of line 3, namely that honey  ''tastes'' sweet, and therefore replaces line 4 with simile meaning something close to the original: &quot;honey tastes sweet, and something of your nature makes you ''as'' sweet at that.&quot; 

Roses look red;&lt;br /&gt;Violets look blue.&lt;br /&gt;Honey tastes sweet,&lt;br /&gt;As sweet as you.

(''This example assumes the speaker does not mean the addressee of the poem &quot;tastes sweet,&quot; but does mean something like &quot;I find you sweet as honey,&quot; and attempts to preserve the meter and rhyme of the original while still avoiding any form of the verb &quot;to be.'')


''An Example of Translation &quot;in the spirit&quot; of e-Prime''

In an attempt to subtract the assumption of absolutes (&quot;what is&quot;) in the original, and to illustrate thought and perspective more in the spirit of E-Prime, the following translation attempts to state meaning directly from a hypothetical speaker's personal feelings toward the addressee, and express that meaning through the filter of that speaker's perceptions of the natural world. Therefore, the translation below changes the meaning of the poem. 

Roses seem red;&lt;br /&gt;Violets seem blue.&lt;br /&gt;I like honey,&lt;br /&gt;And I like you.

That version has attempted to say something close to &quot;I perceive the natural world in the way most people do. (Few people would dispute that the most common rose-variety seems red to the human eye, or that violets can appear blue.) Therefore, when I tell you I like honey, I tell you I like a thing most would agree tastes sweet and may also perceive as a pleasing thing in other ways. Therefore by claiming to like honey and to like you, I claim to make that statement with a certainty as absolute as human perception allows.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], an '''elliptic curve''' is a [[plane curve]] defined by an equation of the form
:''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a'' ''x'' + ''b'',
which is non-singular; that is, its graph has no [[cusps]] or self-intersections. (When the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the coefficient field is equal to 2 or 3, the above equation is not quite general enough to comprise all non-singular [[cubic curve]]s; see [[#Elliptic curves over a general field|below]] for a more precise definition.)

One finds that elliptic curves correspond to embeddings of the [[torus]] into the [[complex projective plane]]; such embeddings generalize to arbitrary [[field (mathematics)|field]]s, and so it is said that elliptic curves are  [[non-singular]] [[projective variety|projective]] [[algebraic curve]]s of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] 1 over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'', together with a distinguished point defined over ''K''. The natural [[group (mathematics)|group]] structure of a torus manifests itself in a curious geometric way on an elliptic curve; the set of points of the curve form an [[abelian group]].

Elliptic curves are especially important in [[number theory]], and constitute a major area of current research; for example, they were used in the proof, by [[Andrew Wiles]] (assisted by one of his former PhD students, [[Richard Taylor]]), of [[Fermat's last theorem]]. They also find applications in [[cryptography]] (see the article [[elliptic curve cryptography]]) and [[integer factorization]].

&lt;small&gt;An elliptic curve is '''''not''''' the same as an [[ellipse]]: see [[elliptic integral]] for the origin of the term. &lt;/small&gt;

==Elliptic curves over the real numbers==
Although the formal definition of an elliptic curve is fairly technical and requires some background in [[algebraic geometry]], it is possible to describe  some features of elliptic curves over the [[real numbers]] using only high school [[algebra]] and [[geometry]].

In this context, an elliptic curve is a [[plane curve]] defined by an equation of the form
:&lt;math&gt;y^2 = x^3 + ax + b&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''a'' and ''b'' are real numbers. This type of equation is called a [[Weierstrass equation]].

For example, the following graphs illustrate the elliptic curves given by the equations &lt;math&gt;y^2 = x^3 - x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y^2 = x^3 - x + 1&lt;/math&gt;.
[[image:ECexamples01.png]]

The definition of elliptic curve also requires that the curve be [[non-singular]]. Geometrically, this means that the graph has no [[cusps]] or self-intersections. Algebraically, this involves calculating the [[discriminant]],
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2)&lt;/math&gt;
The curve is non-singular if the discriminant is not equal to zero. (Although the factor &amp;minus;16 seems irrelevant here, it turns out to be convenient in more advanced study of elliptic curves.)

If the curve is non-singular, then its graph has ''two'' components if the discriminant is positive, and ''one'' component if it is negative. For example, in the graphs shown above, the discriminant in the first case is 64, and in the second case is &amp;minus;368.

==The group law==
By adding a &quot;point at infinity&quot;, we obtain the projective version of this curve. If ''P'' and ''Q'' are two points on the curve, then we can uniquely describe a third point which is the intersection of the curve with the line through ''P'' and ''Q''. If the line is tangent to the curve at a point, then that point is counted twice; and if the line is parallel to the ''y''-axis, we define the third point as the point &quot;at infinity&quot;. Exactly one of these conditions then holds for any pair of points on an elliptic curve.

[[image:ECClines.png]]

It is then possible to introduce a [[group (mathematics)|group operation]], &quot;+&quot;, on the curve with the following properties: we consider the point at infinity to be 0, the identity of the group; and if a straight line intersects the curve at the points ''P'', ''Q'' and ''R'', then we require that ''P'' + ''Q'' + ''R'' = 0 in the group. One can check that this turns the curve into an [[abelian group]], and thus into an [[abelian variety]].  It can be shown that the set of ''K''-rational points (including the point at infinity) forms a [[subgroup]] of this group. If the curve is denoted by ''E'', then this subgroup is often written as ''E''(''K'').

The above group can be described algebraically as well as geometrically. Given the curve ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; ''px'' &amp;minus; ''q'' over the field ''K'' (whose characteristic we assume to be neither 2 nor 3), and points ''P'' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt;) and ''Q'' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''Q''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''Q''&lt;/sub&gt;) on the curve, assume first that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ne; ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''Q''&lt;/sub&gt;. Let ''s'' = (''y''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''Q''&lt;/sub&gt;)/(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''Q''&lt;/sub&gt;); since ''K'' is a field, ''s'' is well-defined. Then we can define ''R'' = ''P'' + ''Q'' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;) by 

:&lt;math&gt;x_R = s^2 - x_P - x_Q&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_R = -y_P + s(x_P - x_R)&lt;/math&gt;

If ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''Q''&lt;/sub&gt;, then there are two options: if ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;minus;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''Q''&lt;/sub&gt;, then the sum is defined as 0; thus, the inverse of each point on the curve is found by reflecting it across the ''x''-axis. If ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''Q''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ne; 0, then ''R'' = ''P'' + ''P'' = 2''P'' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;) is given by 

:&lt;math&gt;s = {(3{x_P}^2 - p)}/{(2y_P)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_R = s^2 - 2x_P&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_R = -y_P + s(x_P - x_R)&lt;/math&gt;

If ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''Q''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, then ''P'' + ''P'' = 0.

==Elliptic curves over the complex numbers==
The formulation of elliptic curves as the embedding of a [[torus]] in the [[complex projective plane]] follows naturally from a curious property of [[Weierstrass's elliptic functions]].  These functions and their first derivative are related by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\wp'(z)^2 = 4\wp(z)^3 -g_2\wp(z) - g_3&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;g_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_3&lt;/math&gt; are constants; &lt;math&gt;\wp(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Weierstrass's elliptic functions|Weierstrass elliptic function]] and &lt;math&gt;\wp'(z)&lt;/math&gt; its derivative. It should be clear that this relation is in the form of an elliptic curve (over the complex numbers). The Weierstrass functions are doubly-periodic; that is, they are period with respect to a [[fundamental pair of periods|lattice]] &amp;Lambda;; in essence, the Weierstrass functions are naturally defined on a torus &lt;math&gt;T=\mathbb{C}/\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;. This torus may be embedded in the complex projective plane by means of the map 

:&lt;math&gt;z\to (1,\wp(z), \wp'(z))&lt;/math&gt;.

This map is a [[group isomorphism]], carrying the natural group structure of the torus into the projective plane. It is also an isomorphism of [[Riemann surface]]s, and so topologically, a given elliptic curve looks like a torus.   If the lattice &amp;Lambda; is related to a lattice ''c''&amp;Lambda; by multiplication by a non-zero complex number ''c'', then the corresponding curves are isomorphic. Isomorphism classes of elliptic curves are specified by the [[j-invariant]]. 

The isomorphism classes can be understood in a simpler way as well. The constants &lt;math&gt;g_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_3&lt;/math&gt;, called the [[modular invariant]]s, are uniquely determined by the lattice, that is, by the structure of the torus. However, the complex numbers are the [[splitting field]] for polynomials, and so the elliptic curve may be written as

:&lt;math&gt;y^2=x(x-1)(x-\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;

One finds that 

:&lt;math&gt;g_2 = \frac{4^{1/3}}{3} (\lambda^2-\lambda+1)&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;g_3=\frac{1}{27} (\lambda+1)(2\lambda^2-5\lambda+2)&lt;/math&gt;

so that the [[modular discriminant]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta = g_2^3-27g_3^2 = \lambda^2(\lambda-1)^2&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &amp;lambda; is sometimes called the [[modular lambda function]].

Note that the [[uniformization theorem]] states that every [[compact]] [[Riemann surface]] of genus one can be represented as a torus.

==Elliptic curves over a general field==
Elliptic curves can be defined over any [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K''; the formal definition of an elliptic curve is a non-singular projective algebraic curve over ''K'' with [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] 1 with a given point defined over ''K''.

If the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of ''K'' is neither 2 nor 3, then every elliptic curve over ''K'' can be written in the form
:''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; ''px'' &amp;minus; ''q''
where ''p'' and ''q'' are elements of ''K'' such that the right hand side polynomial ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; ''px'' &amp;minus; ''q'' does not have any double roots. If the characteristic is 2 or 3, then more terms need to be kept.

One typically takes the curve to be the set of all points (''x'',''y'') which satisfy the above equation and such that both ''x'' and ''y'' are elements of the [[algebraic closure]] of ''K''. Points of the curve whose coordinates both belong to ''K'' are called '''''K''-rational points'''.

==Connections to number theory==
The [[Mordell-Weil theorem]] states that if the underlying field ''K'' is the field of [[rational number]]s (or more generally a [[number field]]), then the group of ''K''-rational points is [[finitely generated abelian group|finitely generated]]. This means that the group can be expressed as the [[direct sum of modules#Construction for two abelian groups|direct sum]] of a [[free abelian group]] and a finite [[torsion subgroup]]. While it is relatively easy to determine the torsion subgroup of ''E''(''K''), no general algorithm is known to compute the [[rank of an abelian group|rank]] of the free subgroup. A formula for this rank is given by the [[Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]].

The recent proof of [[Fermat's last theorem]] proceeded by proving a special case of thetinction between adjectives and adverbs, the reduction of the number of participles from six to two, and the replacement of the [[table of correlatives]] with more latinate words or phrases. These reforms were overwhelmingly rejected, but some were picked up in [[esperantido|subsequent reforms]] (such as [[Ido]]) and criticisms of the language.  In the following decade Esperanto spread into western Europe, especially France. By 1905 there were already 27 magazines being published ([[#References|Auld 1988]]).  

A small international conference was held in 1904, leading to the first world congress in August 1905 in [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], [[France]].  There were 688 Esperanto speakers present from 20 nationalities.  At this congress, Zamenhof officially resigned his leadership of the Esperanto movement, as he did not want personal prejudice against himself (or [[anti-Semitism]]) to hinder the progress of the language.  He proposed a [[Declaration of Boulogne|declaration]] on founding principles of the Esperanto movement, which the attendees of the congress endorsed.

== Esperanto history since the first congress ==

World congresses have been held every year since 1905, except during the two World Wars.

The autonomous territory of [[Neutral Moresnet]], between Belgium and Germany, had a sizeable proportion of Esperanto-speakers among its small and multiethnic population.  There was a proposal to make Esperanto its official language.

In the early 1920s, there was a proposal for the [[League of Nations]] to accept Esperanto as their working language.  Ten delegates accepted the proposal with only one voice against, the French delegate, [[Gabriel Hanotaux]]. Hanotaux did not like how the [[French language]] was losing its position as the international language and saw Esperanto as a threat. However, two years later the League recommended that its member states include Esperanto in their educational curricula. Many people see the 1920s as the heyday of the Esperanto movement. 

Starting in the 1930s, [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] murdered many Esperanto speakers because of their [[nationalism|anti-nationalistic]] tendencies.  Hitler wrote in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' that it was created as a universal language to unite the [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[diaspora]].  Stalin called it &quot;the language of spies&quot;.  While Esperanto itself was not enough cause for execution, its use was extended among Jews or trade unionists and encouraged contacts with foreigners.  

[[Fascist Italy]], on the other hand, made some efforts of promoting [[tourism in Italy]] through Esperanto leaflets.

The [[Cold War]], especially in the 1950s and 1960s, put a damper on the Esperanto movement as well, as there were fears on both sides that Esperanto could be used for enemy [[propaganda]]. However, the language experienced something of a renaissance in the 1970s and spread to new parts of the world, such as its veritable explosion in popularity in [[Iran]] in 1975. By 1991 there were enough African Esperantists to warrant a pan-African congress. The language continues to spread, although it is not officially recognized by any country, and is part of the state educational curriculum of only a few.

== Evolution of the language ==

The [[Declaration of Boulogne]] [http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Delphi/9061/bulonja.html] of 1905 limited changes to Esperanto.  That declaration stated, among other things, that the basis of the language should remain the ''Fundamento de Esperanto'' (&quot;Foundation of Esperanto&quot;, a group of early works by Zamenhof), which is to be binding forever: nobody has the right to make changes to it.  The declaration also permits new concepts to be expressed as the speaker sees fit, but it recommends doing so in accordance with the original style.

Many Esperantists believe this declaration stabilizing the language is a major reason why the Esperanto speaker community grew beyond the levels attained by other constructed languages and has developed a flourishing culture. Other constructed languages, such as [[Ido]], have been hindered from developing a stable speaking community by continual tinkering. Also, many developers of constructed languages have been possessive of their brain-children and have worked to prevent others from contributing to the language. One such ultimately disastrous case was [[Johann Martin Schleyer|Schleyer]]'s [[Volapük]]. In contrast, Zamenhof declared that &quot;Esperanto belongs to the Esperantists&quot;, and moved to the background once the language was published, allowing others to share in the early development of the language. 

The grammatical description in the earliest books was somewhat vague, so a consensus on usage (influenced by Zamenhof's answers to some questions) developed over time within boundaries set by the initial outline ([[#References|Auld 1988]]). Even before the Declaration of Boulogne, the language was remarkably stable; only one set of lexical changes were made in the first year after publication, namely changing &quot;when&quot;, &quot;then&quot;, &quot;never&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot;, &quot;always&quot; from ''kian'', ''tian'', ''nenian'', ''ian'', ''ĉian'' to ''kiam'', ''tiam'', ''neniam'' etc to avoid confusion with the accusative forms of ''kia'' &quot;what sort of&quot;, ''tia'' &quot;that sort of&quot;, etc. Thus Esperanto achieved a stability of structure and grammar similar to that which natural languages enjoy by virtue of their native speakers and established bodies of literature. One could learn Esperanto without having it move from underfoot. Changes could and did occur in the language, but only by acquiring widespread popular support; there was no central authority making arbitrary changes, as happened with [[Volapük]] and some other languages.

Modern Esperanto usage may in fact depart from that originally described in the ''Fundamento'', though the differences are largely semantic (involving changed meaning of words) rather than grammatical or phonological.  The translation given for &quot;I like this one&quot;, in the [[Esperanto#Examples|sample phrases]] in the main [[Esperanto]] article, offers a significant example.  According to the ''Fundamento'', ''Mi ŝatas ĉi tiun'' would in fact have meant &quot;I esteem this one&quot;.  The traditional usage is ''Tiu ĉi plaĉas al mi'' (literally, &quot;this one is pleasing to me&quot;), which reflects the phrasing most European languages (French ''celui-ci me plaît'', Spanish ''éste me gusta'', Russian ''это мне нравится'' [eto mnye nravitsya], German ''Das gefällt mir'', Italian ''mi piace''). However, the original ''Ĉi tiu plaĉas al mi'' is commonly used as well.

Other changes include a reduction of the number of inherently masculine words, and an increase in the East Asian-like use of adjectival verbs. Originally all members of a profession, such as ''dentisto'' &quot;a dentist&quot;, all people defined by a characteristic, such as ''junulo'' &quot;a youth&quot;, and all verbal participles used for humans, such as ''kuranto'' &quot;a runner&quot;, were masculine unless specifically made feminine with the suffix ''-ino''; currently only some twenty words, mostly kinship terms, remain masculine. More recently, [[stative verb]]s have been increasingly used instead of copula-plus-adjective phrasing, following some poetic usage, so that one now frequently hears ''li sanas'' for ''li estas sana'' &quot;he is well&quot;.

More minor changes have affected the names of some countries named after ethnicities, whose endings have changed from ''-ujo'' to ''-io'', and women's names ending in ''-a'' (e.g. ''Maria''), whereas purists once insisted on using the noun ending ''-o'' (e.g. ''Mario'' or ''Mariino'').

Esperantists have also formed many words to express concepts which arose since the publication of the ''Fundamento'', and these have generally conformed to the existing style of the language.  For example, early proposals for the word &quot;computer&quot; included ''komputero'' and ''komputoro'', but the word in current use is ''komputilo'' (from the root of the verb ''komputi'' &quot;to compute&quot; plus the suffix ''-ilo'' used for tools and instruments). ''Eŭro'' is another example: even though the currency is spelled ''[[euro]]'' in official legal documents in all the [[European Union]]'s languages which use a Latin script, in Esperanto ''eŭro'' was chosen to better fit the phonotactics of the language.

Not all new coinages meet ready [[acceptance]], however. For example, the [[neologism]] ''ĉipa'' &quot;cheap&quot; has appeared as an alternative to the more verbose ''malmultekosta'', &quot;inexpensive&quot;, but remains in minority usage.

== Dialects, Reform Projects and Derived Languages ==

Esperanto has not fragmented into regional [[dialect]]s through natural language use. This may be because it is the language of daily communication for only a small minority of its speakers. However at least three other factors work against dialects, namely the centripetal force of the Fundamento, the unifying influence of the Plena Vortaro and its successors, which exemplified usage from the works of Zamenhof and leading writers, and the transnational ambitions of the speech community itself. [[Slang]] and [[jargon]] have developed to some extent, but such features interfere with universal communication &amp;mdash; the whole point of Esperanto &amp;mdash; and so have generally been avoided. 

However, in the early twentieth century numerous reform projects were proposed. Almost all of these &quot;[[esperantido]]&quot;s were stillborn, but the very first, [[Ido]] (&quot;Offspring&quot;), had significant success for several years. Ido was proposed by the ''[[Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language]]'' in [[Paris]] in October 1907. Its main reforms were in bringing the [[alphabet]], [[semantics]], and some [[Grammar|grammatical]] features into closer alignment with the [[Romance languages]], as well as removal of adjectival agreement and the accusative case except when necessary. At first a number of leading Esperantists put their support behind the Ido project, but the movement stagnated and declined, first with the accidental death of one of its main proponents and later as people proposed further changes, and the number of current speakers is estimated at between 250 and 5000. However, Ido has proven to be a rich source of Esperanto vocabulary. 

Some more focused reform projects, affecting only a particular feature of the language, have gained a few adherents. One of these is &quot;[[riism]]&quot;, which modifies the language to incorporate [[non-sexist language]] and [[gender-neutral pronoun]]s. However, most of these projects are specific to individual nationalities (riism from English speakers, for example), and the only changes that have gained acceptance in the Esperanto community have been the minor and gradual bottom-up reforms discussed in the last section. 

Esperanto is credited with influencing or inspiring several later competing language projects, such as [[Occidental]] (1922) and [[Novial]] (1928). These always lagged far behind Esperanto in their popularity. Only [[Interlingua]] (1951) has managed to equal or surpass even Ido in terms of support. It shows little or no Esperanto influence, however.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Esperanto]] is a [[constructed language|constructed]] [[international auxiliary language|auxiliary language]] based on the languages of Europe. A logical structure makes Esperanto easier to learn than most of the world's languages, even for non-Europeans, though particular features may be more or less advantageous to speakers of different language backgrounds. The grammar is very nearly regular, the [[part of speech|parts of speech]] have distinctive word endings (''-o'' for nouns, ''-a'' for adjectives, etc.), and the rules of word formation are so straightforward that new words may be coined on the spot and readily understood, allowing speakers to make do with a much smaller vocabulary than in most other languages.
{{Esperanto}}
==Grammatical summary==
Esperanto has an [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], no [[grammatical gender]], and simple [[grammatical conjugation|verbal]] and [[noun case|nominal inflections]]. Although it is billed as an international language, Esperanto [[syntax]], vocabulary, and [[semantics]] are thoroughly European. [[Verb]]s are [[Inflection#Inflection vs. derivation|inflected]] for four [[Grammatical mood|moods]], of which the [[Grammatical mood#Indicative mood|indicative]] has three [[grammatical tense|tense]]s, and are [[Inflection#Inflection vs. derivation|derived]] for several [[Aktionsart|aspects]], but do not agree with the [[grammatical person]] or [[grammatical number|number]] of their [[Subject (grammar)|subjects]]. [[Noun]]s and [[adjective]]s have two [[noun case|case]]s, [[nominative case|nominative]]/[[oblique case|oblique]] and [[accusative case|accusative]]/[[allative case|allative]], and two [[grammatical number|numbers]], [[singular]] and [[plural]]; demonstrative and perhaps personal [[pronoun]]s also have a [[genitive case]]. Adjectives generally [[agreement|agree]] with nouns in case and number. In addition to indicating [[direct object]]s, the accusative/allative case is used with nouns, adjectives and [[adverb]]s to show the destination of a motion, or to replace certain [[preposition]]s; the nominative/oblique is used in all other situations. The case system allows for a flexible [[word order]] that reflects [[information flow]] and other [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] concerns, as in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Latin]]. 

These concepts are illustrated below.

==Script and pronunciation==
The script is modeled after the [[Czech alphabet]], but with [[circumflex]] [[diacritic]]s instead of [[háček]]s on the letters ''ĉ, ŝ;'' Westernized ''ĝ, ĵ'' in place of Slavic ''dž, ž;'' and ''ĥ'' rather than ''ch'' (there are no [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s). The letter ''ŭ'' is shared with the [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] [[Łacinka]] alphabet. (See [[Esperanto orthography]].) 

The [[consonant]]s are similar to those of Polish and especially Belarusian, except for a lack of [[palatalization]]; and the [[vowel]]s are also those of Belarusian, minus a couple of the less easily distinguished [[diphthong]]s such as ''oǔ''. (See [[Esperanto phonology]].) 

The [[Italian language]] is suggested as a model for [[Esperanto pronunciation]].

==The article==
Esperanto has a single [[definite article]], ''la'', which is invariable. It is similar to English ''the''. 

''La'' is used:

:For identifiable, countable objects,
::''mi trovis botelon kaj deprenis la fermilon'' (I found a bottle and took off the lid).
:For representative individuals,
::''la gepardo estas la plej rapida de la bestoj'' (The cheetah is the fastest of the beasts)
::''la abeloj havas felon, sed ili ne taŭgas por karesi'' (Bees have fur, but are not good for petting).
:For adjectives used as nouns, such as ethnic adjectives used as the names of languages,
::''la blua'' (the blue one)
::''la angla'' (English: lit., &quot;the English [language]&quot;).
:For [[possessive pronoun]]s, when definite,
::''la mia bluas, la via ruĝas'' (mine is blue, yours is red).

The article is also used for [[inalienable possession]] of body parts and kin terms, where English would use a [[possessive adjective]],
:''ili tranĉis la manon'' (they cut their hands [one hand each])

The article ''la'', like the [[demonstrative adjective]] ''tiu'' (this, that), nearly always occurs at the beginning of the [[noun phrase]], but this is not required by the grammar, and exceptions occur in poetry.

There is no grammatically required [[indefinite article]]: ''homo'' means either ''human being'' or ''a human being'', depending on the context, and similarly the plural ''homoj'' means ''human beings'' or ''some human beings''. The words ''iu'' and ''unu'' (or their plurals ''iuj'' and ''unuj'') may be used somewhat like indefinite articles, but they're closer in meaning to &quot;some&quot; and &quot;a certain&quot; than to English &quot;a&quot;.

==Parts of speech and their word endings==
The grammatical [[suffix]]es ''-o'', ''-a'', ''-e'', and ''-i'' indicate that a word is a [[noun]], [[adjective]], [[adverb]], and [[infinitive]] [[verb]], respectively. Many new words can be derived simply by changing these suffixes, just as ''-ly'' derives adverbs from adjectives in English: From ''vidi'' (to see), we get ''vida'' (visual), ''vide'' (visually), and ''vido'' (sight). 

Each [[root word]] has an inherent [[part of speech]]. The nominal suffix ''-o'' with a nominal root is redundant, but with an adjectival or verbal root it indicates an abstraction: ''parolo'' (an act of speech, one's word) from the verbal root ''paroli'' (to speak); ''belo'' (beauty) from the adjectival root ''bela'' (beautiful). Likewise, the adjectival suffix ''-a'' is redundant with adjectival roots, but not with nominal or verbal roots: ''reĝa'' (royal), from the nominal root ''reĝo'' (a king); ''parola'' (spoken). The various verbal endings mean ''to be'' with an adjectival root: ''beli'' (to be beautiful); and with a nominal root mean ''to act as'' the noun, ''to use'' the noun, ''etc.'', depending on the semantics of the root: ''reĝi'' (to reign). There are relatively few adverbial roots, so most words ending in ''-e'' are derived: ''bele'' (beautifully). Often with a nominal or verbal root, the English equivalent is a [[prepositional phrase]]: ''parole'' (by speech, orally); ''vide'' (visually, by sight); ''reĝe'' (like a king, royally). 

A suffix ''-j'' following the noun or adjective suffixes ''-o'' or ''-a'' makes a word plural. Without this suffix, a [[countable noun]] is understood to be singular. [[Direct object]]s take an [[accusative case]] suffix ''-n'', which goes after any plural suffix. (The resulting sequence ''-ojn'' rhymes with English ''coin'', and ''-ajn'' rhymes with ''fine''.)

Adjectives [[agreement|agree]] with nouns. That is, they are plural if the nouns they [[Grammatical modifier|modify]] are plural, and accusative if the nouns they modify are accusative. Compare ''bona tago; bonaj tagoj; bonan tagon; bonajn tagojn'' (good day/days). Zamenhof may have later regretted making this requirement, but it allows for the free word orders of adjective-noun and noun-adjective, even when two noun phrases are adjacent in [[Subject Object Verb|subject-object-verb]] or [[Verb Subject Object|verb-subject-object]] clauses:

:''la knabino feliĉa'''n''' knabo'''n''' kisis'' (the girl kissed a happy boy)
:''la knabino feliĉa knabo'''n''' kisis'' (the happy girl kissed a boy).

Agreement clarifies the [[syntax]] in other ways as well. Adjectives take the plural suffix when they modify more than one noun, even if those nouns are all singular,
:''ruĝa'''j''' domo kaj aŭto'' (a red house and [a red] car) 
:''ruĝa domo kaj aŭto'' (a red house and a car). 
A [[predicative adjective]] does not take the accusative case suffix even when the noun it modifies does,
:''mi farbis la pordo'''n''' ruĝa'''n''''' (I painted the red door)
:''mi farbis la pordo'''n''' ruĝa'' (I painted the door red). 

Esperanto roots have an inherent part of speech, which needs to be kept in mind. For example, ''brosi'' (to brush) is based on a nominal root, whereas ''kombi'' (to comb) is based on a verbal root. Change the grammatical suffix to ''-o'', and their superficially similar meanings diverge: ''broso'' (a brush, the name of an instrument) vs. ''kombo'' (a combing, the name of an action). Dictionaries help here by listing the roots as ''bros'''o''''' and ''komb'''i'''''. Changing verbal ''kombi'' (to comb) to a noun simply creates the name for the action, ''kombo'' (a combing). For the name of the tool, the suffix ''-ilo'' is used, which derives words for instruments from verbal roots: ''kombilo'' (a comb). On the other hand, changing the nominal root ''broso'' (a brush) to a verb gives the action associated with that noun, ''brosi'' (to brush). For the name of the action, the suffix ''-ado'' will change a derived verb back to a noun: ''brosado'' (a brushing). Similarly, an abstraction of a nominal root (changing it to an adjective and then back to a noun) requires the suffix ''-eco'', as in ''infaneco'' (childhood), but an abstraction of an adjectival or verbal root merely requires the nominal ''-o'': ''belo'' (beauty). However, the seemingly redundant form ''beleco'' is also acceptable and widely used.

Additionally, most verbs are inherently [[transitive]] or [[intransitive]]. Transitivity is changed with the suffixes ''-igi'' (the transitivizer/[[causative]]) and ''-iĝi'' (the intransitivizer/[[middle voice]]): 
:''akvo bolas je cent gradoj'' (water boils at 100 degrees)
:''ni bol'''ig'''as la akvo'''n''''' (we boil the water).
Transitivity is covert in Esperanto. That is, it is not apparent from the shape of the verb, and must simply be memorized. 

A limited number of basic adverbs do not end with ''-e'', but with an indefinite part-of-speech ending ''-aŭ''. (Not all words ending in ''-aŭ'' are adverbs.) Most of the adverbs ending in ''-aŭ'' are used as other parts of speech as well, such as ''hodiaŭ'' &quot;today&quot; [noun or adverb] or ''ankoraŭ'' &quot;yet, still&quot; [conjunction or adverb], and people would find it difficult to use the adverbial suffix ''-e'' only when these words function as adverbs. About a dozen other adverbs are bare roots, such as ''nun'' &quot;now&quot;, ''tro'' &quot;too, too much&quot;, not counting the adverbs among the [[Esperanto grammar#Correlatives|correlatives]]. (See [[special Esperanto adverbs]]). 

The other parts of speech occur as bare roots, without a special suffix. They are the pronouns (''mi'' &quot;I&quot;), prepositions (''al'' &quot;to&quot;), conjunctions (''kaj'' &quot;and&quot;), interjections (''ho'' &quot;oh&quot;), and numerals (''du'' &quot;two&quot;). (The final ''-i'' found on pronouns is not, strictly speaking, a suffix.) There are also several &quot;[[grammatical particles]]&quot; which don't fit neatly into any part of speech, and which must generally precede the words they modify, such as ''ne'' (not), ''ankaŭ'' (also), ''nur'' (only), ''eĉ'' (even).

==Pronouns==
There are three types of pronouns in Esperanto: personal (''vi'' &quot;you&quot;), demonstrative (''tio'' &quot;that&quot;, ''iu'' &quot;someone&quot;), and relative/interrogative (''kio'' &quot;what&quot;). Unlike nouns, pronouns take three cases: nominative/oblique, accusative, and genitive.  

===Personal pronouns===
The Esperanto '''[[personal pronoun]]''' system is similar to that of English, but with the addition of the [[reflexive pronoun]] of the Romance languages.

|}

Personal pronouns take the [[accusative]] suffix ''-n'' like nouns do: ''min'' (me), ''lin'' (him), ''ŝin'' (her). [[Possessive adjective]]s are formed with the adjectival suffix ''-a'': ''mia'' (my), ''ĝia'' (its), ''nia'' (our). These agree with their noun like any other [[adjective]]: ''ni salutis liajn amikojn'' (we greeted his friends). Esperanto does not have separate forms for the [[possessive pronoun]]s; this sense is generally (though not always) indicated with the definite article: ''la mia'' (mine). 

The [[reflexive pronoun]] is used, in non-subject phrases only, to refer to back to the subject, usually only in the third and indefinite persons, 
:''li lavis sin'' &quot;he washed&quot; (himself)
:''ili lavis sin'' &quot;they washed&quot; (themselves or each other)
:''li lavis lin'' &quot;he washed him&quot; (someone else)
:''li manĝis '''sian''' panon'' &quot;he ate his bread&quot; (his own bread)
:''li manĝis '''lian''' panon'' &quot;he ate his bread&quot; (someone else's bread). 

The indefinite pronoun is used when making general statements, and is often used where English would have the subject ''it'' with a passive verb, 
:''oni diras, ke ...'' &quot;they say that ...&quot; or &quot;it's said that ...&quot;

Zamenhof created an informal second-person singular pronoun ''ci'' ([[thou]]), and capitalized the formal singular pronoun ''Vi,'' following [[T-V distinction|usage in most European languages]], but these forms are rarely seen today. 

''Ĝi'' is used principally with animals and objects. Zamenhof also prescribed it to be the [[Wiktionary:epicene|epicene]] (gender-neutral) third-person singular pronoun, for use when the sex of an individual is unknown, or to refer to an epicene noun such as ''persono'' (person). However, it is generally only used for children, 
:''La infano ploras, ĉar ĝi volas manĝi'' &quot;the child is crying, because it wants to eat&quot;. 
When speaking of adults or people in general, it is much more common for the demonstrative adjective and pronoun ''tiu'' (that one) to be used in such situations.

===Other pronouns===
The '''[[demonstrative pronoun|demonstrative]]''' and '''[[relative pronoun]]s''' form part of the [[Esperanto vocabulary#Correlatives|correlative system]], and are described in that article. The pronouns are the forms ending in ''-o'' (simple pronouns) and ''-u'' (adjectival pronouns). Their accusative case is formed in ''-n,'' but the genitive case ends in ''-es,'' which is the same for singular and plural and cannot double up with the accusative. Compare the nominative phases ''lia domo'' (his house) and ''ties domo'' (that one's house, those ones' house) with the plural ''lia'''j''' domo'''j''''' (his houses) and ''ties domo'''j''''' (that one's houses, those ones' houses), and with the accusative genitive ''lia'''n''' domo'''n''''' and ''ties domo'''n'''.''

== Prepositions ==
Although Esperanto [[word order]] is fairly free, [[preposition]]s must come at the beginning of a [[noun phrase]]. Whereas in languages such as German, prepositions may require a noun to be in various [[case (linguistics)|case]]s ([[accusative]], [[dative]], ''etc.''), in Esperanto all prepositions govern the [[nominative]]: ''por Johano'' (for John). The only &quot;exception&quot; is when a preposition is ''replaced'' by the accusative. 

Prepositions should be used with a definite meaning. When no one preposition is clearly correct, the indefinite preposition ''je'' should be used, 
:''ili iros '''je''' la tria de majo'' (they'll go on the third of May: the &quot;on&quot; isn't literally true). 

Alternatively, the accusative may be used without a preposition, 
:''ili iros la tria'''n''' de majo''. 
Note that although ''la trian'' (the third) is in the accusative, ''de majo'' (of May) is still a [[prepositional phrase]], and so the noun ''majo'' remains in the nominative case. 

A frequent use of the accusative is in place of ''al'' (to) to indicate the direction or goal of motion ([[allative case]]). It is especially common when there would otherwise be a double preposition, 
:''la kato ĉasis la muson '''en''' la domo'' (the cat chased the mouse '''in''' [inside of] the house)
:''la kato ĉasis la muson '''en''' la domo'''n''''' (the cat chased the mouse '''into''' the house). 

The accusative/allative may stand in for other prepositions as well, especially when they have vague meanings that don't add much to the clause. Adverbs, with or without the case suffix, are frequently used in place of prepositional phrases,
:''li iris '''al''' sia hejmo'' (he went to his home)
:''li iris hejme'''n''''' (he went home)

Occasionally a new preposition is coined. As a bare [[root (linguistics)|root]] may indicate a preposition or [[interjection]], removing the grammatical suffix from another part of speech can be used to derive a preposition or interjection. For example, from ''fari'' (to do, to make) we get the preposition ''far'' (done by), a more precise substitute for ''de'' (of, by, from).

== Verbs ==
All verbs have regular inflections. Three [[tense]]s together form what is called the [[grammatical mood#indicative mood|indicative mood]]. The other moods are the [[infinitive]], [[conditional mood|conditional]], and [[grammatical mood#jussive mood|jussive]]. No [[Grammatical aspect|aspectual]] distinctions are required by the grammar, but derivational expressions of [[Aktionsart]] are common.  

Verbs do not change form according to their [[subject (grammar)|subject]]. ''I am'', ''we are,'' and ''he is'' are simply ''mi estas'', ''ni estas'', and ''li estas'', respectively. Impersonal subjects are not used: ''pluvas'' (it is raining); ''estas muso en la domo'' (there's a mouse in the house). 

===The verbal paradigm===
The tenses have characteristic vowels. ''A'' indicates the present tense, ''i'' the past, and ''o'' the future.

The verbal forms may be illustrated with the root ''esper-'' (hope):
:''esperi'' (to hope)
:''esperas'' (hopes, is hoping)
:''esperis'' (hoped, was hoping)
:''esperos'' (shall hope, will hope)
:''esperu'' (hope!)
:''esperus'' (were to hope, would hope)

A verb can be made emphatic with the particle ''ja'' (indeed): ''mi ja esperas'' (I do hope), ''mi ja esperis'' (I did hope).

===Mood===
The [[conditional mood]] is used for such expressions as ''se mi povus, mi irus'' (if I could, I would go) and ''se mi estus vi, mi irus'' (if I were you, I'd go). 

The [[grammatical mood#jussive mood|jussive mood]], called the ''volitive'' in Esperanto, is used for wishing and requesting, and serves as the [[imperative]]. It covers some of the uses of the [[subjunctive]] in European languages, 
:''Iru!'' (Go!) 
:''Mi petis, ke li venu.'' (I asked him to come.) 
:''Li parolu.'' (Let him speak.) 
:''Ni iru.'' (Let's go.) 
:''Benu tiun domaĉon'' (Bless this mess.)
:''Mia filino belu!'' (May my daughter be beautiful!)

===Aspect===
Although verbal [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] is not grammatically required in Esperanto, the Slavic aspectual system survives in two [[Aktionsart]] affixes, [[perfective aspect|perfective]] ''ek-'' and [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] ''-adi''. Compare,
:''Tiu ĉi '''ek'''interesis min kaj montris al mi, ke ...'' (This '''caught''' my interest and showed me that ...)
and 
:''Tiu ĉi interesis min'' (This interested me).
Various prepositions may also be used as [[Aktionsart]] prefixes, such as ''el'' (out of), used to indicate that an action is performed to completion or at least to a considerable degree. In,
:''Germanan kaj francan lingvojn mi '''el'''lernadis en infaneco'' (I learned French and German in childhood),
the verb ''el-lern-ad-is'' is past tense (''-is''), on-going/imperfective (''-ad-''), and performed to significant completion (''el-''). Such distinctions are notoriously difficult to render in English, but perhaps a circumlocution may help: ''In childhood, I spent time soaking up German and French''. Here ''spend time &amp;mdash;ing'' corresponds roughly to ''-adi'', and the ''up'' of ''soak up'' [originally also a preposition] conveys some of the meaning of ''el-''. 

The participles (see below) may also be used for aspectual distinctions.

===The copula===
The verb ''esti'' (to be) is both the [[copula]] and the existential (&quot;there is&quot;) verb. As a copula linking two [[noun phrase]]s, it does not cause either to take the accusative case. Therefore, unlike the situation with other verbs, word order with ''esti'' can be semantically important: compare ''hundoj estas personoj'' (dogs are people) and ''personoj estas hundoj'' (people are dogs). 

It is becoming increasingly common to replace ''esti''-plus-adjective with a verb: ''la ĉielo estas blua'' or ''la ĉielo bluas'' (the sky is blue). This is a stylistic rather than grammatical change in the language, as the more economical verbal forms were always found in poetry.

===Participles===
[[Participle]]s are verbal derivatives. In Esperanto, they retain the tense of the verb in their vowel. They may be [[active]] (performing an action) or [[passive]] (receiving an action). 

====Adjectival participles====
The basic principle of the participles may be illustrated with the verb ''fali'' (to fall). Picture [[Wile E. Coyote]] running off a cliff. Before gravity kicks in (after all, this is a cartoon), he is ''fal'''o'''nta'' (about to fall). As he drops, he is ''fal'''a'''nta'' (falling). After he impacts the desert floor, he is ''fal'''i'''nta'' (fallen). 

Active and passive pairs can be illustrated with the transitive verb ''haki'' (to chop). Picture a woodsman approaching a tree with an axe, intending to chop it down. He is ''hak'''on'''ta'' (about to chop) and the tree is ''hak'''o'''ta'' (about to be chopped). While swinging the axe, he is ''hak'''an'''ta'' (chopping) and the tree ''hak'''a'''ta'' (being chopped). After the tree has fallen, he is ''hak'''in'''ta'' (having chopped) and the tree ''hak'''i'''ta'' (chopped).

====Compound tense====
Compound tenses are formed with the adjectival participles plus ''esti'' (to be) as the auxiliary verb,

*Present [[Continuous aspect|progressive]]: ''mi estas kaptanta'' (I am catching [something]), ''mi estas kaptata'' (I am being caught)
*Present [[perfect aspect|perfect]]: ''mi estas kaptinta'' (I have caught [something]), ''mi estas kaptita'' (I have been caught)
*Present [[predictive]]: ''mi estas kaptonta'' (I am going to/about to catch), ''mi estas kaptota'' (I am going to be/about to be caught)

These are not used as often as their English equivalents. For &quot;I ''am'' go''ing'' to the store&quot;, you would normally use the simple present ''mi iras'' in Esperanto. 

The tense and mood of ''esti'' can be changed in these compound tenses, 
:''mi estis kaptinta'' (I had caught)
:''mi estus kaptonta'' (I would be about to catch)
:''mi estos kaptanta'' (I will be catching). 
The option of replacing ''esti'' + adjective with a verb holds for adjectival participles, with the verbal suffix reflecting the tense of the auxiliary,
:''mi estas kaptinta'' or ''mi kaptintas'' (I have caught)
:''mi estis kaptinta'' or ''mi kaptintis'' (I had caught). 

Adjectival participles agree with nouns, as any other adjectives do,
:''ili ŝparis la arbojn '''hakotajn''''' (they spared the trees '''that were to be chopped down''').

====Nominal participles====
Participles may be turned into adverbs or nouns by replacing the adjectival suffix ''-a'' with ''-e'' or ''-o''. This means that, in Esperanto, some nouns may be inflected for tense. 

A nominal participle indicates ''one who participates'' in the action specified by the verbal root. For example, ''esperinto'' is a &quot;hoper&quot; (past tense), or ''one who had been hoping''. (In the early years of the language, such forms were assumed to be masculine, but that is no longer the case.) 

====Adverbial participles====
[[Adverbial participle]]s are used with subjectless clauses,
:''Kaptinte la pilkon, li ekkuris golen'' (Having caught the ball, he ran for the goal).

====Conditional and tenseless participles (unofficial)====
Occasionally, the participle paradigm will be extended to include conditional participles, with the vowel ''u'' (''-unt-, -ut-''). If, for example, in our tree-chopping example, the woodsman found that the tree had been spiked and so couldn't be cut down after all, he would be ''hakunta'' and the tree ''hakuta''. (These don't translate well into English.) 

This can also be illustrated with the verb ''prezidi'' (to preside). Just after the recount of the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 US presidential election]], 
*then-president [[Bill Clinton]] was still ''prezid'''a'''nto'' (current president) of the United States, 
*president-elect [[George W. Bush]] was declared ''prezid'''o'''nto'' (president-to-be), 
*the previous president [[George H. W. Bush]] was a ''prezid'''i'''nto'' (former president), and 
*the contending candidate [[Al Gore]] was ''prezid'''u'''nto'' (would-be president – that is, if the recount had gone differently).

Note that this example is somewhat artificial, since the customary word for 'president' is the  tense-neutral word ''prezid'''e'''nto'', which is officially a separate root, not a derivative of the verb ''prezidi''.

The conditional forms are [[nonce words]], but their regular derivation ensures they are readily understood, even if rarely needed. No European language has conditional participles; in English, words like ''prezidunto'' must be expressed periphrastically.

Likewise, some Esperantists have proposed a tenseless partiple, though only for active-participle role. The element ''-ento'' is not officially a participle or even a separate morpheme, but it is very common and is sometimes regarded as a suffix. It frequently occurs in words for occupations where one would not wish to specify tense, such as ''prezidento'' or ''studento'' (student). Since there is often a verb derived from the same Latin root, in these cases ''prezidi'' (to preside) and ''studi'' (to study), this ''-ento'' has occasionally been proposed as a tense-neutral active participle by analogy with the temporal participles ''-anto, -into, -onto''.

However, even if the participial paradigm were to be extended in this way, it would be asymmetric in that there can be no direct passive counterpart to *''-ento'' because the expected ''-eto'' already exists as the diminutive suffix. The nearest equivalent is the [[middle voice]] suffix ''-iĝi,'' which is commonly used as a generic passive. Unlike the active case, where a few new nouns like ''prezidento'' were sufficient to avoid making the language overly specific, a need for a neutral passive participle was felt in the verbs. For example, there was heated debate for several decades as to whether &quot;I was born in 19xx&quot; should be ''mi estis naskita'' (I had been born) or ''mi estis naskata'' (literally 'I was being born'), with the French and Germans generally holding opposite opinions deriving from usage in their native languages. Today, people sidestep the issue with the temporally neutral ''mi naskiĝis'' (I was born).

== Negatives ==
A statement is made negative by using ''ne'' or one of the negative ''(neni-)'' [[Esperanto grammar#Correlatives|correlatives]]. Only one negative word is allowed per clause:

: ''Mi ne faris ion ajn.'' I didn't do anything.

''*Mi ne faris nenion ajn'' (I didn't do nothing) is considered nonsensical.

The word ''ne'' comes before the word it negates, with the default position being before the verb:
: ''Mi ne skribis tion'' (I didn't write that)
: ''Ne mi skribis tion'' (It wasn't me who wrote that)
: ''Mi skribis ne tion'' (It wasn't that that I wrote)

The latter will frequently be reordered as ''ne tion mi skribis'' depending on the flow of information.

== Questions ==
''Main article: [[Interrogatives in Esperanto]]''

&quot;Wh&quot; questions are asked with one of the interrogative/relative (''ki-'') [[Esperanto grammar#Correlatives|correlatives]]. They are commonly placed at the beginning of the sentence, but different word orders are allowed for stress:

:''Li scias, kion vi faris'' (He knows what you did.)
:''Kion vi faris?'' (What did you do?)
:''Vi faris kion?'' (You did ''what?)''

Yes/no questions are marked with the conjunction ''ĉu'' (whether): 

:''Mi ne scias, ĉu li venos'' (I don't know whether he'll come)
:''Ĉu li venos?'' (Will he come?)

Such questions can be answered ''jes'' (yes) or ''ne'' (no) in the European fashion of aligning with the polarity of the answer, or ''ĝuste'' (correct) or ''malĝuste'' (incorrect) in the Japanese fashion of aligning with the polarity of the question: 

:''Ĉu vi ne iris?'' (Did you not go?)
:''&amp;mdash; Ne, mi ne iris'' (No, I didn't go); ''&amp;mdash; Jes, mi iris'' (Yes, I went)
:''&amp;mdash; Ĝuste, mi ne iris'' (Correct, I didn't go); ''&amp;mdash; Malĝuste, mi iris'' (No, I did go)

Note that Esperanto questions may have the same word order as statements.

== Conjunctions ==
Basic Esperanto [[conjunction]]s are ''kaj'' (both/and), ''aŭ'' (either/or), ''nek'' (neither/nor), ''se'' (if), ''ĉu'' (whether/or), ''sed'' (but), ''anstataŭ'' (instead of), ''krom'' (besides, in addition to), ''kiel'' (like, as), ''ke'' (that). Like prepositions, they precede the phrase or clause they modify: 

:''Mi vidis kaj lin kaj lian amikon'' (I saw both him and his friend)
:''Estis nek hele nek agrable'' (it was neither clear [sunny] nor pleasant)
:''ĉu pro kaprico, ĉu pro natura lingvo-evoluo'' (whether by whim, or by natural language development)
:''Li volus, ke ni iru'' (he would like us to go)

However, unlike prepositions, they allow the accusative case, as in the following example from Don Harlow: 

:''Li traktis min kiel princon'' (He treated me like a prince: that is, as he would treat a prince)
:''Li traktis min kiel princo'' (He treated me like a prince: that is, as a prince would treat me)

==Interjections==
Since [[interjection]]s have no part-of-speech suffix, they may be derived from bare affixes or roots: ''ek!'' (get going!), from the perfective prefix; ''um'' (um, er), from the indefinite/undefined suffix; ''fek!'' (shit!), from ''feki'' (to defecate).

== Word formation ==
:''Main article:'' '''[[Esperanto vocabulary#Word formation|Esperanto word formation]]'''
Esperanto [[morphology (linguistics)|derivational morphology]] uses a large number of lexical and grammatical affixes ([[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es). These, along with compounding, decrease the memory load of the language, as they allow for the expansion of a relatively small number of basic roots into a large vocabulary. For example, the Esperanto root ''vid-'' (see) regularly corresponds to several dozen English words: ''see (saw, seen), sight, blind, vision, visual, visible, nonvisual, invisible, unsightly, glance, view, vista, panorama, observant'' etc., though there are also separate Esperanto roots for a couple of these concepts.

==Numbers==
===Numerals===
The cardinal [[numerals]] are:

:''nul'' (zero)
:''unu'' (one)
:''du'' (two)
:''tri'' (three)
:''kvar'' (four)
:''kvin'' (five)
:''ses'' (six)
:''sep'' (seven)
:''ok'' (eight)
:''naŭ'' (nine)
:''dek'' (ten)
:''cent'' (one hundred)
:''mil'' (one thousand)

These are grammatically numerals, not nouns, and as such do not take the accusative case suffix. However, ''unu'' (and only ''unu'') is sometimes used adjectivally or demonstratively, meaning &quot;a certain&quot;, and in such cases it may take the plural affix ''-j'', just as the demonstrative pronoun ''tiu'' does:
:''unu'''j''' homo'''j'''''
:&quot;certain people&quot;; 
:''ili kuris unu'''j''' post la aliaj'' 
:&quot;they ran some after others&quot;. 
In such use ''unu'' is irregular in that it doesn't take the accusative affix ''-n'' in the singular, but does in the plural: 
:''ia'''n''' unu ideo'''n''''' 
:&quot;some particular idea&quot;, 
but 
:''unuj objektoj venis en unu'''jn''' mano'''jn''', aliaj en aliajn manojn''
:&quot;some objects come into certain hands, others into other hands&quot;.
Additionally, when counting off, the final ''u'' of ''unu'' may be dropped, as if it were a part-of-speech suffix: 
:''Un'! Du! Tri! Kvar!''

===Higher numbers===
As in other languages, there are several systems for numbers above a million. A ''[[billion]]'' in the US and Russia is different from a ''billion'' in France and Germany (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; ''vs'' 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;; that is, a thousand million ''vs'' a million million), and Esperanto ''biliono'' is likewise ambiguous.  However, there is an additional unambiguous system:

:10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;: ''miliono'' 
:10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;: ''miliardo'' (or ''mil milionoj'')
:10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;: ''duiliono''
:10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;: ''duiliardo'' (or ''mil duilionoj'')
:10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;: ''triiliono''
:10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;: ''triiliardo'' (or ''mil triilionoj'')
:''etc.''

Note that these are not numerals but nouns, and behave as such.

An additional unambiguous system is provided by the international set of metric prefixes, and occasionally the nonce numerals ''meg'' (miliono) and ''gig'' (miliardo) are derived from them.

===Compound numbers and derivatives===
Numerals are written together as one word when their values are multiplied, and separately when their values are added (''dudek'' 20, ''dek du'' 12, ''dudek du'' 22). Ordinals are formed with the adjectival suffix ''-a'', quantities with the nominal suffix ''-o'', multiples with ''-obl-'', fractions with ''-on-'', collectives with ''-op-'', and repetitions with the root ''-foj-''. 

:''sescent sepdek kvin'' (675)
:''tria'' (third [as in ''first, second, third''])
:''trie'' (thirdly)
:''dudeko'' (a score)
:''duobla'' (double)
:''kvarono'' (one fourth, a quarter)
:''duope'' (by twos)
:''dufoje'' (twice)

The particle ''po'' is used to mark distributive numbers, that is, the idea of distributing a certain number of items to each member of a group. Consequently the [[logogram]] @ is not used (except in email addresses, of course), 
:''mi donis al ili po tri pomojn'' or ''pomojn mi donis al ili po tri'' (I gave them three apples each). 
Note that particle ''po'' forms a phrase with the numeral ''tri'' and is not a preposition for the noun phrase ''tri pomojn'', so it does not prevent a grammatical object from taking the accusative case.

== Comparisons ==
Comparisons are made with the adverbial correlatives ''tiel ... kiel'' (as ... as), the adverbial roots ''pli'' (more) and ''plej'' (most), the antonym prefix ''mal-'', and the preposition ''ol'' (than): 

:''mi skribas tiel bone kiel vi'' (I write as well as you)
:''tiu estas pli bona ol tiu'' (this one is better than that one)
:''tio estas la plej bona'' (that's the best)
:''la mia estas malpli multekosta ol la via'' (mine is less expensive than yours)

Implied comparisons are made with ''tre'' (very) and ''tro'' (too [much]). 

Phrases like &quot;The more people, the smaller the portions&quot; and &quot;All the better!&quot; are translated using ''ju'' and ''des'' in place of &quot;the&quot;: 
:'''''Ju''' pli da homoj, '''des''' malpli grandaj la porcioj'' (The more people, the smaller the portions)
:'''''Des''' pli bone!'' (All the better!)

== Non-Indo-European aspects ==
Although Esperanto is overwhelmingly [[Romance languages|Romance]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], and [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] in origin, with a bit of [[Classical Greek]], there are, arguably, elements of the grammar which are not found in these language families. Most noticeably, Esperanto has no [[ablaut]] (internal inflection of its [[root word|roots]]), something which is nearly universal in the Indo-European languages. Examples of ablaut in English are ''mouse'' vs. ''mice'' for nouns, ''less'' vs. ''least'' for adjectives, and ''run'' vs. ''ran'' for verbs. However, European languages also have many words without ablaut, such as ''cat'' vs. ''cats,'' ''fewer'' vs. ''fewest,'' and ''walk'' vs. ''walked.'' (This is the so-called [[strong (grammatical term)|strong]]-[[weak (grammatical term)|weak]] dichotomy.) Indeed, for many European languages the majority of words inflect without ablaut; Esperanto merely extends this tendency. The closest Esperanto comes to ablaut is in a few sets of related root words such as ''pli, plu, plej'' (more, more, most), ''tre, tro'' (very, too much), and the verbal morphemes ''-as, -anta, -ata; -is, -inta, -ita;'' and ''-os, -onta, -ota.''

Sometimes the part-of-speech endings are given as another example of non-European grammar, but they are similar in their essentials to the more complex system of Russian, which has separate sets of suffixes for nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs. At first Esperanto may appear to stand out in having a suffix for the nominative-singular inflection of nouns, but this is parallel to the feminine and neuter nouns of Russian and Latin; as a rule, bare noun roots only occur in those languages when masculine in [[grammatical gender|gender]]. Although it is not the source of the Esperanto system, [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] is an example of a European language with a general nominative-singular suffix. 

Other arguably non-Indo-European features are derived through regular [[Analogy#Linguistics|analogic]] extension of standard European grammatical structures. For example, the nominal-adjectival paradigm is taken from Greek: Esperanto nominative singular ''mus'''o''''' (mouse) vs. Greek ''mous'''a''','' nominative plural ''muso'''j''''' vs. Greek ''mousa'''i''','' and accusative singular ''muso'''n''''' vs. Greek ''mousa'''n'''.'' However, Esperanto does not have a separate [[portmanteau]] accusative plural suffix like Greek ''mous-'''ās''';'' rather, it compounds the accusative and plural suffixes for this use: ''mus-'''o'''-'''j'''-'''n'''.'' It has been claimed that this system is similar to [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] grammar in its mechanics; however, those languages do not have the grammatical singular-plural distinction that Esperanto and the Indo-European languages do. 

A more clearly non-Indo-European feature is the future participle. Many European languages have three tenses, past, present, and future, but only two participles, past and present. Esperanto extends this system to a pair of future participles, ''-onta'' and ''-ota,'' which are transparently related both to the future verbal tense ''-os'' and to the other participles (''-anta, -ata; -inta, -ita,'' which reflect the vowels of the present and past verbal tenses ''-as, -is''). Occasionally this system has been extended further, with nonce conditional participles ''-unta'' and ''-uta'' derived from the conditional mood in ''-us.'' 

In none of these cases were the non-Indoeuropean elements of Esperanto grammar taken from other language families such as [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], [[Finno-Ugric languages|Fenno-Ugric]], or [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]. Rather, they were derived through internal extensions of existing European grammatical structures.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Esperanto}}
The language [[Esperanto]] is often used to access an international [[culture]].  There are over 25,000 Esperanto books (originals and translations) as well as over a hundred regularly distributed [[Esperanto magazine]]s.  Many Esperanto speakers use the language for free travel throughout the world using the [[Pasporta Servo]].  Others like the idea of having [[pen pal]]s in many countries around the world using services like the [[Esperanto Pen Pal Service]]. Every year, 1500-3000 Esperanto speakers meet for the ''[[World Congress of Esperanto]]'' ''(Universala Kongreso de Esperanto)''.

==Literature, music and film==
Every year, hundreds of new titles are published in Esperanto along with [[Esperanto music|music]].  Also, many Esperanto newspapers and magazines exist. 

''[[Monato]]'' is a general news magazine &quot;like a genuinely international ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' or ''[[Newsweek]]''&quot; [http://www.esperanto-usa.org/epss.html], but written by local correspondents. A magazine for the blind, ''A&amp;#365;roro'', has been published since 1920. 

Esperanto can be heard in television and radio broadcasts and on the internet. There are currently radio broadcasts from [[China Radio International]], [[Melbourne Ethnic Community Radio]], [[Radio Habana Cuba]], [[RAI|Radio Audizioni Italiane]] (Rai), [[Radio Polonia]], and [[Radio Vatican]]. [[Internacia Televido]], an internet television channel, began broadcasting in november 2005.

Historically most of the [[music]] published in Esperanto has been in various folk traditions; in recent decades more rock and other modern genres has appeared.

In [[1964]], [[Jacques-Louis Mahé]] produced the first full-length feature film in Esperanto, entitled ''[[Angoroj]]''. This was followed in [[1965]] by ''[[Incubus (movie)|Incubus]]'', starring [[William Shatner]], being the first American Esperanto-production. Several shorter [[Esperanto film|films]] have been produced since. [[As of 2003|As of July 2003]], the Esperanto-language Wikipedia [http://eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto-filmo lists] 14 films and 3 short films.
[[Image:Ijkde.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Participants at Esperanto international youth conference]]
==Cultural community==
There are cultural commonalities between Esperanto speakers, which is a distinctive feature of a cultural community. Esperanto was created to foster universal understanding, solidarity and peace. A large proportion of the Esperanto movement continue to hold such goals, and most are at least sympathetic to them. Additionally, many Esperantists use the language as a window to the larger world, to meet people from other countries on an equal footing, and for travel. The Esperanto-community has a certain set of shared background knowledge. 

To some extent there are also shared [[tradition]]s, like the [[Zamenhof Day]], and shared [[behaviour]] patterns, like avoiding the usage of one's national language at Esperanto meetings unless there is good reasons for its use (Esperanto culture has a special word, ''krokodili'' (&quot;to crocodile&quot;), to describe this avoided behaviour). On the other hand, some aspects of shared traditions normally found in cultural communities, like clothing and cooking, aren't found in the Esperanto community.

On [[December 15]] ([[L. L. Zamenhof|L. L. Zamenhof's]] birthday), Esperanto speakers around the world celebrate [[Zamenhof Day]], sometimes relabelled Esperanto Book Day, which might easily turn into World Esperanto Day in the future.

The poem ''[[La Espero]]'' is generally considered to be the Esperanto [[anthem]].  It speaks of the achievement of world peace, &quot;sacred harmony&quot; and &quot;eternal blessing&quot; on the basis of a neutral language. Nonetheless Esperanto speakers may or may not agree whether the stated benefits could in fact be achieved in this way.  At the first Esperanto congress, in [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] in 1905, a declaration was made which defined an &quot;Esperantist&quot; merely as one who knows and uses the language &quot;regardless of what kind of aims he uses it for&quot;, and which also specifically declared any ideal beyond the spread of the language itself to be a private matter for the individual speaker.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Redirect|Emotions}}
{{psychology}}
'''Emotion''', in its most general definition, is a [[neurology|neural]] impulse that moves an [[organism]] to [[action (philosophy)|action]], prompting automatic reactive behavior that has been adapted through evolution as a survival mechanism to meet a survival need. [[Linda Davidoff]] defines emotion as a feeling that is expressed through physiological functions such as [[facial expression]]s, faster [[heartbeat]], and behaviors such as [[aggression]], [[crying]], or covering the face with hands.{{ref|Davidoff}}

Emotion is differentiated from [[feeling]], in that, as noted, emotion is a psycho-physiological state that moves an organism to action.  Feeling, on the other hand, is emotion that is filtered through the cognitive brain centers, specifically the frontal lobe, producing a physiological change in addition to the psycho-physiological change. [[Daniel Goleman]], in his landmark book ''[[Emotional Intelligence]]'', discusses this differentiation at length.

== Elaborations ==
Emotion is complex, and the term has no single universally accepted definition.  Emotions are mental states that arise spontaneously, rather than through conscious effort.  It is unclear whether [[animal]]s or all [[human]] beings experience emotion. Emotions are physical expressions, often involuntary, related to feelings, perceptions or beliefs about elements, objects or relations between them, in reality or in the imagination. The study of emotions is part of psychology, neuroscience, and, more recently, artificial intelligence. According to Sloman {{ref|Sloman}}, emotions are cognitive processes. Some authors emphasize the difference between human emotions and the affective behavior of animals.

Emotion is sometimes regarded as the antithesis of [[reason]]. This is reflected in common phrases like ''appeal to emotion'' or ''your emotions have taken over''. Emotions can be undesired to the individual feeling them; he or she may wish to control but often cannot. Thus one of the most distinctive, and perhaps challenging, facts about human beings is this potential for entanglement, or even opposition, between [[will (philosophy)|will]], emotion, and reason.

Emotion as the subject of [[scientific research]] has multiple dimensions: [[behavior]]al, physiological, subjective, and [[cognition|cognitive]]. Sloman and others explain that the need to face a changing and unpredictable world makes emotions necessary for any intelligent system (natural or artificial) with multiple motives and limited capacities and resources.

[[Affective neuroscience|Current research on the neural circuitry of emotion]] suggests that emotion makes up an essential part of human [[decision-making]], including long-term planning, and that the famous distinction made by [[Descartes]] between reason and emotion is not as clear as it seems.

Some state that there is no empirical support for any generalization suggesting the antithesis between reason and emotion: indeed, anger or fear can often be thought of as a systematic response to observed facts. What can be noted, however, is that the human psyche possesses many possible reactions and perspectives in response to the internal and external world - often lying on a continuum&amp;#8212; at one extreme lies pure intellectual logic (often called &quot;cold&quot;); at the other extreme is pure emotionally unresponsive to logical argument (&quot;the heat of passion&quot;). In any case, it is clear that the relation between [[logic]] and [[Logical argument|argument]] on the one hand and emotion on the other, is one which merits careful study. It has been noted by many that passion, emotion, or feeling can add backing to an argument, even one based primarily on reason - particularly regarding religion or ideology, areas of human thought which frequently demand an all-or-nothing rejection or acceptance, that is, the adoption of a comprehensive worldview partly backed by empirical argument and partly by feeling and passion. Moreover, it has been suggested by several researchers that typically there is no &quot;pure&quot; decision or thought, that is, no thought based &quot;purely&quot; on intellectual logic or &quot;purely&quot; on emotion - most decisions and cognitions are founded on a mixture of both.

Pyschiatrist [[William Glasser]]'s theory of the human control system states that all human behavior is composed of four simultaneous components: deeds, ideas, emotions, and physiological states.  He asserts that we choose the idea and deed and that the ''associated'' emotions and physiological states also /timestamp>

'''Frisian''' is a [[Germanic language|Germanic]] language, or group of closely related languages, spoken by around half a million members of an [[ethnic group]] living on the southern fringes of the [[North Sea]] in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]].  The ancient Frisians figured prominently in North European history. They were especially noted as traders and raiders during the [[Viking Age]]. After [[Scots language|Scots]], Frisian is the closest related living language to [[English language|English]] (not including English dialects and pidgins).

== Division==
There are three varieties of Frisian: [[West Frisian language|West Lauwers Frisian]], [[Saterland Frisian language|Saterland Frisian]], and [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]]. Some linguists consider these three varieties, despite their mutual unintelligibility, to be dialects of one single Frisian language, while others consider them to be three separate languages, as do their speakers. Of the three, especially the North Frisian language is further segmented into several strongly diverse dialects. [[Stadsfries]] is a [[mixed language]]. 
&lt;!-- commented out this paragraph until it's completed
=== West Lauwers Frisian ===
--&gt;
=== Speakers ===
Most Frisian speakers live in the [[Netherlands]], primarily in the province of [[Fryslân]], since 1997 officially using its Frisian name, where the number of native speakers is about 350,000. An increasing number of Dutch native speakers in the province of Friesland are able to speak the language. In [[Germany]], there are about 2,000 speakers of Frisian in the [[Saterland]] region of [[Lower Saxony]]; the Saterland's marshy fringe areas have long protected Frisian speech there from pressure by the surrounding [[Low German]] and [[German language|standard German]].

In the [[Nordfriesland]] (Northern Frisia) region of the German province of [[Schleswig-Holstein]], there are 10,000 Frisian speakers. While many of these Frisians live on the mainland, most are found on the islands, notably [[Sylt]], [[Föhr]], [[Amrum]], and [[Heligoland]]. The local corresponding Frisian dialects are still in use.

=== Status ===
Frisian is officially recognised and protected as a [[minority language]] in Germany and is one of the two official languages in the Dutch province of Fryslân. [[ISO 639]] codes 'fy' and 'fry' were assigned to the collective Frisian languages.

==History ==
===Old Frisian===
{{main|Old Frisian}}
In the early [[Middle Ages]] the Frisian lands stretched from the area around [[Bruges]], in what is now [[Belgium]], to the river [[Weser]], in northern [[Germany]]. At that time, the Frisian language was spoken along the entire southern [[North Sea]] coast. Today this region is sometimes referred to as Great Frisia or Frisia Magna, and many of the areas within it still treasure their Frisian heritage, even though in most places the Frisian languages have been lost.

Originally, Frisian was the language closest related to [[English language|English]], but after at least five hundred years of being subjected to the influence of [[Dutch language|Dutch]], modern Frisian bears a greater similarity to Dutch than to English; one must also take into account the centuries-long drift of English away from Frisian. Thus the modern languages are unintelligible to each other today, partly due to the marks which [[Low Franconian languages]] (such as Dutch) and [[Low German]] have left on Frisian, and partly due to the vast influence some languages (in particular [[French language|French]]) have had on English throughout the centuries.

[[Old Frisian]], however, did bear a striking similarity to [[Old English language|Old English]]. This similarity was reinforced in the late [[Middle Ages]] by the [[Ingaevones|Ingaevonic]] sound shift, which affected Frisian and English, but only affected the other [[West Germanic language|West Germanic]] varieties slightly, if at all. Historically, both English and Frisian are marked by the suppression of the Germanic nasal in a word like ''us'' (''ús''), ''soft'' (''sêft'') or ''goose'' (''goes''): see [[Anglo-Frisian nasal spirant law]]. Also, when followed by some vowels, the Germanic ''k'' softened to a ''ch'' sound; for example, the Frisian for ''cheese'' and ''church'' is ''tsiis'' and ''tsjerke'', whereas in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] it is ''kaas'' and ''kerk''.

One rhyme demonstrates the palpable similarity between Frisian and English: &quot;Bread, butter and green cheese is good English and good Friese,&quot; which is pronounced more or less the same in both languages (Frisian: &quot;Brea, bûter, en griene tsiis is goed Ingelsk en goed Frysk.&quot;)

One major difference between Old Frisian and modern Frisian is that in the Old Frisian period (c.1150-c.1550) [[Declension|grammatical cases]] still occurred. Some of the texts that are preserved from this period are from the twelfth or thirteenth, but most are from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Generally, all these texts are restricted to legalistic writings. Although the earliest definite written examples of Frisian are from approximately the [[9th century]], there are a few examples of [[runic]] inscriptions from the region which are probably older and possibly in the Frisian language. These runic writings however usually do not amount to more than single- or few-word inscriptions, and cannot be said to constitute [[literature]] as such. The transition from the Old Frisian to the Middle Frisian period (c.1550-c.1820) in the sixteenth century, is based on the fairly abrupt halt in the use of Frisian as a written language.

===Middle Frisian===
{{main|Middle Frisian}}
Up until the fifteenth century Frisian was a language widely spoken and written, but from 1500 onwards it became an almost exclusively oral language, mainly used in rural areas. This was in part due to the occupation of its stronghold, the Dutch province of [[Friesland]] (Fryslân), in 1498, by Duke Albert of Saxony, who replaced Frisian as the language of government with Dutch.

Afterwards this practice was continued under the [[Habsburg]] rulers of the Netherlands (the German Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and his son, the Spanish King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]), and even when the Netherlands became independent, in 1585, Frisian did not regain its former status. The reason for this was the rise of [[Holland]] as the dominant part of the Netherlands, and its language, Dutch, as the dominant language in judicial, administrative and religious affairs.

In this period the great Frisian poet [[Gysbert Japiks]] (1603-66), a schoolteacher and [[Cantus|cantor]] from the city of [[Bolsward]] (Boalsert), who largely fathered modern Frisian literature and orthography, was really an exception to the rule.

His example was not followed until the nineteenth century, when entire generations of Frisian authors and poets appeared. This coincided with the introduction of the so-called newer breaking system, a prominent grammatical feature in almost all West Frisian dialects, with the notable exception of ''Súdwesthoeksk''. Therefore, the Modern Frisian period is considered to have begun at this point in time, around 1820.

== Family tree ==
Each of the languages has several dialects. Between some, the differences are such that they rarely hamper understanding; only the number of speakers justifies the denominator of 'dialect'. In other cases, even neighbouring dialects may hardly be mutually intelligible.

'''French''' (''français'') is the third largest of the [[Romance languages]] in terms of number of native speakers, after [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], being spoken by about 87 [[million]] people as a [[First language|mother tongue]], and altogether by some 182 million people, which includes second-language speakers who use French for daily communication. Moreover, an extra 82 million people are presently learning French throughout the world. [http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/france-priorities_1/francophony-french-language_1113/francophony_1932/an-expanding-community_1323.html] &lt;!--See the talk page for support of these figures. Please give credible sources for any increase.--&gt;

French is thus the 15th most spoken language in the world by number of native speakers, and 5th in terms of daily speakers. It is an [[official language]] in 29 countries.

French is also an official or administrative language in several communities and international [[organisation]]s (such as the [[European Union]], [[International Olympic Committee]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[FINA]], [[FIA]], [[World Anti-Doping Agency]], [[United Nations]], [[African Union]], [[International Court of Justice]], [[Internation Secretariat for Water]], [[International Association of Political Science]], [[International Bureau of Weigths and Measurements]], [[European Broadcasting Union]], [[Universal Postal Union]], [[Interpol]] and so on) and one of the two ''working'' languages of the [[United Nations]].

== History ==
===The Roman invasion of Gaul===
The French language is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]], meaning that it is descended from [[Latin]].  Before the Roman invasion of what is modern-day France by [[Julius Caesar|Julius Cæsar]] ([[58]]&amp;ndash;[[52]] [[Anno Domini|BC]]), France was inhabited largely by a [[Celts|Celtic]] people that the Romans referred to as [[Gaul]]s, although there were also other linguistic/ethnic groups in France at this time, such as the [[Iberians]] in southern France and [[Spain]], the [[Ligurians]] on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast, [[Greeks|Greek]] colonies such as [[Massalia]] (i.e. present-day [[Marseille]]), [[Phoenicians|Phoenician]] outposts, and the [[Vascons]] on the Spanish/French border.

Although in the past many Frenchmen liked to refer to their descent from Gallic ancestors (''nos ancêtres les Gaulois''), perhaps fewer than 200 words with a Celtic etymological origin remain in French today (largely place and plant names and words dealing with rural life and the earth). Perhaps the most prominent of those are the names of  the country's main rivers ([[Seine]], [[Rhône]], [[Loire]], etc.) which originate from Gallic roots through their Latin and Greek renderings. In the reverse direction, some words for Gallic objects which were new to the Romans and for which there were no words in Latin were imported into Latin – for example, clothing items such as ''les braies'' (Gallic trousers).  Latin quickly became the [[lingua franca]] of the entire Gallic region for mercantile, official and educational purposes, yet it should be remembered that this was  [[Vulgar Latin]], the colloquial dialect spoken by the Roman army and its agents and not the literary dialect of [[Cicero]].

===The Franks===
From the third century on, Western Europe was invaded by [[Germanic tribe|Germanic]] tribes from the east, and some of these groups settled in Gaul.  For the history of the French language, the most important of these groups are the [[Franks]] in northern France, the [[Alemanni]] in the German/French border, the [[Burgundians]] in the [[Rhone]] valley and the [[Visigoth]]s in the [[Aquitaine]] region and Spain.  These Germanic-speaking groups had a profound effect on the Latin spoken in their respective regions, altering both the pronunciation and the syntax.  They also introduced a number of new words: perhaps as much as 15% of modern French comes from Germanic words, including many terms and expressions associated with their social structure and military tactics.

===Langue d'Oïl===
The medieval Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], writing in Latin in his ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'', classified the Romance languages into three groups: &quot;''nam alii oc, alii si, alii vero dicunt oil''&quot; (&quot;some say oc, others say si, others say oïl&quot;), thereby defining ''oïl languages'' (in northern France); ''oc languages'' (in southern France) and ''si languages'' (in [[Italy]] and [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]). Modern linguists typically divide the languages spoken in medieval France into three geographical subgroups: [[Languages of Oïl|Langue d'oïl]] and [[Occitan language|Langue d'oc]] are the two major groups; the third group, [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], is considered a transitional language between the two other groups.  The Oïl&amp;ndash;Oc divide may be broadly compared to the divide illustrated by the use of &quot;yes&quot; in [[English language|English]] and &quot;aye&quot; in [[Scots language|Scots]].

The Romance language group in the north of France is that of the langue d'oïl, the languages which use ''oïl'' (in modern usage, ''oui'') for &quot;yes&quot;.  These languages, like [[Picard language|Picard]], [[Walloon language|Walloon]], [[Francien]] and [[Norman language|Norman]], were influenced by the [[Germanic languages]] spoken by the Frankish invaders.  From the time period [[Clovis I]] on, the Franks extended their rule over northern Gaul.  Over time, the French language developed from either the Oïl language found around [[Paris]] (the Francien theory) or from a standard administrative language based on common characteristics found in all Oïl languages (the [[lingua franca]] theory).  Oïl derives from the Latin ''hoc ille'' (&quot;that is it&quot;).  

Langue d'oc, the languages which use ''oc'' for &quot;yes&quot;, is the language group in the south of France and northern [[Spain]]. These languages, such as [[Gascon language|Gascon]] and [[Provençal language|Provençal]], have relatively little Frankish influence. Oc/òc derive from the Latin ''hoc''.

Modern French has two words for &quot;yes&quot;, ''oui'' and ''si''; the latter is used to contradict negative statements or respond to negative questions. ''Si'' derives from Latin ''sic'' (&quot;thus&quot;), and is cognate to the word for &quot;yes&quot; in Spanish, Italian, and Catalan.

===Foreign language groups===
The early middle ages also saw the influence of other linguistic groups on the dialects of France:

From the [[5th century|5th]] to the [[8th century|8th]] centuries, Celtic-speaking peoples from southwestern Britain ([[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], [[Devon]]) travelled across the [[English Channel]], both for reasons of trade and as a result of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] invasions of England.  They established themselves in [[Brittany|Bretagne]] (Brittany). Their language was a dialect of the [[Brythonic languages]], which has been named [[Breton language|Breton]] in more recent centuries. It is part of the larger [[Celtic language]] family, though the modern dialects reflect a noticeable influence from French in their vocabulary.

From the [[6th century|6th]] to the [[7th century|7th]] centuries, the Vascons crossed over the [[Pyrenees|Pyrénées]], a mountain range in the south of France.  Their presence influenced the [[Occitan language]] spoken in southwestern France, resulting in the dialect called [[Gascon language|Gascon]].

Scandinavian [[Vikings]] invaded France from the [[9th century]] onwards and established themselves in what would come to be called [[Normandy|Normandie]] (Normandy). They took up the [[oïl languages|langue d'oïl]] spoken there and contributed many words to French related to maritime activities, amongst other things.

With their [[Norman conquest|conquest]] of England in [[1066]], the [[Normans]] brought [[Norman language|their language]].  The dialect that developed there as a language of administration and literature is referred to as [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]].  Anglo-Norman served as the language of the ruling classes and commerce in England from the time of the conquest until [[1362]], when the use of [[History of the English Language#Period of French Domination|English]] became dominant again.  Because of the Norman Conquest, the [[English language]] has borrowed a considerable amount of its vocabulary from French.

The [[Arab]] peoples also supplied many words to French around this time period, including words for luxury goods, [[spices]], trade stuffs, sciences and [[mathematics]].

===Modern French===
For the period up to around [[1300]], some linguists refer to the [[oïl languages]] collectively as [[Old French]] (''ancien français''). The earliest extant text in French is the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] from [[842]]; Old French became a [[literary language]] with the ''[[chanson de geste|chansons de geste]]'' that told tales of the [[paladin]]s of [[Charlemagne]] and the [[hero]]es of the [[Crusade]]s. 

By the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]] in [[1539]] King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] made French the [[official language]] of administration and court proceedings in France, ousting the [[Latin]] that had been used before then. With the imposition of a standardised chancery dialect and the loss of the declension system, the dialect is referred to as [[Middle French]] (''moyen français'').  Following a period of unification, regulation and purification, the French of the [[17th century|17th]] to the [[18th century|18th centuries]] is sometimes referred to as [[Classical French]] (''français classique''), although many linguists simply refer to French language from the 17th century to today as [[Modern French]] (''français moderne'').   

The foundation of the [[Académie française]] (French Academy) in [[1634]] by [[Cardinal Richelieu]] created an official body whose goal has been the purification and preservation of the French language.  This group of 40 members is known as the Immortals, not, as some erroneously believe, because they are chosen to serve for the extent of their lives (which they are), but because of the inscription engraved on the official seal given to them by their founder Richelieu&amp;mdash;&quot;À l'immortalité&quot; (&quot;to the Immortality (of the French language)&quot;). The foundation still exists and contributes to the policing of the language and the adaptation of foreign words and expressions.  Some recent modifications include the change from ''software'' to ''logiciel'', ''packet-boat'' to ''paquebot'', and ''riding-coat'' to ''redingote''.  The word ''ordinateur'' for ''computer'' was however not created by the Académie, but by a linguist appointed by [[IBM]] (see [[:fr:ordinateur]]).

From the 17th to the [[19th century|19th centuries]], France was the leading power of Europe; thanks to this, together with the influence of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], French was the [[lingua franca]] of educated Europe, especially with regards to the arts, literature, and [[diplomacy]]; monarchs like [[Frederick II of Prussia]] and [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia could both speak and write in French.

Through the Académie, public education, centuries of official control and the role of media, a unified official French language has been forged, but there remains a great deal of diversity today in terms of regional accents and words.  For some critics, the &quot;best&quot; pronunciation of the French language is considered to be the one used in Touraine (around [[Tours, France|Tours]] and the [[Loire River]] valley), but such value judgments are fraught with problems, and with the ever increasing loss of lifelong attachments to a specific region and the growing importance of the national media, the future of specific &quot;regional&quot; accents is often difficult to predict.

===Modern issues===
There is some debate in today's France about the preservation of the French language and the influence of English (see [[franglais]]), especially with regard to international business, the sciences and popular culture.  There have been laws (see [[Toubon law]]) enacted which require that all print ads and billboards with foreign expressions include a French translation and which require quotas of French-language songs (at least 40%) on the radio. There is also pressure, in differing degrees, from some regions as well as minority political or cultural groups for a measure of recognition and support for their [[regional language]]s.

== Geographic distribution==
[[Image:Map-Francophone World.png|thumb|300px|right|Dark blue: French-speaking; blue: official language; Light blue: language of culture; green: minority]]

[[La Francophonie]] is an international organization of French-speaking countries and governments.

===Legal status in France===
Per the [[Constitution of France]], French is the official language of the Republic since 1992 [http://www.languefrancaise.net/dossiers/dossiers.php?id_dossier=50].

[[France]] mandates the use of French in official government publications, public [[education]] outside of specific cases (though these dispositions are often ignored) and legal [[contract]]s; [[advertisement]]s must bear a translation of foreign words. ''See [[Toubon Law]]''.

Contrary to a [[Urban myth|misunderstanding]] common in the [[United States|American]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] [[mass media|media]], France does not prohibit the use of foreign words in [[Web page|websites]] or any other private publication, which would anyway contradict [[constitutional]] guarantees on [[freedom of speech]]. The misunderstanding may have arisen from a similar prohibition in the Canadian province of [[Quebec]] which made strict application of the [[Charter of the French Language]] between 1977 and 1993, although these regulations addressed language used in advertising and the provision of commercial services offered within the province, not the language of private communication.

There exist in addition to French a variety of languages spoken in France by minorities; see [[Languages of France]].

===Legal status in Canada===
About 12% of the world's francophones are Canadian, and French is one of [[Canada]]'s two official languages, with English; various provisions of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] deal with the right of Canadians to access services in English and French all across Canada. By [[law]], the federal government must operate and provide services in both English and French; proceedings of the [[Parliament of Canada]] must be translated into both English and French; and all Canadian products must be labelled in both English and French. Overall about 22% of Canadians speak French as a first language and 18% are bilingual.

French has been the only official language of [[Quebec]] since [[1974]], although it is commonly (and incorrectly) believed that the designation of French as the sole official language occurred in [[1977]] with the adoption of the [[Charter of the French Language]] (which is popularly referred to as ''Bill 101''). By far the provision of Bill 101 with the most significant impact has been that which mandates French-language [[education]], unless a child's parents or siblings have received the major part of their own education in English within Canada. That provision has reversed a historical trend whereby a large number of immigrant children were being sent to English schools by their parents. In so doing, Bill 101 has greatly contributed to the &quot;visage français&quot; (French face) of Quebec. Other provisions of Bill 101, on the other hand, have been ruled unconstitutional over the years, including those mandating French-only commercial signs, court proceedings, and debates in the legislature. Some of those provisions have remained in effect, for a while, using the constitutional &quot;notwithstanding&quot; clause that permits a non-compliant law to temporarily remain. (No &quot;notwithstanding provision&quot; is currently in effect). In 1993 the Charter was changed to allow signage in other languages so long as French is markedly &quot;predominant&quot;. The Charter also provides for a measure of access by Anglophones to health and social services in their own language.

The only other province which has French as an official language is [[New Brunswick]]. The highest number of Francophones in [[North America]], outside [[Quebec]], reside in [[Ontario]] whereas [[New Brunswick]] has the highest percentage of Francophones after [[Quebec]]. In [[Ontario]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Manitoba]], French does not have full official status, although the provincial governments do provide full French-language services in all communities where significant numbers of francophones live. Canada's capital city,  Ottawa, [[Ontario]] is recognized by the government of [[Ontario]] as being officially bilingual. Sudbury and Cornwall are also officially bilingual cities in the north and east of the province, respectively. Throughout [[Ontario]], the French Language Services Act, adopted in 1986, guarantees French language services where the Francophone population represents greater than 5%, especially in the north and east of the province, as well as in the other larger centres, apart from Ottawa, such as Toronto, Hamilton, Mississauga, London, Kitchener, St. Catharine's-Niagara and Windsor. A similar law came into effect in [[Nova Scotia]] in 2005. After having had the status of an Observer at the last meeting of the [[Francophonie]], [[Ontario]] is now joining this organization as a full Member along with Canada, [[Quebec]] and [[New Brunswick]].

All of the other provinces do make some effort to accommodate the needs of their francophone [[citizen]]s, although the level and quality of French-language service varies significantly from province to province.

=== Legal status in other countries ===
French is an official language in [[Switzerland]]. It is spoken in the part of Switzerland called ''[[Romandy]]''. It is an official language in Belgium and is spoken in the part of the country called Wallonie and in the capital, Brussels (Bruxelles). It is also an Official Language, along with Italian, in [[Val d'Aoste]], [[Italy]]. It is the official language of the principality of [[Monaco]]. It is the official or administrative language of many African countries (such as Ivory Coast, Gabon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Senegal) and of a few Asian countries (such as Laos).

==Sound system==
:''Main article: [[French phonology and orthography]]''
{{IPA notice}}
French pronunciation follows strict rules based on spelling, but French spelling is often based more on history than phonology.  The rules for pronunciation vary between dialects, but the standard  rules are:

* ''liaison'' or linking:  Final single consonants, in particular  s, x, z, t, d, n and m, are normally silent. (The final letters 'c', 'r', 'f', and 'l' however are normally pronounced.)  When the following word begins with a vowel, though, a silent consonant ''may'' once again be pronounced, to provide a &quot;link&quot; between the two words and avoid a [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]].  Some liaisons are ''mandatory'', for example the ''s'' in ''les amants'' or ''vous avez''; some are ''optional'', depending on [[dialect]] and [[register (linguistics)|register]], for example the first ''s'' in ''deux cents euros'' or ''euros irlandais''; and some are ''forbidden'', for example the ''s'' in ''beaucoup d'hommes aiment''.  The ''t'' of ''et'' is never pronounced and the silent final consonant of a noun is only pronounced in the plural and in set phrases like ''pied-à-terre''.  Doubling a final consonant and adding a silent ''e'' at the end of a word (e.g. ''Parisien'' → ''Parisienne'') makes it clearly pronounced, always.  

* [[elision]] or vowel dropping:  Monosyllabic pronouns and conjuctions ending in an ''a'' or a silent ''e'', such as ''je'' and ''que'', drop their final vowel when placed before a word that begins with a vowel sound.  The missing vowel is replaced by an apostrophe.  (e.g. ''je ai'' is instead pronounced and spelt → ''j'ai''). This gives for example the same pronunciation for &quot;l'homme qu'il a vu&quot; (&quot;the man whom he saw&quot;) and &quot;l'homme qui l'a vu&quot; (&quot;the man who saw him&quot;).

* [[nasal]] &quot;[[n]]&quot; and &quot;[[m]]&quot;.  When &quot;n&quot; or &quot;m&quot; follows a vowel or dipthong, the &quot;n&quot; or &quot;m&quot; becomes silent and causes the preceding vowel to become nasalized (i.e. pronounced with the soft palate extended downward so as to allow part of the air to leave through the nostrils).   Exceptions are when the &quot;n&quot; or &quot;m&quot; is doubled, or immediately followed by a non-silent vowel.  The prefixes ''en-'' and ''em-'' are always nasalized.  The rules get more complex than this but may vary between dialects.

* [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] French does not introduce extra letters or diacritics to specify its large range of vowel sounds and [[diphthongs]], rather it uses specific combinations of vowels, sometimes with following consonants, to show which sound is intended.  (See [[French phonology and orthography]] or [http://www.languageguide.org/francais/grammar/pronunciation/ French Pronunciation Guide] for more details.)

* [[gemination]] : Within words, double consonants are not pronounced as geminates in modern French (but you could hear geminates in the cinema or TV news as far as the 70's). For example, &quot;illusion&quot; is pronounced [ilyzjő] and not [illyzjõ]. But gemination occurs in sentences. For example, &quot;il l'a arrêté&quot; (&quot;he stopped it&quot;) is pronounced [illaaʁete], whereas &quot;il a arrêté&quot; (&quot;he stopped&quot;) is pronounced [ilaaʁete].

* [[Accent (linguistics)|accent]]s are used sometimes for pronunciation, sometimes to distinguish similar words, and sometimes for etymology alone.  
** '''Accents that affect pronunciation:'''
***The acute accent (''l'accent aigu''), &quot;é&quot; (e.g.,''école''— school), is pronounced {{IPA|/e/}} instead of the defaults {{IPA|/ɛ/}} or{{IPA|/ə/}},
***The grave accent (''l'accent grave''), &quot;è&quot; (e.g., ''élève''— pupil) means that the vowel is pronounced {{IPA|/ɛ/}} (as usual),
***The [[dieresis]] (''le tréma'') (e.g. ''naïve''— foolish, ''Noël''— Christmas) as in English, specifies that this vowel is pronounced separately from the preceding one (or following one in some cases), not combined, 
***The cedille (''la cédille'')&quot;ç&quot; (e.g., ''garçon''— boy) means that the letter ''c'' is pronounced {{IPA|/s/}} in front of A, O, or U.  (&quot;c&quot; is otherwise hard {{IPA|/k/}} before a hard vowel.)
***The [[circumflex]] (''l'accent circonflexe'') &quot;ê&quot; (e.g., ''forêt''— forest) shows that an ''e'' is pronounced {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and that an ''o'' is pronounced {{IPA|/o/}}. In some dialects it also signifies a pronunciation of {{IPA|/ɑ/}} for the letter ''a'', but this differentiation is disappearing. In the late 19th century, the circumflex was used in place of 's' where that letter was not to be pronounced. Thus, ''forest'' became ''forêt'' and ''hospital'' became'' hôpital''.  
** '''Accents with no pronunciation effect:'''
***The circumflex does not affect the pronunciation of the letters ''i'' or ''u'', and in most dialects, ''a'' as well.
***All other accents are used only to distinguish similar words or for etymological reasons, as in the case of distinguishing the adverbs ''là'' and ''où'' (&quot;there&quot;, &quot;where&quot;) from the article ''la'' and the conjunction ''ou'' (&quot;the fem. sing.&quot;, &quot;or&quot;) respectively.

==Grammar==
:''Main article: [[French grammar]]''
French grammar shares several notable features with most other Romance languages, including:

* the loss of Latin's [[declension]]s
* only two [[grammatical gender]]s
* the development of grammatical [[article (grammar)|article]]s from Latin [[demonstrative]]s
* new [[tense]]s formed from auxiliaries

French word order is [[Subject Verb Object]], except when the object is a pronoun, in which case the word order is [[Subject Object Verb]].

==Vocabulary==
The majority of French words derive from vernacular or &quot;vulgar&quot; Latin or were constructed from Latin or Greek roots. There are often pairs of words, one form  being popular (noun) and the other one savant (adjective), both originating from Latin. Example:

* brother: ''frère'' (brother) / ''fraternel''
* finger: ''doigt'' / ''digital''
* faith: ''foi'' (faith) / ''fidèle''
* cold: ''froid'' / ''frigide''
* eye: ''œil'' / ''oculaire''

The French words which have developed from Latin are usually less recognisable than [[Italian language|Italian]] words of Latin origin because as French developed into a separate language from [[Vulgar Latin]], the unstressed final [[syllable]] of many words was dropped or elided into the following word. 

It is estimated that 12 percent (4,200) of common French words found in a typical [[dictionary]] such as the ''Petit Larousse'' or ''Micro-Robert Plus'' (35,000 words) are of foreign origin. About 25 percent (1,054) of these foreign words come from [[English language|English]] and are fairly recent borrowings. The others are some 707 words from [[Italian language|Italian]], 550 from ancient [[Germanic languages]], 481 from ancient [[Gallo-Romance languages]], 215 from [[Arabic language|Arabic]], 164 from [[German language|German]], 160 from [[Celtic languages]], 159 from [[Spanish language|Spanish]], 153 from [[Dutch language|Dutch]], 112 from [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], 101 from [[Native American languages]], 89 from other [[Asian languages]], 56 from [[Afro-Asiatic languages]], 55 from [[Slavic languages]] and [[Baltic languages]], and 144&amp;mdash;about three percent&amp;mdash;from other languages (Walter &amp; Walter 1998).

===Numerals===
The French counting system is partially [[vigesimal]]:
[[20 (number)|twenty]] (''{{lang|fr|vingt}}'') is used as a base number in the names of numbers from 80-99.  So for example, ''{{lang|fr|quatre-vingts}}'' means 4 times 20, i.e. is the French word for [[80 (number)|80]], and ''{{lang|fr|soixante quinze}}'' (literally &quot;sixty-fifteen&quot;) means 75. This is comparable to archaic English use of &quot;score&quot;, as in &quot;fourscore and seven&quot; (87), or &quot;threescore and ten&quot; (70).

[[Belgian French]] and [[Swiss French]] are different in this respect.

==Writing system==
French is written using the [[Latin alphabet]], plus five diacritics (the [[circumflex]] accent, [[acute accent]], [[grave accent]], [[diaeresis]], and [[cedilla]]) and one [[Ligature (typography)|ligature]] (œ).

French spelling, like English spelling, tends to preserve obsolete pronunciation rules. This is mainly due to extreme phonetic changes since the Old French period, without a corresponding change in spelling.  However, some conscious changes were also made to restore Latin orthography:

* Old French ''doit'' &gt; French ''doigt'' &quot;finger&quot; (Latin ''digitum'')
* Old French ''pie'' &gt; French ''pied'' &quot;foot&quot; (Latin ''pedem'')

As a result, it is nearly impossible to predict the spelling on the basis of the sound alone.  Final consonants are generally silent, except when the following word begins with a vowel.  For example, all of these words end in a vowel sound: ''pied'', ''aller'', ''les'', ''finit'', ''beaux''.  The same words followed by a vowel, however, may sound the consonants, as they do in these examples:  ''beaux-arts'', ''les amis'', ''pied-à-terre''.

On the other hand, a given spelling will almost always lead to a predictable sound, and the [[Académie française]] works hard to enforce and update this correspondence.  In particular, a given vowel combination or diacritic predictably leads to one phoneme.  

The diacritics have phonetic, semantic, and etymological significance.

* [[grave accent]] (à, è, ù): Over ''a'' or ''u'', used only to distinguish homophones: ''à'' (&quot;to&quot;) vs. ''a'' (&quot;has&quot;), ''ou'' (&quot;or&quot;) vs. ''où'' (&quot;where&quot;).  Over an ''e'', indicates the sound {{IPA|/ɛ/}}.
* [[acute accent]] (é): Over an ''e'', indicates the sound {{IPA|/e/}}, the ''ai'' sound in such words as English ''hay'' or ''neigh''. It often indicates the historical deletion of a following consonant (usually an ''s''): ''écouter'' &lt; ''escouter''.
* [[circumflex]] (â, ê, î, ô, û): Over an ''e'' or ''o'', indicates the sound {{IPA|/ɛ/}} or {{IPA|/o/}}, respectively.  Most often indicates the historical deletion of an adjacent letter (usually an ''s'' or a vowel): ''château'' &lt; ''castel'', ''fête'' &lt; ''feste'', ''sûr'' &lt; ''seur'', ''dîner'' &lt; ''disner''.  By extension, it has also come to be used to distinguish homophones: ''du'' (&quot;of the&quot;) vs. ''dû'' (past participle of ''devoir'' &quot;to owe&quot;; note that ''dû'' is in fact written thus because of a dropped ''e'': ''deu'').
* [[diaeresis]] or ''tréma'' (ë, ï, ü): Indicates that a vowel is to be pronounced separately from the preceding one: ''naïve'', ''Noël''. Diaeresis on ÿ only occurs in some proper names (such as l'Haÿ-les-Roses) and in modern editions of old French texts. Since the 1990 orthographic rectifications, the diaeresis in words containing ''guë'' (such as ''aiguë'' or ''ciguë'') should be moved onto the ''u'': ''aigüe'', ''cigüe''. Words coming from German retain the old Umlaut if applicable but uses French pronunciation, such as ''kärcher''(trade mark of a pressure washer).
* [[cedilla]] (ç): Indicates that an etymological ''c'' is pronounced {{IPA|/s/}} when it would otherwise be pronounced /k/. Thus ''je lance'' &quot;I throw&quot; (with ''c'' = {{IPA|[s]}} before ''e''), ''je lan'''ç'''ais'' &quot;I was throwing&quot; (''c'' would be pronounced {{IPA|[k]}} before ''a'' without the cedilla).

The ligature œ is a mandatory contraction of ''oe'' in certain words (''sœur'' &quot;sister&quot; {{IPA|/sœʁ/}}, ''œuvre'' &quot;work [of art]&quot; {{IPA|/œvʁ/}}, ''cœur'' &quot;heart&quot; {{IPA|/kœʁ/}}, ''cœlacanthe'' &quot;coelacanth&quot; {{IPA|/selakɑ̃t/}}), sometimes in words of Greek origin, spelled with an οι {{IPA|/oj/}} diphthong which became ''oe'' in Latin, pronounced {{IPA|/e/}} in French (and other [[Romance languages]]): ''oesophage'' {{IPA|/ezɔfaʒ/}}, ''œnologie'' {{IPA|/enɔlɔʒi/}}. It may also appear in ''œu'' [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] (or ''œ'' alone in ''œil'' &quot;eye&quot;), in words that were once written with ''eu'' digraph (which could be read {{IPA|/y/}} or {{IPA|/œ/}}, depending on the word): ''bœuf'' &quot;ox&quot; {{IPA|/bœf/}} (Old French ''buef'' or ''beuf''), ''mœurs'' {{IPA|/mœʁ/}} &quot;custom&quot;, ''œil'' &quot;eye&quot; {{IPA|/œj/}}, etc. In these cases, the Latin etymon must be spelled with an ''o'' where the French word has ''œu'': ''bovem'' &gt; ''bœuf'', ''mores'' &gt; ''mœurs'', ''oculum'' &gt; ''œil''. 

Some attempts have been made to [[Reforms of French orthography|reform]] French spelling, but few major changes have been made over the last two centuries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[popular culture]], '''formula fiction''' is [[literature]] in which the storylines and plots have been reused to the extent that the narratives are predictable.  It is similar to [[genre fiction]], which identifies a number of specific settings that are frequently reused.  The label of ''formula fiction'' is used in [[literary criticism]] as at least a mild [[pejorative]] to imply lack of originality.  

Formula fiction is similar to genre fiction. The label of genre fiction is typically assigned because of the reuse of settings, content, layout, and/or style. The label of formula fiction is assigned because of the reuse of plot, [[plot device]]s and [[stock character]]s.  

Genres like [[high fantasy]], [[Western movie|Westerns]] and [[science fiction]] [[space opera]] have specific settings, like the Old West, or outer space.  Approaching the genre, certain assumed background information covers the nature and purpose of predictable elements of the story, such as the appearance of [[European dragon|dragon]]s in [[high fantasy]], [[warp drive]]s in [[science fiction]], or [[gunfight|shootouts]] at high noon in [[Western movie|Westerns]]. These set-ups are taken for granted by the genre conventions, and need not be explained for the reader anew.  

The ''formula'' is defined specifically by predictable narrative structure.  Formulaic tales such as ''[[Adultery in Academia]]'', ''[[My Jewish Childhood]]'', or ''[[Beat Generation|Beatniks]] Wandering the [[Midwest]]'' incorporate plots that have been reused so often as to be easily recognizable.  Perhaps the most clearly formulaic plots characterize the [[romantic comedy]] genre; in a book or film labeled as such, viewers already know its basic plot.

In film, the reuse of similar settings and plot motifs is called the [[Hollywood cycles]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[abstract algebra]], a '''field''' is an [[algebraic structure]] in which the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and [[division (mathematics)|division]] (except division by zero) may be performed, and the same rules hold which are familiar from the [[arithmetic]] of ordinary [[number]]s.

==Introduction==
Fields are important objects of study in algebra since they provide a useful generalization of many number systems, such as the [[rational number|rational numbers]], [[real number|real numbers]], and [[complex number]]s. In particular, the usual rules of [[associativity]], [[commutativity]] and [[distributivity]] hold. Fields also appear in many other areas of mathematics; see the examples below.

When abstract algebra was first being developed, the definition of a field usually did not include commutativity of multiplication, and what we today call a field would have been called either a ''commutative field'' or a ''rational domain''. In contemporary usage, a field is always commutative. A structure which satisfies all the properties of a field except for commutativity, is today called a ''[[division ring]]'' or sometimes a ''skew field'', but also ''non-commutative field'' is still widely used. Other languages have retained the old usage: for example, in [[Italian (language)|Italian]] and [[French (language)|French]], division rings are called ''corpo'' and ''corps'', both literally meaning 'body'. Instead, in [[German (language)|German]] and [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]], ''Körper'' (whence the [[blackboard bold]] '''K''' used to denote a field) and ''cuerpo'' mean 'field'. Notice that French language has no single word for field, they are simply called ''corps commutatif''. Italian for field is ''campo'', with the same literal meaning as English.

The concept of a field is of use, for example, in defining [[vector space|vector]]s and [[matrix_(mathematics)|matrices]], two structures in [[linear algebra]] whose components can be elements of an arbitrary field.  [[Galois theory]] studies the symmetry of equations by investigating the ways in which fields can be contained in each other.  See [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]] for more information.

== History ==

In 1910 [[Ernst Steinitz]] gave the first axiomatic definition of a field in his paper ''Algebraische Theorie der Körper'' ([[german language|german]]:algebraic theory of fields).

==Definition==
A ''field'' is a [[commutative ring]] (''F'', +, *) such that 0 does not equal 1 and all elements of ''F'' except 0 have a multiplicative inverse. (Note that 0 and 1 here stand for the identity elements for the + and * operations respectively, not the actual numbers [[0]] and [[1]])

Spelled out, this means that the following hold:

; Closure of ''F'' under + and * : For all ''a'', ''b'' belonging to ''F'', both ''a'' + ''b'' and ''a'' * ''b'' belong to ''F'' (or more formally, + and * are [[binary operations]] on ''F'').

; Both + and * are associative : For all ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''F'', ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c''  and  ''a'' * (''b'' * ''c'') = (''a'' * ''b'') * ''c''.

; Both + and * are commutative : For all ''a'', ''b'' belonging to ''F'', ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a'' and ''a'' * ''b'' = ''b'' * ''a''.

; The operation * is distributive over the operation + : For all ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', belonging to ''F'', ''a'' * (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' * ''b'') + (''a'' * ''c'').

; Existence of an additive identity :  There exists an element 0 in ''F'', such that for all ''a'' belonging to ''F'', ''a'' + 0 = ''a''.

; Existence of a multiplicative identity : There exists an element 1 in ''F'' different from 0, such that for all ''a'' belonging to ''F'', ''a'' * 1 = ''a''.

; Existence of additive inverses : For every ''a'' belonging to ''F'', there exists an element &amp;minus;''a'' in ''F'', such that   ''a'' + (&amp;minus;''a'') = 0.

; Existence of multiplicative inverses : For every ''a'' &amp;ne; 0 belonging to ''F'', there exists an element ''a''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; in ''F'', such that ''a'' * ''a''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.

The requirement 0 &amp;ne; 1 ensures that the set which only contains a single element is not a field. Directly from the axioms, one may show that (F, +) and (F &amp;minus; {0}, *) are commutative [[group (mathematics)|groups]] ([[abelian group|abelian groups]]) and that therefore (see [[elementary group theory]]) the additive inverse &amp;minus;''a'' and the multiplicative inverse ''a''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; are uniquely determined by ''a''. Furthermore, the multiplicative inverse of a product is equal to the product of the inverses:
:(''a*b'')&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''b''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; * ''a''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; * ''b''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;
provided both ''a'' and ''b'' are non-zero. Other useful rules include
:&amp;minus;''a'' = (&amp;minus;1) * ''a''
and more generally
:&amp;minus;(''a * b'') = (&amp;minus;''a'') * b = ''a'' * (&amp;minus;''b'')
as well as
:''a'' * 0 = 0,
all rules familiar from elementary [[arithmetic]].

If the requirement of commutativity of the operation * is dropped, one distinguishes the above '''commutative fields''' from  '''non-commutative fields''', usually called [[division ring]]s or ''skew fields''.

== Examples of fields ==

*The [[complex number|complex numbers]] '''C''', under the usual operations of addition and multiplication. The field of complex numbers contains the following ''subfields'' (a subfield of a field ''F'' is a set containing 0 and 1, closed under the operations + and * of ''F'' and with its own operations defined by restriction):
**The [[rational number|rational numbers]] '''Q''' = { ''a''/''b'' | ''a'', ''b'' in '''Z''', ''b'' &amp;ne; 0 } where '''Z''' is the set of [[integer|integers]]. The rational number field contains no proper subfields.
**An [[algebraic number field]] is a finite field extension of the [[rational number]]s '''Q''', that is, a field containing '''Q''' which has finite dimension as a [[vector space]] over '''Q'''. Such fields are very important in [[number theory]].
**The field of [[algebraic number|algebraic numbers]], the [[algebraic closure]] of '''Q'''.
**The [[real number|real numbers]] '''R''', under the usual operations of addition and multiplication. When the real numbers are given the usual ordering, they form a ''complete ordered field'' which is categorical &amp;mdash; it is this structure that provides the foundation for most formal treatments of [[calculus]].
***The real numbers contain several interesting subfields: the real [[algebraic number]]s, the [[computable number]]s, and the [[definable number]]s.
*If ''q'' &gt; 1 is a power of a [[prime number]], then there exists ([[up to]] [[isomorphism]]) exactly one [[finite field]] with ''q'' elements, usually denoted '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''Z'''/''q'''''Z''', or GF(''q''). Every other finite field is isomorphic to one of these fields. Such fields are often called a [[Galois field]], whence the notation GF(''q'').
**In particular, for a given prime number ''p'', the set of integers modulo ''p'' is a finite field with ''p'' elements: '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; = {0, 1, ..., ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1} where the operations are defined by performing the operation in '''Z''', dividing by ''p'' and taking the remainder; see [[modular arithmetic]].
***Taking ''p'' = 2, we obtain the smallest field, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which has only two elements: 0 and 1. It can be defined by the two [[Cayley table| Cayley tables]]

      [[XOR|+]]  '''0'''  '''1'''        [[Logical AND|*]]  '''0'''  '''1'''
      '''0'''  0  1        '''0'''  0  0
      '''1'''  1  0        '''1'''  0  1

::::This field has important uses in [[computer science]], especially in [[cryptography]] and [[coding theory]].
*The rational numbers can be extended to the fields of [[p-adic numbers|''p''-adic numbers]] for every prime number ''p''. These fields are very important in both [[number theory]] and [[mathematical analysis]].
*Let ''E'' and ''F'' be two fields with ''F'' a subfield of ''E''. Let ''x'' be an element of ''E'' not in ''F''.  Then ''F''(''x'') is defined to be the smallest subfield of ''E'' containing ''F'' and ''x''. We call ''F''(''x'') a ''simple extension'' of ''F''. For instance, '''Q'''(''i'') is the number field of complex numbers '''C''' consisting of all numbers of the form ''a'' + ''bi'' where both ''a'' and ''b'' are rational numbers. In fact, it can be shown that every number field is a simple extension of '''Q'''.
*For a given field ''F'', the set ''F''(''X'') of [[rational function]]s in the variable ''X'' with coefficients in ''F'' is a field; this is defined as the set of quotients of [[polynomial|polynomials]] with coefficients in ''F''. This is the simplest example of a ''transcendental extension''.
*If ''F'' is a field, and ''p''(''X'') is an [[irreducible polynomial]] in the [[polynomial ring]] ''F''[''X''], then the quotient ''F''[''X'']/&lt;''p''(''X'')&gt; is a field with a subfield isomorphic to ''F''. For instance, '''R'''[''X'']/&lt;''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1&gt; is a field (in fact, it is isomorphic to the field of complex numbers). It can be shown that every simple algebraic extension of ''F'' is isomorphic to a field of this form.
*When ''F'' is a field, the set ''F''((''X'')) of [[Laurent series|formal Laurent series]] over ''F'' is a field.
*If ''V'' is an [[algebraic variety]] over ''F'', then the rational functions ''V'' &amp;rarr; ''F'' form a field, the ''function field'' of ''V''.
*If ''S'' is a [[Riemann surface]], then the [[meromorphic function]]s ''S'' &amp;rarr; '''C''' form a field.
*If ''I'' is an index set, ''U'' is an [[ultrafilter]] on ''I'', and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a field for every ''i'' in ''I'', the [[ultraproduct]] of the ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; (using ''U'') is a field.
*[[Hyperreal numbers]] and [[superreal number]]s extend the real numbers with the addition of infinitesimal and infinite numbers.

There are also proper classes with field structure, which are sometimes called '''Fields''', with a capital F:
*The [[surreal number]]s form a Field containing the reals, and would be a field except for the fact that they are a proper class, not a set.  The set of all surreal numbers with birthday smaller than some [[inaccessible cardinal]] form a field.
*The [[nimber]]s form a Field. The set of nimbers with birthday smaller than &lt;math&gt;2^{2^n}&lt;/math&gt;, the nimbers with birthday smaller than any infinite [[cardinal number|cardinal]] are all examples of fields.

== Some first theorems ==
*The set of non-zero elements of a field ''F'' (typically denoted by ''F''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/sup&gt;) is an [[abelian group]] under multiplication. Every finite subgroup of ''F''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/sup&gt; is [[cyclic group|cyclic]].

*The [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of any field is zero or a [[prime number]]. (The characteristic is defined as follows: the smallest positive integer ''n'' such that ''n''·1 = 0, or zero if no such ''n'' exists; here ''n''·1 stands for ''n'' summands 1 + 1 + 1 + ... + 1. An equivalent definition is the following: the characteristic of a field ''F'' is the unique non-negative generator of the kernel of the unique ring homomorphism '''Z''' &amp;rarr; ''F'' which sends 1 |-&gt; 1.)

*The number of elements of any [[finite field]] is a prime power.

*As a ring, a field has no [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s except {0} and itself.

*Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], for every field ''F'', there exists a unique field ''G'' (up to isomorphism) which contains ''F'', is [[algebraic extension|algebraic]] over ''F'', and is [[algebraically closed]]. ''G'' is called the [[algebraic closure]] of ''F''.

    <title>Factpean or Semitic. While much has been speculatively deduced about the Finno-Ugric [[Urheimat]], little is certain, and, of course, the relatedness of the languages does not necessarily imply any racial or cultural unity of the peoples speaking them.

Linguists criticizing the Finno-Ugric group (e.g. Angela Marcantonio, see [[Finno-Ugric languages#References|References]]) believe that Ugric and Finnic are more distantly related than proponents advertise, and possibly are no closer than the Turkic and Ugric groups.  These linguists propose an [[Ural-Altaic hypothesis|Ural-Altaic]] supergroup. Such proposals do not contest the ultimate relatedness of Finno-Ugric, but rather try to include more languages (on even more tenuous grounds) into the family. Other supergroups have been advanced (Uralo-Dravidian, Finno-Basque, Hungaro-Sumerian) but are almost universally regarded as spurious.

==Common vocabulary==

This is a small sample of [[cognate]]s in basic vocabulary across Uralic, illustrating the sound laws (based on the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' and Hakkinen 1979).  Note that in general two cognates don't have the same meaning; they merely have the same origin.  Thus, the English word in each row should be regarded as an approximation of the original meaning, not a translation of the other words.

(Orthographical notes: The hacek (š) denotes postalveolar articulation, while the accent (ś) denotes a secondary palatal articulation. The Finnish letter 'y' [y] represents the same phoneme (a rounded or centralized [i]) as the letter 'ü' in other languages. The voiced dental spirant [ð] is the origin of the standard Finnish 'd', which is realized differently in each dialect today. The same sound is marked with the letter đ in the Sami languages. The Sami 'č' is a voiceless postalveolar affricate [&amp;#679;]. Hungarian 'gy' is the palatalized [d&amp;#690;], not a 'g'.)

One reconstruction for numbers 8 and 9 is *''kak+teksa'' '10&amp;ndash;2' and *''yk+teksa'' '10&amp;ndash;1', where *''teksa'' cf. ''deka'' is a Indo-European loan; notice that the difference between /t/ and /d/ is not phonemic, unlike in Indo-European.

===Finno-Ugric [[Swadesh list]]s===

100-word Swadesh lists for certain Finno-Ugric languages can be compared and contrasted at the [[Rosetta Project]] website:
[http://64.81.54.21:8080/live/search/contribute/swadesh/view?ethnocode=FIN Finnish], [http://64.81.54.21:8080/live/search/contribute/swadesh/view?ethnocode=EST Estonian], [http://64.81.54.21:8080/live/search/contribute/swadesh/view?ethnocode=HNG Hungarian], [http://64.81.54.21:8080/live/search/contribute/swadesh/view?ethnocode=MYV Erzya].
Notice that particularly the Finnish list is unreliable, because it contains several neologisms or formal words, e.g. ''henkilö'' (from ''henki'' life + place suffix) instead of the more commonly used ''ihminen'', which is a Baltic Finnic word. The Finnish list has also spelling errors suggesting it was compiled by a person who does not know Finnish.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{dablink|This article is about a genre of [[dance music]]. For the freestyle form of [[rapping]] in music, see [[Freestyle rap]].}}

'''Freestyle''' or '''Latin freestyle''', also called '''Latin hip hop''' in its early years, is a form of [[electronic music]] that is heavily influenced by [[Hispanic]] and [[African-American]] culture. Freestyle emerged around 1982 and hit its peak in 1989. It continues to be produced today and enjoys some degree of popularity, especially in urban Latino population centers. Another popular modern genre [[Florida breaks]] evolved from this sound.

The music first developed primarily in northeastern U.S. states like [[New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[New Jersey]]. Initially, it was a fusion of the vocal styles found in [[1970s]] [[disco]] music with the syncopated, synthetic instrumentation of [[1980s]] [[Electro (music)|electro]], as favored by fans of [[breakdancing]]. It was also influenced by [[sampling (music)|sampling]], as found in [[hip hop music]]. In the [[1990s]], the electro and hip hop influences were supplanted by [[house music]]. Freestyle music based on house rather than electro is sometimes referred to as '''freestyle house'''. 

==Musical heritage==
Before [[1982]], hip hop was based on rather traditional genres, typically funk and disco tracks such as ''Good Times'' by [[Chic]]. It was only the rapping that clearly made the distinction as to what constituted a rap track. 

The music of early rap records was performed live in the studio and then mixed with the rapping, whereas live hip hop was [[two turntables and a microphone]] with DJs such as [[Kool DJ Herc]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[Grandmaster Flash]]. Herc was a [[Jamaica]]n, and in the beginning he brought the Jamaican tradition of [[dee jaying]] (toasting) and mixing to the [[Bronx]], NY. In the end, Jamaican and African American traditions merged into the new music called hip hop.

===''Planet Rock''===
Herc first tried to make people listen to the [[reggae]] tracks from [[Jamaica]] but it didn't work. Then he started using [[funk]] and [[soul music|soul]] records, focusing on the instrumental breaks. The ''Ultimate Breaks and Beats'' series includes tracks from &quot;''Mary Mary''&quot; to &quot;''Apache''&quot; which have been sampled many times and are still used today by hip hop DJs. Of course, this music was organic rather than electronic. But hip hop DJs discovered weird sounds from [[Europe]] such as [[Kraftwerk]]'s ''Numbers'', [[Art of Noise]]'s &quot;''Beatbox''&quot; and ''[[Trans Europe Express]]'', which, although electronic, were funky and danceable. Back then, this music was called [[techno music|techno]].

With Baker and Robie, Afrika Bambaataa mixed famous samples from [[Kraftwerk]]'s ''Trans Europe Express'' and ''Numbers'' with funkier sounds inspired by [[Captain Sky]]'s ''Super Sperm'' and taking melodic elements from a rock version of [[Ennio Morricone]]'s ''The Mexican''. The result: ''[[Planet Rock]]'' ([[1982]]) by [[Afrika Bambaataa|Afrika Bambaataa]] and the Soul Sonic Force, a track that transformed hip hop music.

This new style of hip hop came to be called Electro Funk. A group of young singers named [[Planet Patrol]] recorded a sung version of Planet Rock, ''Play at your own risk'', also produced by Baker and Robie. Electro Funk was to rule hip hop for the next few years, both in NY and LA ([[Egyptian Lover]], [[World Class Wreckin Cru]]), and in Miami, a new kind of hip hop called [[Miami Bass]] would emerge. [[House music]] was also heavily influenced by [[Electro (music)|Electro Funk]]. [[John Robie]] and [[Arthur Baker]] realized the potential of the new genre and went on mixing the sound with [[R&amp;B]] Vocals: ''I.O.U.'' by [[Freeez]] featuring [[John Rocca]] was an instant club hit, charting high and becoming an instant classic on numerous compilations.

===The music===
It is a genre with rather clear features: a dance tempo with stress on beats 2 &amp; 4; syncopation on a [[bassline]], lead synth, or [[Percussion_instrument|percussion]], with optional [[stab (music)|stab]]s (provided as synthesized brass or orchestral [[sampling (music)|sample]]s); 16th beat high-hat; a [[chord progression]] which lasts 8, 16, or 32 beats and is usually in a minor key; relatively complex, upbeat melodies with singing, verses, and a chorus, with themes about [[love]] or [[dancing]]. Freestyle music in general is heavily influenced by Latin music, especially with respect to rhythms and brass/horn and keyboard parts. The Latin &quot;[[clave]]&quot; rhythm can be felt in many songs (such as in the defining ''Clave Rocks'' by Amoretto). The tempo of Freestyle music is almost always between 110 and 130 [[beats per minute]] (BPM), typically around 118 BPM. The keyboard parts are often elegant and clever, with many short melodies and countermelodies, again a strong influence from Latin music.

==Early cultural effects==
The new exciting sounds rejuvenated the funk, soul and hip hop club scenes. While most of the neighborhood clubs were closing their doors for good, some [[Manhattan]] clubs were suddenly thriving. Places like the [[Roxy]], the [[Funhouse]], [[Broadway 96]], [[Gothams West]], and [[Roseland]] that played this were packed. Records like &quot;Play At Your Own Risk&quot; by [[Planet Patrol]], &quot;One More Shot&quot; by [[C-Bank]], &quot;Numbers&quot; by [[Kraftwerk]], &quot;Al-Naafiyish (The Soul)&quot; by [[Hashim]] and &quot;I.O.U.&quot; by [[Freeez]] became huge hits. Some producers wisely copied the sound and made songs that were more melodic. Records like &quot;I Remember What You Like&quot; by [[Jenny Burton]], &quot;Running&quot; by soon-to-be pop stars [[Information Society]], and &quot;Let The Music Play&quot; and &quot;Give Me Tonight&quot; by [[Shannon (singer)|Shannon]] were all over [[New York]] radio. Many people list ''Let the Music Play'' as the first freestyle track. Indeed, ''Let the Music Play'' became freestyle's biggest record, still getting heavy airplay through radio and other venues. The song was produced by [[Chris Barbosa]], a [[Latino]] from NY. Barbosa changed and refined the electro funk sound, adding Latin American rhythms and a totally [[syncopated]] [[drum]] sound. That was definitely a reason why the style came to be very popular among Latinos as well as [[Italian Americans]]. Furthermore, many DJs who played the music, such as [[John Benitez|Jellybean]], [[Tony Torres]], [[Raul Soto]] and [[Roman Ricardo]] were [[Hispanic]]. However, those on stage performing the songs were not, neither were most of the producers making the music. For example, Information Society's notable hit &quot;Running&quot;, was written by Murat Konar, whom is of Indian descent, and produced by the band, which is of Scandinavian descent. This marks a notable merging of underground Hispanic and African-American urban cultures, hence, the names ''Latin Hip Hop'' or ''Latin Freestyle''. Now, the more neutral term ''Freestyle'' is generally preferred.  

[[KPWR]] (Power 106) in Los Angeles and [[WQHT-FM (Hot 97)]] in New York began playing hits by artists like [[TKA]], [[Sweet Sensation]], and [[Expose]] on the same playlists as Pop superstars like [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. Tracks like TKA's ''One Way Love'' and Sweet Sensation's ''Hooked On You'' received new life and the success of these tracks as well as the just-released ''Show Me'' by the [[Cover Girls]] helped get them added to stations around the country. &quot;(You Are My) All and All.&quot; by [[Joyce Simms]] became the first Freestyle record to cross over into the [[R&amp;B]] market. It was also one of the first Freestyle records to crack the European market. Although still in its early stages, Freestyle was now getting national attention, and was fast becoming dance music for the 80s.

==The Miami scene==
Not only electro was very popular in [[Miami]], also freestyle was embraced with the southern Latin capital of the US. [[Pretty Tony]], a.k.a. Tony Butler, actually first made electro, then bass and finally freestyle. He had a one man group called Freestyle and his success would begin in 1983 with the hit single 'Fix it in the Mix' and later that year a strong showing with artist [[Debbie Deb]] singing &quot;When I Hear Music&quot;. Joining him in early 1984 New York rapper [[TK Rodriguez]] fronted the group Fastlane and would release the single 'Young Ladies' Hip hop's first southern track. That year TK introduced Pretty Tony to [[Arthur Baker]], [[Kurtis Blow]] and Afrika Bambataa and he worked alongside Butler on Debbie Deb's 'Look Out Weekend'. Rodriguez' introduction of freestyle singer [[Trinere]] would become Butler's most successful artist and production.

[[Company B]], [[Stevie B]], [[Paris By Air (band) | Paris By Air]],[[Linear (band) | Linear]], [[Will To Power (band) | Will To Power]], and [[Exposé]]'s later hits defined Miami Freestyle. Many labels confused New York Freestyle and Miami Freestyle, thinking they had the same audience. They thought their promotional strategy would work for both genres, which resulted in skipping the all too important step of cultivating a record at the street and club level before going to radio. This often led to poor results for the New York-based Freestyle. New York Freestyle, even in its most polished forms, retained a raw edge and underground sound, using minor chords that made the tracks darker and more moody. The lyrics also tended to be about unrequited love or other more somber themes, dealing with the reality of what inner city teens were experiencing emotionally.

Miami records on the other hand, tended to be more optimistic, using major chords similar to those used in early disco giving them a more upbeat sound. This is probably why the Miami records fared better at mainstream Pop radio than New York Freestyle. Some Miami artists like [[Stevie B]], after doing their first shows in the New York market, saw the difference and began using the Miami sound combined with New York Freestyle, often with successful results.

==Freestyle as a pop-crossover genre==
By 1989, [[Freestyle]] was at its peak as an underground genre. Around this time, [[Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam]], one of the first Latino freestyle acts to get behind the microphone, began to make it big on the freestyle scene. Their records were produced by clan. Pronounced &quot;ee&quot;.
* ''Ní'': This is used in the Irish Language instead of ''O'' before a surname and comes a shortened form of the Irish word for a daughter, e.g. ''Máire Ní Bhriain'' (&quot;Mary O'Brien&quot;).
* ''Nic'': Compressed form of ''iníon mhic'' (&quot;daughter of Mac...&quot;), e.g. ''Máire Nic Charthaigh'' (&quot;Mary, daughter of McCarthy&quot;).
* ''Bean'': &quot;Wife&quot;, pronounced as ''ban''.

==Italy==
''See also: [[:Category:Italian surnames|Italian surnames category]].''

[[Italy|Italian]] names are mostly derived from Latin, but since Italy has been often ruled by foreigners, many surnames are of Spanish, French, German, Norman or Swiss origin (and thus often [[Romance language]] names).  Beginning in the 14th century, it became necessary to add a [[second name]] to distinguish between individuals with the same surname.  

Italian surnames are especially easy to recognize because most end in a vowel, like nearly all words in [[Standard Italian]], and many of them have been derived from descriptive nicknames.

Italian surnames developed from four major sources: patronym (e.g. ''Francesco di Marco'', &quot;Francis, son of Mark&quot;), occupation (e.g. ''Giovanni Fabbri'', &quot;John the Smith&quot;), personal characteristic (e.g. nicknames or pet names like ''Dario Forte'', &quot;Darius the Strong&quot;), and geographic origin (e.g. ''Elisabetta Romano'', &quot;Elisabeth from Rome&quot;).

Few family names are still in the original Latin, and usually they indicate from or with pretensions to antiquity, e.g. ''de Judicibus'' or ''de Laurentis''. If the family was noble, the ''de'' has lowercase ''d'', otherwise it is uppercase.

==Greece==
Greek surnames usually describe occupation or characteristics. Some are prefixed with ''papa-'', indicating ancestry from a priest. Common patronymic suffixes are ''-poulos'' ([[Peloponessus]]), ''-idis'', ''-iadis'' ([[Pontus]]), ''-akis'' ([[Crete]]), ''-atos'' ([[Ionian sea]]), ''-ellis'' ([[Lesbos_Island|Lesvos Island]]). The suffix ''-idis'' survives from the ancient times (''-ides'') for patronymic epithets. [[Zeus]], for example was also referred to as ''[[Cronides]]'' (&quot;son of [[Cronus]]&quot;).

==Pakistan==
[[Pakistan]]i surnames are basically divided in two categories: tribal names and ancestral names.

Muslim surnames include those of [[Arab]] heritage, e.g. ''[[Shaikh]]'', ''[[Siddiqui]]'', ''[[Abbasi]]'', ''[[Syed]]'', ''[[Farooqi]]'', ''[[Osmani]]'', ''[[Alavi]]'', ''[[Hassani]]'', ''[[Hussaini]]'', and ''Suhrawardi''. ''[[Khan]]'' is the most common surname in [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]] indicating [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]], [[Mongol]] and [[Central Asia]]n ancestory. Other family names indicating [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] heritage include ''[[Mughal]]'', ''Mirza'', ''Baig'' or ''Beg'', ''[[Pasha]]'', and ''[[Barlas]]''. People claiming [[Iran]]ian ancestry include those with family names ''Agha'', ''Firdausi'', ''Ghazali'', ''Hamadani'', ''Isfahani'', ''Kashani'', ''Kermani'', ''Khorasani'', ''Mir'', ''Montazeri'', ''Nishapuri'', ''Noorani'', ''[[Qizilbash]]'', ''Saadi'', ''Sabzvari'', ''Shirazi'', ''Sistani'', ''Yazdani'', ''Zahedi'', and ''Zand''.

Tribal names include ''Afaqi'', ''Afridi'', ''Amini'', ''Ashrafkhel'', ''Awan'', ''Bajwa'', ''Baloch'', ''Barakzai'', ''Baranzai'', ''Bhatti'', ''Bhutto'', ''Bijarani'', ''Bizenjo'', ''Brohi'', ''Bugti'', ''Butt'', ''Ghaznavi'', ''Ghilzai'', ''Gikchi'', ''Jakhrani'', ''Jamali'', ''Jamote'', ''Janjua'', ''Jatoi'', ''Joyo'', ''Junejo'', ''Karmazkhel'', ''Kayani'', ''Khar'', ''Khuhro'', ''Lakhani'', ''Leghari'', ''Lodhi'', ''Magsi'', ''Malik'', ''Mandokhel'', ''Mengal'', ''Palijo'', ''Panhwar'', ''Popalzai'', ''Rabbani'', ''Raisani'', ''Rakhshani'', ''Rathore'', ''Soomro'', ''Sulaimankhel'', ''Talpur'', ''Thebo'', and ''Zamani''.

==Portugal and Brazil==
{{details|Iberian naming customs}}

The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] order of surnames is the reverse of the Spanish one.  Each person has at least two family names: the first is the maternal family name; the last is the paternal family name. A person can have up to six names (two first names and four surnames &amp;mdash; he or she may have two names from the mother and two from the father). In [[Brazil]] the rule is the same except that it is now very common for a person to have only one family name, the paternal one. In the ancient ages the patronymicum was commonly used &amp;mdash; surnames like ''Gonçalves'' (&quot;son of ''Gonçalo''&quot;), ''Fernandes'' (&quot;son of ''Fernando''&quot;), ''Nunes'' (&quot;son of Nuno&quot;) and many more are used today as usual family names. Brazilians usually call people only by their given names, omitting family names, even in many formal situations. When formality or a prefix requires a family name, the given name usually precedes the surname, e.g. ''João Santos'' (&quot;John Saints&quot;), or ''Sr. João Santos'' (&quot;Mr. John Saints&quot;).

==Spain and Hispanic areas==
{{details|Iberian naming customs}}

In medieval times, a patronymic system similar to the one still used in Iceland emerged.  For example, ''Álvaro'', the son of ''Rodrigo'' would be named ''Álvaro Rodríguez''.  His son, ''Juan'', would not be named ''Juan Rodríguez'', but ''Juan Álvarez''. Over time, many of these patronymics became family names and are some of the most common names in the Spanish-speaking world.  Other sources of surnames are personal appearance or habit, e.g. ''Delgado'' (&quot;thin&quot;) and ''Moreno'' (&quot;dark&quot;); occupations, e.g. ''Molinero'' (&quot;miller&quot;) and ''Guerrero'' (&quot;warrior&quot;); and geographic location or ethnicity, e.g. ''Alemán'' (&quot;German&quot;).

However, nowadays in Spain and in some countries of Hispanic culture (former Spanish colonies, e.g. México, Colombia, Venezuela), most people have two surnames, although in some situations only the first is used. The first surname is the paternal one, inherited from the father's paternal surname. The second surname is the maternal one, inherited from the mother's paternal surname. Since both surnames come from the paternal surnames of the previous generation, their transmission can be seen as a [[patriarchal]] feature of the Hispanic society. 

Depending on the country, the surnames may or may not be linked by the conjunction ''y'' (&quot;and&quot;), ''i'' (&quot;and&quot;, in [[Catalonia]]), ''de'' (&quot;of&quot;) and ''de la'' (&quot;of the&quot;, when the following word is feminine). However, in many South American countries people have now adopted the English-speaking custom, thus having a single surname (e.g. in [[Argentina]]). Sometimes a new father transmits his complete surname by creating a new one, combining his two surnames, e.g. the paternal surname of the son of ''Javier'' (given name) ''Reyes'' (paternal surname) ''de la Barrera'' (maternal surname) may become the new paternal surname ''Reyes de la Barrera''.

At present day in Spain, women upon marrying keep their two family names intact. In certain situations she may be addressed as if her maternal surname were substituted with her husbands paternal surname often linked with ''de''. For example, a woman named ''Ana García Díaz'', upon marrying ''Juan Guerrero Macías'', could be called ''Ana García de Guerrero''. This custom, begun in medieval times, is decaying and only has legal validity in [[Ecuador]]. In Ecuador, a couple can choose the order of their children's surnames. Most choose the traditional order (e.g. ''Guerrero García'' in the example above), but some invert the order, putting the mother's paternal surname first and the father's paternal surname last (e.g. ''García Guerrero'' from the example above). Such inversion, if chosen, must be maintained for all the children.

==The Philippines==
Until the middle of the 19th century, there was no standardization of surnames in the [[Philippines]].  There were native Filipinos without surnames, others whose surnames deliberately did not match that of their families, as well as those who took certain surnames simply because they had a certain prestige, usually ones dealing with the Roman Catholic religion, such as ''de los Santos'' and ''de la Cruz''.

In 1849, the Spanish governor [[Spanish Governor - Captain General of the Philippines|Narciso Clavería y Zaldúa]] decreed an end to these arbitrary practices, the result of which was the ''[[Catálogo Alfabético de Apellidos]]'' (&quot;Alphabetic Catalog of Surnames&quot;). The book contained many words coming from Spanish and the Philippine languages such as [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].

The actual application of this decree varied from municipality to municipality. Some municipalities received only surnames starting with a particular letter. For example, the majority of residents of the island of [[Banton]] in [[Romblon|Romblon province]] have surnames starting with ''F'' such as ''Fabicon'', ''Fallarme'', ''Fadrilan'', and ''Ferran''. Thus, although there perhaps a majority of Filipinos have Spanish surnames, such a surname does not imply Spanish ancestry.

There are other sources for surnames. For example, in Muslim-dominated areas of the southern Philippines, surnames are usually of Arabic origin such as Hassan and Haradji.

Many Filipinos also have Chinese surnames which yield clues as to when their Chinese ancestor immigrated to the Philippines. For example, a hispanicized Chinese surname like ''Cojuangco'' suggests an 18th-century immigration while a Chinese surname like ''Lim'' suggests a relatively recent immigration. Some Chinese surnames like ''Tiu-Laurel'' are composed of the immigrant Chinese ancestor's surname as well as the name of that ancestor's godparent.

There are also Filipinos, particularly from rural tribes, who have no surnames at all.

The vast majority of Filipinos follow a naming system which is the reverse of the Spanish one. Children take the mother's surname as their [[middle name]], followed by their father's as their surname; for example, a son of ''Juan de la Cruz'' and his wife ''Maria Agbayani'' may be ''David Agbayani de la Cruz''. Women take the surnames of their husband upon marriage; so upon her marriage to ''David de la Cruz'', the full name of ''Laura Yuchengco Macaraeg'' would become ''Laura Yuchengco Macaraeg de la Cruz''.

==Iceland==
{{details|Icelandic name|Naming conventions of Iceland}}

In [[Iceland]], most people have no family name; a person's last name is a [[patronymic]], i.e. a modified form of the father's first name or, sometimes, the mother's. For example, when a man called ''Karl'' has a daughter called ''Anna'' and a son called ''Magnús'', their names will be ''Anna Karlsdóttir'' (&quot;daughter of Karl&quot;) and ''Magnús Karlsson'' (&quot;son of Karl&quot;).

== Finland ==
Most [[Finnish|Finns]] have surnames ending with ''-nen'', for example ''Räikkönen'', ''Häkkinen'', ''Lipponen'', etc. However, there is a considerable minority of surnames with suffixes like ''-mäki'' (&quot;-hill&quot;), ''-järvi'' (&quot;-lake&quot;), ''-joki'' (&quot;-river&quot;), that describes the place where an ancestor lived.

==Scandinavia==
In [[Scandinavia]] family names often, but certainly not always, originate from a patronymic. In [[Sweden]], the patronymic ending is -''sson'', e.g. ''Karlsson'' (&quot;Karl's son&quot;). In [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]], the corresponding ending is -''sen'', as in ''Karlsen''. Names ending with ''dotter/datter'' (daughter), such as ''Olofsdotter'', are rare but occurring, and only apply to females. Today, the patronymic names are passed on similarly to family names in other Western countries, and a person's father doesn't have to be called Karl if he or she has the surname Karlsson.

Before the 19th century there was the same system in Scandinavia as in Iceland today. Noble families, however, as a rule adopted a family name, which could refer to a presumed or real forefather (e.g. Earl [[Birger Magnusson]] ''[[Folkung]]e'') or to the family's [[coat of arms]] (e.g. King [[Gustav Vasa|Gustav Eriksson]] ''[[House of Vasa|Vasa]]''). In many surviving family noble names, such as ''Cederqvist'' (&quot;cedar-twig&quot;) or ''Stiernhielm'' (&quot;star-helmet&quot;), the spelling is obsolete, but since it applies to a name, remains unchanged.

Later on, people from the Scandinavian middle classes, particularly artisans and  town dwellers, adopted names in a similar fashion to that of the nobility. Family names such as the Swedish ''Bergman'', ''Holmberg'', ''Lindgren'', ''Sandström'' and ''Åkerlund'' were quite frequent and remain common today. The same is true for similar Norwegian and Danish names.

These names often indicated the place of residence of the family. For this reason, Denmark and Norway have a very high incidence of names derived from those of farms, many signified by the suffix -''gaard'' -- the modern spelling is ''gård'' in Danish and has changed to ''gard'' in Norwegian, but as in Sweden, archaic spelling persists in surnames. The most well-known example of this kind of surname is probably ''[[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]]'' (original meaning: ''the farm located by the Church'' or also ''churchyard'' and ''cemetary'' [although this is unlikely in the context] which, with ''kierke'', actually includes two archaic spellings), but many others could be cited. It should also be noted that, since the names in question are derived from the original owners' domiciles, the possession of this kind of name is no longer an indicator of affinity with others who bear it.

In many cases, names were taken from the nature around them.  A family name such as &quot;Dahlgren&quot; is dervied from &quot;dahl&quot; meaning valley and &quot;gren&quot; meaning branch.

==The Netherlands==
Many [[Netherlands|Dutch]] names start with a prefix like ''van'' (&quot;of/from&quot;), ''de''/''het''/''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;t'' (&quot;the&quot;), ''der'' (&quot;of the&quot;), ''van de'' (&quot;of the/from the&quot;), and ''in het'' (&quot;in the&quot;). Examples are ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;t Hooft'' (&quot;the head&quot;), ''de Groot'' (&quot;the great&quot;), ''van Rijn'' (&quot;from Rhine&quot;). These prefixes are not spelled with a capital when used in combination with the first name, e.g. ''Piet de Groot''. When written without first name, a capital is used, e.g., ''Mr. Van Rijn''. In name directories, the prefixes are always ignored for sorting. Many Dutch surnames originated from different personal qualities, geographical locations, and occupations. Surnames were not required until 1811 when Napoleon invaded the Netherlands. Before 1811, many Dutch people used their first name plus their father's name.

==Belgium==
Since [[Belgium]] has three official languages &amp;mdash; Dutch, French and German &amp;mdash; Belgian names are similar to those in the neighbouring countries: the Netherlands, France and Germany. Some differences exist: for example, Belgian Dutch names (Flemish names) commonly have prefixes as mentioned [[#The Netherlands|above]], except that the prefixes usually always start with a capital letter, and are often written connected to the main word. Thus, ''de Bakker'' or ''van der Steen'' is probably Dutch while ''De Bakker'' and ''Vandersteen'' are Belgian, although names, which have older spellings like ''De Backer'', are more common. The most common Flemish surnames are ''Peeters'', ''Janssens'', ''Maes'', ''Jacobs'', ''Willems'', ''Mertens'', ''Claes'', ''Wouters'', ''Goossens'', and ''De Smet''. Flemish family names often resemble first names, e.g. the following first names relate to above surnames: e.g. ''Peter'', ''Jan'', ''Jacob'', ''Willem'', ''Maarten'', ''Klaas'', and ''Wouter''. The trailing ''s'' reportedly once meant &quot;son of&quot;, so ''Willems'' would be &quot;Willem's son&quot;. Furthermore ancient spelling remains visible in many names, e.g. usage of ''c'' instead of ''k'' and ''ae'' instead of ''aa'' (compare ''Claes'' with ''Klaas''). The most common [[Walloons|Walloonian]] (French Belgian) names are ''Dubois'', ''Lambert'', ''Martin'', ''Dupont'', ''Dumont'', ''Leclercq'', ''Simon'', ''Laurent'', ''Lejeune'', and ''Renard''.

==Russia==
A full [[Russians|Russian]] name consists of personal (given) name, patronymic, and family name (surname).

Most Russian family names originated from patronymics, that is, father's name in the genitive case (usually formed by adding the genetive suffix ''-ov(a)'' or ''-ev(a)''). Contemporaty patronymics, however, have additional suffixes ''-ich'' or ''-na'' for masculine or feminine, respectively.

For example, the proverbial triad of most common Russian surnames follows:
*''Ivan'''ov''''' (&quot;son of ''Ivan''&quot;),
*''Petr'''ov''''' (&quot;son of ''Petr''&quot;),
*''Sidor'''ov''''' (&quot;son of ''Sidor''&quot;).

Feminine forms of these surnames have the ending ''-a'':
*''Ivanov'''a''''' (&quot;''Ivan's'' daughter&quot;),
*''Petrov'''a''''' (&quot;''Petr's'' daughter&quot;),
*''Sidorov'''a''''' (&quot;''Sidor's'' daughter&quot;).

Such a pattern of name formation is not unique to Russia or even to the Eastern and Southern Slavs in general; quite common are also names derived from professions, places of origin, and personal characteristics, with various suffixes (e.g. ''-in(a)'' and ''-sky (-skaia)'').

Professions:
* ''kuznets'' (&quot;[[Smith (metalwork)|smith]]&quot;) → ''Kuznetsov''—''Kuznetsova''
* ''portnoi'' (&quot;[[tailor]]&quot;) → ''Portnov''—''Portnova''
* ''pastukh'' (&quot;[[shepherd]]&quot;) → ''Pastukhov''—''Pastukhova''

Places of origin:
* ''Moskva'' (&quot;[[Moscow]]&quot;) → ''Moskvin''—''Moskvina'',
* ''Smolensk'' → ''Smolensky''—''Smolenskaia'',
* ''Riazan'' → ''Riazanov''—''Riazanova'',

Personal characteristics:
* ''tolsty'' (&quot;fat&quot;) → ''Tolstov''—''Tolstova'', ''Tolstoy''—''Tolstaya'',
* ''nose'' (&quot;big&quot;), ''nos'' → ''Nosov''—''Nosova'',
* ''sedoi'' (&quot;grey&quot;) → ''Sedov''—''Sedova''.

A considerable number of “artificial” names exists, for example, those given to seminary graduates; such names were based on major Orthodox holy days or Christian virtues.

Major Orthodox holy days:
* ''rozhdestvo'' (&quot;Christmas&quot;) → ''Rozhdestvensky''—''Rozhdestvenskaia'',
* ''voskresenie'' (&quot;Resurrection&quot;) → ''Voskresensky''—''Voskresenskaia'',
* ''uspenie'' (&quot;Assumption&quot;) → ''Uspensky''—''Uspenskaia'',

Christian virtues:
* ''philagathos'' (&quot;one who loves goodness&quot;) → ''Dobrolubov''—''Dobrolubova'', ''Dobrolubsky''—''Dobrolubskaia'',
* ''philosophos'' (&quot;one who loves wisdom&quot;) → ''Lubomudrov''—''Lubomudrova'',
* ''theophilos'' (&quot;one who loves God&quot;) → ''Bogolubov''—''Bogolubova''.

Many freed serfs were given surnames after those of their former owners. For example, a serf of the [[Demidov]] family might be named ''Demidovsky'', which translates roughly as &quot;belonging to Demidov&quot; or &quot;one of Demidov's bunch&quot;.

Grammatically, Russian family names follow the same rules as other nouns, with exceptions: some names do not change in different cases and have the same form in both genders (for example, ''Sedykh'').

==Poland==
{{details|Polish surnames}}

In [[Poland]] and most of the former [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] the surnames first appeared in late Middle Ages. They initially denoted the differences between various people living in the same town or village and bearing the same name. The conventions were similar to those of English surnames, using denoting occupations, patronymic descent, geographic origins, or personal characteristics. Thus, early surnames indicating occupation include ''Karczmarz'' (&quot;innkeeper&quot;), ''Kowal'' (&quot;blacksmith&quot;), and ''Bednarczyk'' (&quot;young cooper&quot;), while those indicating patronymic descent include ''Szczepaniak'' (&quot;Son of ''Szczepan''), ''Józefski'' (&quot;Son of ''Józef''), and ''Ka&amp;#378;mirkiewicz'' (&quot;Son of ''Kazimierz''&quot;). Similarly, early surnames like ''Mazur'' (&quot;the one from [[Masovia]]&quot;) indicated geographic origin, while ones like ''Nowak'' (&quot;the new one&quot;), ''Bia&amp;#322;y'' (&quot;the pale one&quot;), and ''Wielgus'' (&quot;the big one&quot;) indicated personal characteristics.

In the early 16th century, geographical names became common, especially among the ''[[szlachta]]''. Initially, the surnames were in a form of &quot;[first name] ''z'' (&quot;of&quot;) [location]&quot;, e.g. ''[[Jan z Kolna]]'' (&quot;John of [[Kolno]]&quot;). Later, most surnames were changed to adjective forms, e.g. ''Jakub Wi&amp;#347;licki'' (&quot;James of [[Wisla|Wis&amp;#322;a]]&quot;) and ''[[Zbigniew Olesnicki|Zbigniew Ole&amp;#347;nicki]]'' (&quot;''Zbigniew'' of [[Olesnica|Ole&amp;#347;nica]]&quot;), with masculine [[suffix]]es ''-ski'', ''-cki'' and ''-dzki'' or respective feminine suffixes ''-ska'', ''-cka'' and ''-dzka''. Names formed this way are adjectives grammatically, and therefore change their form depending on gender. ''Jan Kowalski'' and ''Maria Kowalska'' are collectively the plural ''Kowalscy''.

Names with masculine suffixes ''-ski'', ''-cki'', and ''-dzki'', and corresponding feminine suffixes ''-ska'', ''-cka'', and ''-dzka'' became associated with noble origin. Many people from lower classes successively changed their surnames to fit this pattern. This produced many ''Kowalski''s, ''Bednarski''s, ''Kaczmarski''s and so on. Today, although most Polish speakers do not know about noble associations of ''-ski'' endings, such names still sound somehow better to them.

A separate class of surnames derive from the names of [[szlachta]]s [[coat of arms|coats of arms]]. These are used either as separate names or the first part of a double-barrelled name. Thus, persons named ''Jan Nieczuja'' and ''Krzysztof Nieczuja-Machocki'' might be related. Similarly, after [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], many members of [[Polish Secret State|Polish underground organizations]] adopted their [[nom de guerre|war-time pseudonyms]] as the first part of their surnames. ''Edward Rydz'' thus became [[Marshal of Poland]] ''[[Edward Smigly-Rydz|Edward &amp;#346;mig&amp;#322;y-Rydz]]'' and ''Jan Nowak'' became ''[[Jan Nowak-Jezioranski|Jan Nowak-Jeziora&amp;#324;ski]]''.

==Ashkenazi Jewish surnames==
Until a few hundred years ago, [[Ashkenazi]]m ([[Jew]]s from Northern and Eastern Europe) followed no tradition of surnames, but used patronymics within the [[synagogue]], and [[matronymic]]s in other venues. For example, a boy named ''Joseph'' of a father named ''Isaac'' would be called to the [[Torah]] as ''Joseph ben Isaac''. That same boy of a mother named ''Rachel'' would be known in business as ''Joseph ben Rachel''. A male used the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''ben'' (&quot;son&quot;) and a female used ''bat'' (&quot;daughter&quot;).

When Northern European countries legislated that Jews required &quot;proper&quot; surnames, Jews were left with a number of options. Many Jews (particularly in [[Austria]], [[Prussia]], and Russia) were forced to adopt [[German language|Germanic]] names.  In 1781, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II of Austria]] announced an ''[[Edict of Toleration]]'' for the Jews, which established the requirement for hereditary family names.  The Jews of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] did not adopt surnames until 1785.  He issued a law in 1787 which assumed that all Jews were to adopt German names. The city [[mayor]]s were to choose the name for every Jewish family. A fee was charged for names related to precious metals and flowers, while free surnames were usually connected to animals and common metals. 

Many took [[Yiddish]] names derived from occupation (e.g. ''Goldschmidt'' &quot;Gold-smith&quot;), from their father (e.g. ''Jacobson''), or from location (e.g. ''[[Berlin]]er'', ''[[Warsaw|Warszawski]]'' or ''[[Pinsk]]er''). This makes Ashkenazi surnames similar to Scandinaage. Thus, any [[automata theory|automaton]] attempting to recognize the context-free language must necessarily keep track of more information than one that is attempting to recognize the regular language. The latter does not have to count the number of 'a's or 'b's, just to make sure there are more than zero of each.

For more detail, see [[context-free language]] and [[regular language]].

=== Other forms of generative grammars ===
Many extensions and variations on Chomsky's original hierarchy of formal grammars have been developed more recently, both by linguists and by computer scientists, usually either in order to increase their expressive power or in order to make them easier to analyze or [[parse]]. Of course these two goals tend to be at odds: the more expressive a grammar formalism is, the harder it is to analyze or parse using automated tools.  Some forms of grammars more recently developed include:

* [[Tree-adjoining grammar]]s increase the expressiveness of conventional generative grammars by allowing rewrite rules to operate on [[parse tree]]s instead of just strings.
* [[Affix grammar]]s and [[attribute grammar]]s allow rewrite rules to be augmented with semantic attributes and operations, useful both for increasing grammar expressiveness and for constructing practical language translation tools.

A yearly conference is devoted to formal grammars: [http://www.formalgrammar.tk]

== Analytic grammars ==
Though there is a tremendous body of literature on [[parsing]] [[algorithms]], most of these algorithms assume that the language to be parsed is initially ''described'' by means of a ''generative'' formal grammar, and that the goal is to transform this generative grammar into a working parser.  An alternative approach is to formalize the language in terms of an '''analytic grammar''' in the first place, which more directly corresponds to the structure of a [[parser]] for the language.  Examples of analytic grammar formalisms include the following:

* [http://languagemachine.sourceforge.net The Language Machine] directly implements unrestricted analytic grammars. Substitution rules are used to transform an input to produce outputs and behaviour. The system can also produce [http://languagemachine.sourceforge.net/picturebook.html the lm-diagram] which shows what happens when the rules of an unrestricted analytic grammar are being applied.
* [[Top-down parsing language]] (TDPL): a highly minimalist analytic grammar formalism developed in the early [[1970s]] to study the behavior of [[top-down parser]]s.
* [[Parsing expression grammar]]s (PEGs): a more recent generalization of TDPL designed around the practical [[expressiveness]] needs of [[programming language]] and [[compiler]] writers.
* [[Link grammar]]s: a form of analytic grammar designed for [[linguistics]], which derives syntactic structure by examining the positional relationships between pairs of words.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''François d'Aguilon''' (also d'Aguillon or Aguilonius) ([[1546]] &amp;ndash; [[1617]]) was a [[Belgian]] [[mathematician]] and [[physicist]].  He was born in [[Brussels]], Belgium and became a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] in [[1586]].  In [[1611]], he started a special school of [[mathematics]], in [[Antwerp]], which intended to perpetuate the mathematical research and study in the Jesuit society.

[[Image:Freenet_screenshot_the_freedom_engine_jan06.png|thumb|right|250px|Screenshot showing a 'freesite', a freenet-hosted page. The page displayed is an indexing site called &quot;The Freedom Engine&quot;.]]

'''Freenet''' is a decentralized [[censorship]]-resistant [[peer-to-peer]] [[distributed data store]] aiming to provide electronic [[freedom of speech]] through strong [[anonymity]].  Freenet works by pooling the contributed [[bandwidth]] and storage space of member computers to allow users to anonymously publish or retrieve various kinds of information.  Freenet uses a kind of [[key based routing]] similar to a [[distributed hash table]] to locate peers' data.

Freenet is currently under development, and a ''version 1.0'' has not yet been released. Freenet is considered by many to be fundamentally different from other peer-to-peer networks; it is still somewhat more difficult to use and slower.

Although Freenet does not have integrated search function, several freesites serve as directories listing published freesites. On creating a new freesite, the author can add a listing to the directory allowing others to discover the freesite. The directory owners also periodically spider or automatically attempt to retrieve the freesites they list. One of the most famous directories is the Freedom Engine, shown opposite.

Currently, Freenet cannot be used to create or distribute dynamic content, such as content that utilizes databases and scripting. According to the Freenet Project group, such tradeoffs are expected since Freenet's primary goals are neither ease-of-use nor performance. Unlike other [[peer-to-peer]] networks, Freenet is primarily intended to combat censorship and allow people to communicate freely and with near-total anonymity.

== Purpose ==
Although many nations censor communications to different extents, they all share one commonality in that a body must decide what information to censor and what information to allow. What may be acceptable to one group of people may be considered offensive or even dangerous to another. Freenet is a network which, putatively, removes the possibility of any group imposing their beliefs or values on any other. In essence nobody is allowed to decide what is acceptable for anybody else. Tolerance for each others' values is encouraged and failing that, the user is asked to [[turn a blind eye]] to content which opposes his or her views.

== Technical design ==
The type of [[routing]] protocol Freenet uses is [[key based routing]].  While the idea emerged independently, Freenet's routing algorithm is similar to that employed by [[distributed hash table]]s (DHTs). The main differences are that Freenet nodes do not have fixed specialisations, and the routing algorithm is heuristic in nature. Therefore, it does not guarantee that it will find a given piece of data. Freenet can also be viewed as a [[small world phenomenon|small world network]].

The Freenet [[file sharing]] network is designed to be highly survivable, with all internal processes completely anonymized and decentralized across the network. The system has no central servers, is [[peer-to-peer]], and is not subject to the control of any one individual or organization. Even the designers of Freenet do not have any control over the overall system. The system is designed so that information stored in the system is encrypted and replicated across a large number of continuously-changing anonymized computers around the world. It is extremely difficult for an attacker to find out which participants are hosting a given file, since the contents of each file are encrypted, and can also be broken into sections that are distributed over many different computers. Even the participants themselves don't know what they are storing.

The end goal of the Freenet network is to store documents and allow them to be retrieved later by an associated key, as is now possible with protocols such as [[HyperText Transfer Protocol|HTTP]]. The network is implemented as a number of nodes that pass messages among themselves peer-to-peer. Typically, a host computer on the network will run the software that acts as a node, and it will connect to other hosts running that same software to form a large distributed network of peer nodes. Certain nodes will be end user nodes, from which documents will be requested and presented to the human user. But these nodes communicate with each other and with intermediate routing nodes identically&amp;mdash;there are no dedicated &quot;clients&quot; or &quot;servers&quot; on the network.

The Freenet protocol is intended to be implemented on a network with a complex network topology, such as the Internet ([[Internet Protocol]]). Each node knows only about some number of other nodes that it can reach directly (its conceptual &quot;neighbors&quot;), but any node can be a neighbor to any other; there is no hierarchy or other structure. Each document (or other message such as a document request) in Freenet is routed through the network by passing from neighbor to neighbor until reaching its destination. As each node passes a document to its neighbor, it does not know or care whether its neighbor is just another routing node forwarding information on behalf of another, whether it is the source of the document being passed, or whether it is a user node that will present the document to an end user. This is intentional, so that anonymity of both users and publishers can be protected.

Each node maintains a data store containing documents associated with keys, and a routing table associating nodes with records of their performance in retrieving different keys.

To find a document in the network given a key, a user sends a message to a node (probably one running on the same machine as the client program) requesting the document, providing it with the key. If the document is not found in the local data store, the node then finds the node in its routing table that it thinks will be able to locate the key most quickly, and forwards the request to that node, remembering that it has done so. Note that this is a change from the behavior of earlier versions of Freenet nodes: it represents the &quot;Next Generation Routing&quot; protocol. The old behavior was to remember which keys were retrieved from what nodes, and to route based on which node gave us the key closest to the one we were looking for. The effect is largely the same, but NGR, as it is called, results in better overall performance.

The node to which the request was forwarded repeats the process until either the key is found or the request passes through a set maximum of nodes, known as the &quot;Hops To Live&quot; value.   Along the route, if a node is visited more than once (and it will know this because it remembered forwarding the request the first time) then that node cuts off the loop by sending a message to the node that sent it the second request telling it to try the next-best choice, then the next-next-best, and so on.

Eventually, either the document is found or the hop limit is exceeded. The terminal node sends a reply that works its way back to the originator along the route specified by the intermediate nodes' records of pending requests. The intermediate nodes may choose to cache the document along the way. Besides saving bandwidth, this also makes documents harder to censor as there is no one &quot;source node.&quot;

Essentially, the same path-finding process is used to insert a document into the network: a request for the nonexistent document is made, and once it fails, the document is sent along the same path as the request. This ensures that documents are inserted into the network in the same place as requests will look for it. If the initial request doesn't fail, then the data already existed, and the insert &quot;collides.&quot;

Initially, each node has no information about the performance of the other nodes it knows about. This means that routing of requests will be essentially random. But since different nodes have different randomness, they will disagree about where to send a request, given a key. So the data in a newly-started Freenet will therefore be distributed somewhat randomly.

As more documents are inserted by the same node, they will begin to cluster with data items whose keys are similar, because the same routing rules are used for all of them. More importantly, as data items and requests from different nodes &quot;cross paths&quot;, they will begin to share clustering information as well.

The result is that the network will self-organize into a distributed, clustered structure where nodes tend to hold data items that are close together in key space. There will probably be multiple such clusters throughout the network, any given document being replicated numerous times, depending on how much it is used. This is a kind of &quot;[[spontaneous symmetry breaking]]&quot;, in which an initially symmetric state (all nodes being the same, with random initial keys for each other) leads to a highly asymmetric situation, with nodes coming to specialize in data that has closely related keys.

There are forces which tend to cause clustering (shared closeness data spreads throughout the network), and forces that tend to break up clusters (local caching of commonly used data). These forces will be different depending on how often data is used, so that seldom-used data will tend to be on just a few nodes which specialize in providing that data, and frequently used items will be spread widely throughout the network. This automatic mirroring counteracts the times when [[web traffic]] becomes overloaded, and due to a mature network's intelligent routing a network of size n should only require log(n) time to retrieve any given document. Freenet does not employ broadcast searches as used by [[Gnutella]] and other similar file sharing protocols.

Keys are [[hash function|hash]]es: there is no notion of [[semantic closeness]] when speaking of key closeness. Therefore there will be no correlation between key closeness and similar popularity of data as there might be if keys did exhibit some semantic meaning, thus avoiding bottlenecks caused by popular subjects.

There are two main varieties of keys in use on Freenet, the [[Content Hash Key]] (CHK) and the [[Signed Subspace Key]] (SSK).

A CHK is an [[SHA-1]] hash of a document and thus a node can check that the document returned is correct by hashing it and checking the digest against the key. This key contains the meat of the data on freenet. It carries all the binary data building blocks for the content to be delivered to the client for reassembly and decryption. The CHK is unique by nature and provides tamperproof content. A hostile node altering the data under a CHK will immediately be detected by the next node or the client. CHKs also reduce the redundancy of data since the same data will have the same CHK.

SSKs are based on [[public-key cryptography]]. Currently Freenet uses the [[Digital Signature Algorithm|DSA]] system as its [[public key infrastructure]]. Documents inserted under SSKs are signed by the inserter, and this signature can be verified by every node to ensure that the data is not tampered with. SSKs can be used to establish a verifiable [[pseudonymity|pseudonymous]] identity on Freenet, and allow for documents to be updated securely by the person who inserted them. A subtype of the SSK is the Keyword Signed Key, or KSK, in which the key pair is generated in a standard way from a simple human-readable string. Inserting a document using a KSK allows the document to be retrieved and decrypted if and only if the requester knows the human-readable string; this allows for more convenient (but less secure) [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]]s for users to refer to.

== Scalability ==

A [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] network is said to be scalable if the performance of the network does not deteriorate even for very large network sizes.  The scalability of Freenet is being evaluated, but similar architectures have been shown to scale logarithmically [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/kleinberg00smallworld.html].

== History ==

Freenet is an enhanced [[free software]] / [[Open-source software|open source software]] implementation of the system described by [[Ian Clarke]]'s July [[1999]] paper &quot;A distributed decentralized information storage and retrieval system&quot;, written while Clarke was a student at the University of Edinburgh. Shortly after the publication of this paper, Clarke and a small number of volunteers began work on what became Freenet. By March [[2000]] version 0.1 of Freenet was ready for release. Since March 2000 Freenet has been extensively reported on in the press, albeit primarily due to its implications for [[copyright]] rather than for its wider aim of freedom of communication.

Freenet has been developed via a collaborative, open source, methodology. Clarke, originally from Ireland, worked with individuals from many other countries, in a distributed manner utilizing the Internet. Not only is Freenet itself distributed, decentralized Internet software, but the method used to develop it is also distributed and decentralized.

Reports of Freenet's use in authoritarian nations is difficult to track due to the very nature of Freenet's goals.  One group, [[Freenet-China]], has translated the Freenet software to Chinese and is distributing it within China on CD and floppy disk.

According to [[CiteSeer|Citeseer]], Ian Clarke's &quot;Freenet: A Distributed Anonymous Information Storage and Retrieval System&quot; was the most cited [[computer science]] paper of 2000.

One analysis{{ref|2}} of Freenet files conducted in the year 2000 claimed that the top 3 types of files contained in Freenet were text (37%), audio (21%), and images (14%). 59% of all the text files were drug-related, 71% of all audio files were rock music, and 89% of all images were pornographic. It is important to note the fundamental design of Freenet makes accurate analysis of its content difficult. This analysis was done several years ago from within the [[United States]], and the network has been vastly changed and expanded since it was published and many different types of content have been added.

== Current development ==
Freenet is currently undergoing a major re-write incorporating a number of fundamental changes. Version 0.7 of Freenet aims to create a scalable [[darknet]], where users only connect directly to other users they know and trust. The purpose of this change is to protect users who may be placed at risk simply by using the software, irrespective of what they are using it for.  In the new model, users will choose who they connect to, and only those users will know that they are running the software. Previous darknets, such as [[WASTE]], have been limited to relatively small disconnected networks. The core innovation in Freenet 0.7 will be to allow a globally scalable darknet, capable of supporting millions of users.  This is made possible by the fact that human relationships tend to form [[small-world network]]s, a property that can be exploited to find short paths between any two people. The work is based on a speech given at [[DEF CON|DEF CON 13]] by [[Ian Clarke|Clarke]] and Swedish mathematician [[Oskar Sandberg]].

Other modifications include switching from [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] to [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]], which allows [[UDP hole punching]] along with faster transmission of messages between peers in the network. While previously Freenet only supported the insertion and retrieval of information, Freenet 0.7 will support new modes of usage including the real-time broadcast of messages. Features planned for later versions include anonymous &quot;channels&quot; to a particular node allowing for dynamic content, searching, and [[Onion Routing]]. Applications of this range from [[Internet Relay Chat]] to [[RSS (file format)|RSS]]-feeds.

It is anticipated that Freenet 0.7 will be released in 2006.

== Controversy  ==

The same technology which allows the anonymous to communicate with a large group without the publisher's identity being revealed can also allow controversial information such as [[child pornography]] to be made available to anyone. Freenet's founders argue that only with true anonymity comes true [[freedom of speech]], and that what they view as the beneficial uses of Freenet outweigh its negative uses. 

Due to the nature of Freenet, a typical user may unknowingly host this sort of information, which may hypothetically make them subject to severe civil and criminal penalties. Freenet attempts to prevent this through &quot;[[plausible deniability]]&quot;, preventing the user himself/herself from knowing what's on his or her own node and making it difficult to determine if a piece of information is in any given node without causing the distribution of that piece of information throughout the network to change in the process. No court cases have tested any of this to date.

Some anonymous [[friend-to-friend]] (F2F) networks do allow you to control what kind of files your friends exchange with your node in order to stop them from exchanging files you disapprove of, but Freenet's &quot;deniability&quot; defence would not apply to users of these systems.

F2F prevents random people from proving that your IP address can effectively be used to get some controversial files. Freenet does not offer this protection because for efficiency reasons (path shortening) some random nodes are allowed to connect directly to your node, thus exchanging files faster, but thus knowing your IP and thus being able to prove that specific files can be obtained from your computer. However, due to Freenet's &quot;plausible deniability&quot; and the way in which Freenet redistributes files among nodes, one cannot prove that those files were placed there by the node owner or that the node owner knows what they are.

'''Fat''' is one of the three main [[Food guide pyramid|classes of food]]. It has many meanings, and the only good description is in technical terms. There are triglycerides, fatty acids, sterols, but &quot;fat&quot; may also refer to adipose tissue.

The main constituents of both [[animal fat]] and [[vegetable oils]] are [[triglyceride]]s, that is [[glycerin]] molecules with three [[fatty acids]] attached. Nutritional fat is a mixture of many types of [[triglyceride]]s, which differ in the length of their [[fatty acid]] chains, as well as the number and position of single and double bonds between their carbon atoms. Fat molecules contain only oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon atoms.

[[Vitamin]]s [[Vitamin A|A]], [[Vitamin D|D]], [[Vitamin E|E]], and [[Vitamin K|K]] are fat-soluble meaning they can only be digested, absorbed, and transported in conjunction with fats. Fats are sources of [[essential fatty acid]]s, an important dietary requirement.

Fats play a vital role in maintaining healthy [[skin]] and [[hair]], insulating body organs against shock, maintaining body temperature, and promoting healthy cell function. They also serve as energy stores for the body. In [[food]], there are two types of fats: [[Saturated_fat|saturated]] and [[Unsaturated_fat|unsaturated]]. Saturated fat is a sort of a straight chain of carbon connected or bonded with 2 molecules of hydrogen. At the very beginning of this chain is a molecule of oxygen and a molecule of hydroxide. Unsaturated fat is the same thing with one major exception; some of those carbon atoms are not bonded with two hydrogen atoms so it becomes a very &quot;fluid&quot; state. Fats are broken down in the body to release [[Glycerin|glycerol]] and free [[fatty acid]]s.  The glycerol can be converted to [[glucose]] by the liver and thus used as a source of energy.  The fatty acids are a good source of energy for many tissues, especially heart and skeletal muscle.

==Energy==
With an nutritional energy density of approximately 37 [[Joule|kJ]] (9 [[kilocalorie]]s) per [[gram]], compared to [[sugar]] with 17 kJ/g (4 kcal/g) or [[ethanol]] with 29 kJ/g (7 kcal/g), it is the most concentrated form of metabolic [[energy]] available to humans.

==Adipose tissue==
{{main|Adipose tissue}}
[[Adipose tissue|Adipose]], or fatty, tissue is the human body's means of storing metabolic energy over extended periods of time. Depending on current [[physiological]] conditions, [[adipocytes]] store fat derived from the diet and liver [[metabolism]] or degrades stored fat to supply [[fatty acids]] and [[glycerol]] to the [[circulatory system|circulation]]. These metabolic activities are regulated by several hormones (i.e., [[insulin]], [[glucagon]] and [[epinephrine]]). The location of the tissue determines its metabolic profile: &quot;Visceral fat&quot; (around the abdomen) is prone to lead to [[insulin resistance]], while &quot;peripheral fat&quot; (around the limbs) is much more harmless.

==Metabolism==
{{main|Fatty acid metabolism}}

The [[metabolism]] of lipids is a closely regulated system in virtually all lifeforms. It is affected by a variety of [[enzyme]]s and, in higher organisms, regulated by [[hormone]]s. Research is ongoing on the relative influence of various hormonal regulators on the [[anabolism]] (production) and [[catabolism]] (breakdown, also termed ''lipolysis'') of fatty molecules.

A subject of particularly close study is [[cholesterol]], levels and types of which are influenced by the fatty acid metabolism and is known for its role in development of [[atherosclerosis]].

A '''front line''' is a line of confrontation in an [[armed conflict]], most often a [[war]]. On either side of the front line stand the forces of the various [[combatant]]s. In modern [[warfare]], due to the broken nature of mechanized combat, front lines rarely form; instead a zone of confrontation comprises a wide band where forces engage in [[battle]].

[[World War I]] featured the most clearly defined front lines known to date: the front line in [[France]] became marked by dug [[trench]]es almost throughout.

The adjective ''front-line'' is also used to describe [[weapons]], [[ships]] or [[aircraft]] that are of the latest fighting standard, or [[army]] units intended to serve at the front line.

[[Image:Frankenstein Cover.jpg|thumb|The cover of one of Barnes &amp; Noble Classics reprinted editions.]]
'''''Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus''''' is a [[novel]] by [[Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley]]. First published in [[London]] in 1818 (but more often read in the revised third edition of 1831), it is a novel infused with some elements of the [[Gothic novel]] and the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement.  It was also a warning against the &quot;over-reaching&quot; of modern man and the [[Industrial Revolution]]. (The novel's subtitle, ''The Modern [[Prometheus]]'', alludes to the over-reaching and punishment of the character from [[Greek mythology]].) The story has had an influence across [[literature]] and [[popular culture]] and spawned a complete genre of [[horror fiction|horror]] stories and [[film]]s. Many distinguished authors, such as [[Brian Aldiss]], claim that it is the very first [[science fiction]] novel.

==Plot synopsis==
{{spoiler}}

:''&quot;It was on a dreary night of November, that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.&quot;''  

The novel opens with Captain Walton on a ship sailing north of the Arctic Circle. Walton's ship becomes ice-bound, and as he contemplates his isolation and paralysis, he spots a figure traveling across the ice on a dog sledge. This is [[Victor Frankenstein]]'s [[Frankenstein's Monster|creature]]. Soon after he sees the ill Victor Frankenstein himself, and invites him onto his boat. The narrative of Walton is a [[Frame Narrative|frame narrative]] that allows for the story of Victor to be related.  At the same time, Walton's predicament is symbolically appropriate for Victor's tale of displaced passion and brutalism.

Victor takes over telling the story here.  Curious and intelligent from a young age, he is self taught by masters of [[Medieval]] alchemy, reading such authors as [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Paracelsus]], and shunning modern [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] teachings of natural science (see also [[Middle Ages in history#Romantics|Romanticism and the Middle Ages]]). He leaves his beloved family in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] to study in [[Ingolstadt]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]] where he is first introduced to modern science. In a moment of inspiration, combining his new found knowledge of natural science with that of the alchemy dreams of his old masters, Victor discovers the means by which inanimate matter can be imbued with life. With great drive and fervor, he sets about constructing a creature &amp;mdash; perhaps intended as a companion &amp;mdash; through means which Shelley refers to only ambiguously. Subsequent visual interpretations of the story have included the creation of Frankenstein's monster through alchemy, by the piecing together of corpses, or a combination of the two.  In the novel it is stated (chapter 4, volume 1) that he uses bones from charnel-houses where corpses were kept at the time.

He intends the creature to be beautiful, but when the creature awakens, Victor is disgusted. It has yellow, watery eyes, translucent skin, and is of an abominable size. Victor finds this revolting and although the creature expressed him no harm (in fact it grins at him and reaches his hands out innocently to his creator), Victor runs out of the room in terror whereupon the creature disappears. Overwork causes Victor to take ill for several months. After recovering, in about a year's time, he receives a letter from home informing him of the murder of his youngest brother William. He departs for Switzerland at once.

Near Geneva, Victor catches a glimpse of the creature in a thunderstorm among the rocky boulders of the mountains, and is convinced it killed William. Upon arriving home he finds Justine, the family's beloved maid, framed for the murder. Despite Victor's feelings of overwhelming guilt, he does not tell anyone about his horrid creation and Justine is convicted and executed. To recover from the ordeal, Victor goes hiking into the mountains where he encounters his &quot;cursed creation&quot; again, this time atop a [[glacier]].

The creature converses with Victor and tells him his story, speaking in strikingly eloquent language.  He describes his feelings first of confusion, then rejection and hate. He explains how he learned to talk by studying a poor peasant family through a crack in the wall. He performs in secret many kind deeds for this family, but in the end, they drive him away when they see his appearance. He gets the same response from any human who sees him. The creature confesses that it was indeed he who killed William and framed Justine, and that he did so out of [[revenge]]. But now, the creature only wants one thing; he begs Victor to create a female companion for him so that he may have companionship.

At first, Victor agrees, but later, he tears up the half-made companion in disgust and madness. In retribution, the creature kills Clerval, Victor's best friend. On Victor's  wedding night, the creature kills his wife. Victor now becomes the hunter: he pursues the creature into the Arctic ice, though in vain.  Near exhaustion, he is stranded when an iceberg breaks away, carrying him out into the ocean. At that moment, Captain Walton's ship arrives and he is rescued.

Walton assumes the narration again, describing a temporary recovery in Victor's health, allowing him to relate his extraordinary story.  However Victor's health soon fails, and he dies. Unable to convince his shipmates to continue north and bereft the charismatic Frankenstein, Walton is forced to turn back towards [[England]] under the threat of [[mutiny]]. Finally, the creature boards the ship and finds Victor dead, and greatly laments what he has done to his maker. He vows to commit [[suicide]]. He leaves the ship by leaping through the cabin window onto the ice, and is never seen again.

==Genesis==
:&quot;How I, then a young girl, came to think of, and to dilate upon, so very hideous an idea?&quot;
During the snowy summer of 1816, the &quot;[[Year Without A Summer]],&quot; the world was locked in a long cold [[volcanic winter]] caused by the eruption of [[Tambora]] in 1815. In this terrible year, the then Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, age 19, and her husband-to-be [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], visited [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] at the Villa Diodati by [[Lake Geneva]] in [[Switzerland]]. The weather was consistently too cold and dreary that summer to enjoy the outdoor vacation activities they had planned, so after reading ''[[Fantasmagoriana]]'', an anthology of German ghost stories, Byron challenged the Shelleys and his personal physician [[John William Polidori]] to each compose a story of their own, the contest being won by whoever wrote the scariest tale. Mary conceived an idea after she fell into a [[nightmare|waking dream]] or nightmare during which she saw &quot;the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together.&quot; This was the germ of ''Frankenstein''. Byron managed to write just a fragment based on the [[vampire]] legends he heard while travelling the [[Balkans]], and from this Polidori created ''[[The Vampyre]]'' (1819), the progenitor of the romantic vampire literary [[genre]]. Thus, the Frankenstein and vampire themes were created from that single circumstance.

==Publication==
Mary  Shelley completed her writing in May 1817, and ''Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus'' was first published on [[1 January]] [[1818]] by the small [[London]] [[publishing house]] of Lackington, Hughes, Harding, Mavor &amp; Jones. It was issued anonymously, with a preface written for Mary by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and with a dedication to philosopher [[William Godwin]], her father. It was published in an edition of just 500 copies in three volumes, the standard &quot;triple-decker&quot; format for 19th century first editions. The novel had been previously rejected by Percy Bysshe Shelley's publisher Charles Ollier and by Byron's publisher [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]].

Critical reception of the book was mostly unfavourable, compounded by confused speculation as to the identity of the author, which was not well disguised. [[Walter Scott]] wrote that &quot;Upon the whole, the work impresses us with a high idea of the author's original genius and happy power of expression&quot;, but most reviewers thought it &quot;a tissue of horrible and disgusting absurdity&quot; (''Quarterly Review'').

Despite the reviews, ''Frankenstein'' achieved an almost immediate popular success. It became widely known especially through melodramatic theatrical adaptations &amp;ndash; Mary Shelley saw a production of ''Presumption; or The Fate of Frankenstein'', a play by Richard Brinsley Peake, in 1823. A French translation appeared as early as 1821 (''Frankenstein: ou le Prométhée Moderne'', translated by Jules Saladin).

The second edition of ''Frankenstein'' was published on [[11 August]] [[1823]] in two volumes (by G. and W. B. Whittaker), and this time credited Mary Shelley as the author.

On [[31 October]] [[1831]], the first &quot;popular&quot; edition in one volume appeared, published by Henry Colburn &amp; Richard Bentley. This edition was quite heavily revised by Mary Shelley, and included a new, longer preface by her, presenting a somewhat embellished version of the genesis of the story. This edition tends to be the one most widely read now, although editions containing the original 1818 text are still being published.

The revised edition was changed in several significant ways: any indication that Frankenstein's monster was created by vice was removed, and the text details a benevolent creator who creates the monster merely for the purposes of science. Suggestions of an incestuous relationship between Victor and Elizabeth are also removed, by making Elizabeth an adopted child of the Frankensteins.

==Name origins==
===The creature===
{{main|Frankenstein's Monster}}
The creature &amp;ndash; &quot;my hideous progeny&quot; &amp;ndash; was not given a name by Mary Shelley, and is only referred to by words such as 'monster', 'creature', 'daemon', and 'wretch'.

After the release of [[James Whale]]'s popular 1931 film ''Frankenstein'', the filmgoing public immediately began speaking of the monster itself as Frankenstein. A reference to this occurs in ''[[The Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935) and in several subsequent films in the series, as well as in film titles such as ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]].''

Some justify referring to the Creature as &quot;Frankenstein&quot; by pointing out that the Creature is, so to speak, Victor Frankenstein's offspring.

===Frankenstein===
Mary Shelley always maintained that she derived the name &quot;Frankenstein&quot; from a dream-vision, yet despite these public claims of originality, the name and what it means has been a source of many speculations. Literally, in [[German language|German]], the name ''Frankenstein'' means ''stone of the [[Franks]]''ffffff&quot;| ''ræði, æðu, glaða''

&lt;Ð&gt; and &lt;G&gt; are used in Faroese orthography to indicate one of a number of glide rather than any one phoneme.  This can be:
#[{{IPA|j}}]
#*&quot;I-surrounding, type 1&quot; - after /i, y, í, ý, ei, ey, oy/: ''bíða'' [{{IPA|ˈbʊija}}] (to wait), ''deyður'' [{{IPA|ˈdɛijʊɹ}}] (dead), ''seyður'' [{{IPA|ˈsɛijʊɹ}}] (sheep)
#*&quot;I-surrounding, type 2&quot; - between any vowel (except &quot;u-vowels&quot; /ó, u, ú/) and /i/: ''kvæði'' [{{IPA|ˈkvɛajɪ}}] (ballad), ''øði'' [{{IPA|ˈøːjɪ}}] (rage).
#[{{IPA|w}}] &quot;U-surrounding, type 1&quot; - after /ó, u, ú/: ''[[Odin|Óðin]]'' [{{IPA|ˈɔuwɪn}}] (Odin), ''góðan morgun!'' [{{IPA|ˌgɔuwan ˈmɔɹgʊn}}] (good morning!), ''suður'' [{{IPA|ˈsuːwʊɹ}}] (south), ''slóða'' [{{IPA|ˈslɔuwa}}] (to make a trace).

The so-called &quot;skerping&quot; (Thráinsson et al. use the term &quot;Faroese Verschärfung&quot; - in Faroese, ''skerping'' {{IPA|/ʃɛɹpɪŋg/}} means &quot;sharpening&quot;) is a typical phenomenon of fronting back vowels before {{IPA|[gv]}} and monophthongizing certain diphthongs before {{IPA|[ʤː]}}. Skerping is not indicated orthographically.  These consonants occur often after /ó, ú/ (ógv, úgv) and /ey, í, ý, ei, oy/ when no other consonant is following.
*[{{IPA|ɛgv}}]: ''Jógvan'' [{{IPA|ˈjɛgvan}}] (a form of the name John), ''[[Gjógv]]'' [{{IPA|ʤɛgv}}] (cleft)

There are several [[phonology|phonological]] processes involved in Faroese, including:
*Voiced stops are devoiced word-finally and before voiceless consonants
*Liquids are devoiced before voiceless consonants
*Nasals generally assume the place of articulation and laryngeal settings of following consonants.
*Velar stops palatalize to postalveolar affricates before {{IPA|/j/ /e/ /ɪ/ /y/ /ɛi/}} and {{IPA|/ɛi/}}
*/v/ becomes /f/ before voiceless consonants
*/s/ becomes {{IPA|/ʃ/}} after {{IPA|/ɛi, ai, ɔi/}} and before /j/ and may assimilate the retroflexion of a preceding /r/ to become {{IPA|[ʂ]}}.

====Omissions in Consonant clusters====
Faroese tends to omit the first or second consonant in clusters of different consonants:
*''fjalls'' [{{IPA|fjals}}] (mountain's ''gen.'') instead of *[{{IPA|fjadls}}] from [{{IPA|fjadl}}] (''nom.''). Other examples for genitives are: ''barns'' [{{IPA|ˈbans}}] (children's), ''vatns'' [{{IPA|van̥s}}] (lake's, water's).
*''hjálpti'' [{{IPA|jɔl̥tɪ}}] (helped) ''past sg.'' instead of *[{{IPA|ˈjɔlpta}}] from ''hjálpa'' [{{IPA|ˈjɔlpa}}]. Other examples for past forms are: ''sigldi'' [{{IPA|ˈsɪldɪ}}] (sailed), ''yrkti'' [{{IPA|ˈɪɹ̥tɪ}}] (wrote poetry).
*[[homophone]] are ''fylgdi'' (followed) and ''fygldi'' (catched birds with net): [{{IPA|ˈfɪldɪ}}].
*'''skt''' will be:
*#[{{IPA|st}}] in words of more than one syllable: ''føroyskt'' [{{IPA|ˈføːɹɪst}}] (Faroese ''n. sg.'') ''russiskt'' [{{IPA|ˈɹʊsːɪst}}] (Russian ''n. sg.''), ''íslendskt'' [{{IPA|ˈʊʃlɛŋ̊st}}] (Icelandic ''n. sg.'').
*#[{{IPA|kst}}] in monosyllables: ''enskt'' [{{IPA|ɛŋ̊kst}}] (English ''n. sg.''), ''danskt'' [{{IPA|daŋ̊kst}}] (Danish ''n. sg.''), ''franskt'' [{{IPA|fɹaŋ̊kst}}] (French ''n. sg.''), ''spanskt'' [{{IPA|spaŋ̊kst}}] (Spanish ''n. sg.''), ''svenskt'' [{{IPA|svɛŋ̊kst}}] (Swedish ''n. sg.''), ''týskt'' [{{IPA|tʊkst}}] (German ''n. sg.'').
*#*However [{{IPA|ʂt}}] in: ''írskt'' [{{IPA|ʊʂt}}] (Irish ''n. sg.''), ''norskt'' [{{IPA|nɔʂt}}] (Norwegian ''n. sg.)



==Grammar==
Not surprisingly, Faroese grammar is quite similar to the Icelandic and Old Norse. Below in the literature section, you'll find a comprehensive grammar to download (chapter 3 of the standardwork ''Faroese'' by Thráinsson et al. 2004).

===Nominal inflection===
Below is a representation of three [[grammatical gender]]s, two numbers and four cases in the nominal [[inflection]].  This is just an overview to give a general idea of how the grammar works. Faroese actually has even more [[declension]]s.

Read: 
*''hvør, hvat?'' [[interrogative pronoun]] &quot;who, what?&quot; 
*''ein'' [[indefinite article]] &quot;a&quot;
*''stórur'' [[adjective]] &quot;big&quot; 
*''bátur'' [[noun]] &quot;boat&quot;

*ein stórur bátur - a big boat (''m.'')
*ein vøkur genta - a beautiful girl (''f.'')
*eitt gott barn - a good child (''n.'')

In the plural you will see that even the [[numeral]] ''tvey'' (2) is inflected.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For the novel by [[Michel Houellebecq]], see [[The Elementary Particles|''The Elementary Particles'']].

In [[particle physics]], an '''elementary particle''' is a particle of which other, larger particles are composed. For example, [[atom]]s are made up of smaller particles known as [[electron]]s, [[proton (physics)|protons]], and [[neutron]]s. The proton and neutron, in turn, are composed of more elementary particles known as [[quark]]s. One of the outstanding problems of particle physics is to find the most elementary particles — or the so-called '''fundamental particles''' — which make up all the other particles found in Nature, and are not themselves made up of smaller particles.

== Standard Model ==
{{main|Standard Model}}

The Standard Model of particle physics contains 12 flavours of elementary [[fermion]]s (&quot;[[matter]] particles&quot;), plus their corresponding [[antiparticle]]s, as well as elementary [[boson]]s that mediate the forces and the still undiscovered [[Higgs boson]]. However, the Standard Model is widely considered to be a provisional theory rather than a truly fundamental one, since it is fundamentally incompatible with [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]]. There are likely to be hypothetical elementary particles not described by the Standard Model, such as the [[graviton]], the particle that would carry the [[gravity|gravitational force]] or the [[sparticle]]s, [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] partners of the ordinary particles.

=== Fundamental fermions ===
{{main|fermion}}

The 12 fundamental fermionic flavours are divided into three [[generation (particle physics)|generations]] of four particles each. Six of the particles are [[quarks]]. The remaining six are [[leptons]], three of which are [[neutrino]]s, and the remaining three of which have an electric charge of −1: the electron and its two cousins, the [[muon]] and the [[tau lepton]].

* [[down quark]]: ''d''

* tau-neutrino: ''&amp;nu;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;tau;&lt;/sub&gt;''
* [[top quark]]: ''t''
* [[bottom quark]]: ''b''
|}

==== Antiparticles ====
{{main|antimatter}}

There are also 12 fundamental fermionic antiparticles which correspond to these 12 particles.  The [[positron]] ''e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'' corresponds to the electron and has an electric charge of +1 and so on:

* top antiquark: &lt;math&gt; \bar{t} &lt;/math&gt;
* bottom antiquark: &lt;math&gt; \bar{b} &lt;/math&gt;
|}

==== Quarks ====
{{main|quark}}

Quarks and antiquarks have never been detected to be isolated, a fact explained by [[confinement]]. Every quark carries one of three [[color charge]]s of the [[strong interaction]]; antiquarks similarly carry anticolor. Color charged particles interact via [[gluon]] exchange in the same way that charged particles interact via [[photon]] exchange. However, gluons are themselves color charged, resulting in an amplification of the strong force as color charged particles are separated. Unlike the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic force]] which diminishes as charged particles separate, color charged particles feel increasing force; effectively, they can never separate from one another.

However, color charged particles may combine to form color neutral [[composite particle]]s called [[hadron]]s. A quark may pair up to an antiquark: the quark has a color and the antiquark has the corresponding anticolor. The color and anticolor cancel out, forming a color neutral [[meson]]. Or three quarks can exist together: one quark is &quot;red&quot;, another &quot;blue&quot;, another &quot;green&quot;. These three colored quarks together form a color neutral [[baryon]]. Or three antiquarks can exist together: one antiquark is &quot;antired&quot;, another &quot;antiblue&quot;, another &quot;antigreen&quot;. These three anticolored antiquarks form a color neutral [[antibaryon]].

Quarks also carry fractional [[electric charge]]s, but since they are confined within hadrons whose charges are all integral, fractional charges have never been isolated. Note that quarks have electric charges of either +2/3 or −1/3, whereas antiquarks have corresponding electric charges of either −2/3 or +1/3.

Evidence for the existence of quarks comes from [[deep inelastic scattering]]: firing [[electron]]s at [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] to determine the distribution of charge within [[nucleon]]s (which are baryons). If the charge is uniform, the [[electric field]] around the proton should be uniform and the electron should scatter elastically. Low-energy electrons do scatter in this way, but above a particular energy, the protons deflect some electrons through large angles. The recoiling electron has much less energy and a [[jet (particle physics)|jet of particles]] is emitted. This inelastic scattering suggests that the charge in the proton is not uniform but split among smaller charged particles: quarks.

=== Fundamental bosons ===
{{main|boson}}

In the Standard Model, vector ([[spin (physics)|spin]]-1) bosons ([[gluon]]s, [[photon]]s, and the [[W and Z bosons]]) mediate forces, while the [[Higgs boson]] is responsible for particles having intrinsic [[mass]].

==== Gluons ====
{{main|gluon}}

Gluons are the mediators of the [[strong interaction]] and carry both [[color charge|color]] and anticolor. Although gluons are massless, they are never observed in [[particle detector|detectors]] due to [[confinement]]; rather, they produce [[particle jet|jets]] of [[hadron]]s, similar to single [[quark]]s.

==== Electroweak bosons ====
{{main|W and Z bosons}}

There are three [[weak gauge boson]]s: ''W&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''W&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;'', and ''Z&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;''; these mediate the [[weak interaction]]. The massless [[photon]] mediates the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic interaction]].

==== Higgs boson ====
{{main|higgs boson}}

Although the weak and electromagnetic forces appear quite different to us at everyday energies, the two forces are theorized to be unified as a single [[electroweak force]] at high energies. The reason for this difference at low energies is thought to be due to the existence of the [[Higgs field]]. Through the process of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], the Higgs selects a special direction in electroweak space that causes three electroweak particles to become very heavy (the weak bosons) and one to remain massless (the electromagnetic photon). Although the Higgs mechanism has become an accepted part of the Standard Model, the [[Higgs boson]] itself has never been observed in detectors. This is thought to be due to the particle's great mass, but its continuing absence is a major cause of concern for particle physicists.

== Beyond the Standard Model ==

Although there is no experimental evidence that does not agree with the [[Standard Model]], many physicists find it to be unsatisfactory due to its many free parameters, many [[fundamental particle]]s, the non-observation of the [[Higgs boson]] and other problems such as the [[hierarchy problem]]. As a result, there are many speculative theories beyond the Standard Model.

=== Grand unification ===
{{main|grand unification theory}}

One extension of the Standard Model attempts to combine the [[electroweak interaction]] with the [[strong interaction]] into a single grand unified theory (GUT). Such a force would be [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] into the three forces by a [[Higgs mechanism|Higgs-like mechanism]]. The most dramatic prediction of grand unification the existence of [[X boson]]s, which cause [[proton decay]]. However, the non-observation of proton decay at [[Super-Kamiokande]] rules out the simplest GUTs, including SU(5) and SO(10).

=== Supersymmetry ===
{{main|supersymmetry}}

Supersymmetry extends the Standard Model by adding an additional class of symmetries to the [[Lagrangian]]. These symmetries exchange [[fermion]]ic particles with [[boson]]ic ones. Such a symmetry predicts the existence of '''supersymmetric particles''', abbreviated as '''[[sparticle]]s''', which include the [[slepton]]s, [[squark]]s, [[neutralino]]s and [[chargino]]s. Each particle in the Standard Model would have a superpartner whose [[spin (physics)|spin]] differs by 1/2 from the ordinary particle. Due to the [[supersymmetry breaking|breaking of supersymmetry]], the sparticles are much heavier than their ordinary counterparts; they are so heavy that existing [[particle collider]]s would not be powerful enough to produce them. However, some physicists believe that sparticles will be detected when the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]] begins running.

=== String theory ===
{{main|string theory}}

According to [[string theory|string theorists]], each kind of fundamental particle corresponds to a different patterns of fundamental string. All strings are essentially the same, although they may be open (lines) or closed (loops). Different particles differ in the coordination of their strings. Modern string theories include [[supersymmetry]], making them [[superstring theory|superstring theories]].

One particular prediction of string theory is the existence of extremely massive counterparts of ordinary particles due to vibrational excitations of the fundamental string. Another important prediction of string theory is the existence of a massless spin-2 particle behaving like the [[graviton]]. By predicting [[gravity]], string theory unifies [[quantum mechanics]] with [[general relativity]], making it the first consistent theory of [[quantum gravity]].

One problem with string theory is that it predicts that the number of [[dimension]]s for [[spacetime]] much greater than 4 (the number of observed dimensions). These [[extra dimensions]] are supposedly [[compactification (physics)|compactified]] or rolled-up. Other related theories such as [[brane]] theories contain extended extra dimensions, which are n French also a [[bathrobe]])

''(Note: French usage: &quot;un mot à double sens&quot;: a word with more than one meaning; &quot;une phrase à double entente&quot;: a sentence with a hidden meaning. &quot;À double entente&quot; is listed in the [[Petit Larousse]] [[1994]] with no mention of its being obsolete or regional.)''
* [[encore]]&amp;mdash;A request to repeat a performance, as in “Encore !”, lit. ''again''; also used to describe additional songs played at the end of a [[gig]]. Francophones would say «bis !» (''a second time !''); or «Une autre !» (''Another one !'') to request «un rappel» (an ''encore'').
* [[entrée]] or entree&amp;mdash;The main dish or course of a meal (US); in French, entrée literally means ''entrance'' and refers to the appetizer (UK).
* [[faux pas]]&amp;mdash;An embarrassing social error, lit. ''false step''; sometimes used in French to mean ''to slip''.  Francophones would normally use «gaffe».

* [[Maitre d']]- Francophones would say maître d'hôtel instead
* [[petard]]&amp;mdash;A metaphorical trap, as in “hoist by one's own petard”, or “caught in one's own trap”.  In French, pétard means ''fire-cracker'' or ''small explosive device''. In Medieval warfare, a petard was a primitive mine hoisted by a crane against a castle gate in a siege.
* Répondez s'il vous plaît. ([[RSVP]])&amp;mdash;''Please reply''.  Francophones use &quot;prière de répondre&quot;. ''(Note: RSLP [&quot;Réponde s'il lui plaît&quot;] is used on old-fashioned invitations written in the 3rd person, usually in &quot;Script&quot; typography -- at least in Belgium.)''
* [[Résumé]]&amp;mdash;In [[North American English]], a document listing one's qualifications for employment. Francophones call this a ''curriculum vitae'' (''CV'' for short), a [[Latin]] phrase meaning &quot;course of life,&quot; as do speakers of [[Commonwealth English]] and some other European languages.
* [[succès de scandale]]&amp;mdash;''Success through scandal''; Francophones might use «succès par médisance».
* [[voir dire]]—jury selection ([[Law French]]).

==French phrases in international air-sea rescue==
International authorities have adopted a number of words and phrases from French for use by speakers of all languages in voice communications during air-sea rescues. Note that the &quot;phonetic&quot; versions are presented as shown and not in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]].

* SECURITAY (''securité'', “safety”) &amp;ndash; the following is a safety message or warning, the lowest level of danger.
* [[Pan-pan|PAN PAN]] (''panne'', “breakdown”) &amp;ndash; the following is a message concerning a danger to a person or ship, the next level of danger.
* [[Mayday|MAYDAY]] (''[venez] m'aider'', “come help me” ; N.B. &quot;Aidez-moi&quot; means &quot;help me&quot;) &amp;ndash; the following is a message of extreme urgency, the highest level of danger. ''(MAYDAY is used on voice channels for the same uses as SOS on [[Morse code|Morse]] channels.)''
* SEELONCE (''silence'', “silence”) &amp;ndash; keep this channel clear for air-sea rescue communications.
* SEELONCE FEE NEE (''silence fini'', “silence is over”) &amp;ndash; this channel is now available again.
* PRU DONCE (''prudence'', “prudence”) &amp;ndash; silence partially lifted, channel may be used again for urgent non-distress communication.
* MAY DEE CAL (''médical'', “medical”) &amp;ndash; medical assistance needed.

It is a serious breach in most countries, and in international zones, to use any of these phrases without justification.

''See [[Mayday]] for a more detailed explanation.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[South Africa]]n '''financial rand''' system was abolished with effect from [[March 13]] [[1995]]. The financial rand system was instituted on [[September 1]] [[1985]] in an attempt to control the large outflows of capital from South Africa at that time. These outflows were largely the result of economic sanctions in response to [[Apartheid]]. The financial rand system provided for two exchange rates for the [[Rand (currency)|rand]], one for current account transactions, and one for capital account transactions for non-residents. Investments made in South Africa by non-residents could only be sold for financial rand, and limitations were placed on the convertibility of financial rand into foreign currencies. Financial rand had the [[ISO 4217|ISO 4217 currency code]] ZAL. The financial had a previous life, from January 1979 to February 1983. The 1985 crisis coincided with a default (then called a &quot;standstill&quot;) on foreign debt by the Apartheid government.

''This page is about the physical island.  For the knitting technique, see [[Fair Isle (technique)]].''

'''Fair Isle''' ''(From [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] frioar-øy)'' is an island in the [[British Isles]] lying around halfway between the [[Shetland Islands]] and the [[Orkney Islands]] at {{coor dm|59|32|N|1|32|W|}}. Three miles (4.8 km) in length and 1.5 miles (2.4 km) wide, it has an area of 1402 acres (5.61 km&amp;sup2;). The island is situated around 25 miles (40 km) south-west of [[Sumburgh]] on the Shetland mainland.

The majority of the 70 islanders live in the crofts on the southern half of the island, with the northern half consisting of rocky moorland. The western coast consists of cliffs of up to 660 feet (200 m) in height. The population has been decreasing steadily from around 400 in around [[1900]]. There are no pubs or restaurants on the island, but there is a single primary school. After the age of 11, children must attend a boarding school in [[Lerwick]].

Although it is marginally closer to [[North Ronaldsay]] island in the Orkneys, Fair Isle is administratively part of the Shetland Islands. It gives its name to one of the [[British Sea Areas]].

Fair Isle has been occupied since the [[Bronze Age]] which is remarkable because of the lack of raw materials on the island. It has a permanent [[bird observatory]] because of its importance as a [[bird migration]] watchpoint and this provides most of the accommodation on the island. It is unusual amongst bird observatories in providing catered accommodation rather than hostel-style. Many rare species of [[bird]] have been found on the island, and it is probably the best place in western Europe to see skulking [[Siberia]]n [[passerine]]s like [[Pechora Pipit]], [[Lanceolated Warbler]] and [[Pallas's Grasshopper Warbler]].

The island was bought by the [[National Trust for Scotland]] in [[1954]] from George Waterson, the founder of the bird observatory.

[[Image:Fair Isle - Croft houses.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Croft houses.]]

Fair Isle is famous for its knitted sweaters, with [[knitting]] forming an important source of income for the women of the islands. The principal activity for the male islanders is [[crofting]].

On [[January 29]], [[2004]], Fair Isle was granted [[Fairtrade Town|Fairtrade Island]] status.

On [[August 20]], [[1588]] the flagship of the [[Spanish Armada]], ''El Gran Grifón'', was shipwrecked in the cove of [[Stroms Heelor]], forcing its 300 sailors to spend six weeks living with the islanders. The wreck was discovered in [[1970]].

'''Persian''' (known variously as: فارسی '''Fârsi''' or پارسی ''Pârsi'', local name in [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Tajikistan]], ''[[Tajik language|Tajik]]'', a [[Central Asia]]n dialect, or ''[[Dari (Afghanistan)|Dari]]'', another local name in [[Tajikistan]] and [[Afghanistan]]) is a language spoken in [[Iran]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Bahrain]], [[Iraq]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Armenia]], Southern [[Russia]], neighboring countries, and elsewhere. Prior to British colonization, Persian was also widely used as a second language in the [[Indian subcontinent]]; it took prominence as the language of culture and education in several Muslim courts in the subcontinent throughout the Middle Ages and became the official court language under the [[Mughal]] emperors. Evidence of its former rank in the region can still be seen by the extent of its influence on [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]], as well as the popularity that [[Persian literature]] still enjoys in the region. Persian and its dialects have official-language status in the countries of Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan. According to [[CIA World Factbook]], there are 61 million native speakers of Persian language in [[Iran]] [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ir.html], [[Afghanistan]] [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/af.html], [[Tajikistan]] [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ti.html] and [[Uzbekistan]] [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/uz.html]. It belongs to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family, and is of the [[Subject Object Verb]] type.

==History==
Persian is a member of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family of languages, and within that family it belongs to the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] branch. Scholars believe the [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] sub-branch consists of the following chronological linguistic path: Old Iranian ([[Avestan language|Avestan]] and [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]]) → Middle Iranian (Pahlavi [[Middle Persian]] and several other languages) → Modern Iranian (Persian, [[Pashto]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], and several other languages), c. 900 to present.

[[Old Persian]], the main language of the [[Achaemenid]] inscriptions, should not be confused with the non-Indo-European [[Elamite language]] (see [[Behistun inscription]]). Over this period, the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of the language was simplified from the complex [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] and [[declension]] system of Old Persian to the almost completely regularized morphology and rigid [[syntax]] of Modern Persian, in a manner often described as paralleling the development of [[English language|English]]. Additionally, many words were introduced from neighboring languages, including [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] in earlier times, and later [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and to a lesser extent [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. In more recent times, some Western European words have entered the language (notably from [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]]).

The language itself has greatly developed during the centuries. Due to technological developments, new words and idioms are created and enter into Persian like any other language. In [[Tehran]] the [[Academy of Persian Language and Literature]] is a center that evaluates the new words in order to initiate and advise their Persian equivalents. In Afghanistan, the [[Academy of Sciences of Afghanistan]] does the same for Afghan Persian (among other languages).

==Nomenclature==
{{mergefrom|The announcement of the Academy of Persian Language and Literature}}
''Persian'', the more widely used name of the language in [[English language|English]], is an Anglicized form derived from [[Latin]] *''Persianus'' &lt; Latin ''Persia'' &lt; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''Persis'', a Hellenized form of Old Persian ''Parsa''. ''Farsi'' is the Arabicized form of Parsi, due to a lack of the /p/ phoneme in Standard Arabic. Native Persian speakers typically call it “Fârsi” in modern usage. [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], the [[Academy of Persian Language and Literature]], and many other sources call the language Persian. The government of Afghanistan uses both “Dari” and “Persian” in English communications.

The Academy of Persian Language and Literature as well as many lexicographers have announced that “Farsi” is not the appropriate term to use for the Persian language in English. In the [[ISO 639-1]], the local names form the basis for the language codes and for this reason “fa” is the designation for the Persian language in that system.

==Dialects and close languages==
[[Image:Iranische_Sprachen.jpg|thumb|The region where Persian and other Iranian languages are spoken]]
Communication is generally mutually intelligible between Iranians, Tajiks, and Persian-speaking Afghans; however, by popular definition:
*[[Dari (Afghanistan)|Dari]] is the local name for the eastern dialect of Persian, one of the two official languages of [[Afghanistan]], including [[Hazaragi]] — spoken by the [[Hazara]] people of central Afghanistan.
*[[Tajik language|Tajik]] could also be considered an eastern dialect of Persian, but, contrary to Iranian and Afghan Persian, it is written in the [[Cyrillic script]].

[[Ethnologue]] offers another classification for dialects of Persian language. According to this source, dialects of this language include the following:[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90035]

*'''Western Farsi''' (in Iran)
*'''Eastern Farsi''' (in Afghanistan)
*[[Tajiki]] (in Tajikistan)
*[[Hazaragi]] (in Afghanistan)
*[[Aimaq]] (in Afghanistan)
*Bukharic (in Israel, Uzbekistan)
*Dehwari (in Pakistan)
*Darwazi (in Afghanistan)
*[[Dzhidi]] (in Israel)
*Pahlavani (in Afghanistan)

The following are some of the closely related languages of various Iranian peoples within modern Iran proper:
* [[Mazandarani]], spoken in northern Iran mainly in the province of [[Mazandaran]].
* [[Gileki language|Gileki]] (or ''Gilaki''), spoken in the province of [[Guilan]].
* [[Talysh]] (or ''Talishi''), spoken in northern Iran and southern parts of the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]].
* [[Luri language|Luri]] (or ''Lori''), spoken mainly in the southwestern Iranian province of [[Lorestan]] and parts of [[Khuzestan]].
* [[Tat language|Tat]] (also ''Tati'' or ''Eshtehardi''), spoken in parts of the Iranian provinces of [[East Azarbaijan]], [[Zanjan Province|Zanjan]] and [[Qazvin Province|Qazvin]].
* [[Dari (Zoroastrian)|Dari]] or [[Gabri]], spoken originally in [[Yazd]] and [[Kerman]] by the Zoroastrians of Iran. Also called [[Yazdi]] by some.

==Orthography==
[[Image:Dehkhoda note.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dehkhoda]]'s personal handwriting; a typical [[cursive]] Persian script.]]
The vast majority of modern Persian text is written in a form of the [[Arabic alphabet]]. In recent years the [[Latin alphabet]] has been used by some for technological or internationalization reasons. [[Tajik_language|Tajik]], which is considered by many linguists to be a Persian dialect influenced by [[Russian_language|Russian]], is written with the [[Cyrillic alphabet]] in [[Tajikistan]] (but not in Afghanistan).

===Arabic Alphabet===
{{main|Persian alphabet}}
{{mergeto|Persian alphabet}}
Modern Persian is normally written using a modified variant of the [[Arabic alphabet]].

====Script adoption====
After the conversion of [[Persian Empire|Persia]] to [[Islam]] (see [[Islamic conquest of Iran]]), it took approximately one hundred fifty years before Persians adopted the Arabic alphabet as a replacement for the older alphabet. Previously, two different alphabets were used for the Persian language (''[[Middle Persian]]'', or ''Pahlavi'', at that time): one was also called ''[[Pahlavi]]'' and was a modified version of the [[Aramaic alphabet]], and the other was a native Iranian alphabet called ''[[Dîndapirak]]'' (literally: religion script).

====Additions====
The Persian alphabet adds four letters to the Arabic alphabet, due to the fact that four sounds that exist in '''Persian''' do not exist in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], as they come from completely separate language families. Some people call this modified alphabet the ''[[Perso-Arabic alphabet]]''. The additional four letters are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
| '''sound'''
| '''shape'''
| '''Unicode name'''
|-
| [p]
|style=&quot;font-size: larger&quot;| پ
| Peh
|-
| {{IPA|[t&amp;#643;]}} (ch)
|style=&quot;font-size: larger&quot;| چ
| Tcheh
|-
| {{IPA|[&amp;#658;]}} (zh)
|style=&quot;font-size: larger&quot;| ژ
| Jeh
|-
| [g]
|style=&quot;font-size: larger&quot;| گ
| Gaf
|}

====Variations====
Many Persian words with an Arabic root are spelled differently from the original Arabic word. ''Alef with hamza below'' (&amp;nbsp;إ&amp;nbsp;) always changes to ''alef'' (&amp;nbsp;ا&amp;nbsp;); ''teh marbuta'' (&amp;nbsp;ة&amp;nbsp;) usually, but not always, changes to ''teh'' (&amp;nbsp;ت&amp;nbsp;) or ''heh'' (&amp;nbsp;ه&amp;nbsp;); and words using various [[hamza]]s get spelled with yet another kind of hamza (so that مسؤول becomes مسئول).

The letters different in shape are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
| '''sound'''
| '''original Arabic letter'''
| '''modified Persian letter'''
| '''name'''
|-
| [k]
|style=&quot;font-size: larger&quot;| ك
|style=&quot;font-size: larger&quot;| ک
| Kaf
|-
| [j] (y) and [i:], or rarely [ɑ:]
|style=&quot;font-size: larger&quot;| ي or ى
|style=&quot;font-size: larger&quot;| ی
| Yeh
|}

The diacritical marks used in the Arabic script, a.k.a. ''[[harakat]]'', are also used in Persian, although some of them have different pronunciations. For example, an Arabic ''[[Damma]]'' is pronounced /u/, while in Persian it is pronounced /o/.

The Persian variant also adds the notion of a pseudo-space to the Arabic script, called a [[Zero-width non-joiner]] (ZWNJ) by the [[Unicode Standard]]. It acts like a space in disconnecting two otherwise-joining adjacent letters, but does not have a visual width.

====Extensions to other languages====
The features of the Persian variant have been taken for other languages, such as [[Pushtu language|Pashto]] or [[Urdu language|Urdu]], and have sometimes been further extended with new letters or punctuation.

===Latin Alphabet===

The '''Universal Persian ([[UniPers]] / Pârsiye Jahâni) Alphabet''' is a Latin-based alphabet created over 50 years ago in Iran and popularized by Mohamed Keyvan, who used it in a number of Persian textbooks for foreigners and travellers. It sidesteps the difficulties of the traditional Arabic-based alphabet, with its multiple letter shapes and ambiguous spellings, and fits particularly well in contemporary electronically written media.

The &quot;'''International Persian Alphabet'''&quot; ([[IPA2]])[http://www.persiandirect.com/projects/ipa2/ipa2_tutor.htm], commonly called '''Pársik''', is another Latin-based alphabet developed in recent years mainly by A. Moslehi, a comparative linguist, as a project defined and maintained under the authority of [http://www.persiandirect.com/ Persian Linguistics Association]. It is claimed to be the most accurate and regular one among Latin-based Persian alphabets in which many linguistic aspects of Modern Persian have been observed; however, its rules are not as simple as that of UniPers.

'''[[Fingilish]]''', or '''Penglish''', is the name given to texts written in Persian using the [[Alphabets derived from the Latin#Basic Latin Alphabet|Basic Latin alphabet]]. It is most commonly used in [[online chat|chat]], [[email]]s and [[Short Message Service|SMS]] applications.

==Phonology==

:''Main article: [[Persian phonology]]''
The Persian language has six vowels and twenty-three consonants, including two affricates {{IPA|/ʧ/}} (ch) and {{IPA|/ʤ/}} (j).
Historically, Persian distinguished length: the long vowels {{IPA|/i:/}}, {{IPA|/u:/}}, {{IPA|/ɑ:/}} contrasting with the short vowels {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/æ/}} respectively. Modern spoken Persian, however, generally does not make this distinction anymore.

&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

''Note that {{IPA|/ʧ/}} and {{IPA|/ʤ/}} are affricates, not stops.''

==Grammar==

:''Main article: [[Persian grammar]]''

Suffixes predominate Persian morphology, though there are a small number of prefixes. Verbs can express tense and aspect, and they agree with the subject in person and number. There is no [[grammatical gender]] for nouns, nor are pronouns marked for [[natural gender]].

Normal sentences are structured as “(S) (PP) (O) V”. If the object is specific, then the order is “(S) (O + “rɑ:”) (PP) V”.

==Vocabulary==

There are many [[loanword]]s in the Persian language, mostly coming from [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and the [[Turkic languages]].

Persian has likewise influenced the vocabularies of other languages, especially [[Indo-Iranian languages]] and [[Turkic languages]]. Many Persian words have also found their way into the English language. See [[List of English words of Persian origin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Frances''' or '''Fanny Abington''' ([[1737]] &amp;ndash; [[March 4]], [[1815]]) was an [[England|English]]task which no predecessor had attempted. By a historical analysis of those forms, as applied to the verb, he furnished the first trustworthy materials for a history of the languages compared.

After a brief sojourn in Germany, Bopp travelled to London, where he made the acquaintance of [[Sir Charles Wilkins]] and [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke|HT Colebrooke]], and became the friend of [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], then [[Prussia]]n ambassador at the court of St James, to whom he gave instruction in Sanskrit. He brought out, in the ''Annals of Oriental Literature'' (London, 1820), an essay entitled, &quot;Analytical Comparison of the Sanskrit, Greek, Latin and Teutonic Languages&quot;, in which he extended to all parts of the grammar what he had done in his first book for the verb alone. He had previously published a critical edition, with a Latin translation and notes, of the story of Nala and Damayanti (London, 1819), the most beautiful episode of the ''[[Mahabharata]]''. Other episodes of the ''Mahabharata'' -- Indralokâgama, and three others (Berlin, 1824); ''Diluvium'', and three others (Berlin, 1829); and a new edition of Nala (Berlin, 1832) -- followed in due course, all of which, with [[August Wilhelm von Schlegel|AW Schlegel]]'s edition of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' (1823), proved excellent aids in initiating the early student into the reading of Sanskrit texts. On the publication, in Calcutta, of the whole ''Mahabharata'', Bopp discontinued editing Sanskrit texts and confined himself thenceforth exclusively to grammatical investigations.

After a short residence at [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], Bopp gained, on the recommendation of Humboldt, appointment to the chair of Sanskrit and comparative [[grammar]] at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] in 1821, and election as a member of the [[Royal Prussian Academy]] in the following year. He brought out in 1827 his ''Ausführliches Lehrgebäude der Sanskritsprache'', on which he had worked since 1821. Bopp started work on a new edition, in Latin, in the following year, and completed it in 1832; and a shorter grammar appeared in 1834. At the same time he compiled a ''Sanskrit and Latin glossary'' (1830) in which, more especially in the second and third editions (1847 and 1867), he also took account of the cognate languages. His chief activity, however, centred on the elaboration of his ''Comparative Grammar'', which appeared in six parts at considerable intervals (Berlin, 1833, 1835, 1842, 1847, 1849, 1852), under the title ''Vergleichende Grammatik des Sanskrit, Zend, Griechischen, Lateinischen, Litauischen, Gotischen und Deutschen'' (''Comparative Grammar of Sanskrit, Zend, Greek, Latin, Lithuanian, Gothic and German''.

How carefully Bopp matured this work emerges from the series of monographs printed in the ''Transactions of the Berlin Academy'' (1824 to 1831), which preceded it. They bear the general title, ''Vergleichende Zergliederung des Sanskrits und der mit ihm verwandten Sprachen'' (''Comparative Analysis of Sanskrit and its related Languages''). Two other essays (on the &quot;Numerals&quot;, 1835) followed the publication of the first part of the ''Comparative Grammar''. [[Old Slavonic | Old Slavonian]] began to take its stand among the languages compared from the second part onwards. [[Edward Backhouse Eastwick|EB Eastwick]] translated the work into English in 1845. A second German edition, thoroughly revised (1856 - 1861), also covered Old [[Armenian language | Armenian]]. From this edition [[Michel Jules Alfred Bréal|Professor Michel Bréal]] made an excellent French translation in [[1866]].

In his ''Comparative Grammar'' Bopp set himself a threefold task:
# to give a description of the original grammatical structure of the languages as deduced from their intercomparison
# to trace their [[phonetic]] laws, and 
# to investigate the origin of their grammatical forms. 

The first and second points remained subservient to the third. As Bopp based his research on the best available sources, and incorporated every new item of information that came to light, so it continued to widen and deepen as it progressed. Witness his monographs on the vowel system in the [[Teutonic languages]] (1836), on the [[Celtic language]]s (1839), on the [[Old Prussian language | Old Prussian]] (1853) and [[Albanian language]]s (1854), on the [[stress (phonology) | accent]] in Sanskrit and Greek (1854), on the relationship of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages | Malayo-Polynesian]] with the Indo-European languages (1840), and on the [[Caucasian language]]s (1846). In the two last-mentioned the impetus of his genius led him on a wrong track.

Critics have charged Bopp with neglecting the study of the native Sanskrit grammars, but in those early days of Sanskrit studies the great libraries of Europe did not hold the requisite materials; and if they had, those materials would have absorbed his exclusive attention for years, while such grammars as those of Wilkins and Colebrooke, from which Bopp derived his grammatical knowledge, had all used native grammars as a basis. The further charge that Bopp, in his ''Comparative Grammar'', gave undue prominence to Sanskrit stands disproved by his own words; for, as early as the year 1820, he gave it as his opinion that frequently the cognate languages serve to elucidate grammatical forms lost in Sanskrit (''Annals of Or. Lit.'' i. 3), -- an opinion which he further developed in all his subsequent writings.

Bopp's researches, carried with wonderful penetration into the most minute and almost microscopical details of linguistic phenomena, led to the opening up of a wide and distant view into the original seats, the closer or more distant affinity, and the tenets, practices and domestic usages of the ancient Indo-European-speaking nations, and one can date the science of [[comparative grammar]] from his earliest publication. In grateful recognition of that fact, there originated in Berlin on the fiftieth anniversary ([[May 16]], [[1866]]) of the date of Windischmann's preface to that work, a fund called ''Die Bopp-Stiftung'', for the promotion of the study of Sanskrit and comparative grammar, to which his numerous pupils and admirers in all parts of the globe gave liberal contributions. Bopp lived to see the results of his labours everywhere accepted, and his name justly celebrated. But he died a poor man, -- though his genuine kindliness and unselfishness, his devotion to his family and friends, and his rare modesty, endeared him to all who knew him.

See [[Michel Jules Alfred Bréal| M Bréal]]'s translation of Bopp's ''Vergleichende Grammatik'' (1866) introduction; [[Theodor Benfey|Th. Benfey]], ''Geschichte der Sprachwissenschaft'' (1869); A Kuhn in ''Unsere Zeit,'' Neue Folge, iv. I (1868); Lefmann, ''Franz Bopp'' (Berlin, 1891-1897).

'''''Full Metal Jacket''''' ([[1987]]) is a [[film]] produced and directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]], based on the novel ''[[The Short-Timers]]'' by [[Gustav Hasford]]. The film is named after the full metal jacketed bullets used in military ammunition.

The film portrays the [[Vietnam War]] from the point of view of the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]]. Recurring themes are the contradictions of war, a constant feeling of being out of one's depth, and the idea of combat in [[Vietnam]] being part of a different world, with its own rules and customs. The miasma of confusion and [[angst]] of the new world begins in boot camp, and spirals down into bloodshed before even landing in Vietnam.

In the aftermath of this film a series of policy changes came about in what was considered acceptable behavior by a [[Drill Instructor]] in the [[United States Marine Corps]]. All references to a recruit's family are absolutely forbidden, as is striking a recruit.

The movie is often said to have been shot on the [[Isle of Dogs]], in east [[London]], but in fact the ravaged city scenes were shot in a disused gas works in [[Beckton]], further east. The open country is [[Cliffe-at-Hoo|Cliffe]] marshes, also on the [[River Thames|Thames]], with palm trees imported from Spain.  While this was reasonable for the urban nature of the [[Tet Offensive]], it was also influenced by Kubrick's aversion to air travel.

==Synopsis==
The protagonist of the film is Marine recruit J.T. 'Joker' Davis ([[Matthew Modine]]), who is part of a group beginning [[recruit training|basic training]] as a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] on [[Parris Island]], [[South Carolina|SC]].
The brutal command of Senior [[Drill Instructor]] [[Gunnery Sergeant]] Hartman (played by former Marine Drill Instructor [[R. Lee Ermey]], which earned him a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture|best supporting actor]]) shows the harsh [[indoctrination]] of the armed forces during the [[Vietnam War]] era. The training is depicted as designed to eliminate virtually all trace of the recruits' individual personalities and transform them into killers (to &quot;keep Heaven packed with fresh souls&quot;). This first section of the film focuses largely on how the brutal treatment of overweight misfit Leonard 'Gomer Pyle' Lawrence ([[Vincent D'Onofrio]]) results in him losing his [[sanity]]. After this, despite Joker's attempts to intervene, Lawrence murders the Drill Instructor, and then kills himself.

The second part then takes place in Vietnam, focusing on 'Joker', who is now a [[Sergeant]], and a ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' [[war correspondent]], as he covers the [[Tet Offensive]]. The 'Joker' soon becomes familiar with both the horror and the absurdity of the war. His helmet decoration &amp;ndash; the slogan &quot;[[Born to Kill]]&quot; &amp;ndash; and the [[Peace symbol]] pin on his uniform exemplify his moral ambiguity. In one scene Joker is confronted by a [[Marine Corps]] [[Colonel]] ([[Bruce Boa]]), demanding to know why he has a peace symbol on his uniform and &quot;Born To Kill&quot; on his helmet. Joker mentions the duality of man theory postulated by [[Carl Jung]]; the Colonel questions Joker's patriotism and demands that he shape up, &quot;or I will take a giant shit on you.&quot;

Joker joins his friend Cowboy and his unit on patrol near the city of [[Hué]]. A vicious battle breaks out and the city, already crumbling from previous battles, is practically leveled. One of the film's standout sequences shows the unit being interviewed individually by a news crew and expressing their thoughts on the war. They also stand over the dead bodies of two of their unit and comment on what freedom means to the Vietnamese.

Cowboy's platoon is called up for patrol again, this time north of the Perfume River (which divides the city of Hué), where Viet Cong forces are believed to be hiding. The platoon becomes lost and a sniper, hiding among some abandoned buildings, draws in two of their comrades with the intention of sucking more of them into the trap. As the platoon moves up to take defensive positions, the sniper shoots Cowboy. After evading more shots, the unit moves in. Joker finds the sniper hiding in a room. At the critical moment his rifle jams and the sniper, a young Vietnamese girl, opens fire, pinning Joker behind a column, making it impossible for him to escape or shoot back. Suddenly, the girl is rippled by shots and falls; Joker's savior turns out to be Rafterman. As Joker, Rafterman, and, Animal Mother gather around the girl she begins to pray then begs the Marines to kill her. Joker does so after being egged on by his comrades.

The film concludes with the Marines' ironic rendition of the theme song to the [[Mickey Mouse Club]] as they march back to their base. The film's end credits are accompanied by [[The Rolling Stones]]' ''[[Paint It Black]].''

== Characters ==
'''Private/Sergeant &quot;Joker&quot; T.J. Davis'''- The main character of the film as well as its narrator.  He is a conscientious marine that initally joined the marines to see action and to kill.  He witnesses Pyle's insanity growing during boot camp.  He later becomes a combat correspondent and links up with the Lusthog Squad to report combat incidents in depth.  During his time with the squad, he witnesses the horrors of war. Frequently uses a [[John Wayne]] impression to diffuse tense situations.

'''Private/Sergeant &quot;Cowboy&quot; Evans'''- Cowboy is a marine from Texas.  He met Joker at boot camp and befriended him.  He becomes an infantry grunt and meets Joker in Hue City.  He is killed in action when an enemy sniper shoots him from behind.

'''Private Rafterman'''- Rafterman is a member of Joker's journalism staff and serves as a photographer.  He was eager to get into battle to see action and follows Joker into Hue City.  He seems somewhat naive and also seems to believe anything.

'''Animal Mother'''- A wild and headstrong marine in the Lusthog Squad.  He is armed with a M-60 light machine gun.  At first, he seems to be contemptuous of Joker and remains a little scornful of him.  He feels America should win the war.  One of the most significant characters.

'''Eightball'''- An African American marine in the Lusthog squad.  He seems to be sensitive about his ethnicity.  He is a friend of Animal Mother and also one of the more lively members of the squad.  He is also angry at the Vietnamese for not wanting to fight for freedom.  He dies when an enemy sniper hits him multiple times.

'''Doc Jay'''- Doc Jay is a marine in the Lusthog squad.  He also serves as a corpsman.  He is headstrong like Animal Mother and is willing to disobey orders under extreme circumstances.  He is killed by an enemy sniper when he tries to save Eightball.

'''Hand Job'''- A marine in the squad known for his excessive masturbation.  He is killed during a encounter in Hue City.  He used his habit of masturbation to receive a section eight order to go home but was killed one week before being shipped out.

'''Donlon'''- Another African American marine in the squad.  He serves as the RTO (radio/telephone operator).  Along with Eightball, he feels the Vietnamese are ungrateful to the Americans. 

'''Crazy Earl '''- Crazy Earl is the senior N.C.O. of the squad.  He takeover leadership when the platoon leader is killed.  He is a gung-ho marine and feels that he belongs in Vietnam.  He is killed by a booby trap bomb.

'''T.H.E. Rock'''- A Latino Marine in the squad.  He is generally quiet and follows the squad well.  He serves as the M-79 Grenade Launcher gunner.

'''Murphy'''- A marine in the squad who seems to be associated with tank coordination and support.  During the final scene, he is unable to provide the Lusthog Squad with the much needed tank support. (Murphy's radio voice is provided by Stanley Kubrick.)

'''Lieutenant Walter J. Schinoski &quot;Touchdown&quot;'''-  He is the platoon leader of the Lusthog squad.  He played college footbal at Notre Dame, hence his nickname was named after that.  He is killed during an advance into Hue City when several bombs go off and he is shot.

'''No-Doze and Stutten'''- Two marines in the Lusthog squad that go with Cowboy and his group to find the sniper that had killed Eightball and Doc Jay.

'''Gunnery Sergeant Hartman'''- The stereotypical, traciturn drill instructor from Parris Island.  He is insensitive and abuses his recruits to turn them into ruthless killing machines.  He is killed by a mentally-unbalanced Pyle in the latrine.

'''Leonard Lawrence &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot;'''- A large, heavy recruit that joined marines about the same time as Joker.  He was heavily abused by Hartman for his incompetence and weight.  After failing almost everything in boot camp, he begins to become the most disciplined recruit.  Unfortunately, he goes mad and kills Hartman and almost shoots Joker before committing suicide by pointing his M-14 up into his mouth and firing.

'''Private Brown &quot;Snowball&quot;'''- One of the recruits at Parris Island when Joker was also training there.  He was ridiculed for being African American and was given the nickname &quot;Snowball&quot; by Hartman.

'''Payback'''- One of the marines in Joker's journalism staff.  He has been out in the &quot;shit&quot; (combat zone).  He tells Joker and Rafterman about the &quot;Thousand Yard Stare.&quot;

'''Chili''' and '''Stork'''- Chili and Stork are also marines in Joker's journalism staff.
 
'''Lieutenant Lockhart'''- The senior editor and leader of Joker's writing staff.  He has some experience reporting on combat but refuses to go back because of the danger and bugs.  He is often taunted by Joker and his wise-crack statements.

'''Pouge Colonel'''- A marine colonel that encounters Joker near the grave of executed civilians.  He reprimands Joker about his peace symbol button and suggests that Joker be more enthusiasitic about winning the war.

==Theme==
The movie includes a great deal of [[satire]] on the [[Vietnam war]] and the Marines involved in the war, though few would deem the movie a [[comedy]]. The main themes of the movie include the [[irony]] of war, and the comparable power of words and ideas in a war. This theme is crystalized first by the Drill Instructor, whose words hit as hard as his fists, and later in the scenes with Sgt. Joker's editor for &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; (who insists that &quot;search and destroy&quot; missions against the VC be termed &quot;sweep and clear&quot;, as this doesn't sound as violent), and in the scene with the colonel where the Colonel asks if Sgt. Joker is on &quot;our side&quot; and is waiting for &quot;this peace craze to blow over.&quot;

Although often said to contain two distinct parts, the film can be categorized into three. The first part is the training of new [[United States Marine Corps| US Marine Corps]] recruits, culminating with the deaths of the Senior [[Drill Instructor]] and Pvt. &quot;Pyle&quot;. The second part of the movie establishes Joker's role as a war reporter, working behind the lines during the Tet Offensive of 1968. In the third section, the focus shifts to a patrol searching through the bombed out city of [[Huế]] to root out a [[sniper]]. The sections are bookended by scenes of bargaining with [[prostitutes]], and each section ends with shocking violence.

Irony runs rampant throughout the film. In the first section of the movie, the [[recruit training]] is supposed to train [[Marines]] who protect the interests of the country and the military, but eventually it results in the death of the Senior [[Drill Instructor]]. The initially innocent and naive Pvt. Leonard Lawrence (nicknamed Gomer Pyle) ended up as a killer, exactly as the Drill Instructor wanted. The murder of the Senior Drill Instructor is ironic because his success in converting Pvt. Gomer Pyle into a killer results in his own death. The Drill Instructor's speech about famous [[assassins]], provides more irony. Although each of his examples was a motivated Marine, each ultimately ended up insane and killing innocent people. Near the beginning of the second part of the movie, Sgt. Joker is told an irony laced joke about &quot;how to kill women and children.&quot;  The final irony is that the product of the US Marine recruit training, the professional killers, are wiped out one by one by a small school girl who snipes them from a damaged building.  To which Marines when they capture the sniper, mercy kills her with a point blank shot.  

The movie also examines the irony of providing freedom for the [[Vietnamese people]] by taking away the freedom of the American people, and the allegation made by some of the Marines that the Vietnamese don't seem to want their freedom.

There are several references to [[religion]].  In one of the scenes the Senior Drill Instructor asks Pvt. Joker whether he believes in the [[Blessed Virgin Mary| Virgin Mary]].  Pvt. Joker replies that he does not, and the Senior Drill Instructor, offended, strikes the Private, and asks him again, getting the same reply.  After repeated blows, the Drill Instructor asks Pvt. Joker if he is deliberately trying to anger the instructor by reiterating his answer, and Joker replies that he believes the Drill Instructor will beat him harder if he reverses his position in the face of the abuse. The Drill Instructor then promotes Pvt. Joker to squad leader, not because of his answer, but for standing by his beliefs in the face of adversity.

==Music==
All of the music used in the film was written and recorded before 1968, as to be accurate to the time period the film is set in.  The music included in the film is as follows:

* Hello Vietnam - Performed by [[Johnny Wright]]
* [[These Boots Are Made for Walkin']] - Performed by [[Nancy Sinatra]]
* Wooly Bully - Performed by [[Sam the Sham &amp; the Pharaohs]]
* Surfin' Bird - Performed by [[The Trashmen]]
* The Marines Hymn - Performed by [[The Goldmen]]
* Chapel of Love - Performed by [[The Dixie Cups]]
* Paint it Black - Performed by [[The Rolling Stones]]
* [[Mickey Mouse Club]] Television Theme

==Quotes==
*'''Private Joker''' (narration): Parris Island, South Carolina...the United States Marine Corps Recruit Depot. An eight-week college for the phony-tough and the crazy-brave.

*'''Gunnery Sergeant Hartman''' (addressing new recruits): If you ladies leave my island, if you survive recruit training you will be a weapon, you will be a minister of death, praying for war. But until that day, you are pukes! You are the lowest form of life on Earth. You are not even human fucking beings! You are nothing but unorganized, grab-asstic pieces of amphibian shit! Because I am hard, you will not like me. But the more you hate me, the more you will learn. I am hard, but I am fair!  There is no racial bigotry here! I do not look down on niggers, kikes, wops or greasers — here you are all equally worthless! And my orders are to weed out all non-hackers who do not pack the gear to serve in my beloved Corps!

*'''Joker''': I wanted to see exotic Vietnam, the jewel of Southeast Asia. I wanted to meet interesting and stimulating people of an ancient culture and...kill them. I wanted to be the first kid on my block to get a confirmed kill.

==Trivia==
* Stanley Kubrick provided the voice of relation is difficult to determine from the sparse evidence of runic inscriptions, and they remained mutually intelligible throughout the [[Migration period]], so that some individual dialects are difficult to classify.
The 6th century [[Lombardic language]], for instance, may constitute an originally either North or East Germanic dialect that became assimilated to West Germanic as the [[Lombards]] settled at the [[Elbe]]. The Western group would have formed in the late [[Pre-Roman Iron Age#Jastorf culture|Jastorf culture]], the Eastern group may be derived from the 1st century dialect of [[Gotland]] (see [[Old Gutnish]]), leaving southern [[Sweden]] as the original location of the Northern group . The earliest coherent Germanic text preserved is the 4th century [[Gothic language|Gothic]]  translation of the [[New Testament]] by [[Ulfilas]]. Early testimonies of West Germanic are in [[Old High German]] and [[Old English language|Old English]] from about the 9th century. North Germanic is only attested in scattered runic inscriptions, as [[Proto-Norse]], until it evolves into [[Old Norse]] by about 800.
Longer runic inscriptions survive from the [[8th century|8th]] and [[9th century|9th]] centuries ([[Eggjum stone]], [[Rök stone]]), longer texts in the Latin alphabet survive from the 12th century ([[Íslendingabók]]), and some [[skaldic poetry]] held to date back to as early as the 9th century.

By about the 10th century, the dialects had diverged enough to make [[mutual intelligibility|intercomprehensibility]] difficult. The linguistic contact of the [[Viking]] settlers of the [[Danelaw]] with the [[Anglo-Saxon]]s left traces in the English language, and is suspected to have facilitated the collapse of Old English grammar that resulted in [[Middle English]] from the 12th century.

The East Germanic languages were marginalized from the end of the Migration period. The [[Burgundians]], [[Goths]] and [[Vandals]] became linguistically assimilated  to their respective neighbors by about the 7th century, with only [[Crimean Gothic language|Crimean Gothic]] lingering on until the 18th century.

During the early Middle Ages, the West Germanic languages were separated by the insular development of Middle English on one hand, and by the [[High German consonant shift]] on the continent on the other, resulting in [[Upper German]] and [[Low Germanic languages|Low German]], with graded intermediate [[Central German]] dialects. By Early modern times, the span had extended into considerable differences, ranging from [[Highest Alemannic German|Highest Alemannic]] in the South to [[Northern Low Saxon]] and [[Frisian language|Frisian]] in the North, and although both extremes are considered [[German language|German]], they are hardly mutually intelligible. The southern dialects have completed the second sound shift, but remained closer to the Middle German vowel system, while the northern dialects remained unaffected by the consonant shift, but simplified the vowel system.

The North Germanic languages, on the other hand, remained more unified, with the larger languages largely retaining mutual intelligibility into modern times.

==Classification==
Note that divisions between subfamilies of Germanic are rarely precisely defined; most form continuous clines, with adjacent [[dialect]]s being mutually intelligible and more separated ones not.

'''German''' (''{{Audio|de-Deutsch.ogg|Deutsch}}''), is a member of the western group of [[Germanic languages]] (and [[Indo-European languages]]) and one of the world's major [[language]]s. 

Worldwide, German accounts for the most written [[translation]]s into and from a language and according to the [[Guinness Book of Records]] German belongs to the ten most spoken languages worldwide. After English, German is the second largest of the [[Germanic language]]s. 

German is the language with the most native speakers and the second most learned [[second language]] in the [[European Union]], after English and just before French. Spoken by more than 120 million people in 38 countries of the world, German is — like English and French — a [[pluricentric language]] with [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] as the three main centers of usage .

==Geographic distribution==
[[Image:Map_German_World.png|400px|right|Some major German-speaking communities]]
German is spoken primarily in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Luxembourg]], in two-thirds of [[Switzerland]], in two-thirds of the [[South Tyrol]] [[province of Italy]] (in German, ''Südtirol''), in the small [[German speaking community in Belgium|East Cantons]] of [[Belgium]], and in some border villages of the [[South Jutland County]] (in German, ''Nordschleswig'', in Danish, ''Sønderjylland'') of [[Denmark]].

In [[Luxembourg]] (in German, ''Luxemburg''), as well as in the French ''[[régions]]'' of [[Alsace]] (in German, ''Elsass'') and parts of [[Lorraine (région)|Lorraine]] (in German, ''Lothringen''), the native populations speak several German dialects, and some people also master standard German (especially in Luxembourg), although in Alsace and Lorraine [[French language|French]] has for the most part replaced the local German dialects in the last 40 years.

Some German speaking communities still survive in parts of [[Romania]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], and above all [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Poland]], although massive relocations to Germany in the late [[1940s]] and [[1990s]] have depopulated most of these communities.

Outside of Europe and the former [[Soviet Union]], the largest German speaking communities are to be found in the [[USA]] and in [[Brazil]] where millions of Germans migrated in the last 200 years; but the great majority of their descendants no longer speak German. Additionally, German speaking communities are to be found in the former German colony of [[Namibia]], as well as in the other countries of German emigration such as [[Canada]], [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]], [[Chile]], [[Peru]], [[Venezuela]] (where [[Alemán Coloneiro]] developed), [[Thailand]],  and [[Australia]]. See also [[Plautdietsch]].

In the USA, the largest concentration of German speakers are in [[Pennsylvania]] ([[Amish]], [[Hutterites]] and some [[Mennonites]] speak [[Pennsylvania German]] and [[Hutterite German]]), [[Texas]] ([[Texas German]]), [[Kansas]] ([[Mennonites]] and [[Volga Germans]]), [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Montana]], [[Wisconsin]] and [[Indiana]]. Early twentieth century immigration was often to [[St. Louis]], [[Chicago]], [[New York]], and [[Cincinnati]].  Most of the post [[Second World War]] wave are in the [[New York]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Chicago]] [[urban area|urban areas]], and in [[Florida]]. In Brazil the largest concentrations of German speakers are in [[Rio Grande do Sul]] (where [[Riograndenser Hunsrückisch]] was developed), [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], [[Paraná]], and [[Espírito Santo]]. Generally, German immigrant communities in the USA have lost their mother tongue more quickly than those who moved to South America, possibly due to the fact that for German  speakers, English is easier to learn than Portuguese or Spanish.

In [[Canada]] there are people of German ancestry throughout the country and especially in the west as well as in [[Ontario]]. There is a large and vibrant community in the city of [[Kitchener]], [[Ontario]].

German is the main language of about 100 million people in Europe (as of [[2004]]), or 13.3% of all Europeans, being the most spoken native language in Europe excluding [[Russia]], above [[French language|French]] (66.5 million speakers in Europe in 2004) and [[English language|English]] (64.2 million speakers in Europe in 2004). German is the third most taught [[foreign language]] worldwide, also in the [[United States|USA]] (after [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and French); it is the second most known foreign language in the [[European Union|EU]] (after English; see [http://europa.eu.int/comm/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_237.en.pdf]) It is one of the official [[languages of the European Union]], and one of the three [[working language]]s of the EU, along with English and French.

==History==
{{main|History of the German language}}
The history of the German language begins with the [[High German consonant shift]] during the [[Migration period]], separating [[South Germanic]] dialects from common [[West Germanic]]. The earliest testimonies of [[Old High German]] are from scattered [[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions, especially in [[Alemannic]], from the [[6th century]], the earliest glosses (''[[Abrogans]]'') date to the [[8th century|8th]] and the oldest coherent texts (the ''[[Hildebrandslied]]'', the ''[[Muspilli]]'' and the [[Merseburg Incantations]]) to the [[9th century]]. [[Old Saxon]] at this time belongs to the [[North Sea Germanic]] cultural sphere, and [[Low German]] should fall under German rather than [[Anglo-Frisian]] influence during the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

As Germany was divided into many different [[state]]s, the only force working for a unification or [[standard language|standardisation]] of German during a period of several hundred years was the general preference of writers trying to write in a way that could be understood in the largest possible area.

When [[Martin Luther]] translated the [[Bible]] (the [[New Testament]] in [[1522]] and the [[Old Testament]], published in parts and completed in [[1534]]) he based his translation mainly on this already developed language, which was the most widely understood language at this time. This language was based on Eastern Upper and Eastern Central German dialects and preserved much of the grammatical system of Middle High German (unlike the spoken German dialects in Central and Upper Germany that already at that time began to lose the genitive case and the preterit tense). In the beginning, copies of the Bible had a long list for each region, which translated words unknown in the region into the regional dialect. [[Roman Catholics]] rejected Luther's translation in the beginning and tried to create their own Catholic standard (''gemeines Deutsch'') — which, however, only differed from 'Protestant German' in some minor details. It took until the middle of the [[18th century]] to create a standard that was widely accepted, thus ending the period of [[Early New High German]].

German used to be the language of commerce and government in the [[Habsburg Empire]], which encompassed a large area of Central and Eastern Europe. Until the mid-[[19th century]] it was essentially the language of townspeople throughout most of the Empire. It indicated that the speaker was a [[merchant]], an urbanite, not their nationality. Some cities, such as [[Prague]] (German: ''Prag'') and [[Budapest]] ([[Buda]], German: ''Ofen''), were gradually [[Germanization|Germanized]] in the years after their incorporation into the Habsburg domain. Others, such as [[Bratislava]] (German: ''Pressburg''), were originally settled during the Habsburg period and were primarily German at that time. A few cities such as [[Milan]] (German: ''Mailand'') remained primarily non-German. However, most cities were primarily German during this time, such as Prague, [[Budapest]], Bratislava, [[Zagreb]] (German: ''Agram''), and [[Ljubljana]] (German: ''Laibach''), though they were surrounded by territory that spoke other languages.

Until about [[1800]], standard German was almost only a written language. In this time, people in urban northern Germany, who spoke dialects very different from Standard German, learnt it almost like a foreign language and tried to pronounce it as close to the spelling as possible. Prescriptive pronunciation guides used to consider that northern German pronunciation to be the standard. However, the actual pronunciation of standard German varies from region to region.

Media and written works are almost all produced in standard German (often called ''Hochdeutsch'' in German), which is understood in all areas of German languages (except by pre-school children in areas which speak only dialect, for example [[Switzerland]] — but in this age of TV, even they now usually learn to understand Standard German before school age).

The first dictionary of the [[Brothers Grimm]], the 16 parts of which were issued between [[1852]] and [[1860]], remains the most comprehensive guide to the words of the German language. In [[1860]], grammatical and orthographic rules first appeared in the ''[[Duden Handbook]]''. In [[1901]], this was declared the standard definition of the German language. Official revisions of some of these rules were not issued until [[1998]], when the [[German spelling reform of 1996]] was  officially promulgated by governmental representatives of all German-speaking countries. Since the reform, German spelling has been in an eight-year transitional period where the reformed spelling is taught in most schools, while traditional and reformed spelling co-exist in the media. See [[German spelling reform of 1996]] for an overview of the heated public debate concerning the reform.

==Classification and related languages==
[[Image:FrancLowUpperHigh.PNG|right|thumb|300px|By the [[High German consonant shift]], the Dutch-German [[dialect continuum]] is divided into [[Low Franconian|Franconian / Low Frankish]] (Brown), [[Upper German]] (blue) and [[Central German]] (green), and the [[Low German]] (yellow).  The main isoglosses, the Benrath and Speyer lines are marked in red.]]
[[Image:DutchGerman.PNG|right|thumb|300px|The German and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] standard language [[language border]].]]
German is a member of the [[West Germanic language|western branch]] of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] family of languages, which in turn is part of the [[Indo-European language family]].

===Neighboring languages===

In these modern days Germany is surrounded by [[language border]]s, in the north by the [[Frisian language|Frisian]] and [[Danish language|Danish]]; in the east [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Sorbian language|Sorbian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]; in the south [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Friulian language|Friulian]], [[Ladin language|Ladin]], and [[Romansh language|Romansh]]; in the west [[French language|French]]. Except for Frisian and Dutch, none of these languages are West Germanic, and so they are clearly distinct from German. Frisian, after Scots, the closest related living language to English; and Dutch, the closest related living language to German are generally considered not to be [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with German. Although a [[dialect continuum]] still exist at certain places along the Dutch-German language border this is fading away because of standardisation in both countries, as can be seen in the pictures to the right in which the dialectal borders and the standard borders can be seen. 

While German is grammatically quite similar to Dutch in many ways, it is very different in speech. Speakers of one, especially Germans, require practice to effectively understand a speaker of the other. Compare, for example:
:''De kleinste kameleon is volwassen 2 cm groot, de grootste kan wel 80 cm lang worden.'' (Dutch)
:''Das kleinste Chamäleon ist ausgewachsen 2 cm groß, das größte kann gut 80 cm lang werden.'' (German)
: (English: &quot;The smallest chameleon is fully grown 2 cm long, the longest can easily attain 80 cm.&quot;)

Dutch speakers are generally able to read German, and German speakers who can speak Low German or English are generally able to read Dutch, but have problems understanding the spoken language, although Germans who speak High German, or, even better, Low German, can cope with Dutch much better than people from Southern Germany, Switzerland and Austria who have grown up with the Alemannic or Bavarian dialects.

===Official status===
Standard German is the only official language in [[Germany]], [[Liechtenstein]], and [[Austria]]; it shares official status in [[Switzerland]] (with [[French (language)|French]], [[Italian (language)|Italian]] and [[Romansh]]), and [[Luxembourg]] (with [[French (language)|French]] and [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]]). It is used as a local official language in German-speaking regions of [[Belgium]], [[Italy]], [[Denmark]], and [[Poland]].  It is one of the 20 official [[languages of the European Union]].

It is also a minority language in [[Poland]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Russia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], [[Romania]], [[Togo]], [[Cameroon]], the [[United States|USA]], [[Namibia]], [[Brazil]], [[Paraguay]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovakia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Croatia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Argentina]], and [[Australia]].
'
German was once the [[lingua franca]] of central, eastern and northern Europe, but first [[Russian language|Russian]] and now [[English language|English]] have assumed much of this role. However, German remains one of the most popular foreign languages taught world-wide, and is more popular than French as a foreign language in Europe. 8% of citizens of the EU-15 countries say they can converse in German, in addition to the 24% who speak German as a mother tongue.[http://europa.eu.int/comm/education/policies/lang/languages/index_en.html] This is assisted by the availability of German TV by cable or satellite, where series like [[Star Trek]] are shown [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] into German.

German is also the second language of the [[Internet]], more than 8% of the websites are in German ([[English language|English]] 50%, [[French language|French]] 6%, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] 5%, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] 3% and [[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]] 2%).

==Dialects==
{{main|German dialects}}
The term &quot;German&quot; is used for the dialects of Germany, Austria, German-speaking Switzerland (that is, outside the [[French language|French]]-, [[Italian language|Italian]]-, and [[Romansh language|Romansch]]-speaking areas) and some areas in the surrounding countries, as well as for several [[colony|colonies]] and other ethnic concentrations founded by German-speaking people (for example [[German in the United States]]).

The variation among the German dialects is considerable. Only the neighbouring dialects are mutually understandable. Most dialects are not understandable for someone who knows standard German. However, all German dialects belong to the [[dialect continuum]] of the continental [[West Germanic languages]] because any pair of neighbouring dialects is perfectly mutually intelligible.

The dialect continuum of the continental West Germanic languages is typically divided into [[Low Germanic languages]] and [[High Germanic languages]].

'''Low Germanic''' is defined as the varieties that were not affected by the [[High German consonant shift]]. They consist of two subgroups, [[Low Franconian language|Low Franconian]] and [[Low German]]. Low Franconian includes [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Afrikaans]], spoken primarily in the Netherlands, Belgium, Surinam and South Africa; Low German includes dialects spoken primarily in the German [[Northern European Lowlands|Lowlands]] and in the eastern Netherlands. The Low German varieties are considered dialects of the German language by some, but a separate language by others; the Low Franconian varieties are not considered a part of the German language (see [[#Neighboring languages|above]] for a discussion of the distinction between German and Dutch).

'''High Germanic''' is divided into [[Central German]] and [[Upper German language|Upper German]]. Central German dialects include [[Ripuarian]], [[Moselle Franconian]], [[Rhine Franconian]], [[Hessian language|Hessian]], [[Thuringian language|Thuringian]] and [[Upper Saxon dialect|Upper Saxon]]. It is spoken in the southeastern Netherlands, eastern Belgium, Luxembourg, parts of France, and in Germany approximately between the River [[Main]] and the southern edge of the Lowlands. Modern Standard German is mostly based on Central German, but it should be noted that the usual German term for modern Standard German is ''Hochdeutsch'', that is, ''High German''.

The Moselle Franconian varieties spoken in [[Luxembourg]] have been officially standardized and institutionalized and are therefore usually considered a separate language, [[Luxembourgish language]].

Upper German dialects include [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] (for instance [[Swiss German]]), [[Swabian German|Swabian]], [[East Franconian German|East Franconian]], and [[Austro-Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian]]. They are spoken in parts of the [[Alsace]], southern Germany, Liechtenstein, Austria, and in the German-speaking parts of Switzerland and Italy.

The High German varieties spoken by [[Ashkenazi Jew]]s (mostly in the former [[Soviet Union]]) have several unique features, and are usually considered as a separate language, [[Yiddish]]. It is the only Germanic language that does not use the [[Latin alphabet]] as its [[official script|standard script]].

The dialects of German which are or were primarily spoken in colonies founded by German speaking people resemble the dialects of the regions the founders came from (for example [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]] resembles dialects of the [[Rhenish Palatinate|Palatinate]], or [[Hutterite German]] resembles dialects of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], while [[Venezuelan]] ''[[Alemán Coloniero]]'' is a [[Low Alemannic]] variant).

In Brazil the largest concentrations of German speakers ([[German Brazilians]]) are in [[Rio Grande do Sul]], where [[Riograndenser Hunsrückisch]] was developed, especially in the areas of [[Santa Catarina]], [[Paraná]], and [[Espírito Santo]]. 

In the [[United States]], the teaching of the German language to latter-age students has given rise to a pidgin variant which combines the German language with the grammar and spelling rules of the English language. It is often understandable by either party. The speakers of this language often refer to it as ''Amerikanisch'' or ''Amerikanischdeutsch'', although it is known in English as [[American German]].

==Standard German==
{{main|Standard German}}
In German linguistics, only the traditional regional varieties are called dialects, not the different varieties of standard German.

Standard German has originated not as a traditional dialect of a specific region, but as a [[written language]]. However, there are places where the traditional regional dialects have been replaced by standard German (especially in major cities of Germany, and to some extent in Vienna).

Standard German differs regionally, especially between German-speaking countries, especially in [[vocabulary]], but also in some instances of [[pronunciation]] and even [[grammar]]. This variation must not be confused with the variation of local dialects. Even though the regional varieties of standard German are to a certain degree influenced by the local dialects, they are very distinct. German is thus considered a [[pluricentric language]]. 

In most regions, the speakers use a continuum of mixtures from more dialectical varieties to more standard varieties according to situation.

In the German-speaking parts of Switzerland, mixtures of dialect and standard are very seldom used, and the use of standard German is almost entirely restricted to the written language. Therefore, this situation has been called a ''medial [[diglossia]]''. Standard German is rarely spoken, for instance when speaking with people who do not understand the [[Swiss German]] dialects at all, and it is expected to be used in school.

==Grammar==
''Main article: [[German grammar]]''

German is an [[inflected language]].

===Noun inflection===
German nouns inflect into:
* one of four [[declension class]]es
* one of three [[grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine, feminine, or neutral. Word endings indicate some grammatical genders; others are arbitrary and must be memorised.
* two numbers: singular and plural
* four cases: [[nominative]], [[genitive]], [[dative]], and [[accusative case]]. 

Although German is usually cited as an outstanding example of a highly inflected language, it should be noted that the degree of inflection is considerably less than in Old German, or in Icelandic today.  The three genders have collapsed in the plural, which now behaves, grammatically, somewhat as a fourth gender.  With four cases and three genders plus plural there are 16 distinct possible combinations of case and gender/number, but presently there are only six forms of the definite article used for the 16 possibilities. Inflection for case on the noun itself is required in the singular for strong masculine and neuter nouns in the genitive and sometimes in the dative. This dative ending is considered somewhat old-fashioned in many contexts and often dropped, but it is still used in sayings and in formal speech or written language. Weak masculine nouns share a common case ending for genitive, dative and accusative in the singular. Feminines are not declined in the singular. The plural does have an inflection for the dative. In total, six inflectional endings (not counting plural markers) exist in German: ''-s, -es, -n, -en, -ns, -e''

In the German orthography nouns and most words with the syntactical function of nouns are capitalized, which makes it quite easy for readers to find out what function a word has within the sentence. On the other hand, things get more difficult for the writer. This spelling convention is almost unique to German today (shared perhaps only by the closely related [[Luxembourgish]] language), although it was historically common in other languages (e.g., [[Danish language|Danish]]), too.

Like most Germanic languages, German forms left-branching noun [[compound (linguistics)|compound]]s, where the first noun modifies the category given by the second, for example: ''Hundehütte'' (eng. ''doghouse''). Unlike English, where newer compounds or combinations of longer nouns are often written in ''open'' form with separating spaces, German (like the other German languages) always uses the ''closed'' form without spaces, for example: Baumhaus (eng. ''tree house''). Like English, German allows arbitrarily long compounds, but these are rare. (''See also'' [[English compounds]].)
The longest official German word is [[Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz]]. There is even a child's game played in kindergartens and primary schools where a child begins the spelling of a word (which is not told) by naming the first letter. The next one tells the next letter, the third one tells the third and so on. The game is over when the a child can not think of another letter to be added to the word (see [[Ghost (game)|Ghost]]).

===Verb Inflection===
Standard German verbs inflect into:
* one of two conjugation classes, [[weak verb|weak]] and [[strong verb|strong]] (like English). 
(note: in fact there is a third class, called &quot;gemischte Verben&quot;, which can be either weak (&quot;active meaning&quot;) or strong (&quot;passive meaning&quot;))
There are about 200 strong or irregular verbs.
* three persons: 1st, 2nd, 3rd.
* two numbers: singular and plural
* three [[Grammatical mood|mood]]s: Indicative, Subjunctive, Imperative
* two [[Grammatical voice|genera verbi]]: active and passive; the passive being composed and dividable into static and dynamic.
* 2 non-composed tenses (Present, [[Preterite]]) and 4 composed tenses (Perfect, Plusquamperfect, Future I, Future II)
* no distinction between aspects (in English, perfect and progressive; in Polish between completed and incompleted form; in Turkish between first-hand and second-hand information)

There are also many ways to expand, and sometimes radically change, the meaning of a base verb through several prefixes. Examples: haften=to stick, verhaften=to imprison; kaufen=to buy, verkaufen=to sell

The word order is much more flexible than in English. The word order can be changed for subtle changes of a sentence's meaning. In normal positive sentences the verb always has position 2, in questions it has position 1.

Most German vocabulary is derived from the Germanic branch of the [[Indo-European language family]], although there are significant minorities of words derived from [[Latin]], [[French language|French]], and most recently [[English language|English]] (which is known as [[Germish]]).

==Writing system==
German is written using the [[Latin alphabet]]. In addition to the 26 standard letters, German has three vowels with [[Umlaut]], namely ''ä'', ''ö'' and ''ü'', as well as a special symbol for &quot;ss&quot;, the Eszett or Scharfes-S (sharp &quot;s&quot;) ''[[ß]]''. In traditional German spelling, ''ß'' replaces any inseparable &quot;ss&quot;, while it appears only after long vowels or diphthongs in [[German spelling reform of 1996|reform spelling]]. ''ß'' is not used at all in [[Switzerland]].

Until the early [[20th century]], German was mostly printed in [[blackletter]] [[typefaces]] (mostly in [[fraktur (typeface)|Fraktur]], but also in [[Schwabacher]]) and written in corresponding [[handwriting]] (for example [[Kurrent]] and [[Sütterlin]]). These variants of the Latin alphabet are very different from the serif or sans serif [[antiqua]] typefaces used today, and are difficult for the untrained to read. They were abolished by the [[Nazis]] (incorrectly claiming that these letters are Jewish) in [[1941]] but this has been retained for broader and easier usability.

There are many German words that are [[cognate]] to [[English language|English words]]. Most of them are easily identifiable and have almost the same meaning.

|}

When these cognates have slightly different consonants, this is often due to the [[High German consonant shift]].

There are cognates whose meanings in either language have changed through the centuries. It is sometimes difficult for both English and German speakers to discern the relationship.  On the other hand, once the definitions are made clear, then the logical relation becomes obvious.

German and English also share many borrowings from other languages, especially from [[Latin]], [[French language|French]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], but also from many other languages. Most of these word have the same meaning, while a few have subtle differences in meaning. As many of these words have been borrowed by numerous languages, not only German and English, they are called ''[[internationalism (linguistics)|internationalisms]]'' in German [[linguistics]].

==Names of the German language in other languages==
Because of the turbulent history of both Germany and the German language, the names that other peoples have chosen to use to refer to it varies more than for most other languages.

|}

[[Lao language|Lao]] is unique in that both under the influence of English &quot;German&quot; (through Thai &quot;yeraman&quot;) and French (the colonial language) &quot;Allemand&quot;, it chose a name in between: ພາສາເຢຍລະມັນ (''phaxa yeylaman''), which could be ranked both under category 2 and category 5.

Note: The Romanian language used to use in the past the Slavonic term &quot;nemţeşte&quot;, but &quot;Germană&quot; is now widely used. Hungarian &quot;német&quot; is also a Slavonic loan-word. The Arabic name for Austria, النمسا (&quot;an-namsa&quot;), is derived from the Slavonic term.

A possible explanation for the use of &quot;mute&quot; to refer to German (and also to Germans) in Slavic languages is that Germans were the first people Slavic tribes encountered, with whom they could not communicate. The corresponding experience for the Germans was with the [[Volcae]], whose name they subsequently also applied to the Slavs, see [[etymology of Vlach]]. 

[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] traditionally (nowadays this is not the case) used the Biblical term [[Ashkenaz]] (Genesis 10.3) to refer to Germany, or to certain parts of it, and the [[Ashkenazi]] Jews are those who originate from Germany and Eastern Europe and formerly spoke [[Yiddish]] as their native language, derived from [[Middle High German]].

The '''Gothic  language''' (''*gutiska razda'', *𐌲𐌿𐍄𐌹𐍃𐌺𐌰 𐍂𐌰𐌶𐌳𐌰) is an extinct [[Germanic language]] that was spoken by the [[Goths]] and specifically by the [[Visigoth]]s.  It is known primarily through a translation of the [[Bible]] dating from the [[4th century]], and is the only [[East Germanic language]] with a sizeable corpus.  All others, including [[Burgundian]] and [[Vandalic language|Vandalic]], are known, if at all, only from proper names that survived in historical accounts. 

As a Germanic language, Gothic is a part of the [[Indo-European language]] family.  It is the Germanic language with the earliest attestation, but it has no modern descendants.  The oldest documents in Gothic date back to the [[4th century]].  The language was in decline by the mid-[[6th century]], due in part to the military defeat of the Goths at the hands of the [[Franks]], the elimination of the Goths in Italy, massive conversion to primarily Latin-speaking Roman Catholicism, and geographic isolation.  The language survived in the [[Iberian peninsula]] (modern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) as late as the [[8th century]], and [[Franks|Frankish]] author [[Walafrid Strabo]] wrote that it was still spoken in the lower [[Danube]] area and in isolated mountain regions in [[Crimea]] in the early [[9th century]] (see [[Crimean Gothic]]). Gothic-seeming terms found in later (post-9th century) manuscripts may not belong to the same language.  

The existence of such early attested corpora makes it a language of considerable interest in [[comparative linguistics]].

The native name for the language is unattested, and the reconstruction ''*gutiska razda'' is based on [[Jordanes]]' ''[[Gothiskandza]]'', read as ''gutisk-andja'', &quot;gothic end (or border)&quot;. ''razda'' &quot;speech&quot; is attested, e. g.  in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 26:73 [http://www.wulfila.be/gothic/browse/token/?ID=T3635].

''Words in Gothic written in this article are [[transliteration|transliterated]] into the [[Roman alphabet]] using the system described on the [[Gothic alphabet]] page.''

==Documents in Gothic==
[[Image:Ambrosianus.jpg|thumb|240px|leaf of the Codex Ambrosianus B]]

There are only a few surviving documents in Gothic, not enough to completely reconstruct the language.

* The largest body of surviving documentation consists of [[codices]] written and commissioned by the [[Arianism|Arian]] bishop [[Ulfilas]] (also known as ''Wulfila'', [[311]]-[[382]]), who was the leader of a community of [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] [[Christian]]s in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Moesia]] (modern [[Bulgaria]]).  He commissioned a translation of the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Septuagint]] into the Gothic language, of which roughly three-quarters of the [[New Testament]] and some fragments of the [[Old Testament]] have survived.  
:*[[Codex Argenteus]] (and the '''Speyer fragment'''): 188 leaves. 
::The best preserved Gothic manuscript, the ''[[Codex Argenteus]]'', dates from the [[6th century]] and was preserved and transmitted by northern Italian [[Ostrogoths]].  It contains a large part of the four [[Gospel]]s.  Since it is a translation from Greek, the language of the ''Codex Argentus'' is replete with borrowed Greek words and Greek usages.  The syntax in particular is often copied directly from the Greek.
:*[[Codex Ambrosianus]] ([[Milan]]) (and the '''Codex Taurinensis'''): Five parts, totalling 193 leaves.
::The ''Codex Ambrosianus'' contains scattered passages from the New Testament (including parts of the [[Gospel]]s and the [[Epistle]]s), of the [[Old Testament]] ([[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]]), and some commentaries known as ''[[Skeireins]]''.  It is therefore likely that the text had been somewhat modified by copyists.
:*[[Codex Gissensis]] ([[Gießen]]): 1 leaf, fragments of Luke 23-24. It was found in Egypt in 1907, but destroyed by water damage in 1945.
:*[[Codex Carolinus]]:  ([[Wolfenbüttel]]): 4 leaves, fragments of Romans 11-15. 
:*'''Codex Vaticanus Latinus 5750''':  3 leaves, pages 57/58, 59/60 and 61/62 of the [[Skeireins]].
* A scattering of old documents: alphabets, calendars, glosses found in a number of manuscripts and a few [[Runic]] inscriptions that are known to be or suspected to be Gothic. Some scholars believe that these inscriptions are not at all Gothic (see Braune/Ebbinghaus &quot;Gotische Grammatik&quot; Tübingen 1981)
*A few dozen terms compiled by [[Ogier de Busbecq]], a [[16th century]] [[Flanders|Flemish]] diplomat living in [[Crimea]] who listed them in his compilation ''Turkish Letters''.  These terms are from nearly a millennium later and are therefore not representative of the language of Ulfilas.  See [[Crimean Gothic]].

There have been unsubstantiated reports of the discovery of other parts of Ulfilas' bible. [[Heinrich May]] in [[1968]] claimed to have found in England 12 leaves of a [[palimpsest]] containing parts of the [[Gospel of Matthew]]. The claim was never substantiated.

Only fragments of the Gothic translation of the [[Bible]] have been preserved. The translation was apparently done in the [[Balkans]] region by people in close contact with Greek [[Christianity|Christian]] culture. It appears that the Gothic Bible was used by the [[Visigoths]] in [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]] until circa 700 AD, and perhaps for a time in [[Italy]], the [[Balkans]] and what is now [[Ukraine]].  In exterminating [[Arianism|Arian]]ism, many texts in Gothic were probably expunged and overwritten as palimpsests, or collected and burned. Apart from Biblical texts, the only substantial Gothic document which still exists, and the only lengthy text known to have been composed originally in the Gothic language, is the &quot;[[Skeireins]]&quot;, a few pages of commentary on the [[Gospel of John]].

There are very few references to the Gothic language in secondary sources after about [[800]] AD, so perhaps it was rarely used by that date. In evaluating medieval texts that mention the [[Goths]], it must be noted that many writers used the word ''Goths'' to mean any Germanic people in eastern Europe, many of whom certainly did not use the Gothic language as known from the Gothic Bible. Some writers even referred to [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]-speaking people as Goths.

The relationship between the language of the [[Crimean Gothic|Crimean Goths]] and Ulfilas' Gothic is less clear. The few fragments of  their language from the [[16th century]] show significant differences from the language of the Gothic Bible, although some of the glosses, such as ''ada'' for &quot;egg&quot;, imply a common heritage.

Generally, the Gothic language refers to the language of [[Ulfilas]], but the attestations themselves are largely from the [[6th century]] - long after Ulfilas had died.  The above list is not exhaustive, and a more extensive list is available on the website of the [http://www.wulfila.be/gothic/manuscripts/ Wulfilas Project].

==Alphabet==
''See [[Gothic alphabet]].''

Ulfilas' Gothic, as well as that of the ''Skeireins'' and various other manuscripts, was written using an alphabet that was most likely invented by Ulfilas himself for his translation.  Some scholars (e.g. Braune) claim that it was derived from the [[Greek alphabet]] only, while others maintain that there are some Gothic letters of [[Runic]] or [[Latin]] origin.

This [[Gothic alphabet]] has nothing to do with [[Blackletter]] (also called ''Gothic script''), which was used to write the [[Roman alphabet]] from the [[12th century|12th]] to [[14th century|14th centuries]] and evolved into the [[Fraktur]] writing later used to write [[German language|German]].

==Phonetic and phonological system==
It is possible to determine more or less exactly how the Gothic of [[Ulfilas]] was pronounced, primarily through comparative phonetic reconstruction. Furthermore, because Ulfilas tried to follow the original Greek text as much as possible in his translation, we know that he used the same writing conventions as those of contemporary Greek. Since the Greek of that period is well documented, it is possible to reconstruct much of Gothic pronunciation from translated texts. In addition, the way in which non-Greek names are transcribed in the Greek Bible and in Ulfilas' Bible is very informative.

===Vowels===

|}

* {{IPA|[/a/]}}, {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[u]}} can be either long or short. Gothic writing distinguishes between long and short vowels only for {{IPA|[i]}} - writing ''i'' for the short form and ''ei'' for the long (a [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] or ''false diphthong''), in imitation of Greek usage (ει = [i:]). Single vowels are sometimes long where a historically present [[nasal consonant]] has been dropped in front of an {{IPA|[h]}} (a case of [[compensatory lengthening]]). Thus, the preterite of the verb ''briggan'' {{IPA|[briŋgan]}} &quot;to bring&quot; (English ''bring'', German ''bringen'') becomes ''brahta'' {{IPA|[bra:xta]}} (English ''brought'', German ''brachte''), from the [[proto-Germanic]] *''braŋk-dē''. In detailed [[transliteration]], where the intent is more [[phonetic transcription]], length is noted by a [[macron]] (or failing that, often a [[circumflex]]): ''brāhta'', ''brâhta''. {{IPA|[aː]}} is found often enough in other contexts: ''brūks'' &quot;useful&quot; (German ''Gebrauch'', Swedish ''bruk'' &quot;usage&quot;).
* {{IPA|[eː]}} and {{IPA|[oː]}} are long [[close-mid vowel]]s. They are written as ''e'' and ''o'': ''ne{{Unicode|ƕ}}'' {{IPA|[neːʍ]}} &quot;near&quot; (English ''nigh'', German ''nah''); ''fodjan'' {{IPA|[foːdjan]}} &quot;to feed&quot;.
* {{IPA|[ɛ]}} and {{IPA|[ɔ]}} are short [[open-mid vowel]]s. They are noted using the digraphs ''ai'' and ''au'': ''taihun'' {{IPA|[tɛhun]}} &quot;ten&quot; (German ''zehn''), ''dauhtar'' {{IPA|[dɔxtar]}} &quot;daughter&quot; (German ''Tochter''). In transliterating Gothic, accents are placed on the second vowel of these digraphs ''aí'' and ''aú'' to distinguish them from the original diphthongs ''ái'' and ''áu'': ''taíhun'', ''daúhtar''. In most cases short {{IPA|[ɛ]}} and {{IPA|[ɔ]}} are allophones of {{IPA|/i, u/}} before {{IPA|[r, h, ʍ]}}. Furthermore, the reduplication syllable of the reduplicating preterites has ''ai'' as well, which is probably pronounced as a short {{IPA|[ɛ]}}. Finally, short {{IPA|[ɛ]}} and {{IPA|[ɔ]}} occur in loan words from Greek and Latin (''aípiskaúpus'' {{IPA|[ɛpiskɔpus]}} = {{Polytonic|ἐπίσκοπος}} &quot;bishop&quot;, ''laíktjo'' {{IPA|[lɛktjoː]}} = ''lectio'' &quot;lection&quot;, ''Paúntius'' {{IPA|[pɔntius]}} = ''Pontius'').
* The Germanic [[diphthong]]s ''ai'' and ''au'' appear as ''ai'' and ''au'' in Gothic (normally written with an accent on the first vowel to distinguish them from ''ai, au'' &lt; Germanic ''i/e, u''). Some researchers suppose that they were still pronounced as diphthongs in Gothic, i.e. {{IPA|[ai]}} and {{IPA|[au]}}, whereas others think that they have become long [[open-mid vowel]]s, i.e. {{IPA|[ɛː]}} and {{IPA|[ɔː]}}: ''ains'' {{IPA|[ains] / [ɛːns]}} &quot;one&quot; (German ''eins''), ''augo'' {{IPA|[auγoː] / [ɔːγoː]}} &quot;eye&quot; (German ''Auge''). In Latin sources Gothic names with Germanic ''au'' are rendered with ''au'' until the 4th century and ''o'' later on (''Austrogoti'' &gt; ''Ostrogoti''). Long {IPA|[ɛː]}} and {{IPA|[ɔː]}} occur as allophons of {IPA|/eː}} and {IPA|/u:, oː/}} respectively before a following vowel: ''waian'' {{IPA|[wɛːan]}} &quot;to blow&quot; (German ''wehen''), ''bauan'' {{IPA|[bɔːan]}} &quot;to build&quot; (German &quot;bauen&quot;, Swedish ''bo'' &quot;live&quot;), also in Greek words ''Trauada'' &quot;Troad&quot; (Gk. {{Polytonic|Τρῳάς}}).
* {{IPA|[y]}} (pronounced like German ''ü'' and French ''u'' and similar to the ''ew'' in ''n'''ew''''') is a Greek sound used only in borrowed words. It is transliterated as ''w'' in vowel positions: ''azwmus'' {{IPA|[azymus]}} &quot;unleavened bread&quot; (&lt; Gk. {{polytonic|ἄζυμος}}). It represents an υ (y) or the diphthong οι (oi) in Greek, both of which were pronounced {{IPA|[y]}} in period Greek. Since the sound was foreign to Gothic, it was most perhaps pronounced {{IPA|[i]}}.
* {{IPA|[iu]}} is a descending [[diphthong]], i.e. {{IPA|[iu̯]}} and not {{IPA|[i̯u]}}: ''diups'' {{IPA|[diu̯ps]}} &quot;deep&quot; (German ''tief'', Swedish ''djup'').
* Greek diphthongs: In [[Ulfilas]]' era, all the diphthongs of classical Greek had become simple vowels in speech (''[[monophthong]]ization''), except for αυ (au) and ευ (eu), which were probably still pronounced as {{IPA|[aβ]}} and {{IPA|[ɛβ]}}. (They evolved into {{IPA|[av/af]}} and {{IPA|[ev/ef]}} in modern Greek.) Ulfilas notes them, in words borrowed from Greek, as ''aw'' and ''aiw'', probably pronounced {{IPA|[au, ɛu]}}: ''Pawlus'' {{IPA|[paulus]}} &quot;Paul&quot; (Gk. {{Polytonic|Παῦλος}}), ''aíwaggelista'' {{IPA|[ɛwaŋgeːlista]}} &quot;evangelist&quot; (Gk. {{Polytonic|εὐαγγελιστής}}, via the Latin ''evangelista'').
* Simple vowels and diphthongs (original and spurious ones) can be followed by a {{IPA|[w]}}, which was likely pronounced as the second element of a diphthong with roughly the sound of {{IPA|[u]}}. It seems likely that this is more of an instance of [[phonetic coalescence]] than of phonological diphthongs (such as, for example, the sound {{IPA|[aj]}} in the French word ''paille'' (&quot;straw&quot;), which is not the diphthong {{IPA|[ai]}} but rather a vowel followed by an [[approximant]]): ''alew'' {{IPA|[aleːw]}} &quot;olive oil&quot; (&lt; Latin ''oleum''), ''snáiws'' {{IPA|[snɛːws] }} (&quot;snow&quot;), ''lasiws'' {{IPA|[lasiws]}} &quot;tired&quot; (English ''lazy'').

In general, Gothic consonants are [[Final devoicing|devoiced]] at the ends of words. Gothic is rich in fricative consonants (although many of them may have been [[approximant]]s, it's hard to separate the two) derived by the processes described in [[Grimm's law]] and [[Verner's law]] and characteristic of [[Germanic languages]]. Gothic is unusual among Germanic languages in having a {{IPA|[z]}} phoneme which has not become {{IPA|[r]}} through [[R-colored vowel|rhotacization]]. Furthermore, the doubling of written consonants between vowels suggests that Gothic made distinctions between long and short, or [[Gemination|geminated]] consonants: ''atta'' {{IPA|[atːa]}} &quot;dad&quot;, ''kunnan'' {{IPA|[kunːan]}} &quot;to know&quot; (German ''können'' &quot;to be able&quot;, Swedish: ''kunna'').

====Stops====
* The voiceless stops {{IPA|[p]}}, {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[k]}} are regularly noted by ''p'', ''t'' and ''k'' respectively: ''paska'' {{IPA|[paska]}} (&quot;Easter&quot;, from the Greek {{Polytonic|πάσχα}}), ''tuggo'' {{IPA|[tuŋgoː]}} (&quot;tongue&quot;), ''kalbo'' {{IPA|[kalboː]}} (&quot;calf&quot;). The stops probably had (non-phonemic) aspiration like in most modern Germanic languages: {{IPA|[pʰ, tʰ, kʰ]}}.  Thus, the [[High German consonant shift]] seems to presuppose aspiration.
* The letter ''q'' is probably a voiceless [[labiovelar]] stop, {{IPA|[kʷ]}} ({{IPA|[kʷʰ]}}), comparable to the Latin ''qu'': ''qiman'' {{IPA|[kʷiman]}} &quot;to come&quot;. In the later Germanic languages this phoneme has become either a voiceless [[velar stop]] + a [[labio-velar approximant]] (English ''qu'') or a simple voiceless [[velar stop]] (English ''c, k'')
* The voiced stops {{IPA|[b]}}, {{IPA|[d]}} and {{IPA|[g]}} are noted by the letters ''b'', ''d'' and ''g''. To judge from the other Germanic languages, they were probably restricted to a word-initial position and the position after a the nasal; in other positions they had affricative allophones. In the end of a word and before a voiceless consonant, they were most likely also devoiced: ''blinds'' {{IPA|[blints]}} &quot;blind&quot;, ''lamb'' {{IPA|[lamp]}} &quot;lamb&quot;.
* There was probably also a voiced [[labiovelar]] stop, {{IPA|[gʷ]}}, which was written with the digraph ''gw''. It occurred after a nasal, e.g. ''saggws'' {{IPA|[saŋgʷs]}} &quot;song&quot;, or long as a regular outcome of Germanic *''ww'', e.g. ''triggws'' {{IPA|[trigʷːs]}} &quot;faithful&quot; (English ''true'', German ''treu'', Swedish ''trygg'').
* Similarly the letters ''ddj'', which is the regular outcome of Germanic *''jj'', may represent a voiced palatal stop, {{IPA|[ɟː]}}: ''waddjus'' {{IPA|[twaɟːe]}} &quot;wall&quot; (Swedish ''vägg''), ''twaddje'' {{IPA|[waɟːe:]}} &quot; two (genitive)&quot;.

====Fricatives====
* {{IPA|[s]}} and {{IPA|[z]}} are usually written ''s'' and ''z''. The latter corresponds to Germanic *''z'' (which has become ''r'' or silent in the other Germanic langauges); at the end of a word, it is regularly devoiced to ''s''. E.g. ''saíhs'' {{IPA|[sɛhs]}} &quot;six&quot;, ''máiza'' {{IPA|[mɛːza]}} &quot;greater&quot; (English ''more'', German ''mehr'') ~ ''máis'' {{IPA|[mɛːs]}} &quot;more, rather&quot;.
* {{IPA|[ɸ]}} and {{IPA|[θ]}}, written ''f'' and ''þ'', are voiceless bilabial and voiceless dental fricatives respectively. It is likely that the relatively unstable sound {{IPA|[ɸ]}} became {{IPA|[f]}}. ''f'' and ''þ'' are also derived from ''b'' and ''d'' at the ends of words, when they are devoices and become approximants: ''gif'' {{IPA|[giɸ]}} &quot;give (imperative)&quot; (infinitive ''giban'': German ''geben''), ''miþ'' {{IPA|[miθ]}} &quot;with&quot; ([[Old English language|Old English]] ''mid'', German ''mit'').
* {{IPA|[h]}} is written as ''h'': ''haban'' &quot;to have&quot; (German &quot;haben&quot;). It was probably pronounced {{IPA|[h]}} in word-final position as well (not {{IPA|[x]}}, since {{IPA|/g/}} &gt; {{IPA|[h]}} is written ''g'', not ''h''): ''jah'' {{IPA|[jah]}} &quot;and&quot; (German, Scandinavian ''ja'' &quot;yes&quot;). Before another consonant, it may have had the allophon {{IPA|[x]}}, given that all modern Germanic languages have {{IPA|[k]}} before {{IPA|/s/}} and German has {{IPA|[x]}} before {{IPA|[t]}} (the Scandinavian languages, on the other hand, have ''ht'' &gt; ''tt''): ''saíhs'' {{IPA|[sɛhs] / [sɛxs]}} &quot;six&quot; (German ''sechs'' {{IPA|[zɛks]}}, Swedish ''sex'' {{IPA|[sɛks]}}), ''ahtau'' {{IPA|[ahtɔː] / [axtɔː]}} &quot;eight&quot; (German ''acht'' {{IPA|[axt]}}, Swedish ''åtta'' {{IPA|[ɔtʰa]}}).
* {{IPA|[x]}} is an allophon of {{IPA|/g/}} at the end of a word or before an voiceless consonant; it is always written ''g'': ''dags'' {{IPA|[daxs]}} &quot;day&quot; (German ''Tag''). In some borrowed Greek words, we find the special letter ''x'', which represents the Greek letter χ (''ch''): ''Xristus'' {{IPA|[xristus]}} &quot;Christ&quot; (Gk. {{Polytonic|Χριστός}}). It may also have signified a {{IPA|[k]}}.
* {{IPA|[β]}}, {{IPA|[ð]}} and {{IPA|[γ]}} are voiced fricatives only found between vowels. They are [[allophones]] of {{IPA|[b]}}, {{IPA|[d]}} and {{IPA|[g]}} and are not distinguished from them in writing. {{IPA|[β]}} may have become {{IPA|[v]}}, a more stable labiodental form (a case of [[articulatory strengthening]]). In the study of Germanic languages, these phonemes are usually transcribed as ''{{Unicode|ƀ}}'', ''{{Unicode|đ}}'' and ''{{Unicode|ǥ}}'' respectively: ''haban'' {{IPA|[haβan]}} &quot;to have&quot;, ''þiuda'' {{IPA|[θiu̯ða]}} &quot;people&quot; (Old Norse ''þióð'', German ''Deutsch'' &gt; English ''Dutch''), ''áugo'' {{IPA|[auγoː]}} &quot;eye&quot; (English ''eye'', German ''Auge'').
* ''{{Unicode|ƕ}}'' (also transcribed ''hw'') is a [[Labiovelar consonant|labiovelar variant]] of {{IPA|[x]}} (derived from the proto-Indo-European {{PIE|kʷ}}). It probably was pronounced as {{IPA|[ʍ]}} (a voiceless {{IPA|[w]}}) as it is in many dialects of English, where it is always written as ''wh'': ''{{Unicode|ƕ}}an'' {{IPA|[ʍan]}} &quot;when&quot;, ''{{Unicode|ƕ}}ar'' {{IPA|[ʍar]}} &quot;where&quot;, ''{{Unicode|ƕ}}eits'' {{IPA|[ʍiːts]}} &quot;white&quot;.

====Nasals and approximants and other phonemes ====
Gothic has three nasal consonants, of which one is an allophone of the others, found only in [[complementary distribution]] with them. Nasals in Gothic, like most languages, are pronounced at the same [[point of articulation]] as either the consonant that follows them ( [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]]). Therefore, clusters like {{IPA|[md]}} and {{IPA|[nb]}} are not possible.
* {{IPA|[n]}} and {{IPA|[m]}} are freely distributed - they can be found in any position in a syllable and form [[minimal pair]]s except in certain contexts where they are neutralized: {{IPA|[n]}} before a [[bilabial consonant]] becomes {{IPA|[m]}}, while and {{IPA|[m]}} preceding a [[Dental consonant|dental stop]] becomes an {{IPA|[n]}}, as per the principle of assimilation described in the previous paragraph. In front of a [[Velar consonant|velar stop]], they both become {{IPA|[ŋ]}}. {{IPA|[n]}} and {{IPA|[m]}} are transcribed as ''n'' and ''m'', and in writing neutralisation is marked: ''sniumundo'' {{IPA|[sniu̯mundoː]}} (&quot;quickly&quot;).
* {{IPA|[ŋ]}} is not a phoneme and cannot appear freely in Gothic. It is present where a nasal consonant is neutralised before a [[Velar consonant|velar stop]] and is in a complementary distribution with {{IPA|[n]}} and {{IPA|[m]}}. Following Greek conventions, it is normally written as ''g'' (sometimes ''n''): ''þagkjan'' {{IPA|[θaŋkjan]}} &quot;to think&quot;, ''sigqan'' {{IPA|[siŋkʷan]}} &quot;to sink&quot; ~ ''þankeiþ'' {{IPA|[θaŋkiːθ]}} &quot;thinks''. The cluster ''ggw'' denotes now {{IPA|[ŋgʷ]}}, now {{IPA|[gʷː]}} (see above).
* {{IPA|[w]}} is transliterated as ''w'' before a vowel: ''weis'' {{IPA|[wiːs]}} (&quot;we&quot;), ''twái'' {{IPA|[twɛː]}} &quot;two&quot; (German ''zwei'').
* {{IPA|[j]}} is written as ''j'': ''jer'' {{IPA|[jeːr]}} &quot;year&quot;, ''sakjo'' {{IPA|[sakjoː]}} &quot;strife&quot;.
* {{IPA|[l]}} is used much as in English and other European languages: ''laggs'' {{IPA|[laŋks]}} &quot;long&quot;, ''mel'' {{IPA|[meːl]}} &quot;hour&quot; (English ''meal'', German ''Mahl'').
* {{IPA|[r]}} is a [[Trill consonant|trilled]] {{IPA|[r]}} (eventually a [[Flap consonant|flap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}}): ''raíhts'' {{IPA|[rɛxts]}} &quot;right&quot;, ''afar'' {{IPA|[afar]}} &quot;after&quot;.
* The [[sonorant]]s {{IPA|[l]}}, {{IPA|[m]}}, {{IPA|[n]}} and {{IPA|[r]}} act as the nucleus of a [[syllable]] (&quot;vowels&quot;) after the final consonant of a word or between two consonants. This is also the case in modern English: for example, &quot;bottle&quot; is pronounced {{IPA|[bɒtl̩]}} in many dialects. Some Gothic examples: ''tagl'' {{IPA|[taγl̩]}} &quot;hair&quot; (English ''tail'', Swedish ''tagel''), ''máiþms'' {{IPA|[mɛːθm̩s]}} &quot;gift&quot;, ''táikns'' {{IPA|[tɛːkn̩s]}} &quot;sign&quot; (English ''token'', German ''Zeichen'', Swedish ''tecken'') and ''tagr'' {{IPA|[taγr̩]}} &quot;tear (as in crying)&quot;.

===Accentuation and Intonation===
Accentuation in Gothic can be reconstructed through phonetic comparison, [[Grimm's law]] and [[Verner's law]]. Gothic used a [[stress accent]] rather than the [[pitch accent]] of [[Proto-Indo-European language|proto-Indo-European]]. It is indicated by the fact that long vowels {{IPA|[eː]}} and {{IPA|[oː]}} were shortened and the short vowels {{IPA|[a]}} and {{IPA|[i]}} were lost in unstressed syllables.

Just like other [[Germanic languages]], the free moving Indo-European accent was fixed on the first syllable of simple words. (For example, in modern English, nearly all words that do not have accents on the first syllable are borrowed from other languages.) Accents do not shift when words are [[inflexion|inflected]]. In most compound words, the location of the stress depends on its placement in the second part:

* In compounds where the second word is a ''noun'', the accent is on the first syllable of the first word of the compound.
* In compounds where the second word is a ''verb'', the accent falls on the first syllable of the verbal component. Elements prefixed to verbs are otherwise unstressed, except in the context of separable words (words that can be broken in two parts and separated in regular usage, for example, [[separable verb]]s in German and Dutch) - in those cases, the prefix is stressed.
Examples: (with comparable words from modern Germanic languages)
* Non-compound words: ''marka'' {{IPA|['marka]}} &quot;border, borderlands&quot; (English &quot;march&quot; as in the [[Marches|Spanish Marches]]); ''aftra'' {{IPA|['aftra]}} &quot;after&quot;; ''bidjan'' {{IPA|['bidjan]}} &quot;pray&quot; (German ''beten'', Swedish ''bedja'').
* Compound words:
** Noun second element: ''guda-láus'' {{IPA|['guðalaus]}} &quot;godless&quot;.
** Verb second element: ''ga-láubjan'' {{IPA|[ga'lauβjan]}} &quot;believe&quot; (German ''glauben'' &lt; [[Old High German]] ''g(i)louben'' by [[syncope]] of the atonic ''i'').

==Morphology==
===Nouns===

Gothic preserves many archaic Indo-European features that are not always present in modern Germanic languages, in particular the rich Indo-European [[declension]] system.  Gothic had [[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]] and [[dative]] cases, as well as vestiges of a [[vocative case]] that was sometimes identical to the nominative and sometimes to the accusative.  The three [[grammatical gender|genders]] of Indo-European were all present, including the neuter gender of modern German and Icelandic and to some extent modern Dutch, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, in opposition to the &quot;common gender&quot; (''genus commune'') which applies to both masculine and feminine nouns.  Nouns and adjectives were inflected according to one of two [[grammatical number]]s: the singular and the plural.
   
One of the most striking characteristics of the [[East Germanic languages]] is the division of nouns between those with ''weak declensions'' (generally those where the [[root (linguistics)|root word]] ends in an ''n'') and those with ''strong declensions'' (those whose roots end in a vowel or an inflexional suffix indicative of a pronoun).  This separation is particularly important in Gothic.  While a noun can only belong to one class of declensions, depending on the end of the root word, some adjectives can be either strongly or weakly declined, depending on their meaning.  An adjective employed with a particular meaning and accompanied by a [[deixis|deictic]] article, like the [[demonstrative pronoun]]s ''sa'', ''þata'', or ''so'' which act as definite articles, took a weak declension, while adjectives used with indefinite articles had a strong declension.  

This process is still sometimes found in German, where adjectives are declined:
* weak declension: ''d'''er''' gut'''e''' Wein'' (&quot;the good wine&quot;) ;
* strong declension: ''gut'''er''' Wein'' (&quot;good wine&quot;), ''ein gut'''er''' Wein'' (&quot;a good wine&quot;)

Descriptive adjectives in Gothic (as well as superlatives ending in ''-ist'' and ''-ost'') and the [[past participle]] may take either declension.  Some pronouns only take the weak declension; for example: ''sama'' (English &quot;same&quot;), adjectives like ''un&amp;#405;eila'' (&quot;constantly&quot;, from the root ''&amp;#405;eila'', &quot;time&quot;; compare to the English &quot;while&quot;), comparative adjectives, and [[present participle]]s.  Others, such as ''áins'' (&quot;some&quot;), take only the strong declension.

The table below displays the declension of the Gothic adjective ''blind'' (English: &quot;blind&quot;) with a weak noun (''guma'' - &quot;man&quot;) and a strong one (''dags'' - &quot;day&quot;):

This table is, of course, not exhaustive.  (There are secondary inflexions, particularly for the strong neuter singular and irregular nouns among other contexts, which are not described here.)  An exhaustive table of only the ''types'' of endings Gothic took is presented below.

* '''strong declension''' : 
** roots ending in ''-a'', ''-ja'', ''-wa'' (masculine and neuter): equivalent to the Greek and Latin second declension in ''&amp;#8209;us'' / ''&amp;#8209;i'' and &amp;#8209;&amp;#959;&amp;#962; / &amp;#8209;&amp;#959;&amp;#965;;
** roots ending in ''-o'', ''-jo'' and ''-wo'' (feminine): equivalent to the Greek and Latin first declension in ''&amp;#8209;a'' / ''&amp;#8209;æ'' and &amp;#8209;&amp;#945; / &amp;#8209;&amp;#945;&amp;#962; (&amp;#8209;&amp;#951; / &amp;#8209;&amp;#951;&amp;#962;);
** roots ending in ''-i'' (masculine et feminine): equivalent to the Greek and Latin third declension in ''&amp;#8209;is'' (acc. ''&amp;#8209;im'') and &amp;#8209;&amp;#953;&amp;#962; / &amp;#8209;&amp;#949;&amp;#969;&amp;#962;; 
** roots ending in ''-u'' (all three genders) : equivalent to the Latin fourth declension in ''&amp;#8209;us'' / ''&amp;#8209;us'' and the Greek third declension in &amp;#8209;&amp;#965;&amp;#962; / &amp;#8209;&amp;#949;&amp;#969;&amp;#962;; 
* '''weak declension''' (all roots ending in ''-n''), equivalent to the Greek and Latin third declension in ''&amp;#8209;o'' / ''&amp;#8209;onis'' and &amp;#8209;&amp;#969;&amp;#957; / &amp;#8209;&amp;#959;&amp;#957;&amp;#959;&amp;#962; or &amp;#8209;&amp;#951;&amp;#957; / &amp;#8209;&amp;#949;&amp;#957;&amp;#959;&amp;#962;:
** roots ending in ''-an'', ''-jan'', ''-wan'' (masculine);
** roots ending in ''-on'' et ''-ein'' (feminine);
** roots ending in ''-n'' (neuter): equivalent to the Greek and Latin third declension in ''&amp;#8209;men'' / ''&amp;#8209;minis'' and &amp;#8209;&amp;#956;&amp;#945; / &amp;#8209;&amp;#956;&amp;#945;&amp;#964;&amp;#959;&amp;#962;;
* '''minor declensions''' : roots ending in ''-r'', en ''-nd'' and vestigial endings in other consonants, equivalent to other third declensions in Greek and Latin.

Gothic adjectives follow noun declensions closely - they take same types of inflexion.

===Pronouns===
Gothic inherited the full set of Indo-European pronouns: [[personal pronoun]]s (including [[reflexive pronoun]]s for each of the three [[grammatical person]]s), [[possessive pronoun]]s, both simple and compound [[demonstrative pronoun|demonstratives]], [[relative pronoun]]s, [[interrogative pronoun|interrogatives]] and [[indefinite pronoun]]s.  Each follows a particular pattern of inflexion (partially mirroring the noun declension), much like other Indo-European languages.  One particularly noteworthy characteristic is the preservation of the [[dual number]], refering to two people or things while the plural was only used for quantities greater than two.  Thus, &quot;the two of us&quot; and &quot;we&quot; for numbers greater than two were expressed as ''wit'' and ''weis'' respectively.  While [[Proto-Indo-European language|proto-Indo-European]] used the dual for all grammatical categories that took a number (as did classical [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]]), Gothic is unusual among Indo-European languages in only preserving it for pronouns.

The simple demonstrative pronoun ''sa'' (neuter: ''þata'', feminine: ''so'', from the Indo-European root ''*so'', ''*seh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''*tod''; cognate to the [[Greek language|Greek]] article &amp;#8001;, &amp;#964;&amp;#972;, &amp;#7969; and the [[Latin]] ''is'''tud''''') can be used as an article, allowing constructions of the type ''definite article + weak adjective + noun''.

The interrogative pronouns are also noteworthy for all beginning in ''&amp;#405;-'', which derives from the proto-Indo-European consonant ''*k&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;w&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;'' that was present at the beginning of all interrogratives in proto-Indo-European.  This is cognate to the ''wh-'' at the beginning of many English interrogatives which, like in Gothic, are pronounced with [&amp;#653;] in some dialects.  This same etymology is present in the interrogratives of many other Indo-European languages&quot; ''w-'' [v] in [[German language|German]], ''v-'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], the [[Latin]] ''qu-'' (which persists in modern [[Romance languages]]), the [[Greek language|Greek]] &amp;#964; or &amp;#960; (a derivation of ''*k&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;w&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;'' that is unique to Greek), and the [[Sanskrit]] ''k-'' as well as many others.

===Verbs===
The bulk of Gothic verbs follow the type of Indo-European conjugation called [[Athematic|&quot;thematic&quot;]] because they insert a vowel derived from the reconstructed proto-Indo-European phonemes ''*e'' or ''*o'' between roots and inflexional suffixes.  This pattern is also present in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]]:
*Latin - ''leg-i-mus'' (&quot;we read&quot;): root ''leg-'' + thematic vowel ''-i-'' (from ''*e'') + suffix ''-mus''.
*Greek - &amp;#955;&amp;#965;-&amp;#972;-&amp;#956;&amp;#949;&amp;#957; (&quot;we untie&quot;): root &amp;#955;&amp;#965;- + thematic vowel -&amp;#959;- + suffix -&amp;#956;&amp;#949;&amp;#957;.
*Gothic - ''nim-a-m'' (&quot;we take&quot;):  root ''nim-'' ([[German language|German]] ''nehmen'') + thematic vowel ''-a-'' (from ''*o'') + suffix ''-m''.

The other conjugation, called [[Athematic|&quot;athematic&quot;]], where suffixes are added directly to roots, exists only in unproductive vestigial forms in Gothic, just as it does in Greek and Latin.  The most important such instance is [[Indo-European copula|the verb &quot;to be&quot;]], which is athematic in Greek, Latin, Sanskrit and many other Indo-European languages.

Gothic verbs are, like nouns and adjectives, divided into strong verbs and weak verbs.  Weak verbs are characterised by [[preterite]]s formed by appending the suffixes ''-da'' or ''-ta'', parallel to past participles formed with ''-þ'' / ''-t''.  Strong verbs form preterites by alternating vowels in their root forms or by doubling the first consonant in the root, but without adding a suffix in either case.  This parallels the Greek and Sanskit [[perfect tense]]s.  This dichotomy is still present in modern Germanic languages: 
* weak verbs (&quot;to have&quot;) : 
** Gothic: ''haban'', preterite ''habái'''da''''', past participle ''habái'''þ'''s'' ;
** English: ''(to) have'', preterite ''ha'''d''''', past participle ''ha'''d''''' ;
** German: ''haben'', preterite ''hat'''te''''', past participle ''(ge)hab'''t''''' ;
** Icelandic: ''hafa'', preterite ''haf'''ði''''', past participle ''haf'''t''''' ;

* strong verbs (&quot;to give&quot;) : 
** Gothic: infinitive ''g'''i'''ban'', preterite ''g'''a'''f'' ; 
** English: infinitive ''(to) g'''i'''ve'', preterite ''g'''a'''ve'' ;
** German: infinitive ''g'''e'''ben'', preterite ''g'''a'''b'' ;
** Icelandic: infinitive ''g'''e'''fa'', preterite ''g'''a'''f''.

Verbal inflexions in Gothic have two [[grammatical voice]]s: the active and the medial; three numbers: singular, dual (except in the third person), and plural; two tenses: present and preterite (derived from a former perfect tense); three [[grammatical mood]]s: [[indicative mood|indicative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] (from an old [[optative mood|optative]] form) and [[imperative mood|imperative]]; as well as three kinds of nominal forms: a present [[infinitive]], a present [[participle]], and a past [[passive]].  Not all tenses and persons are represented in all moods and voices - some conjugations use [[Auxiliary verb|auxiliary forms]].

Finally, there are forms called &quot;preterite-present&quot; - old Indo-European perfect tenses that were reinterpreted as present tense.  The Gothic word ''wáit'', from the proto-Indo-European ''*woid-h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e'' (&quot;to see&quot; in the perfect tense), corresponds exactly to its Sanskrit cognate ''véda'' and in Greek to &amp;#988;&amp;#959;&amp;#7990;&amp;#948;&amp;#945;.  Both etymologically should mean &quot;I saw&quot; (in the perfective sense) but mean &quot;I see&quot; (in the preterite-present meaning).  Latin follows the same rule with ''n&amp;#333;u&amp;#299;'' (&quot;I knew&quot; and &quot;I know&quot;).   The preterite-present verbs include ''áihan'' (&quot;to possess&quot;) and ''kunnan'' (&quot;to know&quot;) among others.

==Gothic compared to other Germanic languages==
===Gothic and Old Norse===
The Goths had a tradition of a Scandinavian origin, and there are linguistic similarities with [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]], especially with its dialect [[Old Gutnish]]. The number of similarities that Old Gutnish had with Gothic made the prominent linguist [[Elias Wessén]] classify it as a Gothic dialect. This is a text sample from the [[Gutasaga]] about a migration to southern Europe (Manuscript from the [[14th century]]):

:''siþan af þissum þrim aucaþis fulc j gutlandi som mikit um langan tima at land elptj þaim ai alla fyþa þa lutaþu þair bort af landi huert þriþia þiauþ so at alt sculdu þair aiga oc miþ sir bort hafa som þair vfan iorþar attu... so fierri foru þair at þair quamu til griclanz... oc enn byggia oc enn hafa þair sumt af waru mali'' 

:over a long time, the people descended from these three multiplied so much that the land couldn't support them all. Then they draw lots, and every third person was picked to leave, and they could keep everything they owned and take it with them, except for their land. ... They went so far that they came to the land of the Greeks. ... they settled there, and live there still, and still have something of our language. 

The main points cited for grouping North and East Germanic are:

1) The evolution of the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] *''-jj-'' and *''-gg-'' into Gothic ''ddj'' (from an older Gothic ''ggj''?) and ''ggw'' and Old Norse ''ggj'' and ''ggv'' (&quot;Holtzmann's law&quot;). For instance, the [[Old High German]] genitive of ''zwei'' (two) is ''zweio'', which is distinct from Gothic ''twaddje'' and Old Norse ''tveggja''. Whereas German has the form ''treu'', Gothic has ''triggws'' and modern Swedish ''trygg''.

2) The existence of numerous inchoative verbs ending with -''na'', such as Gothic ''waknan'' and modern Swedish ''vakna''.

3) Gothic is important for the understanding of the evolution of Proto-Germanic into Old Norse through [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]]. For instance, the final -''n'' in North Germanic languages, such as ''navn'' and ''namn'' (name) is explained by referring to Gothic in which ''namo'' had its plural genitive ''namne''. Sometimes, Gothic explains forms of words found on the oldest runestones, such as the Gothic word ''gudja'' ([[gothi]], man serving as priest) which explains the word ''gudija'' found on the runestone of Nordhuglo in Norway.

But there have also been theories grouping West and East Germanic. Today, the three groups are generally treated as derived independently from [[Proto-Germanic]].

===Other unique features of Gothic===

Being the first attested Germanic language, Gothic fails to display a number of traits that are shared by all other known Germanic languages.  Most conspicuously, Gothic contains no morphological [[umlaut]]; the Gothic word ''gudja'' &quot;priest&quot; can be contrasted with the Old Norse ''gydja'' (&quot;priestess&quot;); the Norse form contains the characteristic change /u/ &gt; /y/ that indicates the influence of i-umlaut in [[Proto-Norse]]; the Gothic form shows no such change.  

Gothic retains a [[passive voice]] inherited from Indo-European, but unattested in all other Germanic languages.  Gothic preserves several verbs that display [[reduplication]] (''haitan'', &quot;to be called&quot; &gt; ''haihait''; cf. Norwegian ''heita'' German ''heißen'', archaic English ''hight'') in the formation of the [[preterit]]; another Indo-European inheritance that has left only a few traces in Old English, Old Norse and Old High German.

'''Greek''' (Greek Ελληνικά, [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|[e̞ˌliniˈka]}} — &quot;Hellenic&quot;) is an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] with a documented history of 3,500 years. Today, it is spoken by 15 million people in [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]], the former Yugoslavia, particularly the former Yugoslav [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Albania]] and [[Turkey]]. There are also many Greek emigrant communities around the world, such as those in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] which has the third largest urban Greek population of any city in the world, after [[Athens]] and [[Thessaloniki]].

Greek has been written in the [[Greek alphabet]], the first true [[alphabet]], since the 9th century B.C. and before that, in [[Linear B]] and the [[Cypriot syllabary|Cypriot]] syllabaries.

[[Greek literature]] has a long and rich tradition.

==History==
{{History of the Greek language}}
{{main|History of the Greek language}}
''This article does not cover the reconstructed history of Greek prior to the use of writing. For more information, see main article on [[Proto-Greek language]].''

Greek has been spoken in the [[Balkan]] Peninsula since the [[2nd millennium BC]]. The earliest evidence of this is found in the [[Linear B]] tablets dating from [[1500 BC]]. The later [[Greek alphabet]] (''q.v.'') is unrelated to Linear B, and was derived from the [[Phoenician alphabet]] ([[abjad]]); with minor modifications, it is still used today. Greek is conventionally divided into the following periods:

*'''[[Mycenean language|Mycenean Greek]]''': the language of the [[Mycenean civilisation]]. It is recorded in the [[Linear B]] script on tablets dating from the [[16th century BC]] onwards.

*'''[[Ancient Greek|Classical Greek]]''' (also known as [[Ancient Greek]]): In its various dialects was the language of the [[Archaic]] and [[Classical]] periods of Greek civilisation. It was widely known throughout the Roman empire. Classical Greek fell into disuse in western Europe in the [[Middle Ages]], but remained known in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] world, and was reintroduced to the rest of [[Europe]] with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and Greek migration to [[Italy]]. 

*'''[[Hellenistic Greek]]''' (also known as [[Koine Greek]]): The fusion of various ancient Greek dialects with [[Attic Greek|Attic]] (the dialect of Athens) resulted in the creation of the first '''common''' Greek dialect, which gradually turned into one of the world's first international languages. [[Koine Greek]] can be initially traced within the armies and conquered territories of [[Alexander the Great]], but after the [[Hellenistic]] colonisation of the known world, it was spoken from [[Egypt]] to the fringes of [[India]]. After the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] conquest of Greece, an unofficial diglossy of Greek and Latin was established in the city of [[Rome]] and Koine Greek became a first or second language in the [[Roman Empire]]. Through Koine Greek it is also traced the origin of [[Christianity]], as the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] used it to preach in [[Greece]] and the Greek-speaking world. It is also known as the '''Alexandrian dialect''', '''Post-Classical Greek''' or even '''New Testament Greek''' (after its most famous work of literature).

*'''[[Medieval Greek]]''': The continuation of [[Hellenistic Greek]] during medieval [[Greek history]] as the official and vernacular (if not the literary nor the ecclesiastic) language of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and continued to be used until, and after the fall of that Empire in the [[15th century]]. Also known as '''Byzantine Greek'''.

*'''[[Modern Greek]]''': Stemming independently from [[Koine Greek]], '''Modern Greek''' usages can be traced in the late [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period (as early as 11th century).[[Image:Codex alexandrinus.jpg|thumb|150px|left|A section of the [[Codex Alexandrinus]]. This section contains [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 12:54-13:4.]]
Two main forms of the language have been in use since the end of the medieval Greek period: [[Modern Greek|Dhimotikí]] (Δημοτική), the Demotic (vernacular) language, and [[Katharevousa|Katharévousa]] (Καθαρεύουσα), an imitation of classical Greek, which was used for literary, juridic, and scientific purposes during the [[19th century|19th]] and early [[20th century|20th]] centuries. Demotic Greek is now the official language of the modern Greek state, and the most widely spoken by Greeks today.

It has been claimed that an &quot;educated&quot; speaker of the modern language can understand an ancient text, but this is surely as much a function of education as of the similarity of the languages. Still, Koinē {{IPA|/ciˈni/}}, the version of Greek used to write the [[New Testament]] and the [[Septuagint]], is relatively easy to understand for modern speakers.

Greek words have been widely borrowed into the European languages: ''astronomy'', ''democracy'', ''philosophy'', ''thespian'', etc.  Moreover, Greek words and [[morpheme|word elements]] continue to be productive as a basis for coinages: ''anthropology'', ''photography'', ''isomer'', ''biomechanics'' etc. and form, with [[Latin language|Latin]] words, the foundation of international scientific and technical vocabulary.  See ''[[English words of Greek origin]]'', and ''[[List of Greek words with English derivatives]]''.

==Classification==
Greek is an independent branch of the [[Indo-European]] [[language family]].  The ancient languages which were probably most closely related to it, [[Ancient Macedonian language]] (which may have been a [[dialect]] of Greek) and [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]], are not well enough documented to permit detailed comparison. Among living languages, [[Armenian language|Armenian]] seems to be the most closely related to it.

==Geographic distribution==
Modern Greek is spoken by about 15 million people mainly in [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]]. There are also Greek-speaking populations in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Egypt]], [[Turkey]], [[Albania]], [[Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]] and [[Southern Italy]]. The language is spoken also in many other countries where Greeks have settled, including [[Armenia]], [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Netherlands]], [[Sweden]], [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]].

==Official status==
Greek is the [[official language]] of [[Greece]] where it is spoken by about 99.5% of the population. It is also, alongside [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the official language of [[Cyprus]]. Due to the membership of Greece and Cyprus in the European Union, Greek is one of the [[languages of the European Union#official languages of the European Union|20 official languages]] of the [[European Union]].

==Phonology==
This section generally describes the post-Classic phonology of the Greek language.

:''All phonetic transcriptions in this section use the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]''

===Vowel sounds===
Greek has 5 vowel sounds, all phonemic:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
 &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th width=&quot;20%&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th width=&quot;20%&quot;&gt;[[Front vowel|Front]]&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th width=&quot;20%&quot;&gt;[[Back vowel|Back]]&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[[Close vowel|Close]]&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;[[Close front unrounded vowel|{{IPA|i}}]]&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;[[Close back rounded vowel|{{IPA|u}}]]&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[[mid vowel|Mid]]&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;[[close-mid front unrounded vowel#mid front unrounded vowel|{{IPA|e̞}}]]&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;[[Close-mid back rounded vowel#mid back rounded vowel|{{IPA|o̞}}]]&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[[Open vowel|Open]]&lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;[[Open front unrounded vowel|{{IPA|a}}]]&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
|}

Close vowels, when found in unstressed final syllables, tend to be voiceless, particularly if they are between voiceless consonants [e.g.: φάσης {{IPA|/ˈfasis/}} → {{IPA|/ˈfasi̥s/}} (→ {{IPA|/fasː/}}) = &quot;of phase&quot; ([[genitive case]])].

===Consonants===

Greek has a repertoire of 29 consonant sounds.  The number of phonemes depends on the analysis, but may be as few as 15, assuming for example that the sound [b] is represented in the underlying form as /mp/, which is also its standard orthographic representation.  (cf. Newton)

Greek /p/, /t/ and /k/ are not [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] as they are in English. They tend to be voiced to /b/, /d/ and /g/ in Cretan and Cypriot dialects. The letter &lt;ρ&gt; is generally pronounced /r/, but tends to be pronounced {{IPA|/ɾ/}} in intervocalic position.

Standard Modern Greek does not have double consonants within words, although some dialects (notably Cypriot) do.

===Sandhi rules===

Greek has certain [[sandhi]] rules, some represented in the orthography, some not.

/n/ before bilabials and [[Velar consonant|velars]] becomes /m/ and /{{IPA|[[Velar nasal|ŋ]]}}/ respectively, and is written &lt;μ&gt; (συμπάθεια, &quot;sympathy&quot;) and &lt;γ&gt; (συγκρητισμός, &quot;syncretism&quot;). Before the labiodental fricatives &lt;φ&gt; and &lt;β&gt;, it is also written &lt;μ&gt;, but pronounced /{{IPA|[[Labiodental nasal|ɱ]]}}/ (συμφωνία, &quot;symphony&quot;).

The combination &lt;μπ&gt; is pronounced /mb/ after vowels (but often reduced to /b/), else /b/. In some words, especially in Northern dialects, could also be pronounced /mp/.

The combinations &lt;γγ&gt; and &lt;γκ&gt; are pronounced /ŋg/ or /{{IPA|ŋɟ}}/ after vowels, else /g/ or /{{IPA|[[Voiced palatal plosive|ɟ]]}}/. An exception to this rule is the word &lt;συγγνώμη&gt; (freely translated &quot;I'm sorry&quot;) in which /n/ is phonetically dropped and the word is pronounced /{{IPA|siˈŋgnomi}}/ (this is actually an older form of the word, the current orthography is &lt;συγνώμη&gt;, pronounced /{{IPA|siˈγnomi}}/, in which /n/ is dropped both phonetically and literally).

The combination &lt;ντ&gt; is pronounced /nd/ after vowels (but often reduced to /d/), else /d/. In some words, especially in Northern dialects, could also be pronounced /nt/.

The sounds /k/ and /g/, before the front vowels /{{IPA|[[Close-mid front unrounded vowel#mid front unrounded vowel|e̞]]}}/ and /i/, are palatalized, becoming /{{IPA|[[Voiceless palatal plosive|c]]}}/ and /{{IPA|[[Voiced palatal plosive|ɟ]]}}/. In some dialects, notably in Crete, they become [{{IPA|[[Voiceless alveolo-palatal affricate|ʨ]]}}] and [{{IPA|[[Voiced alveolo-palatal affricate|ʥ]]}}].

The word {{polytonic|ἐστὶ}} (estí, IPA /{{IPA|e̞sˈti}}/), which means &quot;is&quot; in Ancient Greek (q.v. Modern Greek είναι), gains a &quot;''euphonic''&quot; n. in Modern Greek, the negative adverb δεν and the accusative articles τον and την  lose the final /n/, depending on the beginning letter of the next word (if it's a consonant, /n/ is usually dropped). In the phrase δεν πειράζει, which means &quot;it doesn't matter&quot;, instead of being dropped, n is assimilated into the second word and, following the example above, np is pronounced /mp/ in Northern Greece and /mb/ in Southern Greece, thus producing the sound /ðempirázi/ or /ðembirázi/.

Some of these rules are optional, and reflect the formality of speech. While everyday spoken Greek sounds artificial if the sandhi rules are ''not'' used, a formal or official speech may sound equally awkward if sandhi rules ''are'' used.

===Orthography===

The Greek vowel letters with their pronunciation are: &lt;α&gt; {{IPA|/a/}}, &lt;ε&gt; {{IPA|/e̞/}}, &lt;η&gt; {{IPA|/i/}}, &lt;ι&gt; {{IPA|/i/}}, &lt;ο&gt; {{IPA|/o̞/}}, &lt;υ&gt; {{IPA|/i/}}, &lt;ω&gt; {{IPA|/o̞/}}. There are also vowel digraphs, called &quot;double-digit vowels&quot; which are phonetically monophthongal: &lt;αι&gt; {{IPA|/e̞/}}, &lt;ει&gt; {{IPA|/i/}}, &lt;οι&gt; {{IPA|/i/}}, &lt;ου&gt; {{IPA|/u/}}, &lt;υι&gt; {{IPA|/i/}}. The three digraphs &lt;αυ&gt;, &lt;ευ&gt; and &lt;ηυ&gt; are pronounced {{IPA|/av/}}, {{IPA|/e̞v/}} and {{IPA|/iv/}} except when followed by unvoiced consonants, in which case they are pronounced {{IPA|/af/}}, {{IPA|/e̞f/}} and {{IPA|/if/}}.

Modern Greek has also four diphthongs: &lt;αη&gt; (or &lt;άη&gt;) {{IPA|/aj/}}, &lt;αϊ&gt; (or &lt;άι&gt;) {{IPA|/aj/}}, &lt;οη&gt; (or &lt;όη&gt;) {{IPA|/o̞j/}} and &lt;οϊ&gt; (or &lt;όι&gt;) {{IPA|/o̞j/}} (diphthongs can better be transcribed using the IPA non-syllabic diacritic under {{IPA|/i/}} instead of the approximant {{IPA|/j/}}).

The Greek letters &lt;β&gt; and &lt;δ&gt; are pronounced {{IPA|/v/}} and {{IPA|/ð/}} respectively. The letter &lt;γ&gt; is generally pronounced {{IPA|/ɣ/}}, but before the mid or close front vowels, it is pronounced {{IPA|/ʝ/}}.

The letters &lt;θ&gt;, &lt;φ&gt; and &lt;χ&gt; are pronounced {{IPA|/θ/}}, {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/x/}}. The letter &lt;χ&gt;, before mid or close front vowels, is pronounced {{IPA|/ç/}}. The letter &lt;ξ&gt; stands for {{IPA|/k͡s/}} and &lt;ψ&gt; stands for {{IPA|/p͡s/}} (the tie bar is used to indicate that, in Modern Greek, &lt;ξ&gt; and &lt;ψ&gt; should be considered sibilant affricates). The digraphs &lt;γγ&gt; and &lt;γκ&gt; are generally pronounced {{IPA|/g/}}, but are pronounced {{IPA|/ɟ/}} before mid or close front vowels. When these digraphs are preceded by a vowel, they are pronounced {{IPA|/ŋg/}}  ({{IPA|/ŋɟ/}} before mid or close front vowels). The digraph &lt;γγ&gt; may be pronounced {{IPA|/ŋɣ/}} in some words ({{IPA|/ŋʝ/}}) before mid or close front vowels). It is better to use a tie bar above {{IPA|/ŋg/}}, {{IPA|/ŋɟ/}}, {{IPA|/ŋɣ/}} and {{IPA|/ŋʝ/}}, when used for Greek words, to indicate the simultaneous articulation.

==Grammar==
Modern Greek is still largely a [[synthetic language]]. It is one of the few Indo-European languages that has retained a synthetic [[passive voice|passive]]. Noticeable changes in its grammar (compared to Classical Greek) include the loss of the [[dative]], the [[optative mood]], the [[infinitive]] the [[dual number]], and the [[participle]]s (except the past participle); the adoption of the [[gerund]]; the reduction in the number of noun [[declension]]s, and the number of distinct forms in each declension; the adoption of the [[modal particle]] ''θα'' (a corruption of ''{{Polytonic|ἐθέλω ἵνα}}'' &gt; ''θέλω να'' &gt; ''θε' να'' &gt; ''θα'') to denote future and conditional tenses; the introduction of [[auxiliary verb]] forms for certain tenses; the extension to the future tense of the aspectual distinction between present/imperfect and aorist; the loss of the third person imperative,  and the simplification of the system of grammatical prefixes, such as [[augment (linguistics)|augmentation]] and [[reduplication]]. Some of these features are shared with other languages spoken in the Balkan peninsula (see [[Balkan linguistic union]]).

[[Archaism|Archaic]] forms are still used in formal writing and in a few expressions like εντάξει (entáxei /{{IPA|ɛnˈdaˌksi}}/), which means &quot;OK&quot; (literally: &quot;in order&quot;) or ''ζήτω!'' ('long live!');

==Writing system==
{{Table_Greekletters}}
{{sectstub}}
Modern Greek is written in the late [[Ionic]] variant of the [[Greek alphabet]], the oldest discovered inscriptions of which date to the 8th or 9th Century BC, assumed its final form in 403 BC, and displaced other regional variants due to its use for the [[Attic]] ''[[Koine]]'' dialect during the [[Hellenistic]] era.

The Greek alphabet consists of 24 letters, each with a capital and lowercase (small) form: 
[[Alpha (letter)|Α α]],
[[Beta (letter)|Β β]],
[[Gamma|Γ γ]],
[[Delta (letter)|Δ δ]],
[[Epsilon|Ε ε]],
[[Zeta (letter)|Ζ ζ]],
[[Eta (letter)|Η η]],
[[Theta|Θ θ]],
[[Iota|Ι ι]],
[[Kappa (letter)|Κ κ]],
[[Lambda|Λ λ]],
[[Mu (letter)|Μ μ]],
[[Nu (letter)|Ν ν]],
[[Xi|Ξ ξ]],
[[Omicron|Ο ο]],
[[Pi (letter)|Π π]],
[[Rho (letter)|Ρ ρ]],
[[Sigma (letter)|Σ σ ς (word-final form)]],
[[Tau|Τ τ]],
[[Upsilon|Υ υ]],
[[Phi (letter)|Φ φ]],
[[Chi (letter)|Χ χ]],
[[Psi (letter)|Ψ ψ]],
[[Omega|Ω ω]].

In addition to the letters of the alphabet, Greek has a number of diacritical signs, most of which were eliminated from official use in Greece in 1982 as no longer corresponding to the modern pronunciation of the language. See [[Monotonic orthography]] for the simplified modern set, and [[Polytonic orthography]] for the traditional set.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{dablink|[[Golem (ILP)|Golem]] is also the name of an [[inductive logic programming]] system. [[Golem (Pokémon)|Golem]] is also a rock-type [[Pokémon]]. }}

In [[Jewish folklore]], a '''golem''' (גולם, sometimes [as in Yiddish] pronounced ''goilem'') is an animated being which is crafted from inanimate material. In modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] the word ''golem'' denotes &quot;fool&quot;, &quot;silly&quot;, or even &quot;stupid&quot;, &quot;clue-less&quot;, and &quot;dumb&quot;, and literally means &quot;cocoon&quot;. The name appears to derive from the word ''gelem'' (גלם), which means &quot;raw material&quot;.

==History==

===Origins of the word===
The word ''golem'' is used in the [[Bible]] to refer to an embryonic or incomplete substance: [[Psalms|Psalm]] 139:16 uses the word &quot;&lt;b&gt;g&lt;/b&gt;a&lt;b&gt;l&lt;/b&gt;'&lt;b&gt;m&lt;/b&gt;i&quot;, meaning &quot;my unshaped form&quot; (in Hebrew, root words are defined by sequences of consonants, ie. &lt;b&gt;glm&lt;/b&gt;). The [[Mishnah]] uses the term for an uncultivated person (&quot;Ten characteristics are in a learned person, and ten in an uncultivated one&quot;, [[Pirkei Avoth]] 5:7). Similarly, Golems are used today primarily in [[metaphor]] either as brainless lunks or as entities serving man under controlled conditions but enemies in others. Similarly, it is a [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] slang insult for someone who is clumsy or slow.

===Earliest stories===
The earliest stories of golems date to early Judaism.  [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] is described in the Talmud (Tractate [[Sanhedrin]] 38b) as initially created as a golem when his dust was &quot;kneaded into a shapeless hunk&quot;. Like Adam (whose name literally means &quot;red [clay],&quot;) all golems are created from [[mud]]. They were a creation of those who were very holy and close to [[God]].  A very holy person was one who strove to approach God, and in that pursuit would gain some of God's wisdom and power.  One of these powers was the creation of life.  No matter how holy a person became, however, the being they created would be but a shadow of one created by God.

Early on, the notion developed that the main disability of the golem was its inability to speak. In [[Sanhedrin]] 65b, it describes how [[Rabba]] created a golem using the [[Sefer Yetzirah]]. He sent the golem to Rabbi [[Zeira]]. Rabbi Zeira spoke to the golem, but he did not answer. Said Rabbi Zeira, &quot;I see that you were created by one of our colleagues; return to your dust.&quot;

===Owning and activating golems===
Having a golem servant was seen as the ultimate symbol of wisdom and holiness, and there are many tales of golems connected to prominent rabbis throughout the [[Middle Ages]].

Other attributes of the golem were gradually added over time. In many tales the Golem is inscribed with magic or religious words that keep it animated. Writing one of the [[Names of God in Judaism|names of God]] on its forehead, a slip of paper attached to its forehead, or on a clay tablet under its tongue, or writing the word ''Emet'' (אמת, 'truth' in the [[Hebrew language]]) on its forehead are examples of such words. By erasing the first letter in ''Emet'' to form ''Meit'' (מת, 'death' in Hebrew) the golem could be deactivated.

===The classic narrative===
The most famous golem narrative involves [[Judah Low ben Bezalel|the Maharal]] of [[Prague]], a [[16th century]] [[rabbi]]. He is reported to have created a golem to defend the Prague [[ghetto]] from [[Anti-Semitism|Anti-Semitic]] attacks. The story of the Golem first appeared in print in 1847 in a collection of Jewish tales entitled ''Galerie der Sippurim'', published by Wolf Pascheles of Prague. About sixty years later, a fictional account was published by Yudl Rosenberg (1909). According to the legend, Golem could be made of clay from the banks of the [[Vltava]] river in Prague. Following the prescribed rituals, the Rabbi built the Golem and made him come to life by reciting special incantations in Hebrew. As Rabbi Loew's Golem grew bigger, he also became more violent and started killing people and spreading fear. Rabbi Loew was promised that the violence against the Jews would stop if the Golem was destroyed. The Rabbi agreed. To destroy the Golem, he rubbed out the first letter of the word &quot;emet&quot; from the golem's forehead to make the Hebrew word &quot;met&quot;, meaning death. 
The existence of a golem is sometimes a mixed blessing.  Golems are not intelligent - if commanded to perform a task, they will take the instructions perfectly literally.

===The hubris theme===
In all Jewish kabbalistic descriptions of Golems, they are incapable of disobeying the one who created them, but in one version of the story, Rabbi Eliyahu of Chelm created a Golem that grew bigger and bigger until it tore the name of God from its forehead, whereupon it fell over its creator. The [[hubris]] theme in this version is similar to that in the stories of the monster of [[Frankenstein]] and of the broomstick in [[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]. It remains a standard feature of golems in popular culture.

===The golem in European culture===
In the late nineteenth century the golem was adopted by mainstream European society. Most notably [[Gustav Meyrink]]'s [[1915]] novel ''[[The Golem (Meyrink)|Der Golem]]'' based on the tales of the golem created by [[Judah Low ben Bezalel]].  This book inspired a classic set of [[Expressionism (film)|expressionistic]] [[silent movies]], [[Paul Wegener]]'s Golem series, of which especially ''Golem: How He Came Into the World'' (also released as ''The Golem'', 1920, USA 1921) is famous. Another famous treatment from the same era is [[H. Leivick]]'s 1921 Yiddish-language &quot;dramatic poem in eight sections&quot; ''[[The Golem (Leivick)|The Golem]]''.  Also notable is [[Julien Duvivier]]'s &quot;Le Golem&quot; (1936), a sequel to the Wegener film.

These tales saw a dramatic change, and some would argue a Christianization, of the golem.  Christianity, far more than Judaism, has long had a deep concern with humanity getting too close to God.  The golem thus became a creation of overambitious and overreaching mystics, who would inevitably be punished for their blasphemy, very similar to [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' and the [[alchemy|alchemical]] [[homunculus]]. In [[Norse mythology]], Mökkurkálfi (or Mistcalfa) was a clay giant, built to help the [[troll]] [[Hrungnir]] in a battle with [[Thor]]. The Golem has also been considered by some to be an early [[android]], further divorcing it from its roots.

In America, the opera &quot;'The Golem' by Abraham Ellstein retells in 20th-century harmonic language the centuries-old tale of a creature fashioned from clay and brought to life by kabbalistic spells who ultimately threatens the very people he was intended to serve.&quot; (quote from Milken website) Selections are available on disc from the Milken Archive of American Jewish music.

==In popular culture==
&lt;!--Please only insert notable examples here, as this list is potentially endless--&gt;

===Books, films and TV===

Probably as a result of the popularity of Meyrink's work, the golem concept has found its way into various elements of popular culture. Examples include:

* The Golem of Prague has appeared in stories across many media, including the novels ''[[The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay]]'', ''[[A Calculus of Angels]]'', ''[[He, She and It]]'', [[Pete Hamill]]'s ''Snow in August'', the 1990s cartoons ''[[The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest]]'' and ''[[Gargoyles (animated series)|Gargoyles]]'', and the computer games [[Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption]] and [[Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb]].

* Edward Einhorn's ''Golem Stories'' appearing in his book of plays entitled ''[http://www.untitledtheater.com/GMS.htm The Golem, Methuselah, and Shylock]'' includes a golem that has the soul of a young man who was the fiance of the Rabbi's daughter.

* Also inspired in part by the story of the Golem of Prague, [[Ted Chiang]] wrote a short story &quot;[[Seventy-Two Letters]]&quot; which explores the role of language in the creation of golems. The story won the [[Sidewise Award for Alternate History]] in 2000. It can be found in the collection ''[[Stories of Your Life and Others]]''.

* [[Karel Capek|Karel Čapek]]'s [[1921]] play ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]'' included robots which are not machines, but synthetic humans made from a claylike goo.

* The science-fiction novel ''[[Kiln People]]'' by [[David Brin]] features short-lived duplicates of people created from mud, and a character named Maharal.

* [[Golem XIV]] is name of  a hyper-intelligent computer from a sci-fi novel written by [[Stanisław Lem]] in [[1981]]

* [[Stel Pavlou]] uses multiple golems created from carbon based nanotechnology as the guardians of Atlantis in the novel ''[[Decipher (novel)|Decipher]]'' [[2001]].

* [[Roger Zelazny]] uses the golem metaphorically as an android sparring partner, literally called a golem, in the novel ''[[This Immortal]]''.

* The ''[[Discworld]]'' novel ''[[Feet of Clay]]'' by [[Terry Pratchett]] satirizes many of the cliches of the golem genre. Another Discworld novel, ''[[Going Postal]]'' sees golems trained as postmen, and compares them to the robots of [[Isaac Asimov]]. The oldest of these golems carries clay tablets on his arm and in his head, alluding to Jewish mythology. 

* The television program ''[[The X-Files]]'' aired an episode &quot;[[Kaddish]]&quot;, in which a young [[Hasidic]] woman creates a Golem who avenges her husband's murder by [[neo-nazi]]s.

* In the [[anime]] series ''[[RahXephon]]'', the main weapons are called &quot;Dolems&quot;. Like golems, they are made from clay and may be difficult to control. The D in &quot;Dolem&quot; is a pun on &quot;[[solfege|Do-Re-Mi]]&quot;.

* The [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] [[Ragman]] was created using the same formula required to make a golem, though it substituted rags instead of clay and required a human host to function. Another DC hero, the [[Monolith (comics)|Monolith]], is a golem.

* A golem which is eventually destroyed by changing the word 'emet' on its forehead to 'met' is used in both an early issue of the ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' and ''[[The Invaders]]'' [[comic books]].

* In the [[Bartimaeus Trilogy]] book ''[[The Golem's Eye]]'' by [[Jonathan Stroud]] a golem is loose in London.

* In [[2005]], the story of the Golem was returned to its Jewish roots, as a new [[comic strip]] in [[Israel|Israeli]] newspaper [[Yedioth Ahronoth]] depicted the Golem as a government-funded [[superhero]] protecting Israel from its domestic and existential difficulties.

* In the ''[[Dreamhunter Duet]]'' by [[Elizabeth Knox]] a young dreamhunter replaces her missing father with a golem.

* In the novel [[Iron Council]] by [[China Mieville]] a [[Thaumaturge]] named Judah Low learns how to create powerful golems from almost any material. These are used to assist a group of rebels

* In an episode of the animated television series [[Batman Beyond]], the young Batman fights a human controlled robot with the acronym G.L.M.

===Golems in modern games===
Golems also appear as a popular feature of the [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] [[role-playing game| role-playing games]] (including a playable race in the [[Ebberon]] supplement called Warforged) and are almost ubiquitous in the many fantasy computer and card games inspired by it, such as [[NetHack]], the [[Final Fantasy]] series, the [[Ogre Battle]] series, and [[Magic: The Gathering]]. In these games the word is generally used as an [[umbrella term]] to refer to [[automata]] and [[simulacra]] from many mythologies. The convention is that they are named after the material of construction. Examples include Clay golems (most like the original Jewish golem), Flesh golems (stiched-together abominations reminiscent of [[Frankenstein]]'s creature), Iron golems (animated metal statues), and a host of others including gold golems, stone golems and paper golems.

The second [[Fullmetal Alchemist]] game, ''Curse of the Crimson Elixir'', features golems as enemies.  They have magic symbols on their bodies that keep them alive.  They were created by an ancient [[alchemy]]-using civilization for use as slaves. These golems have several extra abilities such as the ability to diguise themselves as humans.

The &quot;[[mon (monster)|mon]]&quot; genre of [[video games]] often include a monster named &quot;golem&quot; or having golem-like qualities, usually animated rock or earth in a vaguely [[anthropomorphic]] shape, such as [[Golem (Pokémon)|Golem]], [[Regirock]], [[Regice]] and [[Registeel]] from ''[[Pokémon]]'', [[Golemon]] from ''[[Digimon]]'' and the breed called Golem in [[Monster Rancher]].

==The Golem in the Czech Republic==
The Golem is a popular figure in the [[Czech Republic]]. There are several restaurants and other businesses named after him. [[Strongman (strength athlete)|Strongman]] René Richter goes by the nickname &quot;Golem,&quot; and a Czech [[monster truck]] outfit calls itself the &quot;Golem Team.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:GeorgeOrwell.jpg|thumb|200px|George Orwell on [[Time Magazine]] cover from [[1983]].]]

'''Eric Arthur Blair''' ([[June 25]], [[1903]]&amp;ndash;[[January 21]], [[1950]]), much better known by the [[pen name]] '''George Orwell''', was a [[British literature|British author]] and [[journalist]]. Noted as a political and cultural commentator, as well as an accomplished novelist, Orwell is among the most widely-admired [[English-language]] [[essayist]]s of the [[20th century]]. He is best known for two [[novel]]s written towards the middle and end of his life:  ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.

==Early life==
Eric Blair was born on [[June 25]], [[1903]] in [[Motihari]], [[Bihar]], in [[India]], during the period when India was part of the [[British Empire]] under the [[British Raj]]. There Blair's father, Richard Walmesley Blair, worked for the [[opium]] department of the [[British Civil Service|Civil Service]]. His mother, Ida Mabel Blair, brought him to the [[United Kingdom]] at the age of one. He did not see his father again until [[1907]], when Richard visited England for three months before leaving again. Eric had an older sister named Marjorie, and a younger sister named Avril. He would later describe his family's background as &quot;lower-upper-middle class.&quot;

==Education==
At the age of six, Blair was sent to a small [[Anglican]] parish school in [[Henley-on-Thames]], which his sister had attended before him. He never wrote of his recollections of it, but he must have impressed the teachers very favourably, for two years later he was recommended to the headmaster of one of the most successful preparatory schools in England at the time: [[St Cyprian's School]], in [[Eastbourne]], [[Sussex]]. Blair attended St Cyprian's on a scholarship that allowed his parents to pay only half of the usual fees. Many years later, he would recall his time at St Cyprian's with biting resentment in the essay &quot;[[Such, Such Were the Joys]]&quot;, describing the stifling limits placed on his development by the Warden. &quot;They [the officials] were my benefactors&quot;, writes Orwell, &quot;sacrificing financial gain in order that the cleverest might bring academic accolades to the school&quot;. &quot;Our brains were a gold-mine in which he [the Warden] had sunk money, and the dividends must be squeezed out of us&quot;. However, in his time at St Cyprians, the young Blair successfully earned scholarships to both [[Wellington College (Berkshire)|Wellington College]] and [[Eton College]].

After some time at [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington]], Blair moved to Eton, where he was a [[King's Scholar]] from [[1917]] to [[1921]]. Later in life he wrote that he had been &quot;relatively happy&quot; at Eton, which allowed its students considerable independence, but also that he ceased doing serious work after arriving there. Reports of his academic performance at Eton vary; some assert that he was a poor student, while others claim the contrary. He was clearly disliked by some of his teachers, who resented what they perceived as disrespect for their authority. During his time at the school, Blair made lifetime friendships with a number of future British intellectuals such as [[Cyril Connolly]], the future editor of the ''Horizon'' magazine, in which many of Orwell's most famous essays were originally published.

==Burma and the early novels==
After Blair finished his studies at Eton, his family could not pay for university and he had no prospect of a scholarship. So in [[1922]] he joine]]

==Area==
:* Total: [[1 E11 m²|357,021]] [[square kilometre|km²]]
:* Land: 349,223 km²
:* Water: 7,798 km²
==[[Climate]]==
Temperate and marine; cool, cloudy, wet winters and summers; occasional warm [[föhn wind]]. The greater part of Germany lies in the cool/temperate climatic zone in which humid westerly winds predominate. In the north-west and the north the climate is extremely oceanic and rain falls all the year round. Winters there are relatively mild and summers comparatively cool. In the east the climate shows clear continental features; winters can be very cold for long periods, and summers can become very warm. Here too, long dry periods are often recorded. In the centre and the south there is a transitional climate which may be predominantly oceanic or continental, according to the general weather situation.

The extreme points of medieval Germany are mentioned in the first stanza of ''[[Das Lied der Deutschen]]'', of which the third stanza is today the national anthem of Germany. They were in part no longer accurate when the song was penned, because [[Austria]] and [[Flanders]] had different affiliations by then. The limits mentioned are the [[river|rivers]] [[Meuse|Meuse/Maas]] which crosses [[France]], [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], the [[Neman River]], which runs through [[Belarus]] and [[Lithuania]] but previously formed part of the border of East Prussia, the [[Adige]] in German-speaking [[South Tyrol]] which was transferred from the [[Habsburg]] Empire to [[Italy]] after [[World War I]], and the [[Little Belt|Belt]] which is a part of the Baltic Sea between Germany and [[Denmark]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Deutschland topo.png|thumb|right|300px]]
The population of [[Germany]], currently numbering over 80 million, is primarily of German nationality. There are about 7 million foreign residents, the largest single nationality group of whom are the Turkish. Germany has been a prime destination for refugees from many developing countries, in part because its constitution long had a clause giving a 'right' to [[refugee|political asylum]], but restrictions over the years have made it less attractive. 

Germany has one of the world's highest levels of education, technological development, and economic productivity. Since the end of [[World War II]], the number of youths entering universities has more than tripled, and the trade and technical schools are among the world's best. With a per capita income level of about $27,000, Germany is a broadly middle class society. Germans also are mobile; millions travel abroad each year. A generous social welfare system provides for [[universal health care]], [[unemployment compensation]], and other social needs. Due to Germany's aging population and struggling economy,  the welfare system came under a lot of strain from the 1990s. This lead the government to push through a wide-ranging programme of belt-tightening reforms, [[Agenda 2010]], including the labour market reforms known as [[Hartz concept|Hartz I - IV]]. 

Population: 82,468,000 ([[2005]], 1st quarter avg.)

The official statistics collect only nationality data: [[Germans]] 91.5%, [[Turkish people|Turks]] 2.4%, other 6.1% (made up largely of [[Serbs]], [[Croats]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Italians]], [[Russians]], [[Greeks]], and [[Poles]]).

While most of the German citizens are ethnic Germans or naturalized immigrants, there are four other sizable groups of people that have lived in Germany for centuries. They are referred to as &quot;national minorities&quot; (''nationale Minderheiten''): [[Danes]], [[Frisians]], [[Roma and Sinti]], and [[Sorbs]].

There is a [[Denmark|Danish]] minority (about 50,000, according to government sources) in the most northern-most state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. 

Eastern and Northern [[Frisians]] (60,000 inhabitants define themselves as &quot;Frisians&quot;) live at Schleswig-Holstein's western coast, and in the north-western part of [[Lower Saxony]]. They are part of a wider community ([[Frisia]]) stretching from Germany to the northern [[Netherlands]].

The [[Sorbs]], a [[Slavic people]] with about 60,000 members, are located in the [[Lusatia]] region of [[Saxony]] and [[Brandenburg]]. They are the last remnants of the Slavs that lived in central and eastern Germany since the [[7th century]].

[[Roma people]] have been in Germany since the [[Middle Ages]]. They were persecuted by the [[Nazis]], and thousands of Roma living in Germany were killed by the Nazi regime. Nowadays, they are spread all over Germany, mostly living in major cities. It is difficult to estimate their exact number, as the Germany government normally does not keep information on the ethnicity of its citizens. There are also many assimilated Sinti and Roma. A vague figure given by the German Department of the Interior is about 70,000. In the [[1990s]], many Roma moved to Germany from former [[Yugoslavia]]. In contrast to the old-established Roma population, the majority of them do not have German citizenship, they are classified as [[immigrants]] or [[refugee]]s.

Since the [[1960]]s, ethnic Germans from the [[Soviet Union]] came to Germany, especially from [[Kazakhstan]], [[Russia]], and [[Ukraine]].
During the time of [[Perestroika]], and after the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]], the number of immigrants increased heavily.

Germany now has Europe's third-largest [[Jews|Jewish]] population. In [[2004]], twice as many Jews from former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] republics settled in Germany as in [[Israel]], bringing the total inflow to more than 200,000 since [[1991]]. Jews have a voice in German public life through the [[Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland]].

There are also around 500,000 &quot;[[Afro-Germans]]&quot;.

== East-West Migration ==

[[Image:Mk Bevölkerung Bundesländer.png|left|200px]]
With unification on [[October 3]], [[1990]], Germany began the major task of bringing the standard of living of Germans in the former [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR) up to that of western Germany. This will be a lengthy and difficult process due to the relative inefficiency of industrial enterprises in the former GDR, difficulties in resolving property ownership in eastern Germany, and the inadequate infrastructure and environmental damage that resulted from decades of communist rule. Since reunification, hundreds of thousands of former East Germans have migrated into western Germany to find work. 

Drastic changes in the socioeconomic landscape brought about by reunification have resulted in troubling social problems. Economic uncertainty in eastern Germany is often cited as one factor contributing to extremist violence, primarily from the political right. Confusion about the causes of the current hardships and a need to place blame have found expression in harassment and violence by some Germans directed toward foreigners, particularly non-Europeans. The vast majority of Germans condemn such violence.


== Immigration ==
[[Image:Mk Zuwanderer.png|right|200px]]
''see main article'' [[Immigration to Germany]]

Due to its high standard of living Germany is attracting vast groups of people from all over the world and is a classical immigration country. Because of Germanys aging population the country depends on immigration is however restructuring it with a directed immigration law.

== Religions ==

Roman Catholic 32.1%, Lutheran 31.8%,  Muslim 4.5%, Jewish 0.1%, unaffiliated or other 31.5% (2002)

Roman Catholic is mainly in the South East (Southern [[Bavaria]]) and the Very West ([[Rheinland]] &amp; [[Cologne]]). Strongholds of Protestants are in all Northern and Eastern Federal States. Muslim and Jews minority communities are mainly in the big cities.

== Languages ==
[[German language|German]] is Germany's only official and most-widely spoken language. [[Standard German]] is understood all over the country, while [[dialect]]s &amp;mdash; which can be quite distinct from the standard language &amp;mdash; are still in use in everyday speech, especially in rural regions. In contrast to [[France]] speakers with regional dialects and accents are generally not frowned on or interpreted as uneducated.

[[English language|English]] is the most popular foreign language.
In secondary education (in some regions even earlier), it is taught as the first foreign language almost everywhere. Other languages taught at schools are [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Russian language|Russian]]. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is taught in [[counties]] bordering the [[Netherlands]]. [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] are part of the syllabus of [[classical education]] which is offered by some secondary schools.

According to a [[2004]] survey, two thirds of Germany's citizens have at least basic knowledge of English. About 20% consider themselves as speakers of French, followed by those of Russian (18%), Italian (6.1%), and Spanish (5.6%). The high number of Russian speakers is a result of the [[GDR]]'s close relation to the Soviet Union &amp;mdash; more than half of the Germans in the East speak Russian, compared to 5.5% in the western part of the country (a big part of them is also originaly from the East).

[[Danish language|Danish]], [[Low German]], [[Sorbian]], and [[Frisian]] are officially recognized and protected as minority languages per the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] in their respective regions.
As speakers of [[Romany]] are living in all parts of Germany, the federal government has promised to take action to protect the language. Until now, [[Hesse]] is the only ''Land'' that has followed Berlin's announcement and implemented concrete measures to support speakers of Romany.

[[Image:Berlin-brandenburg-gate.jpg|thumb|300px|Since reunification, Germany faces low growth rates]]

'''[[Germany]]''' is one of the world's highest developed market '''[[Economics|economies]]'''. It is the world's third largest economy in [[United States dollar|USD]] [[exchange rate|exchange-rate]] terms, the fifth largest by [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP) and the largest economy in [[Europe]]. 

Recent performance has not been dynamic, however, and the German economy is marked by vulnerability to external shocks, domestic structural problems, and continued difficulties in fueling formerly [[Communism|communist]] [[East Germany]]. 

Germans describe their economic system as a &quot;[[social market economy]]&quot;. An extensive array of [[Social security|social services]] is provided. Although the state intervenes in the economy through the provision of [[subsidies]] to selected sectors and the ownership of some segments of the economy, competition and [[free enterprise]] are promoted as a matter of government policy.

== History ==

From the [[1948]] [[currency]] reform until the early [[1970]]s, West Germany experienced almost continuous economic expansion (''see also'': [[Wirtschaftswunder]]), but real [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth slowed and even declined from the mid-1970s through the [[recession]] of the early [[1980]]s. The economy then experienced eight consecutive years of growth that ended with a downturn beginning in late [[1992]]. Since [[German reunification|reunification]] in [[1990]], Germany has seen annual average real growth of only about 1.5% and stubbornly high [[unemployment]]. The best performance since reunification was registered in [[2000]], when real growth reached 3.0%. In [[2003]], Germany experienced a negative GDP growth about -0.1%. Estimated growth rate in [[2006]]: +2.0%.

== General view ==

The heart of the German economy is the [[industry sector]] (28.6% of GDP), though its share in GDP and the number of employees continue to decline. Since the late 1970s, most of the people work in the steadily growing [[service sector]] (70.3% of GDP), agriculture is of small importance (1.1% of GDP).

The German economy is heavily export-oriented, with exports accounting for more than one-third of [[national output]] (since spring 2003, Germany exports in absolute figures more goods than every other country). As a result, exports traditionally have been a key element in German macroeconomic expansion. Germany is a strong advocate of closer European economic integration, and its economic and commercial policies are increasingly determined by agreements among [[European Union]] (EU) members. Germany uses the common European currency, the [[Euro]], and its [[Monetary policy of central banks|monetary policy]] is set by the [[European Central Bank]].

Despite this external vulnerability, most foreign and German experts consider domestic structural problems to be mainly responsible for recent sluggish performance. They note that

*an inflexible [[labour market]] is a main cause of persistently high unemployment 
*the same is true for high non-wage labour costs
*heavy bureaucratic [[regulation]]s burden many businesses and the process of starting new businesses

Nevertheless, the export oriented economy is doing well (exports grew 50% during the last 5 years), the main problem is a weak home market, in part due to a low consumer confidence. Therefore, some experts believe that Germany's current trouble doesn't result from domestic structural problems, but from stagnating wages over more than a decade. Germany finances its reunification to a large extent by social insurance contributions, forcing up non-wage labour costs. To conserve the competitiveness of German workers, the unions abandon high wage claims since the mid-1990s.

More than ten years after the unification of the two German states, great progress has been made in raising the standard of living in eastern Germany, introducing a market economy and improving infrastructure there. At the same time, the process of convergence between East and West is taking longer than originally expected and, on some measures, has stagnated since the mid-1990s. Eastern economic growth rates have been slower than in the West in recent years, unemployment is twice as high, prompting many skilled easterners to seek work in the West, and productivity continues to lag. Eastern consumption levels are dependent on public net financial transfers from West to East totalling about $65 [[billion]] per year, or over 4% of the GDP of western Germany. The German news magazine &quot;[[Der Spiegel]]&quot; estimates the total reunification costs between 1990 and 2003 at €1.25 [[trillion]]. In addition to social assistance payments, the government plans to extend funds to promote eastern economic development through [[2019]].

== Industries ==

== Media &amp; Advertising ==

The German TV market is divided into two parts: Two publicly-funded television stations, [[ARD]] and [[ZDF]], and some private television stations, mainly [[RTL Television|RTL]] (owned by [[Bertelsmann]]), [[Sat.1]] and [[Pro7]].

[[Bild]] is Europe's best-selling newspaper, dominating the German [[tabloid]] market. The most important subscription newspapers are [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] and [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]], important news magazines are [[Der Spiegel]] and [[Der Stern]].

The German advertising industry grew in 2005 by about 5%, after several years of stagnation. The outlook on 2006 is good, not least because of [[FIFA World Cup]] 2006, that is hosted by Germany.

== Trade ==

The [[United States]] is Germany's second-largest trading partner, and U.S.-German trade has continued to grow strongly. Two-way trade in goods and services totalled $88 billion in 2000. U.S. exports to Germany were $29.2 billion while U.S. imports from Germany were twice as high, $58.7 billion. At $29.5 billion, the U.S. [[trade deficit]] with Germany is the United States' fourth-largest, after the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Japan]], and [[Canada]]. Major U.S. export categories include [[aircraft]], electrical equipment, telecommunications equipment, data processing equipment, and motor vehicles and parts. German export sales are concentrated in motor vehicles, machinery, chemicals, and heavy electrical equipment. Much bilateral trade is intra-industry or intra-firm.

== Investments ==

Germany follows a [[liberalism|liberal]] policy toward foreign investment. From [[1995]] to [[1999]], annual average flows of U.S. direct investment in Germany were $3.4 billion, while those of German investors in the United States reached $21 billion. Americans accounted for 18% of all foreign direct investment in Germany during 1998-99, the third-largest source after [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. In terms of cumulative position (historical cost basis), German investment in the United States was valued at $111 billion in 1999, having more than doubled since 1995, while U.S. investment in Germany was worth just under $50 billion, having grown just 12% since 1995.

Despite persistence of structural rigidities in the labour market and extensive government regulation, the economy remains strong and internationally competitive, not least because of its highly skilled work force. Although production costs are high, Germany is still an export powerhouse. Additionally, Germany is strategically placed to take advantage of the rapidly growing central European countries. The current government has addressed some of the country's structural problems, with important tax, [[social security]], and financial-sector reforms. In the future, Germany faces further fundamental (and perhaps even more sweeping) economic adjustments to boost growth and job creation.

At the start of 2005, the seasonally adjusted number of registered unemployed persons initially showed another sharp increase. The considerable rise in the unemployment figures is largely due to the fact that former recipients of income support who now receive the new class-II unemployment benefit are registered as unemployed. This means that people who used to be numbered among the latent manpower reserve are now shown as registered unemployed persons. In particular, the labour-market statistics now include more unemployed young, older and low-skilled people. The unemployment rate peaked at [http://www.forbes.com/business/2005/03/08/cz_0308oxan_germany.html 12.6%] in March [[2005]], although it has gradually declined since then. Also, There are considerable regional differences in unemployment rates within Germany. The unemployment rate in eastern Germany, at 20.7%, is almost twice as high as the western figure of 10.4%, ''see'': [http://www.europa.eu.int/eures/main.jsp?catId=2641&amp;acro=lmi&amp;lang=en&amp;countryId=DE&amp;regionId=DE-NAT.com  Job mobility portal of the European Union].

[[Deutsche Bahn]] (DB) is the major German railway company. Though Deutsche Bahn is a private company, the government still holds all shares and therefore Deutsche Bahn can still be called a state-owned company.

Since its privatisation in 1994, Deutsche Bahn AG (DB AG) no longer publishes details of the tracks it owns; in addition to the DB AG system there are about 280 privately or locally owned railway companies which own an approximate 3,000 km to 4,000 km of the total tracks and use DB tracks in ''open access''.

There are significant differences between the financing of long-distance and short-distance (or local) trains in Germany. While long-distance trains can be run by any railway company, the companies also receive no subsidies from the government; instead, the long-distance trains must be self-supporting.  Local trains however are subsidized by the German states ''(Länder)'' which pay the operating companies to running these trains. This resulted in many private companies offering to run local train services as they can provide cheaper service than the state-owned Deutsche Bahn. Long-distance trains on the other side are primarily operated by Deutsche Bahn as the initial investment in rolling stock is a lot higher and not subsidized by the state.

'''G''' is the seventh letter in the [[Roman alphabet]]. Its name in [[English language|English]] is ''gee'' ([[IPA]] [ʤi:]). 

==History==
The letter '''G''' was created by the Romans because they felt that [[C]] was not an adequate letter to represent both /k/ ''and'' /g/. 
{| align=&quot;center&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10&quot;

|[[Image:Capital_C.svg|Late Latin|75px]]&lt;br /&gt;Late Latin&lt;br /&gt;
|}
The recorded inventor of the letter G is [[Spurius Carvilius Ruga]], who taught around 230 BC: 

:The first derived letter of the Latin alphabet can be dated to the 3rd century BCE. Latin phonology was different again from Etruscan; while Q was used for the labiovelar /k&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;/, C continued to represent /k/ before /e/ and /i/ as well as in other environments (K had become unpopular and fallen out of general use in favour of C). Latin had a voiced velar /ɡ/, however, which also had to be represented by C. The first Roman to open a fee-paying school, a freedman named Spurius Carvilius Ruga, amended the Latin script by replacing the seventh letter, Z, which represented the unneeded Greek sound /dz/, with a new letter, LATIN LETTER C WITH STROKE, which we have come to know as G. [...] Note that Ruga’s positioning of G shows that alphabetic order was a concern even in the 3rd century BCE. Sampson (1985) suggested that: “Evidently the order of the alphabet was felt to be such a concrete thing that a new letter could be added in the middle only if a ‘space’ was created by the dropping of an old letter.” LATIN LETTER G is a derived letter which has become a basic letter of the Latin alphabet.[http://www.evertype.com/standards/wynnyogh/thorn.html]

As the sound /k/ [[did]], /g/ also developed [[palatal consonant|palatal]] and [[velar consonant|velar]] [[allophone]]s which is why today, G has different sound values in all Romance languages, as well as  [[English language|English]] (due to [[French language|French]] influence).

The modern [[minuscule]] (lower-case) G has two basic shapes: the &quot;opentail G&quot; [[Image:Opentail g.PNG|10px]] and the &quot;looptail G&quot; [[Image:Looptail g.PNG|10px]]. The opentail version derives from the majuscule (capital) form by raising the [[serif]] that distinguishes it from a C to the top of the loop, thereby closing the loop, and extending the vertical stroke downward and to the left. The looptail form developed similarly, except that some ornate forms then extended the tail back to the right, and to the left again, forming a loop. The initial extension to the left was absorbed into the upper loop. The looptail version became popular when printing switched to &quot;Roman type&quot; because the tail was effectively shorter, making it possible to put more lines on a page. And in the looptail version, there is a tiny flick at the upper right which in typography is called its &quot;ear.&quot;

Generally, the two minuscule forms are interchangeable, but occasionally the difference has been exploited to make a contrast. The 1949 ''Principles of the [[International Phonetic Association]]'' recommends using [[Image:Opentail g.PNG|10px]] for advanced [[voiced velar plosive]]s and [[Image:Looptail g.PNG|10px]] for regular ones where the two are contrasted, but this suggestion was never accepted by [[phonetics|phoneticians]] in general, and today [[Image:Opentail g.PNG|10px]] is the symbol used in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], with [[Image:Looptail g.PNG|10px]] acknowledged as an acceptable variant.

==Usage==
In English, the letter can be pronounced as a &quot;soft G&quot; ([[IPA chart for English|IPA]] {{IPA|/d[[Voiced postalveolar fricative|ʒ]]/}}), as in: ''[[giant (disambiguation)|giant]]'', ''[[ginger]]'', ''[[geology]]'', or as a &quot;hard G&quot; (IPA {{IPA|/g/}}), as in: ''goose'', ''gargoyle'', ''game''. In some words of French origin, as in [[French language|French]] generally, the &quot;soft G&quot; is pronounced as IPA {{IPA|/ʒ/}}, as in ''rouge'', ''beige'', and ''genre''. Generally, G is soft before E, I, and Y, and hard otherwise, but there are many English words of non-Romance origin where G is hard regardless of position, and three (''gaol,'' ''margarine,'' and the name ''[[Sacagawea]]'') in which it is soft even before an A.

Most non-Romance languages pronounce G as {{IPA|/g/}} regardless of position (however the [[Dutch language]] does not have a /g/ sound in its native words, and instead G is pronounced {{IPA|/[[Voiced velar fricative|ɣ]]/}}, a sound that does not occur in English) while in Romance languages the soft value varies, such as {{IPA|/ʒ/}} in French, Catalan, and Portuguese, {{IPA|/ʤ/}} in Italian, and {{IPA|/x/}} in Castillian Spanish and {{IPA |/h/}} in other dialects of Spanish. The general rule is that soft G is pronounced the same as the J of the same language.

Several [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s are common in English. GH originally represented the letter [[yogh]] which English adopted from [[Old Irish]], and took various values including {{IPA|/g/}}, {{IPA|/ɣ/}}, {{IPA|/x/}}, and {{IPA|/j/}}. It now has a great variety of values, including {{IPA|/f/}} in ''enough'', {{IPA|/g/}} in loan words like ''spaghetti'', and silence in words like ''eight'' and ''night''. GN, with value {{IPA|/n/}}, is also common, as in ''sign''.

In Italian, GH is used to force a {{IPA|/g/}} value before E and I where G would take a soft value, and GN is used for {{IPA|/[[Palatal nasal|ɲ]]/}} (rather like English NY in ''canyon'').

In Spanish, G before I or E is pronounced as the same as J. The Spanish poet [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]] proposed to simplify the Spanish spelling by using just the versions with [[j]]. The rest of Spanish speakers did not follow him, but his works, and the translations of [[Rabindranath Tagore]] made by Jiménez's wife [[Zenobia Camprubí]], are published in his spelling.

{{Table_Greekletters|letter=gamma}}
'''Gamma''' (upper case &amp;Gamma;, lower case &amp;gamma;) is the third letter of the [[Greek alphabet]].   It derives from the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] [[Gimel (letter)|Gimel]] [[Image:phoenician_gimel.png|20px|Gimel]]. In [[Greek language|Modern Greek]], it is pronounced [[voiced velar fricative|{{IPA|[ɣ]}}]] or [[Voiced palatal fricative|{{IPA|[&amp;#669;]}}]], and in [[Ancient Greek]], it was pronounced [[voiced velar plosive|{{IPA|[ɡ]}}]] or [[velar nasal|{{IPA|ŋ}}]] before plosives. In the system of [[Greek numerals]] it has a value of 3.

Letters that arose from Gamma are the Roman [[C]] and [[G]] and the Cyrillic letters [[Ge (Cyrillic)|Ge]] Г and [[Ghe (Cyrillic)|Ghe]] Ґ.

== Use in science == 
Gamma is often used to denote a variable in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]].
In certain areas it has specific meaning. 

* '''[[Gamma correction]]''' in [[photography]], [[television]] and [[computer display]] systems. '''''Gamma''''' is the [[exponent]] in a power-law relationship between [[video]] or [[pixel]] values and the displayed brightness. In photography it is the slope of the curve of (density or log(opacity)) of the film image versus log(exposure) (the [[sensitometry|Hurter-Driffield curve]]), in the straight line region. 
* 1 gamma is a unit of [[magnetic flux density]], 1 gamma = 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;9&lt;/sup&gt; [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] or 1 [[nanotesla]].
* [[Gamma wave]]s are a type of [[electroencephalography|brain waves]] around 40 [[hertz]].

=== Upper-case ===
The upper-case letter &amp;Gamma; is used as the symbol for:
* The [[gamma function]] (related to factorials) in mathematics.
* The [[Gamma distribution]] in probability theory and statistics.
* The [[Christoffel symbol]] in [[General Relativity]].
* The [[reflection coefficient]] in [[electrical engineering]].
* The [[linewidth]] relating to uncertainty of mass energy in short-lived particles.
* The symbol on the hat of Nintendo character [[Waluigi]].

=== Lower-case ===
The lower-case letter &amp;gamma; is used as the symbol for:
* The [[Euler-Mascheroni constant]] in mathematics.
* A risk management measure in [[mathematical finance]].
* The [[photon]], seen as an elementary particle in physics.
* [[Gamma ray]]s in physics and astronomy.
* The [[Lorentz factor|gamma factor]] in relativity theory and astronomy.
* The [[adiabatic index]] of a gas in physics. Often the letter kappa &amp;kappa; is used.
* The [[propagation constant]] of an electromagnetic wave (in [[electrical engineering]] and [[electromagnetic theory]]).
* The third brightest (usually) star in a [[constellation]].  ''See'' [[Bayer designation]].

== Fictional names ==
* In the game of [[Tetris]], '''''gamma''''' is another name for the J [[tetromino]].
* [[E-102 Gamma]] is a fictional robotic character in the Sonic the Hedgehog universe.
* Gamma is a giant peace-keeping robot stolen by [[Dr. Wily]] which is the final boss of [[Capcom]]'s [[Nintendo]] game [[Megaman]] 3.
*Gamma is the third caste in Aldous Huxley's dystopic satire [[Brave New World]].

== Trivia ==
* [[Tropical Storm Gamma]] is the third Atlantic tropical storm to be named using the Greek alphabet.

      <comment>[[:en:Wikipedia:Tools/Navigation_popups|Popups]]-assisted redirection bypass from [[Varanger glaciation]] to [[Cryogenian]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''glaciation''' (a created composite term meaning '''Glacial Period''', referring to the ''Period or Era of'', as well as the process of ''High Glacial Activity''), often called an ''[[ice age]]'', is a [[geology|geological]] phenomenon in which massive [[ice]] sheets form in the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] and advance toward the [[equator]]. Conversely, the term ''interglacial'' or ''Interglacial Period'', such as the current era, is used to denote the absence of large-scale glaciation on a global scale &amp;mdash; i.e., a ''non-Ice Age''.  Interglacials are, in general, shorter than glacial epochs.

Glaciations are characterized by cool, wet climates and thick ice sheets extending from each pole. [[Mountain]] or alpine [[glacier]]s in otherwise unglaciated areas expand and extend to lower elevations even in the lowest of [[latitude]]s.  Sea levels drop due to the presence of large volumes of water above sea level in the icecaps.  There is evidence that ocean circulation patterns are disrupted by glaciations. Since the earth has significant continental glaciation in the Arctic and Antarctic, we currently are in a glacial minimum of a glaciation. Such a period between glacial maxima is known as an &quot;interglacial&quot;. The current one is the [[Flandrian]].

In general, the [[Earth]] seems to have been ice-free even in high latitudes except during relatively rare glacial maximums such as the one from which we emerged 10 to 15 thousand years ago.

The causes of glaciations have been much debated ever since the phenomenon was clearly identified in the [[17th century]].  Modern theories tend to revolve around periodic oscillations in the Earth's [[Planetary orbit|orbit]], hypothesized periodic changes in solar output, and/or the effects of continental masses drifting into polar regions where Antarctica currently resides.

Known periods of glaciation include the [[Huronian]] (2400 Ma - 2100 Ma), [[Cryogenian|Sturtian-Varangian]] (950 Ma - 570 Ma), [[Andean-Saharan]] (450 Ma - 420 Ma), [[Karoo]] (360 Ma - 260 Ma), [[Cenozoic]] (30 Ma - Present).  These can be further divided by location and time (e.g.: the names Riss (180,000 - 130,000 years bp) and Würm (70,000 - 10,000 years bp) refer specifically to glaciation at the headwaters of the Donau/Rhine rivers.) Not every year in each interval was a time of complete or even partial glaciation.  The best-studied glaciation, that of the recent past, appears to have taken place in at least four separate ice incursions and retreats.  Unfortunately, the scouring action of each glaciation tends to remove most of the evidence of prior ice sheets almost completely, except in regions where the later sheet doesn't achieve full coverage.  It is probable that glacial periods other than those above have been overlooked because of the paucity of exposed rocks from high latitudes from older periods.   The [[Cryogenian|Varanger glaciation]] was especially severe and may have extended to the [[Equator]].  This has led to a recent &quot;[[Snowball Earth]]&quot; hypothesis - that the Earth froze over completely in the late [[Proterozoic]], then thawed very rapidly as trapped [[water]] and [[carbon dioxide]] were returned to [[Earth's atmosphere]]. An alternative hypothesis, sometimes called [[Slushball Earth]], maintains that the Equator at least was ice-free.

-----

The term ''[[ice age]]'' is used to refer either to a single glaciation or to an entire period of repeated glaciations such as the recent 30 million years of the [[Cenozoic]] period, especially the Pleistocene glaciations.

A '''goitre''' (or '''goiter''') ([[Latin]] ''struma'') is a swelling in the neck (just below adam's apple or [[larynx]]) due to an enlarged [[thyroid|thyroid gland]]. They are classified in different ways: 

* A &quot;diffuse goitre&quot; is a goitre that has spread through all of the thyroid (and is contrasted with a &quot;simple goitre&quot;, &quot;single thyroid nodule&quot; and &quot;multinodular goitre&quot;.

* &quot;Toxic goitre&quot; refers to goitre deriving from [[inflammation]], [[neoplasm]], or malfunction of the  [[thyroid]], while &quot;nontoxic goitre&quot; refers to all other types (such as that caused by [[lithium]] or an [[autoimmune]] reaction.)

==Causes==
The most common cause for goitre in the world is [[iodine]] deficiency (E01). Other causes are:
* [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] (E06.3)
* [[Graves-Basedow disease]] (E05.0)
* [[juvenile goitre]] due to [[congenital hypothyroidism]] (E03.0)
* [[neoplasm]] of the thyroid 
* [[thyroiditis]] (acute, chronic) (E06)
* [[Adverse drug reaction|side-effects]] of [[pharmacological therapy]] (E03.2)

==Occurrence==
Iodine is necessary for the synthesis of the thyroid [[hormone]]s, [[triiodothyronine]] and [[thyroxine]] (T3 and T4). When iodine is not available, these hormones cannot be made. In response to low thyroid hormones, the [[pituitary gland]] releases [[thyroid stimulating hormone]] (TSH). Thyroid stimulating hormone acts to try and increase synthesis of T3 and T4, but it also causes the thyroid gland to grow in size as a type of compensation.

Goitre is more common among women. Treatmentn>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Glagolithic tablet.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Tablet inscribed with the Glagolitic alphabet]]
The '''Glagolitic alphabet''' or '''Glagolitsa''' is the oldest known [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[alphabet]]. It was created by [[Saint Cyril]] in [[855]] or around [[862]]-[[863]] in order to translate the [[Bible]] and other texts into the [[Slavic languages]].

The name comes from the [[Old Slavonic]] ''glagolə'', which means ''word'' (and is also the origin of the name for the letter &quot;G&quot;). Since ''glagolati'' also means ''to speak'', the Glagolitsa is poetically referred to as &quot;the marks that speak&quot;.

The original Glagolitic alphabet has 41 letters, but the number varies slightly in later versions.  Twenty-four of the 41 original Glagolitic letters (see Great Moravian below) are probably derived from graphemes of the [[medieval]] cursive [[Greek alphabet|Greek small alphabet]], but have been given an ornamental design. It is presumed that the letters ''sha'', ''shta'' and ''tsi'' were derived from the [[Hebrew alphabet]] (the letters [[Shin (letter)|Shin]] and [[Tsadi]]) - the [[phoneme]]s that these letters represent did not exist in Greek but do exist in Hebrew and are quite common in all Slavic languages. The remaining original characters are of unknown origin. Some of them are presumed to stem from the Hebrew and [[Samaritan]] scripts, which Cyril got to know during his journey to the [[Khazars]] in [[Cherson]].

Another theory (see [[Chernorizetz Hrabar]]) asserts that the Glagolitic alphabet was based on ancient Slavic [[Runic alphabet|rune]]s (''chərti i rezki'', i.e., lines and notches), which like the [[Germanic rune]]s were only used in sacred texts of the pre-Christian [[Slavic religion]].

== History ==
{{alphabet}}
[[Rastislav]], the Knyaz (Prince) of [[Great Moravia]], wanted to weaken the dependence of his [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] empire on East [[Frankish]] priests, so in [[862]] he had the [[Byzantine emperor]] send two missionaries, [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], to Great Moravia. Cyril created a new alphabet for that purpose - the Glagolitic. The alphabet was then used in [[Great Moravia]] between [[863]] (when Cyril and Methodius arrived there) and [[885]] for government and religious documents and books, and at the Great Moravian Academy (Ve&amp;#318;komoravské u&amp;#269;ili&amp;#353;te) founded by Cyril, where followers of Cyril and Methodius were educated (also by Methodius himself).

In [[886]], an East Frankish bishop of [[Nitra]] named [[Wiching]] banned the script and jailed 200 followers of Methodius (mostly of the students of the original academy).  They were then dispersed or, according to some sources, sold as slaves. Three of them, however, reached Bulgaria and were commissioned by [[Boris I of Bulgaria]] to teach and instruct the future clergy of the state into the [[Slavic language]]s. After the adoption of Christianity in [[Bulgaria]] in [[865]], religious ceremonies were conducted in [[Greek language|Greek]] by clergy sent from the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Fearing growing Byzantine influence and weakening of the state, Boris viewed the introduction of the Slavic alphabet and language in church use as a way to preserve the independence of [[Bulgaria]]. As a result of Boris's measures, two academies in [[Ohrid Literary School|Ohrid]] and [[Preslav Literary School|Preslav]] were founded.

From there, the students traveled to various other places and spread the use of their alphabet. Some went to [[Croatia]] and [[Dalmatia]] where the squared variant arose and where the Glagolitic remained in use for a long time. In [[1248]], [[Pope Innocent IV]] gave the Croats the unique privilege of using their own language and this script in liturgy.  Formally given to bishop Philip of [[Senj]], the permission actually extended to all Croatian lands using the Glagolitic liturgy, mostly along the [[Adriatic]] coast. The Vatican had several Glagolitic [[missal]]s published in Rome.  It was eventually replaced with the Latin alphabet.

Some of the students of the Ohrid academy went to [[Bohemia]] where the alphabet was used in the 10th and 11th century, along with other scripts. Glagolitic was also used in Russia, although rarely.

At the end of the [[9th century]], one of these students of Methodius who was settled in [[Preslav, Bulgaria|Preslav]] ([[Bulgaria]]) created the [[Cyrillic alphabet]], which almost entirely replaced the Glagolitic during the [[Middle Ages]]. The Cyrillic alphabet is derived from the Greek alphabet, with (at least 10) letters peculiar to Slavic languages being derived from the Glagolithic.

Nowadays, Glagolitic is only used for [[Church Slavonic]] and, sometimes, vernacular in the service-books of the Catholic [[Eparchy of Krizevci|Eparchy of Kri&amp;#382;evci]] in Croatia.

== Names ==
The tradition that the alphabet was designed by [[Saint Cyril]] and [[Saint Methodius]] has not been universally accepted. A less common belief was that the Glagolitic was created by [[St. Jerome]], hence the alphabet is sometimes named '''Hieronymian'''.  It is also [[acrophonically]] called '''azbuki''' from the names of its first two letters, on the same model as 'alpha' + 'beta'. (See ''[[azbuka]]'' for the Cyrillic alphabet).  The Slavs of [[Great Moravia]] (present-day [[Slovakia]] and [[Moravia]]), [[Hungary]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Slavonia]] were called ''Slov&amp;#283;ne'' at that time, which gives rise to the name '''Slovenish''' for the alphabet. Some other, more rare, names for this alphabet are '''Bukvitsa''' and '''Illyrian'''.

The name &quot;Glagolitic&quot; is in [[Czech (language)|Czech]] ''hlaholice'', in [[Slovak (language)|Slovak]] ''hlaholika'', in [[Polish (language)|Polish]] ''g&amp;#322;agolica'', in [[Russian (language)|Russian]],   [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] and [[Bulgarian (language)|Bulgarian]] ''&amp;#1075;&amp;#1083;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1075;&amp;#1086;&amp;#769;&amp;#1083;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1094;&amp;#1072;'' (transliterated ''glagolitsa''), in [[Croatian (language)|Croatian]] ''glagoljica'', in [[Ukrainian (language)|Ukrainian]] ''&amp;#1075;&amp;#1083;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1075;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1083;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1094;&amp;#1103;'' (transliterated ''hlaholytsia''), in [[Belarusian (language)|Belarusian]] ''&amp;#1075;&amp;#1083;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1075;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1083;&amp;#1110;&amp;#1094;&amp;#1072;'' (transliterated ''hlaholitsa''), in [[Slovenian (language)|Slovene]] ''glagolica'',in [[Serbian (language)|Serbian]] ''глагољица/glagoljica'' etc. &lt;!-- other variants can be added --&gt;

== Characteristics ==
The alphabet has two variants: round and square.
The round variant is dominated by circles and smooth curves, and the square variant features a lot of right angles, and sometimes trapezoids.
See [http://kodeks.uni-bamberg.de/AKSL/Schrift/GlagolVergleichAlphabet.htm an image of both variants (incomplete)]. Or [http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb17-1/tb50zubr.pdf for more details]
The square variant lends itself to a more abundant use of [[ligature (typography)|ligature]]s than in the Latin or the Cyrillic script.

The following table lists each letter in order, giving a picture (round variant), its name, its approximate sound in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], the presumed origin (if applicable), and the corresponding modern Cyrillic letter. The names ''Jer'' to ''Jus'' are sometimes written ''Yer'' to ''Yus''. There are several letters that have no modern counterpart, such as the [[nasal vowel]]s [[Yus|Jus]].

== Unicode ==
The Glagolitic alphabet was added to [[Unicode]] in version 4.1. The codepoint range is U+2C00 &amp;ndash; U+2C5E. See also:
* [http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2C00.pdf Glagolitic code chart]

== In popular culture ==
In Western Europe, Glagolitic is one of the least known Eastern European alphabets. It also has a particularly exotic appearance to Western eyes, as (unlike Cyrillic or Greek) none of the letters bear any resemblance to Roman letters. It may be for this reason that Glagolitic was selected as the script used by an [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] species in the [[3-D film|3-D]] [[IMAX]] movie, ''[[Alien Adventure]]''. Not only did the aliens write in Glagolitic, but their leader was called &quot;Cyrillus&quot;! (However, the alien language was unrelated to Slavonic, as in fact they spoke the [[Walloon language]], a rare dialect from the production company's homeland, [[Belgium]].)

The formal study of grammar is an important part of [[education]] from a young age through advanced [[learning]], though the rules taught in [[school]]s are not a &quot;grammar&quot; in the sense most [[linguistics|linguists]] use the term, as they are often prescriptive rather than descriptive.

[[Planned language|Planned languages]] are more common in the modern day. Many have been designed to aid human [[communication]] (such as [[Esperanto]] or the intercultural, highly logic-compatible artificial language [[Lojban]]) or created as part of a work of [[fiction]] (such as the [[Klingon language]] and [[Elvish languages]]). Each of these artificial languages has its own grammar.

It is a myth that [[analytic language]]s have simpler grammar than [[synthetic language]]s. Analytic languages use [[syntax]] to convey information that is encoded via [[inflection]] in synthetic languages. In other words, word order is not significant and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] is highly significant in a purely synthetic language, whereas morphology is not significant and syntax is highly significant in an analytic language. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], for example, are highly analytic and meaning is therefore very context dependent. (Both do have some inflections, and had more in the past; thus, they are becoming even less synthetic and more &quot;purely&quot; analytic over time.) [[Latin]], which is highly [[synthetic language|synthetic]], uses [[affix]]es and [[inflection]]s to convey the same information that Chinese does with [[syntax]]. Because Latin words are quite (though not completely) self-contained, an intelligible Latin [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] can be made from elements placed in largely arbitrary order. Latin has a complex affixation and a simple syntax, while Chinese has the opposite.

-----

In [[computer science]], the [[syntax]] of each [[programming language]] is defined by a [[formal grammar]].  In [[theory of computation|theoretical computer science]] and [[mathematics]], formal grammars define [[formal language]]s.  The [[Chomsky hierarchy]] defines several important classes of formal grammars.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about the unit of measurement, for the computer hardware manufacturer see [[Gigabyte Technology]].
{{Quantities of bytes}}
A '''gigabyte''' (derived from the [[SI prefix]] ''[[giga]]-'') is a unit of [[information]] or [[computer storage]] equal to one [[billion]] [[byte]]s. It is commonly abbreviated '''GB''' in writing (not to be confused with '''Gb''', which is used for [[gigabit]]) and '''gig''' in writing or speech.

There are two slightly different definitions of the size of a gigabyte in use: 

* 1,000,000,000 bytes or 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; bytes is the decimal definition used in [[telecommunication]]s (such as network speeds) and some [[computer storage]] manufacturers (such as [[hard disk]]s and [[flash drives]]).  This usage is compatible with [[SI]].
* 1,073,741,824 bytes, equal to 1024&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, or 2&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; bytes.  This is the definition used for [[computer memory]] sizes, and most often used in [[computer engineering]], [[computer science]], and most aspects of computer [[operating system]]s.  The [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] recommends that this unit should instead be called a [[gibibyte]] (abbreviated '''GiB'''), as it conflicts with SI units used for bus speeds and the like.

== Distinction between 1000 and 1024 megabytes ==
:''Main article: [[Binary prefix]]''

As a result of this confusion, the unadorned term gigabyte is useful only where just one digit of precision is required.  In technical specifications, the first usage is typically expanded to remove the ambiguity (&quot;GB is one billion bytes&quot;).  The only exception is [[RAM]], where sizes are always given in the power-of-two units natural to this domain.

Thus, to convert metric gigabytes into binary gigabytes (for example a 100 GB drive contains 93 GiB when installed), follow this formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{y \cdot 10^9}{2^{30}}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is size of drive in metric gigabytes

To clarify the distinction between decimal and binary prefixes, in [[1997]] the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), a standards body, proposed complete conformity with the International System of Units ([[SI]]) conventions (standard [[IEC 60027-2]]). New units were formed as unions of the SI prefixes with the word &quot;binary&quot;. Thus 2&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; bytes would be called a ''[[gibibyte]]'' (GiB) while the use of gigabyte is deprecated in this context. Thus, gigabyte unambiguously follows the SI convention as 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; bytes. This naming convention is steadily gaining acceptance, but deprecated usage is common. The convention must be inferred from context or fine print.

== Gigabytes in use ==
* As of [[2005]], most consumer [[hard drive]]s are defined by their gigabyte-range capacities.  The true capacity is usually some number above or below the class designation.  Although most hard disk manufacturers' definition of GB is 1,000,000,000 bytes (only [[computer memory]] has a natural inclination towards units that are powers of 2), most computer operating systems use the 1,073,741,824 byte definition. This distinction can cause confusion.  
* [[As of 2005]], consumer hard drive per-gigabyte costs are 0.50-0.80 [[USD]].
* In speech, ''gigabyte'' is often informally abbreviated to ''gig'', as in &quot;This is a ten-gig [[hard drive]]&quot;.
* A [[DVD#Technical_information|DVD-5]] format disc is capable of storing 4.7 GB. One gigabyte is roughly equal to 18 hours of [[MP3]] music (at 128 kbit/s).
* Most [[USB flash drive]]s have a capacity measured in [[MB]] but GB capacity flash drives have been released recently.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Galaxy groups and clusters''' are the largest [[gravity|gravitationally]]-bound objects.  They form the densest part of the [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|large scale structure of the Universe]].  In models for the gravitational formation of structure with [[cold dark matter|cold dark matter]], the smallest structures collapse first and eventually build the largest structures, clusters of galaxies. Clusters are then formed relatively recently between 10 billion years ago and now.  Groups and clusters may contain from ten to thousands of galaxies. The clusters themselves are often associated with  larger groups called [[supercluster]]s.

==Groups of galaxies==

Groups of [[galaxy|galaxies]] are the smallest aggregates of galaxies. They typically contain fewer than 50 galaxies in a diameter of 1 to 2 [[Megaparsec]]s (Mpc) (see [[1 E22 m]] for distance comparisons). Their mass are approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; solar masses. The spread of velocities for the individual galaxies is about 150 km/s.

The group which contains our own galaxy, the [[Milky Way]], is called the [[Local Group]], and contains more than 40 galaxies.

==Clusters of galaxies==
[[image:galaxy.group.hickson.arp.500pix.jpg|thumb|200px|&lt;small&gt;The galaxies of [[HCG 87]], about four hundred million light-years distant. The large edge-on spiral, the fuzzy elliptical galaxy immediately to its right, and the spiral near the top of the image are members of the group, while the small spiral galaxy exactly in the middle is a more distant background galaxy.&lt;/small&gt;]]
Clusters are larger than groups, although there is no sharp dividing line between a group and a cluster. When observed visually, clusters appear to be collections of galaxies held together by mutual gravitational attraction. However, their velocities are too large for them to remain gravitationally-bound by their mutual attractions, implying the presence of either an additional invisible mass component, or an additional attractive force besides gravity.  X-ray studies have revealed the presence of large amounts of intergalactic gas known as the [[intracluster medium]]. This gas is very hot, between 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;K and 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;K, and hence emits X-rays in the form of [[bremsstrahlung|bremsstrahlung]] and [[atomic spectral line|atomic line emission]]. The total mass of the gas is greater than that of the galaxies by roughly a factor of two. However this is still not enough mass to keep the galaxies in the cluster. Since this gas is in approximate [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] with the overall cluster gravitational field,  the total mass distribution can be determined. It turns out the total mass deduced from this measurement is approximately six times larger than the mass of the galaxies or the hot gas.  The missing component is known as [[dark matter]] and its nature is unknown. In a typical cluster perhaps only 5% of the total mass is in the form of galaxies, maybe 10% in the form of hot X-ray emitting gas and the remainder is dark matter.

Clusters typically have the following properties.
* They contain 50 to 1000 galaxies, hot X-ray emitting gas and large amounts of [[dark matter]]
* The distribution of these three components is approximately the same in the cluster.
* They have total masses of 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; solar masses.
* They typically have a diameter of 2 to 10 Mpc (see [[1 E23 m]] for distance comparisons).
* The spread of velocities for the individual galaxies is about 800-1000 km/s.

Notable galaxy clusters in the relatively nearby universe include the [[Virgo cluster]], [[Hercules Cluster]], and the [[Coma Cluster]].  A very large aggregation of galaxies known as the [[Great Attractor]], dominated by the [[Norma cluster]], is massive enough to affect the local expansion of the universe ([[Hubble flow]]).

Note: clusters of galaxies should not be confused with [[star cluster]]s such as [[galactic cluster]]s and [[open cluster]]s, which are structures ''within'' galaxies, as well as [[globular cluster]]s, which typically orbit galaxies.

==Superclusters==
''Main article: [[Supercluster]]''

Groups, clusters and some isolated galaxies form even larger structures, the [[supercluster]]s. At the very largest scales of the visible universe, matter is gathered into [[filament (astronomy)|filament]]s and walls surrounding vast [[void (astronomy)|void]]s. This structure resembles a [[foam]].

==Observational methods==

Clusters of galaxies have been found in [[astronomical catalog|surveys]] by a number of observational techniques and have been studied in detail using many methods:  

* [[Optical spectrum|Optical]] or [[infrared]]:  The individual galaxies of clusters can be studied through optical or infrared imaging and spectroscopy.  Galaxy clusters are found by optical or infrared telescopes by searching for clustered galaxies, and then confirmed by finding several galaxies at a similar [[redshift]]. Infrared searches are more useful for finding more distant (higher [[redshift]]) clusters.
* [[X-ray]]:  The hot plasma emits X-rays which can be detected by [[X-ray]] [[telescope]]s.  The cluster gas can be studied using both X-ray imaging and X-ray spectroscopy.  Clusters are quite prominent in X-ray surveys and along with [[AGN]] are the brightest X-ray emitting extragalactic objects.
* [[Radio]]:  A number of diffuse structures emitting at radio frequencies have been found in clusters. Groups of radio sources (which may include diffuse structures or [[AGN]] have been used as tracers of cluster location. At high [[redshift]] imaging around individual radio sources (in this case [[AGN]]) has been used to detect proto-clusters (clusters in the process of forming).
* [[Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect]]:  The hot electrons in the intracluster medium scatter radiation from the [[cosmic microwave background]] through [[Compton scattering]].  This produces a &quot;shadow&quot; in the observed [[cosmic microwave background]] at some radio frequencies.  
* [[gravitational lens|Gravitational Lensing]]:  Clusters of galaxies contain enough matter to distort the orientations of galaxies behind them.  This method can constrain the distribution of dark matter.

'''Grus''' ([[Latin]] for ''[[Crane (bird)|Crane]]'') is a southern [[constellation]]. The constellation was one of twelve constellations created by [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]] between [[1595]] and [[1597]], and it first appeared in [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of [[1603]].

==History and mythology==
Until the 17th century, Grus was considered part of [[Piscis Austrinus]].  The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] names of many of its stars reflect this classification.  Since it was created in the 17th century, there is no earlier mythology associated with it.

'''Servius Sulpicius Galba''' ([[December 24]], [[3 BC]] - [[January 15]], [[69]]) was [[Roman Emperors|Roman Emperor]] from [[June]] [[68]] until his death. He was the first emperor of the [[Year of the four emperors]].

== Origins and rise to power ==

He was born near [[Terracina]]. He came of a noble family and was a man of great wealth, but unconnected either by birth or by adoption with the first six Caesars. In his early years he was regarded as a youth of remarkable abilities, and it is said that both [[Augustus Caesar|Augustus]] and [[Tiberius]] prophesied his future eminence ([[Tacitus]], ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+6.20 vi. 20]; [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Galba*.html#4 Suet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[linguistics]], '''conjugation''' is the creation of derived forms of a [[verb]] from its [[principal parts]] by [[inflection]] (regular alteration according to rules of [[grammar]]). Conjugation may be affected by [[grammatical person|person]], [[grammatical number|number]], [[grammatical gender|gender]], [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical mood|mood]], [[grammatical voice|voice]], [[grammatical aspect]], or other language-specific factors. All the different forms of the same verb constitute a [[lexeme]] and the form of the verb that is conventionally used to represent the canonical form of the verb is a [[lemma (linguistics)|lemma]].

Conjugated forms of a verb which show a given person, number, tense, etc. are called ''finite'' forms. In many languages there are also one or more several ''non-finite'' forms, such as the [[infinitive]] or the [[gerund]]. A table giving all the conjugated variants of a verb in a given language is called a '''conjugation table''' or a '''verb paradigm'''.

A [[regular verb]] has a paradigm of conjugation that derives all forms from a few specific forms or ''[[principal parts]]'' (maybe only one, such as the infinitive in English). When a verb cannot be conjugated straightforwardly like this, it is said to be [[irregular verb|irregular]]. Typically the principal parts are the [[root (linguistics)|root]] and/or several modifications of it ([[stem (linguistics)|stem]]s).

'''Conjugation''' is also the traditional name of a group of verbs that share a similar conjugation pattern in a particular language (a ''verb class''). This is the sense in which teachers say that [[Latin]] has four conjugations of verbs. This means that any regular Latin verb can be conjugated in any person, number, tense, mood, and voice by knowing which of the four conjugation groups it belongs to, and its principal parts.

==Examples of conjugation==

[[Indo-European language]]s tend to [[inflection|inflect]] the verb for several categories and thus they have large verb paradigms and a difficult conjugation.  The [[copula]]r verb ''to be'' is usually the most irregular. Here is a sample conjugation of ''to be'' in [[English language|English]] and its [[Latin]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] equivalents &amp;mdash; ''esse'', ''être'', ''sein'', ''ser'', ''ser'', and ''vara'', respectively.  Notice the similarities between English, German, and Swedish on the one hand and French, Spanish, Portuguese and Latin on the other; notice also that, where the infinitive is concerned, only English and Swedish are very much divergent from the rest of the major European languages.

''(Except for the infinitive, which is in the present active form, all the verbs listed are in the present indicative active. The appropriate [[pronoun]] is included in most of the examples.)''

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Gomoku''', '''go-moku''', or '''gobang''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 五目並べ, Gomoku Narabe, &quot;five points&quot;) is an [[abstract strategy]] [[board game]]. It is traditionally played with [[Go (board game)|go]] pieces (black and white stones) on a go board (19x19 intersections); however, because once placed pieces are not moved or removed from the board, gomoku may also be played as a [[Paper and pencil game]].

Black plays first, and players alternate in placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to get an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Gomoku is known in [[Korean language|Korean]] by its cognate '''omok''' (오목) and in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] as &quot;五子棋&quot; ([[Pinyin]]: wǔzǐqí).

==Example game==
[[Image:gomoku-game-1.png|right|300px|Moves 1-21 of a game of gomoku]]

This game on the 15×15 board is adapted from the paper &quot;Go-Moku and Threat-Space Search&quot;.

The opening moves show clearly black's advantage. An open row of three (one that is not blocked by an opponent's stone at either end) has to be blocked immediately, or countered with a threat elsewhere on the board. If not blocked or countered, the open row of three will be extended to an open row of four, which threatens to win in two ways. White has to block open rows of three at moves 10, 14, 16 and 20, but black only has to do so at move 9.

Move 20 is a blunder for white (it should have been played next to black 19). Black can now force a win against any defence by white, starting with move 21.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;[[Image:gomoku-game-3.png|right|300px|Moves 22-39 of first variation]]

There are two forcing sequences for black, depending on whether white 22 is played next to black 15 or black 21. The diagram on the right shows the first sequence. All the moves for white are forced (except for 38, but by then it is too late). Such long forcing sequences are typical in gomoku, and expert players can read out forcing sequences of 20 to 40 moves rapidly and accurately.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;[[Image:gomoku-game-2.png|right|300px|Moves 22-37 of second variation]]

The diagram on the right shows the second forcing sequence. This diagram shows why white 20 was a blunder; if it had been next to black 19 (at the position of move 32 in this diagram) then black 31 would not be a threat and so the forcing sequence would fail.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

==Variations==
Black was long known to have a big advantage, even before [[L. Victor Allis]] proved that black could force a win (see below). So a number of variations are played with extra rules that aimed to reduce black's advantage.

* '''Free-style gomoku''' is the basic game as described above.
* '''Standard gomoku''' requires a row of exactly five stones for a win: rows of six or more, called '''overlines''', do not count.
* The rule of '''three and three''' bans a move that simultaneously forms two open rows of three stones (rows not blocked by an opponent's stone at either end).	
* '''Gomoku+''' the winner must have an unbroken row of five stones and this row must not be blocked at either end. This rule makes Gomoku more flexible and provides more power for White to defend.
* The rule of '''four and four''' bans a move that simultaneously forms two rows of four stones (open or not).	 
* The [http://www.littlegolem.net Little Golem] game server has a &quot;forbidden zone&quot; where black cannot play his second move.
These restrictions are often applied only to black.

* '''[[Renju]]''' is played on a 15×15 board, with the rules of three and three, four and four, and overlines applied to black only. There are special rules for the opening.
* '''Ninuki-renju''' or '''Wu''' is a variant which adds capturing to the game; it was published in the USA in a slightly simplified form under the name [[Pente]].
* [[mnk-games|''m'',''n'',''k''-games]] are a [[generalized game|generalization]] of gomoku to a board with ''m''×''n'' intersections, and ''k'' in a row needed to win.
* Connect(''m'',''n'',''k'',''p'',''q'') games are another [[generalized game|generalization]] of gomoku to a board with ''m''×''n'' intersections, ''k'' in a row needed to win, ''p'' stones for each player to place, and ''q'' stones for the first player to place for the first move only. Among these games, Connect(''m'',''n'',6,2,1) is the most interesting one, and is called [[Connect6]].

==Analysis==
Computer search by [[L. Victor Allis]] has shown that on a 15x15 board, black wins with [[perfect play]]. This applies regardless of whether overlines are considered as wins, but it assumes that the rule of three and three is not used. It seems very likely that black wins on larger boards too.

[[Generalized game|Generalized]] gomoku is [[PSPACE-complete]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Gegenschein''' ([[German language|German]] for ''counterglow'') is a faint brightening of the night sky in the region of the [[zodiac]] directly opposite the [[Sun]] caused by reflection of sunlight by small [[Cosmic_dust|dust]] particles released both by
[[asteroid]]s during their mutual collisions, and by [[comet]]s during the
development of their dust tails. Due to complex interactions between
the dust particles and [[solar radiation]], this dust collapses towards the Sun,
building up an ellipsoidal cloud of dust particles centered on our star, where the density
of particles increases towards the Sun. The gegenschein is a subtle visual and geometrical effect 
caused by the light ''we see'' reflecting off of the dust particles better in the backwards
direction than in other directions. Therefore, the gegenschein appears as a 
softly glowing oval region a few degrees wide and 10-15° in length, oriented 
along the plane of the [[ecliptic]]. It is so faint that it cannot be seen if there is any [[Moon|moonlight]] or if it falls in the vicinity of the [[Milky Way]].

The gegenschein was discovered in [[1854]] by the Danish astronomer [[Theodor Brorsen]].

The gegenschein is one of several skyglows that also include the [[zodiacal light]] and the [[zodiacal band]].

[[Image:Astrological Glyphs.jpg|thumb|right|These are the [[astrological]] [[glyph]]s as most commonly used in [[Western astrology|Western Astrology]]]]
A '''glyph''' is a carved figure or character, incised or in relief; a carved pictograph; hence, a pictograph representing a form 
originally adopted for sculpture, whether carved or painted.  Augustan English scholars of the early 18th century, imitating French antiquaries, adopted ''glyph'' from the Greek word meaning a &quot;carving.&quot;  Compare the carved and incised &quot;sacred glyphs&quot; [[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyph]]s, which have had a longer history in English dating from the first Elizabethan translation of Plutarch (who adapted &quot;hieroglyphic&quot; as a Latin adjective). But &quot;glyph&quot; first came to widespread European attention with the engravings and lithographs from [[Frederick Catherwood]]'s drawings of undeciphered glyphs of the [[Maya civilization]] in the early [[1840]]s. &quot;Glyphs&quot; still bring connotations of Maya glyphs to mind.   

In [[typography]], a '''glyph''' is an [[allograph (handwriting)|allograph]]: a particular graphical representation of a [[grapheme]], or sometimes several graphemes in combination, or only a part of a grapheme. In [[computing]] as well as typography, the term ''[[character (computing)|character]]'' refers to a grapheme or grapheme-like unit of text, as found in [[natural language]] [[writing system]]s (''scripts''). A character or grapheme is a unit of [[text]], whereas a glyph is a [[graphics|graphical]] unit.

For example, the sequence ''ffi'' contains three characters, but will be represented by ''one glyph'' in [[TeX]], since the three characters will be combined into a single [[ligature (typography)|ligature]]. Conversely, some [[typewriter]]s require the use of multiple glyphs to depict a single character (for example, two [[hyphen]]s in place of a [[dash]], or an overstruck [[apostrophe]] and [[full stop|period]] in place of an [[exclamation mark]]).

Most glyphs in typography originate from the carved and cast characters of a ''[[typeface]]'', also called a ''font''. In computing, ''font'' refers to a typeface manifesting as an indexed collection of glyphs or glyph-rendering instructions, and associated information that facilitates rendering mapping characters to glyphs and for rendering glyphs in different sizes. For a given typeface or font, each character typically corresponds to a single glyph. However, this is not always the case, especially in a font used for a language with a large alphabet or complex writing system, where one character may correspond to several glyphs, or several characters to one glyph.

In [[graphonomics]], the term '''glyph''' is used for a non-character, i.e., either a sub-character or multi-character pattern.

:''This article is about the contemporary goth/gothic [[subculture]]. For the [[Germanic tribes]] of the same name, see the [[Goths]].''

'''Goth''' is a modern [[subculture]] that first became popular during the early 1980s within the [[gothic rock]] scene, an offshoot of [[post-punk]].  It is associated with characteristically &quot;gothic&quot; tastes in music and [[Gothic fashion|clothing]]. Styles of dress range from [[death rock]], [[punk fashion|punk]], [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]], [[androgyny]], some [[Renaissance]] style clothes, a combination of the above, and/or lots of [[black]] attire, and makeup.
==English usage==
The word &quot;goth&quot; can be used as a noun, e.g. &quot;my best friend is a goth.&quot; Plurally, an S is added, e.g. &quot;at the club there were many goths.&quot; &quot;Gothic&quot; and &quot;goth&quot; can also be used interchangeably as adjectives, e.g. &quot;she was wearing a gothic necklace&quot; or &quot;he is goth&quot;. The word &quot;gothic&quot; is sometimes used as a noun in non-English speaking countries, as in &quot;I saw a gothic&quot;; this is comparatively rare and grammatically incorrect in English.
&quot;Goth&quot; cannot be used as a singular name for a group of people or the subculture in general. &quot;A member of goth&quot;, for example, is incorrect because &quot;goth&quot; is not the name of an organized group. To refer correctly to the entire group of people, one says &quot;goths&quot;, &quot;the goth subculture&quot;, or possibly &quot;the gothic subculture&quot;. &quot;Gothic&quot;, when used as an adjective, can potentially refer to anything dark or horrifying, or something influenced by medieval [[Gothic art]], and not necessarily to something associated with modern gothic subculture.


==Origins and influences==
[[Image:Goth-p1010510.jpg|thumb|200px|left| Long or eccentric hair and black leather [[trench coat]]s are features that are sometimes associated with a gothic look.]]

===Original subculture===
By the late 1970s, there were a small number of [[post punk]] bands in [[Britain]] labeled &quot;gothic.&quot; However, it was not until the early 1980s that [[gothic rock]] became its own [[Music genre|subgenre]] within [[post-punk]] and that followers of these bands started to come together as a distinctly recognisable group or movement. The opening of the [[Batcave (London nightclub)|Batcave]] in [[London]]'s [[Soho]] in July 1982 might be seen as marking the emergence of this scene (which had briefly been labeled [[positive punk]] by the [[New Musical Express]])[[http://www.scathe.demon.co.uk/batcave.htm]]. As one of the most famous meeting points for early goths, it lent its name to the term &quot;Batcaver,&quot; used to describe old-school goths.
Independent of the British scene, the late 1970s and early 1980s saw [[death rock]] branch off from American punk [[http://www.alicebag.com/dinahcancerinterview.html]].

===Etymology and Gothic horror literature===
Goth was originally the name of a [[Germanic tribe]], the [[Goths]], who played an important role in the fall of the western [[Roman Empire]].  Like another similar tribe, the [[Vandals]], the name &quot;goth&quot; later became pejorative synonymous with &quot;[[barbarian]]&quot; and being uncultured.  During the [[Renaissance]] period in [[Europe]], medieval [[architecture]] was retrospectively labeled [[gothic architecture]], and was considered ugly and barbaric in contrast to the pure lines of [[classical architecture]].

    <title>Grammatical tense</title>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Grammatical '''tense''' is a way [[language]]s express the time at which an event described by a sentence occurs. In [[English language|English]], this is a property of a [[verb]] form, and expresses only time-related information.

Tense, along with [[grammatical mood|mood]], [[grammatical voice|voice]] and [[grammatical person|person]], are three ways in which verb forms are frequently characterized, in languages where those categories apply. There are languages (mostly [[isolating language]]s, like [[Chinese language|Chinese]]) where tense is not expressed anywhere in the verb or any auxiliaries, but only as adverbs of time, when needed for comprehension; and there are also languages (such as [[Russian language|Russian]]) where tense is not deemed very important and emphasis is instead placed on [[grammatical aspect|aspect]].

The exact number of tenses in a language is often a matter of some debate, since many languages include the state of certainty of the information, the frequency of the event, whether it is ongoing or finished, and even whether the information was directly experienced or gleaned from hearsay, as moods or tenses of a verb.  Some grammarians consider these to be separate tenses, and some do not.

Tenses cannot be easily mapped from one language into another. While all languages have a &quot;default&quot; tense with a name usually translated as &quot;present tense&quot; (or &quot;simple present&quot;), the actual meaning of this tense may vary considerably. For example, the simple present tense in Spanish is often employed for continuous actions, where English would use a continuous phrase (&quot;be doing&quot;), and the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] present tense is actually best described as &quot;non-past tense&quot; because it's used also for future events.

==Compound tenses==
The more complex tenses in [[Indo-European]] languages are formed by combining a particular tense of the verb with certain [[auxiliary verb|verbal auxiliaries]], the most common of which are various forms of &quot;be&quot;, various forms of &quot;have&quot;, and modal auxiliaries such as English ''will''. Romance and Germanic languages often add &quot;to hold&quot;, &quot;to stand&quot;, &quot;to go&quot;, or &quot;to come&quot; as auxiliary verbs.  For example, Italian uses ''stare'' (&quot;stand&quot;) with the present participle to indicate the present continuous.  Portuguese uses ''ter'' (&quot;have&quot;) with the past participle for the perfect tense.  Swedish uses ''kommer att'' (&quot;come to&quot;) for the simple future, and Spanish ''ir a'' (&quot;go to&quot;) for the same. These constructions are often known as complex tenses or compound tenses (a more accurate technical term is [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] tenses).

Examples of some generally-recognized [[Indo-European]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] tenses using the verb &quot;to go&quot; are shown in the table below.

&lt;td width=&quot;10%&quot;&gt;[[Germanic language|Germanic]]: [[Swedish language|Swedish]]:&lt;br&gt; '''''att g&amp;aring;''''' &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;10%&quot;&gt;[[Finno-ugric|Finno-ugric]]: [[Finnish language|Finnish]]:&lt;br&gt; '''''menn&amp;auml;''''' &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;'''notes'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;simple [[Present tense|present]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''I go.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Vado.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Jag g&amp;aring;r.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Menen.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;In most languages this is used for most present indicative uses. In English, it's used mainly to express habit or ability (&quot;I play the guitar&quot;). &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;present [[Progressive tense|continuous]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''I am going.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Sto andando.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Jag g&amp;aring;r.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Olen menossa.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This form is prevalent in English to express current action, but is absent or rarer in other Indo-European languages, which prefer the simple present tense.  Continuous is more an [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] than a tense and is included here only because of its prevalence in English to substitute for the Simple Present.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;simple past ([[Preterite|preterite]], [[Imperfect tense|imperfect]])&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''I went.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Andai.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Jag gick.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Menin.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;In English (unlike in some languages with [[aorist]] tenses), this implies that the action took place in the past and that it is ''not'' taking place now.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;simple [[Future tense|future]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''I will go.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Andr&amp;ograve;.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Jag ska g&amp;aring;.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Menen.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This can be used to express intention, prediction, and other senses.  In Finnish, the future tense is identical to the present tense.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;!-- as [[User: Circeus]] says, some of these tenses are actually not time-only but include aspect.  And they're pretty particular to English, so I'm cutting them [[User:Steverapaport|Steverapaport]] 16:08, [[12 December]] [[2004]] (UTC) 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;past [[Progressive tense|continuous]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''I was going.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Andavo.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Olin menossa.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;--&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;future [[Progressive tense|continuous]]&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;''I will be going.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
--&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;present [[Perfect tense|perfect]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''I have gone.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Sono andato.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Jag har g&amp;aring;tt.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Olen mennyt.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Common past composite tense.  In some languages indicates recent past, in others indicates an unknown past time.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;!-- again revising this out as suggested by Circeus 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;present [[Perfect tense|perfect]] [[Progressive tense|continuous]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''I have been going.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This is used to express that an event or habit started at some time in the past and continues to the present.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;past [[Perfect tense|perfect]] [[Progressive tense|continuous]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''I had been going.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This is usually coupled with a duration, indicating that an event was ongoing for a specific time and was completed before a specific event.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
--&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;past [[Perfect tense|perfect]] ([[Pluperfect|pluperfect]])&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''I had gone.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Ero andato.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Jag hade g&amp;aring;tt.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Olin mennyt.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This expresses that an action was completed before some other event.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;future [[Perfect tense|perfect]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''I will have gone.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Sar&amp;ograve; andato.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Jag kommer att ha g&amp;aring;tt.''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(none)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This expresses a past action in a hypothetical future.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Tense, aspect, and mood==
The distinction between grammatical tense, [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], and [[Grammatical mood|mood]] is fuzzy and at times controversial.  The English ''continuous'' temporal constructions express an [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] as well as a tense, and some therefore consider that aspect to be separate from tense in English. In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] the traditional verb tenses are also combinations of aspectual and temporal information.

Going even further, there's an ongoing dispute among modern English grammarians (see [[English grammar]]) regarding whether ''tense'' can only refer to [[inflection|inflected]] forms.  In [[Germanic languages]] there are very few tenses (often only two) formed strictly by inflection, and one school contends that all complex or periphrastic time-formations are [[Grammatical aspect|aspects]] rather than tenses.

The abbreviation ''TAM'' , ''T/A/M'' or ''TMA'' is sometimes found when dealing with verbal morphemes that combine tense, aspect and mood information.

== Classification of tenses ==

Tenses can be broadly classified as:
* absolute: indicates time in relationship to the time of the utterance (i.e. &quot;now&quot;). For example, &quot;I am sitting down&quot;, the tense is indicated in relation to the present moment.
* relative: in relationship to some other time, other than the time of utterance, e.g. &quot;Strolling through the shops, she saw a nice dress in the window&quot;. Here, the &quot;saw&quot; is relative to the time of the &quot;strolling&quot;. The relationship between the time of &quot;strolling&quot; and the time of utterance is not clearly specified.
* absolute-relative: indicates time in relationship to some other event, whose time in turn is relative to the time of utterance. (Thus, in absolute-relative tense, the time of the verb is indirectly related to the time of the utterance; in absolute tense, it is directly related; in relative tense, its relationship to the time of utterance is left unspecified.) For example, &quot;When I  walked through the park, I saw a bird.&quot; Here, &quot;saw&quot; is present relative to the &quot;walked&quot;, and &quot;walked&quot; is past relative to the time of the utterance, thus &quot;saw&quot; is in absolute-relative tense.

Moving on from this, tenses can be quite finely distinguished from one another, although no language will express simply all of these distinctions. As we will see, some of these tenses in fact involve elements of modality (e.g. predictive and not-yet tenses), but they are difficult to classify clearly as either tenses or moods.

Many languages define tense not just in terms of past/future/present, but also in terms of how far into the past or future they are. Thus they introduce concepts of closeness or remoteness, or tenses that are relevant to the measurement of time into days ([[hodiernal tense|hodiernal]] or [[hesternal tense|hesternal tenses]]).

Some languages also distinguish not just between past, present, and future, but also nonpast, nonpresent, nonfuture. Each of these latter tenses incorporates two of the former, without specifying which.

Some tenses:
*[[Absolute tense]]s
**[[Future tense]]s. Some languages have different future tenses to indicate how far into the future we are talking about. Some of these include:
***[[Close future tense]]: in the near future, soon
***[[Hodiernal future tense]]: sometime today
***[[Post-hodiernal future tense]]: sometime after today
***[[Remote future tense]]: in the more distant future
***[[Predictive future tense]]: a future tense which expresses a prediction rather than an intention, i.e. &quot;I predict he will lose the election, although I want him to win&quot;. As such, it is really more of a mood than a tense. (Its tenseness rather than modality lies in the fact that you can predict the future, but not the past.)
**[[Nonfuture tense]]: refers to either the present or the past, but does not clearly specify which. Contrasts with future.
**[[Nonpast tense]]: refers to either the present or the future, but does not clearly specify which. Contrasts with past.
**[[Not-yet tense]]: has not happened in present or past (nonfuture), but often with the implication that it is expected to happen in the future. (As such, is both a tense and a modality). In English, it is expressed with &quot;not yet&quot;, hence its name.
**[[Past tense]]s. Some languages have different past tenses to indicate how far into the past we are talking about.
***[[Hesternal past tense]]: yesterday or early, but not remote
***[[Hodiernal past tense]]: sometime earlier today
***[[Immediate past tense]]: very recent past tense, e.g. in the last minute or two
***[[Recent past tense]]: in the last few days/weeks/months (exact definition varies)
***[[Remote past tense]]: more than a few days/weeks/months ago (exact definition varies)
***[[Nonrecent past tense]]: not recent past tense, contrasting with recent past tense
***[[Nonremote past tense]]: not remote past tense, contrasting with remote past tense
***[[Prehesternal past tense]]: before hesternal past tense
***[[Prehodiernal past tense]]: before hodiernal past tense
***[[Preterit]]: past tense not marked for aspect or modality
**[[Present tense]]
**[[Still tense]]: indicates a situation held to be the case, at or immediately before the utterance
*[[Absolute-relative tenses]]
**[[future perfect tense]]: will have completed by some time in the future, will occur before some time in the future
**[[future-in-future tense]]: at some time in the future, will still be in the future
**[[future-in-past tense]]: at some time in the future, will be in the past
**[[future-perfect-in-past tense]]: will be completed by some time which is in the future of some time in the past, eg., Sally went to work; by the time she should be home, the burglary would have been completed.
**[[past perfect tense]]: at some time in the past, was already in the past
*[[Relative tenses]]
**[[relative future tense]]: is in the future of some unspecified time
**[[relative nonfuture tense]]: is in the past or present of some unspecified time
**[[relative nonpast tense]]: is in the present or future of some unspecified time
**[[relative past tense]]: is in the past of some unspecified time
**[[relative present tense]]: is in the present of some unspecified time

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[linguistics]], '''grammatical aspect''' is a property of a [[verb]] that defines the nature of temporal flow (or lack thereof) in the described event or state. 

It is to be stressed that aspect, as discussed here, is a ''formal'' property of a language.  Some languages distinguish a large number of formal aspects (see the list below), while others distinguish none at all.  Even languages that do not mark aspect formally, however, can convey such distinctions, if important, by the use of adverbs, phrases, serial verb constructions or other means.

==Common aspectual distinctions==
The most fundamental aspectual distinction, represented in many languages, is between [[perfective aspect]] and [[imperfective aspect]]. This is the basic aspectual distinction in the Slavic languages. It semantically corresponds to the distinction between the tenses known respectively as the [[aorist]] and [[imperfect]] in Greek, the [[preterite]] and imperfect in Spanish, the [[simple past]] (passé simple) and imperfect in French, and the [[perfect]] and imperfect in Latin.  Essentially, the perfective aspect refers to a single event conceived as a unit, while the imperfective aspect represents an event in the process of unfolding or a repeated or habitual event. In the past tense, the distinction often coincides with the distinction between the simple past &quot;X-ed&quot;, as compared to the progressive &quot;was X-ing&quot;.  For example, the perfective would translate both verbs in the sentence &quot;He raised his sword and struck the enemy&quot;.  However, in the sentence &quot;As he was striking the enemy, he was killed by an arrow&quot;, the first verb would be rendered by an imperfective and the second by a perfective.

==Aspect vs. tense==
Aspect is a somewhat difficult concept to grasp for the speakers of most modern [[Indo-European]] languages, because they tend to conflate the concept of aspect with the concept of [[grammatical tense|tense]]. (The two concepts are mostly independent in the modern [[Slavic languages]], such as [[Russian language|Russian]], and in [[Greek language|Greek]].) Although English largely separates tense and aspect formally, its aspects (neutral, progressive, perfect and progressive perfect) do not correspond very closely to the distinction of perfective vs. imperfective that is common in most other languages.  Furthermore, the separation of tense and aspect in English is not maintained rigidly.  One instance of this is the alternation, in informal English, between sentences such as &quot;Have you eaten yet?&quot; and &quot;Did you eat yet?&quot;.  Another is in the past perfect (&quot;I had eaten&quot;), which sometimes represents the combination of  past tense and perfect aspect (&quot;I was full because I had already eaten&quot;), but sometimes simply represents a past action which is anterior to another past action (&quot;A little while after I had eaten, my friend arrived&quot;). (The latter situation is often represented in other languages by a simple perfective tense.  Formal Spanish and French use a [[past anterior]] tense in cases such as this.)

==Lexical vs. grammatical aspect==
It is extremely important to distinguish between grammatical aspect, as described here, and [[lexical aspect]].  Lexical aspect is an inherent property of verbs, and is not marked formally.  The distinctions made as part of lexical aspect are different from those of grammatical aspect; typical distinctions are between states (&quot;I have&quot;), activities (&quot;I shop&quot;) and achievements (&quot;I buy&quot;).  These distinctions are often relevant syntactically.  For example, states and activities, but not usually achievements, can be used with a prepositional ''for''-phrase describing a time duration: &quot;I had a car for five hours&quot;, &quot;I shopped for five hours&quot;, but not &quot;*I bought a car for five hours&quot;.  Lexical aspect is sometimes called ''[[Aktionsart]]'', especially by [[German language|German]] and [[Slavist|Slavic]] linguists.

==Usage of aspects==
In some languages, aspect and time are very clearly separated, making them much more distinct to their speakers. There are a number of languages that mark aspect much more saliently than time. Prominent in this category is [[Chinese language|Chinese]], which differentiates a whole slew of aspects but relies exclusively on (optional) time-words to pinpoint an action with respect to time. In other language groups, for example in most modern [[Indo-European language]]s (except [[Slavic languages]]), aspect has become almost entirely conflated, in the tense system, with time.

In [[Russian language|Russian]], aspect is more salient than tense in narrative. Russian, like other Slavic languages, uses different lexical entries for the different aspects, whereas other languages mark them [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]], and still others with [[auxiliary verb|auxiliaries]] (e.g., English).

[[Arabic language|Arabic]] shows a contrast between [[dynamic aspect|dynamic]] and [[static aspect]]. For example, the concepts 'ride' and 'mount' are shown by forms of the same verb ''rukubun'', static in the former case and dynamic in the latter.

Important qualifications:

*In many cases, the English simple past is used in situations that would be rendered in the imperfective in most other languages, not the perfective.  This occurs particularly with verbs that represent ongoing states, rather than actions (&quot;He had two dogs&quot; or &quot;There was a chair on the floor&quot;), and in constructions describing habitual actions (&quot;He walked his dog every day&quot;).
*Although the perfective is often thought of as representing a &quot;momentary action&quot;, this is not strictly correct.  It can equally well be used for an action that took time, as long as it is ''conceived of'' as a unit, with a clearly defined start and end, such as &quot;Last summer I visited France&quot;.
*Grammatical aspect represents a formal distinction encoded in the grammar of a language.  Although languages that are described as having imperfective and perfective aspects will agree in most cases in their usage of these aspects, no two languages will agree in every situation.  For example:
**Some languages have additional grammatical aspects.  Spanish and Ancient Greek, for example, have a [[perfect aspect]] (not the same as the perfective!), which refers to a state resulting from a previous action (also described as a previous action with relevance to a particular time, or a previous action viewed from the perspective of a later time).  This corresponds (roughly) to the &quot;have X-ed&quot; construction in English, as in &quot;I have recently eaten&quot;.  Languages that lack this aspect (such as Portuguese, which is closely related to Spanish) often use the past perfective to render the present perfect (compare the synonymous American English sentences &quot;Have you eaten yet?&quot; and &quot;Did you eat yet?&quot;).
**In some languages, the formal representation of aspect is optional, and can be omitted when the aspect is clear from context or does not need to be emphasized.  This is the case, for example, in Chinese, with the perfective suffix ''le'' and (especially) the imperfective ''zhe''.
**For some verbs in some languages, the difference between perfective and imperfective conveys an additional meaning difference; in such cases, the two aspects will typically be translated using separate verbs in English.  In Greek, for example, the imperfective sometimes adds the notion of &quot;try to do something&quot; (the so-called ''conative imperfect''); hence the same verb, in the imperfective (present or imperfect tense) and aorist, respectively, is used to convey ''look'' and ''see'', ''search'' and ''find'', ''listen'' and ''hear''. (For example, &amp;#951;&amp;#954;&amp;#959;&amp;#965;&amp;#959;&amp;#956;&amp;#949;&amp;#957; ''ēkouomen'' &quot;we listened&quot; vs. &amp;#951;&amp;#954;&amp;#959;&amp;#965;&amp;#963;&amp;#945;&amp;#956;&amp;#949;&amp;#957; ''ēkousamen'' &quot;we heard&quot;.) Spanish has similar pairs for certain verbs, such as (imperfect and preterite, respectively) ''sabía'' &quot;I knew&quot; vs. ''supe'' &quot;I found out&quot;, ''podía'' &quot;I was able to&quot; vs. ''pude'' &quot;I succeeded (in doing something)&quot;, ''quería'' &quot;I wanted to&quot; vs. ''quise'' &quot;I tried to&quot;, ''no quería'' &quot;I didn't want to&quot; vs. ''no quise'' &quot;I refused (to do something)&quot;.   Such differences are often highly language-specific.

==Aspect in English==
According to one prevalent account, the English tense system is considered to have strictly only two basic ''times'' (since no primitive future tense exists in English, and the futurity of an event is expressed in English through the use of the [[auxiliary verb]]s &quot;[[will future|will]]&quot; and &quot;[[shall]]&quot;, by use of a present form, as in &quot;tomorrow we go to Newark&quot;, or by some other means). But present and past are expressed using direct modifications of the verb, which may then be modified further by the [[progressive aspect]] (also called the ''continuous'' aspect), the [[perfect aspect]] (also called the ''completed'' aspect), or both.  Each tense is named according to its combination of aspects and time.

So we have for the present tense:
*Present Simple (not progressive/continuous, not perfect; simple): &quot;I eat&quot;
*Present Progressive (progressive, not perfect): &quot;I am eating&quot;
*Present Perfect (not progressive, perfect): &quot;I have eaten&quot;
*Present Perfect Progressive (progressive, perfect): &quot;I have been eating&quot;

...and for the past tense:
*Past Simple (not progressive/continuous, not perfect; simple): &quot;I ate&quot;
*Past Progressive (progressive, not perfect): &quot;I was eating&quot;
*Past Perfect (not progressive, perfect): &quot;I had eaten&quot;
*Past Perfect Progressive (progressive, perfect): &quot;I had been eating&quot;

(Note that, while many elementary discussions of English grammar would classify the Present Perfect as a past tense, from the standpoint of strict linguistics – and that elucidated here – it is clearly a species of the present, as we cannot say of someone now deceased that he &quot;has eaten&quot; or &quot;has been eating&quot;; the present auxiliary implies that he is in some way ''present'' (alive), even if the action denoted is completed (perfect) or partially completed (progressive perfect).)

Another aspect that does survive in English, but that is no longer productive, is the [[frequentative]], which conveys the sense of continuously repeated action; while prominent in [[Latin]], it is omitted from most discussions of English grammar, as it suggests itself only by [[Scandinavian language|Scandinavian]] [[suffix]]es no longer heard independently from the words to which they're affixed (e.g., &quot;blabber&quot; for &quot;blab&quot;, &quot;chatter&quot; for chat&quot;, &quot;dribble&quot; for &quot;drip&quot;, &quot;crackle&quot; for &quot;crack&quot;, etc.).

Note that the aspectual systems of certain dialects of English, such as [[Hawaiian Creole English]] and [[African-American Vernacular English]], are quite different from standard English, and often distinguish aspect at the expense of tense.

==Aspect in Slavic languages==
In [[Slavic languages]] there is only one type of aspectual opposition which forms two grammatical aspects: [[perfective aspect|perfective]] and [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] (in contrast with English which has two aspectual oppositions: perfect vs. neutral and progressive vs. nonprogressive). The aspectual distinctions exist on the lexical level - there is no unique method to form a perfective verb from a given imperfective one (or conversely).

With a few exceptions each Slavic verb is either perfective or imperfective. Most verbs form strict pairs of one perfective and one imperfective verb with generally the same meaning. However, in each Slavic language there is a number of verbs which are bi-aspectual and act as both imperfective and perfective. They are mainly borrowings from non-Slavic languages, but some native verbs also belong to this group. As opposed to them, mono-aspectual verbs are mainly native. There are mono-aspectual imperfective verbs without perfective equivalents (among others, verbs with the meaning ''to be'' and ''to have'') as well as perfective verbs without imperfective equivalents (for instance, verbs with the meaning 'become ...', e.g. ''to become paralyzed'' etc.).

Perfective aspect allows the speaker to describe the action as finished, completed, finished in the natural way. Imperfective aspect does not present the action as finished, but rather as continuing or repeating.

An example will be made of the verb &quot;to eat&quot; in the [[Serbian language]]. The verb translates into Serbian either as &quot;jesti&quot; (imperfective) or &quot;pojesti&quot; (perfective). Now, both aspects could be used in the same tense of Serbian. For example:

{| border=1
!colspan=3|[[Serbian language|Serbian]]
|-
|Example||Tense||Aspect
|-
|Ja sam jeo||rowspan=2|past||imperfective
|-
|Ja sam pojeo||perfective
|-
|Ja sam bio jeo||rowspan=2|[[Pluperfect tense|pluperfect]]||imperfective
|-
|Ja sam bio pojeo||perfective
|-
|Ja &amp;#263;u jesti||rowspan=2|future||imperfective
|-
|Ja &amp;#263;u pojesti||perfective
|}

''Ja sam pojeo'' signals that the action was completed. Its meaning can be given as &quot;I ate (something) and I finished eating (it)&quot;; or &quot;I ate (something) up&quot;.

''Ja sam jeo'' signals that the action took place (at a specified moment, or in the course of one's life, or every day, etc.); it may mean &quot;I was eating&quot;, &quot;I ate&quot; or &quot;I've been eating&quot;.

The [[Polish language]] can also serve as a typical Slavic language. All following examples are Polish.

'''Imperfective''' verbs mean:
* actions in progress, just going states and activities, with significant course (in opinion of the speaker);
* activities posing the background for other (perfective) activities, ex. ''czytałem książkę, gdy zadzwonił telefon'' 'I was reading the book when the telephone rang';
* simultaneous activities, ex. ''będę czytać książkę, podczas gdy brat będzie pisać list'' 'I will be reading the book while brother will be writing the letter';
* durative activities, lasting through some time, e.g. ''krzyczał'' 'he was shouting', ''będzie drgać'' 'it will be vibrating';
* motions without a strict aim, ex. ''chodzę'' 'I am walking here and there';
* multiple (iterative) activities, ex. ''dopisywać'' 'to insert many times to the text', ''będziemy wychodziły'' 'we will go out (many times)';
* non-resultative activities, only heading towards some purpose: ''będę pisał list'' 'I will be writing the letter';
* continuous states, ex. ''będę stać'' 'I will be standing'.

'''Perfective''' verbs mean past or future, but not present activities – an activity which is happening now cannot be ended, so it cannot be perfective. Perfective verbs mean:
* states and activities which were ended (even if a second ago) or which will be ended, with insignificant course, short or treated as a whole by the speaker, ex. ''krzyknął'' 'he shouted', ''drgnie'' 'it will stir';
* single-time activities, ex. ''dopisać'' 'to insert to the text', ''wyszedł'' 'he has gone out';
* actions whose goals have already been achieved, even if with difficulty, ex. ''przeczytałem'' 'I have read', ''doczytała się'' 'she finished reading and found what she had sought';
* reasons for the state, ex. ''pokochała'' 'she came to love', ''zrozumiesz'' 'you (sg.) will understand', ''poznamy'' 'we will get to know';
* the beginning of the activity or the state, ex. ''wstanę'' 'I will stand up' (and I will stand), ''zaczerwienił się'' 'he reddened';
* the end of the activity or the state, ex. ''dośpiewaj'' 'sing till the end';
* activities executed in many places, on many objects or by many subjects at the same time, ex. ''powynosił'' 'he carried out (many things)', ''popękają'' 'they will break out in many places', ''poucinać'' 'to cut off many items';
* actions or states which last some time, ex. ''postoję'' 'I will stand for a little time', ''pobył'' 'he was (there) for some time'.

Most '''simple''' Polish verbs are imperfective (the same in other Slavic languages), ex. ''iść'' 'to walk, to go', ''nieść'' 'to carry', ''pisać'' 'to write'. But there are also few simple perfective verbs, ex. ''dać'' 'to give', ''siąść'' 'to sit down'. There exist many perfective verbs with suffixes and without prefixes, ex. ''krzyknąć'' 'to shout', ''kupić'' 'to buy' (cf. the imperfective ''kupować'' with a different suffix).

Numerous perfective verbs are formed from simple imperfectives by '''prefixation'''. To create the perfective counterpart, verbs use various [[prefix]]es without any clear rules. The actual prefix can even depend on a dialect or special meaning, ex. the perfective counterpart to ''malować'' is ''pomalować'' when it means 'to paint a wall', or ''namalować'' when it means 'to paint a picture'.

Besides the strict perfective equivalent, a number of other prefixed verbs may be formed from a given simple imperfective verb. They all have similar but distinct meaning. And they form, as a rule, their own imperfective equivalents by means of '''suffixation''' (attaching [[suffix]]es) or stem '''alternation'''. Example:
* ''prać'' 'to wash / clean clothes with water and soap / washing powder' is a simple imperfective verb;
* ''uprać'' is its perfective counterpart while ''doprać'', ''przeprać'', ''oprać'' are other derived perfective verbs with a little different meanings;
* ''dopierać'', ''przepierać'', ''opierać'' are secondary imperfective verbs which are counterparts for ''doprać, przeprać, oprać'' respectively; ''*upierać'' does not exist because the basic verb ''prać'' is the imperfective counterpart of ''uprać''.

There is a number of verbs which form their aspectual counterparts by simultaneous prefixation and suffixation or by suppletion, ex. (the first one is imperfective) ''stawiać - postawić'' 'to set up', ''brać - wziąć'' 'to take', ''widzieć - zobaczyć'' 'to see'.

Special imperfective verbs are those which express aimless motions. They are mono-aspectual, i.e they have no perfective equivalents. They are formed from other imperfective verbs by stem alternations or suppletion, ex. ''nosić'' 'to carry around' (from ''nieść''), ''chodzić'' 'to walk around, to go around' (from ''iść'' 'to go, to walk'). However, when such a verb gets an aim anyway, it becomes iterative: ''chodzić do szkoły'' 'to go to school'.

Other iteratives build another group of mono-aspectual imperfective verbs. They are formed from other imperfective verbs, including the previous group: ''chadzać'' 'to walk around usually' (from ''chodzić''), ''jadać'' 'to eat usually' (from ''jeść'' 'to eat'). Both groups are not too numerous: most Polish verbs cannot form iterative counterparts.

Perfective verbs which express activities executed in many places, on many objects or by many subjects at the same time, and those which express actions or states which last some time, have no imperfective counterparts. They are formed with the prefix ''po-'' (which can have other functions as well).

States and activities which last for some time can be expressed by means of both imperfective and perfective verbs: ''cały dzień leżał w łóżku'' 'he was in bed all day long' (literally: 'he lay in bed') means nearly the same as ''cały dzień przeleżał w łóżku''. The difference is mainly stylistic: imperfective is neutral here, while using perfective causes stronger tone of the statement.

Aspect in Slavic is a superior category in relation to [[tense]] or [[mood]]. Particularly, some verbal forms (like infinitive) cannot distinguish tense but they still distinguish aspect. Here is the list of Polish verb forms which can be formed by both imperfective and perfective verbs (such a list is similar in other Slavic languages). The example is an imperfective and a perfective Polish verb with the meaning 'to write'. All personal forms are given in 3rd person, masculine singular:
* infinitive: ''pisać - napisać'';
* passive participle: ''pisany - napisany'';
* gerund: ''pisanie - napisanie'';
* past impersonal form: ''pisano - napisano'';
* past impersonal form in subjunctive: ''pisano by - napisano by'';
* past tense: ''pisał - napisał'';
* future tense: ''będzie pisać / będzie pisał - napisze'';
* subjunctive, 1st form: ''pisałby - napisałby'';
* subjunctive, 2nd form: ''byłby pisał - byłby napisał'';
* imperative: ''pisz - napisz''.

The following may be formed only if the verb is imperfective:
* contemporary adverbial participle – ''pisząc'';
* active participle – ''piszący'';
* present tense – ''pisze''.  

One form may be created only if the verb is perfective, namely:
* anterior adverbial participle – ''napisawszy''.

==Aspect in Finnic languages==

[[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]], among others, have a grammatical aspect contrast of [[telicity]] between telic and atelic. Telic sentences signal that the intended goal of an action is achieved. Atelic sentences do not signal whether any such goal has been achieved. The aspect is indicated by the [[List of grammatical cases|case]] of the object: [[accusative]] is telic and [[partitive]] is atelic. For example, the (implicit) purpose of shooting is to kill, such that:
* ''Ammuin karhun'' -- &quot;I shot the bear (succeeded)&quot;; i.e., &quot;I shot the bear dead&quot;.
* ''Ammuin karhua'' -- &quot;I shot (towards) the bear&quot;; i.e., &quot;I shot the bear (and I am not telling if it died)&quot;. 
Sometimes, corresponding telic and atelic forms have as little to do with each other semantically as &quot;take&quot; has with &quot;take off&quot;. For example, ''naida'' means &quot;to marry&quot; when telic, but &quot;to have sex with&quot; when atelic.

Also, derivational suffices exist for various aspects. Examples:
*''-ahta-'' &quot;do suddenly by itself&quot; as in ''ammahtaa'' &quot;to shoot up&quot; from ''ampua'' &quot;to shoot&quot;
*''-ele-'' &quot;repeatedly&quot; as in ''ammuskella'' &quot;to go shooting around&quot;

There are derivational suffixes for verbs, which carry [[frequentative]], [[momentane]], [[causative]], and [[inchoative]] aspect meanings; also, pairs of verbs differing only in [[transitivity]] exist.

==Confusing terminology: perfective vs. perfect==
The terms ''perfective'' and ''perfect'' are used in an unfortunate and highly confusing fashion in different writings about linguistics.  Traditional Greek grammar uses the term &quot;perfect&quot; to refer to a grammatical tense encoding what is variously described as a past action with present relevance or a present state resulting from a past action. (For example, &quot;I have gone to the cinema&quot; implies both that I went to the cinema and that I am now in the cinema.) The perfect is opposed to the [[aorist]], describing a simple past action, and the [[imperfect tense|imperfect]], describing an ongoing past action.  From this, the aspectual nature of the perfect tense was generalized into the [[perfect aspect]], describing a previously completed action with relevance to a particular time.  Accordingly, English grammar speaks of the ''[[present perfect]]'' (&quot;I have gone&quot;), the ''[[past perfect]]'' or ''[[pluperfect]]'' (&quot;I had gone&quot;), and the ''[[future perfect]]'' (&quot;I will have gone&quot;).

Latin, however, lacks a distinction between aorist and perfect, and for morphological reasons the single tense representing the combination of both meanings is called the &quot;perfect&quot;.  The two-way distinction here between imperfect and perfect is carried over into the terminology of various modern languages, such as the [[Slavic languages]], where a distinction between &quot;imperfective&quot; and &quot;perfective&quot; aspect corresponds to a distinction between an event viewed as ongoing or with internal structure and an event viewed as a simple whole.  That is, what is called &quot;perfective&quot; is similar to the aspectual nature of the original Greek aorist, ''not'' the Greek perfect.

Many linguists have tried to maintain this terminology.  The web site of SIL, for example, describes the &quot;perfective aspect&quot; as &quot;an aspect that expresses a temporal view of an event or state as a simple whole, apart from the consideration of the internal structure of the time in which it occurs&quot; [http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsPerfectiveAspect.htm].  This has led other linguists to categorize the three-way aspectual distinction visible in Greek, English, Spanish and various other languages as a distinction between &quot;imperfective&quot;, &quot;perfective&quot; and &quot;perfect&quot;.  Not surprisingly, the latter two are constantly confused, and &quot;perfective&quot; is often taken to be synonymous with &quot;perfect&quot;.

==Examples of various aspects rendered in English==
* [[Perfective aspect|perfective]] ([[aorist aspect|aorist]], simple; see above): 'I struck the bell.' (single action)
* [[Perfect aspect|Perfect]] (sometimes confusingly called &quot;perfective&quot;; see above): 'I have gone to the cinema.' (hence, I am now in the cinema)
* Progressive ([[continuous aspect|continuous]]): 'I am eating.' (action is in progress)
* Habitual: 'I walk home from work.' (every day)
: 'I would walk [OR: used to walk] home from work.' (past habit)
* [[Imperfective aspect|Imperfective]] (either progressive or habitual): 'I am walking to work' (progressive) or 'I walk to work every day' (habitual).
* Prospective: 'I am about to eat' OR: 'I'm going to eat.&quot;
* Inceptive: 'I am beginning to eat.'
* [[Inchoative]] (not clearly distinguished from inceptive): 'The apples ripen.'
* Continuative: 'I am continuing to eat.'
* Terminative: 'I am finishing my meal.'
* Conative: 'I am trying to eat.'
* Cessative: 'I am quitting smoking.'
* Pausative: 'I stopped working for a while.'
* Resumptive: 'I resumed sleeping.'
* Punctual: 'I slept.'
* Durative: 'I slept for an hour.'
* Delimitative: 'I slept for a while.'
* Protractive: 'The argument went on and on.'
* Iterative: 'I read the same books again and again.'
* [[Frequentative]]: 'It sparkled', contrasted with 'It sparked'. Or, 'I run around', vs. 'I run'.
* Experiential: 'I have gone to school many times.'
* Intentional: 'I listened carefully.'
* Accidental: 'I knocked over the chair.'
* Generic: 'Mangos grow on trees.'
* Intensive: 'It glared.'
* Moderative: 'It shone.'
* Attenuative: 'It glimmered.'
* Semelfactive ([[momentane]]): 'The mouse squeaked once.' (contrasted to 'The mouse squeaked/was squeaking.')

Languages which contrast intentional and accidental aspect morphologically are extremely rare; one such language is [[Bats language|Bats]], which distinguishes this aspectual difference for just six verbs. Compare '''so wodze''' ''I fell down (through no fault of my own, accidentally)'' and '''as wodze''' ''I fell down (through something I did, or on purpose)''.

'''Glucose''' (Glc), a [[monosaccharide]], is one of the most important [[carbohydrate]]s. The cell uses it as a source of energy and metabolic intermediate. Glucose is one of the main products of [[photosynthesis]] and starts [[cellular respiration]]. The natural form (&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose) is also referred to as '''dextrose''', especially in the food industry. This article deals with the D-form of glucose (see '''''Isomers'''''-section below)

==Structure==
[[Image:D-glucose.png|frame|right|''The chain form of &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose'']]
[[Image:Space-filling_Glucose.jpg|thumb|left|80px|''A space-filling model of glucose'']]
Glucose contains six [[carbon]] [[atom]]s and an [[aldehyde]] group and is therefore referred to as an aldo[[hexose]]. The glucose molecule can exist in an open-chain (acyclic) and ring (cyclic) form, the latter being the result of an intramolecular reaction between the aldehyde C atom and the C-5 [[hydroxyl]] group to form an intramolecular [[hemiacetal]]. In water solution both forms are in equilibrium, and at [[pH]] 7 the cyclic one is thapka një universitet privat&quot; (Albanian: A private University will be opened - apparently, i.e. as reported by someone &amp; to my surprise.)
*&quot;Varacak/mish/&quot; (Turkish: He will be arriving - as told by someone)

==Cohortative mood==

The '''[[cohortative mood]]''' is used to express plea, insistence, imploring, self-encouragement, wish, desire, intent, command, purpose or consequence. It does not exist in English, but phrases such as &quot;let us&quot; are often used to denote it.

== Conditional mood ==

The '''[[conditional mood]]''' is used to express a lack of certainty about whether the action ever occurs, particularly, but not exclusively, in conditional clauses. In [[English language|English]], the conditional is manifested by means of the modal auxiliary 'would' added to the bare infinitive, e.g. ''I would buy''. In other languages, such  as Spanish, it is expressed by means of morphological marking on the verb. So, the conditional of 'John eats' is, in English, 'John would eat' ('would' + bare infinitive of [[main verb]]) and, in Spanish, 'Juan comería' (infinitive ''comer'' ((to) eat)) + third-singular ''ía'').

Typically, it introduces [[subordinate clause]]s which are headed by a [[phrase]] roughly meaning 'on the condition that', such as 'if', 'as long as', etc., and these phrases can have their meaning intensified by items like 'even', as in 'even if'. A peculiarity in English and several related languages is that the  conditional mood occurs only in the main clause: the verb of the subordinate clause is marked for subjunctive modality.  This is unusual; in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], for example, the conditional mood is used both in the main and the subordinate clauses. An example in English with a conditional main clause and a subjunctive subordinate clause is: ''I &lt;u&gt;would buy&lt;/u&gt; a house if I &lt;u&gt;earned&lt;/u&gt; a lot of money'' (I might buy a house, if I earn a lot of money, but I do not and thus earning a lot of money is a condition for buying a house.) Compare Finnish, where the both clauses have a conditional marker (''-isi-''): ''Osta&lt;u&gt;isi&lt;/u&gt;n talon, jos ansaits&lt;u&gt;isi&lt;/u&gt;n paljon rahaa''.

The conditional mood does not express uncertainty; this is a distinct mood, the potential mood, which is expressed with the words &quot;probably&quot; or &quot;may&quot; in English. The conditional mood is sometimes erroneously called a tense rather than a mood. This practice should be avoided, as tense refers exclusively to temporal location, and therefore in no way does it involve conditions, desires, etc., which are all modal. However, despite this, [[linguistics]] tends to be the only area in which such discrimination takes place &amp;mdash; in foreign language courses, for example, non-temporal distinctions such as the conditional mood may be erroneously called 'tenses'.

==Dubitative mood==

The [[dubitative mood]] is used in [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and other languages.  It expresses the speaker's doubt or uncertainty about the event denoted by the verb. See [[irrealis moods]]. For example, in Ojibwe, ''Baawitigong igo ayaa noongom'' translates as &quot;he is in [[Sault Ste. Marie]] today.&quot; When the dubitative suffix ''-dig'' is added, this becomes ''Baawitigong igo ayaa&lt;u&gt;dig&lt;/u&gt; noongom'', &quot;I guess he must be in Sault Ste. Marie today.&quot; (modified from the example in the Ontario Curriculum Support Document for the Teaching of Language Patterns)

==Energetic mood==

Found in [[Classical Arabic]] and various other [[Semitic languages]], the [[energetic mood]] expresses something which is strongly believed or which the speaker wishes to emphasize, e.g. &quot;Ya-ktub-un&quot;. (&quot;He certainly writes.&quot;) 

==Eventive mood==

The '''eventive mood''' is used in the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] epic poem, [[Kalevala]]. It is a combination of the potential and the conditional. It is also used in dialects of [[Estonian language|Estonian]].
In Finnish, there are theoretically forms like this:
* 'kävelleisin' = 'I probably would walk'

== Generic mood ==

The '''[[generic mood]]''' is used to make generalizations about a particular class of things, e.g. in ''&quot;Rabbits are fast&quot;,'' one is speaking about rabbits ''in general'', rather than about particular fast rabbits. [[English language|English]] has no means of [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] distinguishing generic mood from indicative mood, however the distinction can easily be understood in context by surrounding words.  Compare, for example: ''rabbits are fast'', versus, ''the rabbits are fast''.  Use of the word &quot;the&quot; implies specific, particular rabbits, whereas omitting the word &quot;the&quot; implies the generic mood simply by default.

[[Ancient Greek]] had a species of generic mood (the so-called ''[[gnomic]] utterance''), marked by the [[aorist]] indicative (normally reserved for statements about the past).  It was used especially to express philosophical truths about the world.

==Hypothetical mood==

The [[hypothetical mood]], found in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Lakota]], and other languages, expresses a [[counterfactual]] but possible event or situation.

== Imperative mood ==

The '''imperative mood''' expresses commands, direct requests, and prohibitions. In many circumstances, directly using the imperative mood seems blunt or even rude, so it is often used with care. Example: &quot;Paul, read that book&quot;.

Many languages, including English, use the bare verb stem to form the imperative.  In English, second-person is implied by the imperative except when first-person plural is specified, as in &quot;Let's go.&quot;

== Indicative mood ==

The '''indicative mood''' is used in factual statements. All intentions in speaking that a particular language does not put into another mood use the indicative.  It is the most commonly used mood and is found in all languages. Example: &quot;Paul is reading books&quot; or &quot;Paul reads books&quot;.

Closely related is the '''declarative mood''' which indicates that the statement is true, without any qualifications being made. It is in many languages equivalent to the indicative mood, although sometimes distinctions between them are drawn.

== Interrogative mood ==

The '''[[interrogative mood]]''' is used for asking questions. Most languages do not have a special mood for asking questions, but [[Nenets language|Nenets]] does.

==Jussive mood==
The [[jussive mood]] is similar to the '''cohortative mood''', in that it expresses plea, insistence, imploring, self-encouragement, wish, desire, intent, command, purpose or consequence. In some languages, the two are distinguished in that cohortative occurs in the first person and the jussive in the second or third.

== Negative mood ==

The '''negative mood''' expresses a [[negation|negated]] action. In many languages, this is not distinct mood; negativity is expressed by adding a particle before (as in [[Russian language|Russian]] or [[Esperanto]]: &quot;Li '''ne''' iras.&quot;), after (as in archaic or dialectic [[English language|English]]: &quot;Thou remembrest '''not'''?&quot;), or both (as in [[French language|French]]: &quot;Je '''ne''' sais '''pas'''.&quot;.) Standard English brings in a helper verb, ''do'' usually, and then adds ''not'' after it: &quot;I '''did not''' go there&quot;.

In Indo-European languages, it is not customary to speak of a negative mood, since in these languages negation is originally a [[grammatical particle]] that can be applied to a verb in any of these moods.  In some non-Indo-European languages, the negative mood counts as a separate mood, an example of which is [[Japanese language|Japanese]], which conjugates verbs in the negative ''after'' the suffix ''-nai'' (indicating negation) has been added, e.g. tabeta (ate) and tabe'''naka'''tta (did not eat). 

It could be argued that [[Modern English]] has joined the ranks of these languages, since negation in the indicative mood requires the use of an [[auxiliary verb]] and a distinct [[syntax]] in most cases.  Contrast, for instance, &quot;He sing'''s'''&quot; -&gt; &quot;He '''doesn't''' sing&quot; (where the auxiliary ''to do'' has to be supplied, inflected to ''does'', and the clitic form of ''not'' suffixed to derive the negative from &quot;He sings&quot;) with &quot;Il chante&quot; -&gt; &quot;Il '''ne''' chante '''pas'''&quot;; [[French language|French]] adds the (discontinuous) negative particle ''ne...pas'', without changing the form of the verb.

== Optative mood ==

The '''optative mood''' expresses hopes, wishes or commands and has other uses that may overlap with the subjunctive mood. Few languages have an optative as a distinct mood; [[Albanian language|Albanian]], Ancient [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] are some that do.

In Finnish, the mood may be called an &quot;archaic&quot; or &quot;formal imperative&quot;, even if it has other uses; nevertheless, it does express formality at least. For example, 9th Article of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] begins with ''&lt;u&gt;Älköön&lt;/u&gt; ketään &lt;u&gt;pidätettäkö&lt;/u&gt; mielivaltaisesti'', &quot;&lt;u&gt;Not&lt;/u&gt; anyone &lt;u&gt;shall be arrested&lt;/u&gt; arbitrarily&quot;, where ''älköön pidätettäkö'' &quot;shall not be arrested&quot; is the optative of ''ei pidätetä'' &quot;is not arrested&quot;. (Also, using the conditional mood ''-isi-'' in conjunction with the clitic ''-pa'' yields an optative meaning, e.g. ''olisinpa'' &quot;if I only was&quot;. Here, it is evident that the wish is not, and probably will not be fulfilled.)

In Japanese the verb inflection ''-tai'' expresses the speaker's desire, e.g. ''watashi wa asoko ni ikitai'' &quot;I want to go there&quot;. Oddly enough, this verb form is treated as a pseudo-adjective: the auxiliary verb ''garu'' is used by dropping the end -i of an adjective to indicate the outward appearance of another's mental state, in this case the desire of a person other than the speaker (e.g. ''Jon-san wa tabetagatte imasu'' &quot;John wants to eat&quot;).

Sometimes this is called a &quot;desiderative mood&quot;, since it indicates desires. Occasionally distinctions are made between different optative moods, e.g. a mood to express hopes as opposed to a mood to express desires. (Desires are what we want to be the case; hope generally implies an optimism toward the chances of a desire's fulfillment. If someone desires something but is pessimistic about its chances of occurring, then one desires it but does not hope for it.)

==Potential mood==

The '''[[potential mood]]''' is a mood of probability, indicating that the action most likely, but not certainly, occurs. It is used in [[Finnish_language|Finnish]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and in [[Sanskrit|Sanskrit]].  (In Japanese it is often called something like '''tentative,''' since '''potential''' is used to refer to a [[grammatical_voice|voice]] indicating capability to perform the action.)

In Finnish, it is mostly a literary device, as it has virtually disappeared from daily spoken language in most dialects. Its suffix is ''-ne-'', as in *''men+ne+e'' &amp;rarr; ''mennee''  &quot;probably (s/he/it) will go&quot;. Some kinds of consonant clusters simplify to geminates. This simplification occurs progressively (*''rne &amp;rarr; rre'') with the resonant consonants L, R, and S, and regressively with stops (*''tne &amp;rarr; nne'') and is related to the violation of [[Phonotactics|phonotactical]] rules concerning [[sonority hierarchy]]. For example, ''korjata'' &amp;rarr; *''korjat+ne+t'' &amp;rarr; ''korjannet'' (&quot;probably you will fix&quot;), or ''tulla'' &amp;rarr; *''tul+ne+e'' &amp;rarr; ''tullee'' (&quot;probably s/he/it will come&quot;). The potential mood can be used only in present and perfect tenses. The verb ''ole-'' &quot;be&quot; is replaced by ''lie'', thus &quot;probably (it) is&quot; is ''lienee'' (not *''ollee''). Thus, in the perfect tense, which is formed with an auxiliary verb, the auxiliary verb ''lie'' is used instead of ''ole-'' as ''liene-'', e.g. ''lienet korjannut'' &quot;you probably have fixed&quot; (not *''ollet korjannut'').

In English, it is formed by means of the auxiliaries ''may'', ''can'', ''ought'' and ''must''.

== Presumptive mood ==

The [[presumptive mood]] is used in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] to express presupposition or hypothesis regarding the fact denoted by the verb, as well as other more or less similar attitudes: doubt, curiosity, concern, condition, indifference, inevitability. For example, &quot;Acolo s-o fi dus.&quot; (''He might have gone there'') shows the basic presupposition use, while the following excerpt from a poem of [[Eminescu]]

: &quot;De-o fi una, de-o fi alta... Ce e scris şi pentru noi, / Bucuroşi le-om duce toate, de e pace, de-i război.&quot;

: (''Be it one, be it the other... Whatever fate we have, / We will gladly go through all, be it peace or be it war.'')

shows the use both in a conditional clause (&quot;de-o fi&quot; ''suppose it is'') and in a main clause showing an attitude of submission to fate (&quot;le-om duce&quot; ''we would bear'').

== Subjunctive mood ==

The '''[[subjunctive mood]]''' has several uses in independent clauses.  Examples include discussing hypothetical or unlikely events, expressing opinions or emotions, or making polite requests (the exact scope is language-specific). A subjunctive mood exists in English, but appears to be falling out of common use; many native English speakers do not use it.  Example: &quot;I suggested that Paul read books&quot;. Paul is not in fact reading the book.  Contrast this with the sentence &quot;Paul reads books&quot;, where the verb ''read'' has the third person singular ending.  Another way, especially in [[British English]], of expressing this might be &quot;I suggested that Paul should read books.&quot;, derived from &quot;Paul should read books.&quot;  Other uses of the subjunctive in English, as in &quot;And '''if he be''' not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass...&quot; ([[King James Version|KJV]] [[Leviticus]] 5:7) have definitely become archaic.  Statements such as &quot;I will ensure that he leave immediately&quot; often sound archaic or overly formal, and have been almost completely supplanted by constructions like &quot;I will ensure that he leave'''s''' immediately&quot;; of course, one could easily argue that the subjunctive mood is not truly fading from use, but is simply becoming ''morphologically'' indistinguishible from the indicative mood while remaining ''contextually'' alive and well.

The subjunctive mood figures prominently in the grammar of the [[Romance languages]], which require this mood for certain types of dependent clauses. This point commonly causes difficulty for English speakers learning these languages.

In certain other languages, the [[dubitative mood]] is employed instead of the subjunctive in referring to doubtful or unlikely happenings and the like (see also below).

When said in other languages such as Spanish it is used as: tu pones esto alli or Uds. ponen este alli.

}}The '''Geelong Football Club''', nicknamed '''The Cats''', is an [[Australian rules football]] club in the [[Australian Football League]]. The club is based in the city of [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]] at [[Skilled Stadium]]. They are the only current AFL team that is not based in a state capital city (although some may count the [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle Dockers]], and at one stage the [[Brisbane Bears]] were actually based on the [[Gold Coast, Australia|Gold Coast]]).
==History==
Geelong is the second oldest Australian rules football club (after the [[Melbourne Football Club]]), and ninth [[oldest football club]] in the world, having been formed in the Victoria Hotel in [[1859]]. Originally based at Corio Oval, Geelong moved to [[Skilled Stadium| Kardinia Park]] (now Skilled Stadium) in the [[1940s]]. For many years they were known as the '''Pivotonians''', after the city's nickname 'The Pivot', Seagulls was also an earlier nickname, with the dark blue and white striped uniform still worn today representing the blue water of Corio Bay and the white seagulls so frequent in the Bay. They were nicknamed the 'Cats' in 1923 after a run of losses prompted a local cartoonist to suggest that the club needed a black cat to bring it good luck. When one ran onto the ground in a match and Geelong won that match, breaking the losing streak, they decided that cats were indeed good luck.

Although being relatively strong performers throughout the 1980s and 1990s (Grand Final appearances in 1989, 1992, 1994 and 1995), the Cats have been unable to win a premiership since 1963. The club won the VFL/AFL premierships in: [[1925]], [[1931]], [[1937]], [[1951]], [[1952]] and [[1963]]. 

The current senior coach is Mark Thompson who is in his 7th year at the helm. The current captain is Steven King. The most recent Club Best and Fairest Winner (2005) was Joel Corey.

In 2004 the club made the finals for the first time in 4 years, finishing 4th. After this improvement 2005 looked to be a very promising year, but the team was plagued by injuries and inconsistent form and could only reach 5th spot. With a young but readily maturing list, the Cats will look to 2006 and again hope to be a genuine premiership contender.

Theme song: &quot;We are Geelong&quot; (sung to the tune of the ''Toreador's song'' from [[Carmen]]).

==Membership Base==
In 2005, the Geelong Football Club had 30,900 members, in excess of the [[seating capacity]] at Skilled Stadium, but less than the capacity of the Telstra Dome where some of the club's home matches are played.

Academically, and in scholastical classification, Gallurese is often considered a [[Sardinian language]] for two main reasons (that could be controversial):
#First of all, a ''geographical'' reason could not allow any different classification; oppositors however stress that the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] spoken in [[Alghero]] and the [[Tabarchino]] ([[Ligurian]]) spoken in the minor island of [[Sant'Antioco]] are not actually submitted to this rule.
#A genetical reason immediately follows the geographical one: undoubtedly (?), Gallurese has a common origin with the other languages of Sardinia, and it is very likely that any change, any development might have been built upon a common basic structure, and not on a different starting idiom.
This genetical reason links the Corsican languages and the Sardinian languages in a remote ''Romania africana'' : only the true Sardinian dialects are the heirs of this former unity.

But in the recent regional law (No. 26, 1997) voted by the Sardinian Parliament, the Gallurese (with the Sassarese) is not considered as a Sardinian language but in the same category as [[Catalan language]] of Alghero or [[Tabarchino]].

== Hypothesis on Gallurese's development ==

The occasions of contact between the idioms could be interesting, in order to know more about the genesis and the development of Gallurese. Before the [[Phoenician languages]], the presumed [[Paleosardinian]] language of the [[Nuragici people]] should have been evenly distributed over the island, but [[archaeological]] evidence of the language is only found at a few points on the island.

Phoenicians came and invaded the island, only two main areas remaining free from their control and their influence, the two traditionally independent areas of Sardinia: Gallura and [[Barbagia]]. Here the contact with surrounding areas was broken, supposedly. So there should locally remain the influences of [[Balari]] (a Sardinian people that came from [[Spain]]), probably with protoiberic influences. Then [[Rome]] came, and defeated Balari, therefore Rome was in Gallura too, as it was in Barbagia. Maybe it could be presumed that when the [[Latin|Latin language]] entered, only some part of the idiom was different, so the difference could have came later. 

The greatest difference could perhaps be born in the age of [[Giudicati]], it could be [[Pisa]], and the quality of the presence of Pisa to start separating the local speaking. Since the defeat of arab pirate Musetto, [[1000]]-[[1050]], Pisa was in the northern Giudicato with the sole &quot;disturb&quot; of [[Genoa]] (and the Doria family), then it would have remained there as the main dominator. As known, we know most of medieval [[sardinian history]] thanks to the Pisan ''liber fondachi'', the registry of paid [[tax]]es, which is so detailed to let us consider Pisan presence as a heavy influence. 

From this point perhaps the languages begin to part, along time producing what lets now underline that there is some [[Italian language]] and some [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] in Gallurese. But talking about Corsica, the mere institution of a common ''Regnum Sardiniae et Corsicae'' ([[1297]]), more a formal political act than a concrete creation of power at the beginning, does not allow to consider that particular relationships were established between the islands just as an effect of this institution, being the main action of [[Aragon]], at that time, the first conquer of Giudicati, mainly [[Arborea]], and it took quite a century or something more. Pisans remained in Sardinia for a while, as their [[Romanesque architecture]] and some of their idioms attest. 

It could be interesting to investigate if the Tuscan ingredients of Gallurese effectively came from this domination, because in this case, a Tuscan influence would have presumedly affected a Sardinian version, resulting in a modified Sardinian version (then it still could be a Sardinian version). It would consequently be classified as a Sardinian language for a genetical reason.

In this hypothesis we were considering Sardinian as if Corsican could modify it, but the contrary could be possible, as well, and there could also be a possible Sardinian influence on Corsican. It could also be that Corsican had been influenced by Sardinian. Or it could eventually be that they both were influenced by the same factors, received in their own territories separately and with different actions, finally producing not so distant results. External influences could consent this hypothesis: Sardinia had a wider population, and in its history has been more subject to foreign influences than Corsica. Invasions and taxes would probably have caused an eventual movement in the direction of the minor island, less probably the other way, even if the establishment of a few groups of Corsicans in Sardinia is known. Also, the little distance between Corsica and Tyrrhenic (tuscan) islands would let suppose more frequent practical contacts, while in Sardinia these contacts were more decisive on a point of local administration.

Contacts between the two islands were again intense in 17th century, when [[France]] entered in commercial relationship with Sardinia, provoking (not completely unintentionally) a certain [[contraband]] in the Bocche di Bonifacio (the narrow channel that divides the two islands); the need of using a common [[jargon]] on the coast is of evident relevance. Its diffusion however was not so wide, presumedly. 

Similarities do exist also with [[Maremma]], in southern Tuscany-northern [[Latium]], with which there were no relationships. All this would tend to suggest that a common evolution had interested the areas. Some authors like Maxia believe that, in analogy among themselves, all the coastal areas of [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] should have lived an evolutive moment perhaps at the same time. But the point is not obviously the similarity, because it would not be sufficient to a classification. Current central logudorese sardinian is not similar, in phonetics, to medieval logudorese sardinian (cfr. Pittau [http://web.tiscali.it/pittau/Sardo/silki.html]), although no one would ever deny that it is the same language. How much did it change, from what was it changing, what happened in Gallura and from what Gallurese started, are still unanswered questions, by now. 

A proposed proof of a common genetical root between Gallurese and Sardinian regards the turning to Italian language of both logudorese and gallurese people when they abandon their respective natural idioms: considering the relevant similarity in the use of their second language (Italian), it could be not immediately unfair to consider that the genetical root should be common, even if the &quot;musical&quot; result is different.

'''William Gary Busey''' (born [[June 29]], [[1944]] in [[Goose Creek, Texas|Goose Creek]], [[Texas]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[film]] [[actor]].

He began his show-business career as a [[drummer]] in [[The Rubber Band]]. He also starred in a local television comedy show called ''Mazeppa'' in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].

In film, Busey is often cast as a rebel. Many consider his most noteworthy role to be his portrayal of [[Buddy Holly]] in ''[[The Buddy Holly Story]]'', for which he received an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination. Among other roles, he also starred in the film adaptation of ''[[Stephen King]]'''s  ''[[Cycle of the Werewolf]]'', ''[[Silver Bullet]]'', and starred opposite ''[[Mel Gibson]]'' in ''[[Lethal Weapon]]''.

Busey attended [[Pittsburg State University]] in [[Pittsburg, Kansas|Pittsburg]], [[Kansas]], where he became interested in acting. He is listed as one of the university's &quot;outstanding alumni.&quot; He then transferred to [[Oklahoma State University - Stillwater|Oklahoma State University]], where he quit school one class short of graduation. Busey began his career in television guest roles. For example, he was the last person killed on the last episode of ''[[Gunsmoke]]''. 

On [[December 4]], [[1988]], Busey was severely injured in a [[motorcycle]] accident in which he was not wearing a helmet. His skull was fractured and doctors feared he suffered permanent [[brain damage]]. Busey made a remarkable recovery, however, and encouraged all cyclists to wear helmets. Busey had been a heavy drug user, and in [[1995]] almost died from a [[cocaine]] overdose. Only prompt medical attention saved his life; he narrowly escaped going to jail. Busey claimed that he suffered a terrifying near death experience in which he saw [[hell]] and [[Satan|the devil]]. He was so affected that he announced he had become a [[Born again|born-again Christian]]. He joined [[Promise Keepers]] and preached against drug abuse.

In [[1990]], Busey co-starred next to [[Danny Glover]] in ''[[Predator 2]]''. 

In the summer of [[2003]], Busey starred in the 13-episode [[reality TV|reality show]] ''[[I'm with Busey]]'' on [[Comedy Central]].

Busey resembles [[Nick Nolte]], an actor with whom he has sometimes been confused.

Busey is now also known to younger people for his [[cameo role|cameo appearance]] on ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Appearing in a police information video, Busey (as himself) explains [[restraining order]]s to the viewer, peppering his lecture with bouts of loud laughter at hilariously inappropriate moments. He even mocks himself, claiming that the reason he knows so much about restraining orders is because he has been the subject of twelve of them, his crime apparently &quot;being too real.&quot;

Somewhat unkindly, the &quot;Busey&quot; class in the school featured in the popular television comedy [[Malcolm In The Middle]] is a repository for dim, disruptive and mentally challenged children.

He is the father of actor [[Jake Busey]].

Busey appeared on a recent ([[July 19]],2005) episode of ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' promoting his fitness show (as the second guest), and amused the audience and primary guest [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[John McCain]] with an extended [[philosophy|philosophical]] explanation of his [[oxymoron]]ic phrase: &quot;hidden reality revealed.&quot;

He is also famous for his &quot;Buseyisms.&quot;  For example, the word &quot;sober&quot; becomes &quot;Son Of a Bitch Everything's Real,&quot; while &quot;doubt&quot; becomes &quot;Debating On Understanding Bewildering Thoughts.&quot; &quot;Romance&quot; becomes &quot;Relying On Magnificent And Necessary Compatible Energy.&quot;

Busey starred in the [[VH1]] show ''[[Celebrity Fit Club]] 2'', where he lost 39 pounds.

Most recently, Busey has taken a lead role in the controversial Turkish action film ''[[Valley of the Wolves]]''. He plays a Jewish doctor, conspiring with renegade American soldiers in occupied Iraq to steal the organs from slain or captured Iraqis and sell them on the black market. Among other things, the film in general and his role in particular has been criticized in American media outlets for being anti-semitic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:'''''Gry''' is also an obsolete unit of measurement, equal to 1/10 of a line, which is in turn 1/12 of an [[inch]]. Hence, a gry is 1/120 inch or about 0.212 [[metre|mm]].''

The '''-Gry Puzzle''' is a popular puzzle that asks for the third [[English Language|English]] word, other than &quot;angry&quot; and &quot;hungry,&quot; that ends with the letters &quot;gry.&quot; Aside from words derived from &quot;angry&quot; and &quot;hungry,&quot; there is no stand-alone word ending in &quot;gry&quot; that is in current usage. Both ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]] of the English Language, Unabridged'' (Merriam-Webster, Inc., 2002, ISBN 0877792011) and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]], Second Edition'' (Oxford University Press, 1989, ISBN 0198611862) contain the phrase &quot;aggry bead.&quot; To find a third word ending in &quot;gry&quot; that is not part of a phrase, you must turn to obsolete words or personal or place names. A
[[Gry#List of obsolete words, phrases, and names ending in gry|list of 130]]
of these is given at the end of this article.

So, basically, this puzzle has no good answer. Yet it has become the most frequently asked word puzzle. It is so common that it is a standing joke [http://listserv.dom.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind9910&amp;L=STUMPERS-L&amp;P=R39908&amp;m=98684] on the Stumpers reference librarian list server [http://domin.dom.edu/depts/gslis/stumpers/] that it's time to
change your car's oil when it is asked anew. The regular readers of the [[Usenet]] newsgroup rec.puzzles [http://rec-puzzles.org/new] coined the word &quot;nugry&quot; [http://groups.google.com/groups?q=gry+limerick&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;selm=638539%24bsv%241%40nntp.Stanford.EDU&amp;rnum=1] to describe a (presumably) new reader who posts a frequently asked question.

==History==

[[Merriam-Webster]], publishers of the leading American dictionaries, first heard of this puzzle in a [[Media:Lasker.pdf|letter]] dated [[March 17]], [[1975]], from Patricia Lasker of [[Brooklyn, New York]]. Lasker says her Plant Manager heard the question on a [[quiz show]]. Since that time Merriam-Webster has received about four letters per year asking the question.

This puzzle first appears in print in Anita Richterman's &quot;Problem Line&quot; column 
in ''Newsday'' on [[April 29]], [[1975]]. One &quot;M.Z.&quot; from Wantagh states that the problem was asked on a TV quiz program. Richterman states that she asked a learned professor of English for help when she first received the inquiry, and he did not respond for over a month. So the quiz show probably occurred in March.

In Anita Richterman's column on [[May 9]], [[1975]], several correspondents reported that they had heard the puzzle on the [[Bob Grant (radio)|Bob Grant]] radio talk show on [[WMCA]] in New York City. However, as this is not a TV quiz show, this may not be the origin of the puzzle, although it is also likely people were mistaken about the medium on which the show was broadcast. The majority of readers gave the answer &quot;gry,&quot; one of the obsolete words
[[Gry#List of obsolete words, phrases, and names ending in gry|listed]] at the end of this article. It is unclear whether this was the answer given on the Grant show.

Ralph G. Beaman in the &quot;Kickshaws&quot; column in [http://wordways.com ''Word Ways''] for February 1976 reports that the Delaware Valley was mystified during the Fall of 1975 by the question. By this time the puzzle seems to have mutated to a form in which the missing word is an adjective that describes the state of the world.

However, some people remember a different version of this puzzle dating it back before 1975. For example, someone named &quot;Rush Elkins&quot; emailed the editors of [http://yourdictionary.com/library/article008.html yourDictionary] with this report:

:''I first heard the &quot;gry&quot; riddle posed in slightly different form in 1969 or 1970. I was then in graduate school at University of Florida and in the habit of meeting with a group of friends every Wednesday evening for dinner, drinks, and conversation. One of those evenings, someone challenged the group to find three common English words containing the letter combination &quot;gry.&quot; I'm sure that there was no stipulation on the placement of &quot;gry&quot; because I recall someone suggesting that it might occur at the boundary of a compound word. (That turns out to lead nowhere.)''

:''A year or two later, I encountered the word &quot;gryphon&quot; in a book, had one of those aha! experiences, and presented my find at the next meeting as a sort of trophy. Although not exactly an everyday sort of word, &quot;gryphon&quot; appears in most dictionaries and is understood by most literate English readers.''

If these memories are accurate, then perhaps in 1975 a subtle flaw was introduced into an otherwise commonplace word puzzle. Instead of asking for three words that contain &quot;gry,&quot; the flawed version asks for three words that end in &quot;gry.&quot; Presumably the person who asked the question did
not know the answer and, in repeating the question, simply misstated it. Since the flawed version has no good answer, an explosion of searching followed.

==Alternate versions==

Some of the trick versions are enumerated below.

#This version only works when spoken: There are three words in English that end in &quot;gree.&quot; The first two are &quot;angry&quot; and &quot;hungry,&quot; and if you've listened closely, you'll agree that I've already told you the third one.
#*The answer is &quot;agree.&quot; 
#There are three words in the English language that end in the letters g-r-y. Two are &quot;hungry&quot; and &quot;angry.&quot; Everyone knows what the third word means, and everyone uses it every day. What is the third word?
#*The answer is &quot;energy.&quot; The riddle says that the word ends in the letters g-r-y; it says nothing about the order of the letters. 
#The [http://www.marilynvossavant.com &quot;Ask Marilyn&quot;] ([[Marilyn vos Savant]]) column in [http://parade.com/homepage.html Parade magazine] on [[March 9]] [[1997]] featured this spoken version: There are at least three words in the English language that end in g or y. One of them is &quot;hungry,&quot; and another one is &quot;angry.&quot; There is a third word, a short one, which you probably say every day. If you are listening carefully to everything I say, you just heard me say it three times. What is it?
#*The answer is &quot;say.&quot; This version depends upon the listener confusing the spoken word &quot;or&quot; and the spoken letter r.
#There are three words in the English language that end in &quot;gry.&quot; Two words that end in &quot;gry&quot; are &quot;hungry&quot; and &quot;angry.&quot; Everyone knows what the third word means, and everyone uses them every day. If you listened very carefully, I have already stated to you what the third word is. The three words that solve this riddle are...?
#*The answer is the three-word sentence &quot;I am hungry.&quot; This version asks for three words that end in &quot;gry,&quot; not three words each of which end in &quot;gry.&quot;
#This version is a play on the use-mention ambiguity exploited by other versions: I know two words that end in &quot;gry.&quot; Neither one is angry or hungry. What are they?
#*The answer is &quot;angry&quot; and &quot;hungry.&quot; Since these are words, they are not angry or hungry.
#Here is a version invented by Frank Rubin on [[December 4]] [[2003]]: Give me 3 English words, commonly spoken, ending in g-r-y.
#*There are many possible answers, such as &quot;Beg for mercy,&quot; or &quot;Bring your money.&quot;
#There are three words in the English language that end g-r-y. One is &quot;angry,&quot; another is &quot;hungry.&quot; The third word is something that &quot;everyone&quot; uses. If you have listened carefully, I have already told you what it is.
#*The answer is &quot;every,&quot; and the logic is as follows: There are three words, ending g, r and y. The first is &quot;fuming,&quot; ending in g and meaning angry. The second is &quot;eager,&quot; ending in r and meaning hungry. The third is &quot;every,&quot; ending in y and clearly something that the word &quot;everyone&quot; uses.

The remaining versions are a form of meta-puzzle, in the sense that they make no use of the actual letters &quot;gry&quot; themselves, which therefore are a [[red herring]]. The red herring only works because there is another puzzle that does use these letters (even though that puzzle has no good answer).

#On [[March 28]] [[1996]], one such version was broadcast on WHTZ in New York City during &quot;The Elvis Duran Afternoon Show.&quot; The person asking the question was a caller who worked in a beauty salon at a mall somewhere in NJ: Think of words ending in &quot;gry.&quot; Angry and hungry are two of them. There are only three words in &quot;the English language.&quot; What is the third word? The word is something that everyone uses everyday. If you have listened carefully, I have already told you what it is.
#*The answer to this version is &quot;language&quot; -- the third word in the phrase &quot;the English language.&quot; There are quotation marks needed to make this answer correct when the puzzle is printed, but they give away the trick.
#Angry and hungry are two words in the English language that end in &quot;gry.&quot; &quot;What&quot; is the third word. The word is something that everyone uses everyday. If you have listened carefully, I have already told you what it is.
#*The answer is &quot;what.&quot; But again, the quotation marks spoil the puzzle when it is printed.
#There are three words in the English language that end with &quot;gry.&quot; Two of these are &quot;angry&quot; and &quot;hungry.&quot; The third word is a very common word, and you use it often. If you have read what I have told you, you will see that I have given you the third word. What is the third word? Think very carefully.
#*The answer is &quot;three,&quot; the third word in the paragraph. The rest of the paragraph is a red herring.
#This version is usually stated with the word &quot;one&quot; capitalized, which is a hint at the solution: There are three words in the English language that end in &quot;gry.&quot; The first ONE is &quot;hungry,&quot; the second is &quot;angry,&quot; and the third everyONE uses everyday. If you have read this carefully I have given a clue.
#*The answer is supposedly &quot;one,&quot; which is the third &quot;one.&quot; Probably because this answer does not make much sense, this version has a variant which contains more instances of the capitalized word &quot;one.&quot; The idea is that the capitalized &quot;one&quot; is a hint for the letter a, which when prefixed to the sound &quot;gree&quot; yields the answer word &quot;agree.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Giosuè Carducci''' ([[July 27]], [[1835]] &amp;ndash; near [[Lucca]], [[February 16]], [[1907]]) was an Italian poet, one of Italy's greatest, and a teacher. He was very influential and was regarded as the unofficial [[national poet]] of modern [[Italy]].

He was born in [[Val di Castello]], a small town in the northwest corner of [[Tuscany]] near [[Pisa]]. His father, a doctor, was an advocate of the unification of Italy. Because of his politics, the family was forced to move several times during Giosuè's childhood, eventually settling for a few years in [[Florence]].

From the time he was in college, he was fascinated with the restrained style of Greek and Roman antiquity, and his mature work reflects a restrained classical style. He translated Book&amp;nbsp;9 of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' into Italian.

He received his Ph.D. in [[1856]] from the [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa]] and began teaching school. The following year, he published his first collection of poems, ''Rime''. These were difficult years for Carducci; his father died, and his brother committed suicide.

In 1859, he married Elvira Menicucci, and they had four children. He briefly taught Greek at a high school in Pistoia, and then was appointed Italian professor at the university in [[Bologna]]. He was a popular lecturer and a fierce critic of literature and society. His political views were consistently opposed to Christianity generally and the secular power of the Catholic Church in particular. 

“I know neither truth of God nor peace with the Vatican or any priests. They are the real and unaltering enemies of Italy.” he said in his later years.{{ref|nopeace}}

This anti-clerical revolutionary zeal is prominently showcased in his most famous poem, the deliberately blasphemous and provocative &quot;Inno a Satana&quot; (or &quot;Hymn to Satan&quot;.) The poem was composed in 1863 as a dinner party toast, published in 1865, then republished in 1869 by Bologna’s radical newspaper, ''Il Popolo'', as a provocation timed to coincide with the 20th Vatican Ecumenical Council, a time when revolutionary fervor directed against the papacy was running high as republicans pressed both politically and militarily for an end of the Vatican’s domination over the papal states.{{ref|Satana}} 

While &quot;Inno a Satana&quot; had quite a revolutionary impact, Carducci's finest poetry came in later years.  His collections ''Rime Nuove'' (“New Rhymes”) and ''Odi Barbare'' (“Barbaric Odes”) contain his greatest works.

He was the first Italian to win the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in [[1906]]. He was also elected a Senator of Italy. {{ref|Senate}}Although his reputation rests primarily on his poetry, he also produced a large body of prose works.  Indeed, his prose writings including literary criticism, biographies, speeches and essays filled some 20 volumes. {{ref|prose}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''In British English, &quot;geyser&quot; can also refer to the [[water heating]] system.''

[[Image:Clepsydra Geyser at Fountain Paint Pot in Yellowstone-750px.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Clepsydra Geyser in Yellowstone]]
A '''geyser''' is a type of [[hot spring]] that erupts periodically, ejecting a column of hot [[water]] and [[steam]] into the air.  The name ''geyser'' comes from ''[[Geysir]]'', the name of an erupting spring at [[Haukadalur]], [[Iceland]]; that name, in turn, comes from the [[Iceland|Icelandic]] verb ''gjósa'', &quot;to gush&quot;.

The formation of geysers requires a favourable [[hydrogeology]] which exists in only a few places on Earth, and so they are fairly rare phenomena. About 1000 exist worldwide, with about half of these in [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[USA]] ([[Glennon, J.A.]] 2005). Geyser eruptive activity may change or cease due to ongoing mineral deposition within the geyser plumbing, exchange of functions with nearby hot springs, earthquake influences, and human intervention (Bryan, T.S. 1995).

Erupting fountains of liquefied [[nitrogen]] have been observed on [[Neptune (planet)|Neptune]]'s moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]]. These phenomena are also often referred to as ''geysers''. On Triton, the geysers appear to be driven by solar heating instead of geothermal energy.  The [[nitrogen]], liquefied by a kind of [[greenhouse effect]], may erupt to heights of 8&amp;nbsp;km.

==Eruptions==
Geyser activity, like all [[hot spring]] activity, is caused by surface water gradually seeping down through the ground until it meets rock heated by [[magma]]. The [[geothermal (geology)|geothermal]]ly heated water then rises back toward the surface by [[convection]] through porous and fractured rock. Geysers differ from noneruptive hot springs in their subterranean structure; many consist of a small vent at the surface connected to one or more narrow tubes that lead to underground reservoirs of water.

[[Image:white dome geyser eruption.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Eruption of White Dome Geyser in Yellowstone]]
As the geyser fills, the water at the top of the column cools off, but because of the narrowness of the channel, convective cooling of the water in the reservoir is impossible.  The cooler water above presses down on the hotter water beneath, not unlike the lid of a [[pressure cooker]], allowing the water in the reservoir to become [[superheating|superheated]], i.e. to remain [[liquid]] at temperatures well above the [[boiling point]].

Ultimately, the temperatures near the bottom of the geyser rise to a point where boiling begins; steam bubbles rise to the top of the column. As they burst through the geyser's vent, some water overflows or splashes out, reducing the weight of the column and thus the pressure on the water underneath.  With this release of pressure, the superheated water flashes into [[steam]], boiling violently throughout the column. The resulting froth of expanding steam and hot water then sprays out of the geyser.

Eventually the water remaining in the geyser cools back to below the boiling point and the eruption ends; heated groundwater begins seeping back into the reservoir, and the whole cycle begins again. The duration of eruptions and time between successive eruptions vary greatly from geyser to geyser; [[Strokkur]] in Iceland erupts for a few seconds every few minutes, while [[Grand Geyser]] in the [[USA]] erupts for up to 10 minutes every 8-12 hours.

==Types of geyser==
[[Image:Vixen Geyser at Norris Geyser Basin in Yellowstone-750px.JPG|300px|thumb|right|Vixen Geyser in Yellowstone]]
There are two types of geyser; ''Fountain geysers'' erupt from pools of water, typically in a series of intense, even violent, bursts; and ''cone geysers'' which erupt from cones or mounds of siliceous sinter (also known as [[geyserite]]), usually in steady jets that last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. [[Old Faithful Geyser|Old Faithful]], perhaps the best-known geyser at Yellowstone National Park, is an example of a cone geyser.

The intense transient forces inside erupting geysers are the main reason for their rarity.  There are many volcanic areas in the world that have [[hot spring]]s, [[mud pot]]s and [[fumarole]]s, but very few with geysers. This is because in most places, even where other necessary conditions for geyser activity exist, the rock structure is loose, and eruptions will erode the channels and rapidly destroy any nascent geysers.

Most geysers form in places where there is volcanic [[rhyolite]] rock which dissolves in hot water and forms [[mineral]] deposits called siliceous sinter, or [[geyserite]], along the inside of the plumbing systems. Over time these deposits cement the rock together tightly, strengthening the channel walls and enabling the geyser to persist.

Geysers are fragile phenomena and if conditions change, they can 'die'. Many geysers have been destroyed by people throwing litter and debris into them; others have ceased to erupt due to dewatering by [[geothermal power]] plants. The [[Geysir|Great Geysir of Iceland]] has had periods of activity and dormancy. During its long dormant periods, eruptions were sometimes humanly-induced---often on special occasions---by the addition of [[surfactant]]s to the water. Inducing eruptions at Geysir is no longer done, as the forced eruptions were damaging the geyser's special plumbing system. Following an [[earthquake]] in [[Iceland]] in 2000 the geyser became somewhat more active again. Initially the geyser erupted about eight times a day. As of July 2003, Geysir erupts several times a week.


[[Image:Grand prismatic spring.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Hyperthermophiles produce some of the bright colors of [[Grand Prismatic Spring]], Yellowstone National Park]]
:''Main article: [[Thermophile]], [[Hyperthermophile]].''
The specific colours of geysers derive from the fact that despite the apparently harsh conditions, life is often found in them (and also in other hot [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]]) in the form of [[thermophiles|thermophilic]] [[prokaryote]]s. No known [[eukaryote]] can survive over 60 °C (140 °F).

In the 1960s, when the research of '''biology of geysers''' first appeared, scientists were generally convinced that no life can survive above around 73 °C (163 °F) - the upper limit for the survival of [[cyanobacteria]], as the structure of key cellular [[protein]]s and [[DNA|deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) would be destroyed. The optimal temperature for thermophilic bacteria was placed even lower, around 55 °C (131 °F). 

However, the observations proved that it actually is possible for life to exist at high temperatures and that some bacteria prefer even temperatures higher than boiling point of [[water (molecule)|water]]. Dozens of such bacteria are known nowadays. [[Thermophile]]s prefer temperatures from 50 to 70 °C whilst [[hyperthermophile]]s grow better at temperatures as high as 80 to 110 °C. As they have heat-stable enzymes that retain their activity even at high temperatures, they have been used as a source of thermostable [[tool]]s, that are important in [[medicine]] and [[biotechnology]], for example in manufacturing [[antibiotic]]s, [[plastic]]s, [[detergent]]s (by the use of heat-stable enzymes [[lipase]]s, [[pullulanase]]s and [[protease]]s), and fermentation products (for example [[ethanol]] is produced). The fact that such bacteria exist also stretches our imagination about life on other [[celestial body|celestial bodies]], both inside and outside of [[solar system]]. Among these, the first discovered and the most important for biotechnology is ''[[Thermus aquaticus]]''.

In Spanish, a cheetah is always ''un guepardo'' (masculine) and a zebra is always ''una cebra'' (feminine), regardless of their biological sex. If it becomes necessary to specify the sex of the animal, an adjective is added, as in ''un guepardo hembra'' (a female cheetah). Individualized names for the male and the female of a species are more frequent when they refer to common pets or farm animals. E.g., English ''horse'' and ''mare'', French ''chat'' (male cat) and ''chatte'' (female cat).

=== Personal names ===

Personal [[names]] often have characteristic culture-specific forms that identify the gender of the bearer. For example, in an English-speaking culture, ''John'' (masculine) and ''Joan'' or ''Jane'' (feminine) are gendered variants on the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] name of [[John the Evangelist]]. Again, this is natural gender, and not necessarily grammatical gender.

For [[Russian language|Russian]] gender-related tradition of personal naming, see [[Names in Russian Empire, Soviet Union and CIS countries]].


== Noun classes in specific linguistic families ==

&lt;!-- language families sorted alphabetically --&gt;

=== [[Algonquian languages]] ===

The [[Ojibwe language]] and other members of the [[Algonquian languages]] distinguish between animate and inanimate classes. Some sources argue that the distinction is between things which are powerful and things which are not. All living things, as well as sacred things and things connected to the Earth are considered powerful and belong to the &quot;animate&quot; class. Still, the assignment is somewhat arbitrary, as &quot;raspberry&quot; is animate, but &quot;strawberry&quot; is inanimate. 

=== [[Athabaskan languages]] ===

In [[Navajo language|Navajo]] ([[Southern Athabaskan]]) nouns are classified according to their animacy, shape, and consistency. [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphologically]], however, the distinctions are not expressed on the nouns themselves, but on the verbs of which the nouns are the subject or direct object. For example, in the sentence ''Shi’éé’ tsásk’eh bikáa’gi dah siłtsooz'' &quot;My shirt is lying on the bed&quot;, the verb ''siłtsooz'' &quot;lies&quot; is used because the subject ''shi’éé’'' &quot;my shirt&quot; is a flat, flexible object. In the sentence ''Siziiz tsásk’eh bikáa’gi dah silá'' &quot;My belt is lying on the bed&quot;, the verb ''silá'' &quot;lies&quot; is used because the subject ''siziiz'' &quot;my belt&quot; is a slender, flexible object. See [[Navajo language#Classificatory Verbs]] for more discussion.

[[Koyukon]] ([[Northern Athabaskan]]) has a more intricate system of classification. Like Navajo, it has classificatory verb stems that classify nouns according to animacy, shape, and consistency. However, in addition these verb stems, Koyukon verbs have what are called ''gender prefixes'' that further classify nouns. That is, Koyukon has two different systems that classify nouns: '''(a)''' a classificatory verb system and '''(b)''' a gender system. To illustrate, the verb stem ''-tonh'' is used for enclosed objects. When ''-tonh'' is combined with different gender prefixes, it can result in ''daaltonh'' which refers to objects enclosed in boxes or ''etltonh'' which refers to objects enclosed in bags.

=== [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] ===

The [[Dyirbal language]] is well known for its system of four noun classes, which tend to be divided along the following semantic lines:

* I &amp;mdash; animate objects, men
* II &amp;mdash; women, [[water]], [[fire]], [[violence]]
* III &amp;mdash; edible [[fruit]] and [[vegetable]]s
* IV &amp;mdash; miscellaneous (includes things not classifiable in the first three)

The class usually labeled &quot;feminine&quot;, for instance, includes the word for fire and nouns relating to fire, as well as all dangerous creatures and phenomena. This inspired the title of the [[George Lakoff]] book ''Women, Fire and Dangerous Things'' (ISBN 0226468046).

The [[Ngangikurrunggurr language]] has noun classes reserved for canines, and hunting weapons, and the [[Anindilyakwa language]] has a noun class for things that reflect light. The [[Diyari language]] distinguishes only between female and other objects. Perhaps the most noun classes in any Australian language are found in [[Yanyuwa language|Yanyuwa]], which has 16 noun classes.

=== [[Caucasian languages]] ===

Of the [[Caucasian languages]], some members of the [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]] family, and almost all of the [[Northeast Caucasian languages]], manifest noun class. In the Northeast Caucasian family, only [[Lezgi language|Lezgi]], [[Udi language|Udi]], and [[Aghul language|Aghul]] do not have noun classes. Some languages have only two classes, while the [[Bats language]] has eight. The most widespread system, however, has four classes: male, female, animate beings and certain objects, and finally a class for the remaining nouns. The [[Andi language]] has a noun class reserved for insects.

Among Northwest Caucasian languages, [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] shows a human male/human female/non-human distinction. [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]] shows some inflections along the same lines, but only in some instances, and in some of these instances inflection for noun class is not even obligatory.

In all Caucasian languages that manifest class, it is not marked on the noun itself but on the dependent verbs, adjectives, pronouns and prepositions.

An entire [http://www.beautyinchaos.com/sex website] has been devoted to exploring the possibilities of inanimate genders in Caucasian languages.

=== [[Indo-European languages]] ===

In Indo-European languages, genders typically include '''feminine''', '''masculine''' and '''neuter'''. [[Latin]] has these three, but in many of [[Romance languages|its modern descendants]], such as [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], the neuter gender has all but disappeared, though a few words, especially pronouns with no clear gender such as &quot;cela&quot; in French, have been assigned by some grammarians to a neuter gender.  In Spanish, there exists a &quot;neuter singular&quot; gender whose only nouns are adjectives used as abstract nouns. (''eg'' &quot;lo único&quot; = &quot;the only thing&quot;; &quot;lo mismo&quot; = &quot;the same thing&quot;). [[Romanian language|Romanian]] has preserved all three genders from [[Latin]], but the neuter gender is a combination of the other two, in the sense that neuter nouns in the singular behave like masculine nouns, while in the plural they behave like feminine nouns; as a consequence, adjectives, pronouns, and pronominal adjectives only have two forms, both in the singular and in the plural.

In other languages, feminine and masculine have merged into a '''common''' gender with a neuter gender, for example, in [[Danish language|Danish]].  [[English language|English]] generally exhibits gender only in third-person singular pronouns (as with '''he''', '''she''', and '''it'''), with the masculine and feminine genders used only for persons or higher animals, sometimes objects in colloquial speech as in 'Isn't she a beauty?'.  Other languages may group genders differently: [[Slavic languages]] further divide the masculine gender into '''animate''' and '''inanimate''' groups (the extent varies between individual languages, and some of them also apply the distinction in the feminine plural); The Spanish constructions for direct objects are different for humans and for objects, although its Latin-influenced grammar tradition doesn't usually count this as a noun class distinction; the [[Nostratic language]], a theoretical language that gave rise to the Indo-European languages and other language families, is believed by its proponents to have had '''human''', '''animal''', and '''object''' as grammatical genders.

In common nouns, grammatical gender is usually only peripherally related to sex. For example, in Spanish, the word '''hijo''' (son) is masculine and '''hija''' (daughter) is feminine, as one might expect.  This is called '''[[natural gender]]''', or sometimes '''logical gender'''.  Other times, there are elaborate (and mostly incomplete) rules to define the gender of a word.  For example, in [[German language|German]], nouns ending in '''-ung''' (corresponding to '''-ing''' in English) are feminine, and car brand names are masculine.  Words with the '''-lein''' and '''-chen''' ending (meaning little, young) are neuter, thus the grammatical genders of '''Mädchen''' (girl) and '''Fräulein''' (young woman) are neuter. In some local dialects of German, all nouns for female persons have been shifted to the neuter gender, but the female gender remains for some words denoting objects. All this is language-specific. In Latin, the word ''Sol'' (Sun) was masculine and the word ''Luna'' (Moon) was feminine (as in French, Spanish, Italian), but in German (and Germanic languages in general), the opposite occurs. The learner of a language thus must regard the gender as part of the noun, and memorize accordingly to use the language correctly.  A frequent recommendation is to memorize the definite article and the noun as a unit.

In Indo-European languages that assign genders to all nouns, the genders often correspond roughly to [[declension]]s that govern the way the nouns are inflected.  In Latin, for example, almost all of the ''-a'' stem nouns of the first declension are feminine; the main exceptions are a handful of nouns that identify typically male roles like ''nauta'', &quot;sailor,&quot; ''agricola'', &quot;farmer,&quot; and ''poeta'', &quot;poet&quot;. Likewise, almost all of the ''-o'' stem nouns of the second declension that end in ''-us'' in the [[nominative]] [[noun case|case]] are masculine; those ending in ''-um'' are neuter.  Names of places and trees are feminine though, like ''ulmus'', &quot;elm,&quot; or ''Ægyptus'', &quot;Egypt.&quot;  Most other Indo-European languages that have retained declensional systems have similar rules.

=== [[Niger-Congo languages]] ===

==== [[Bantu languages]] ====

According to [[Carl Meinhof]], the [[Bantu languages]] have a total of 22 [[noun class|noun classes]]. While no single language is known to express all of them, all of them have at least 10 noun classes. For example, by Meinhof's numbering, [[Swahili language#Noun classes|Swahili]] has 15 classes, and [[Sesotho language#Noun prefix system|Sesotho]] has 18. However, Meinhof's numbering system counts singular and plural numbers of the same noun as belonging to separate classes (see [[Sesotho language]] for examples). This is inconsistent with the way other languages are traditionally considered, where number is orthogonal to gender (a Meinhof-style analysis would give [[Ancient Greek]] 9 genders!). If one follows broader linguistic tradition and counts singular and plural as belonging to the same class, then Swahili has 8 or 9 noun classes and Sesotho has 11.

Often, certain noun classes are reserved for humans. The [[Fula language]] has a noun class reserved for liquids.  According to [[Steven Pinker]], the [[Kivunjo language]] has 16 genders including classes for precise locations and for general locales, classes for clusters or pairs of objects and classes for the objects that come in pairs or clusters, and classes for abstract qualities.

==== [[Zande language|Zande]] ====

The Zande language distinguishes four noun classes:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Criterion&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Example&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Translation&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;human male&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;kumba&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;man&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;human female&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;dia&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;wife&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;animate&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;nya&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;beast&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;other&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;bambu&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;house&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

There are about 80 inanimate nouns which are in the animate class, including nouns denoting heavenly objects (moon, rainbow), metal objects (hammer, ring), edible plants (sweet potato, pea), and non-metallic objects (whistle, ball). Many of the exceptions have a round shape, and some can be explained by the role they play in Zande mythology.

==== Other ====

The [[Alamblak language]], a [[Sepik Hill]] language spoken in [[Papua New Guinea]], has a &quot;masculine&quot; noun class, which includes males, as well as things which are tall or long and slender, or narrow such as fish, crocodile, long snakes, arrows, spears and tall slender trees, and a &quot;feminine&quot; noun class, which includes females, as well as things which are short, squat or wide, such as turtles, frogs, houses, fighting shields and trees that are typically more round and squat than others.

{{Gay rights}}
The '''gay rights movement''', also called the '''LGBT rights movement''', is a [[social movement|social]] and [[political movement]] with the goal of achieving [[Social equality|equality]] for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]] and [[transgender]]ed ([[LGBT]]) persons.

:''For the gay rights situation in specific countries, see [[:Category:Gay rights by country|Gay rights by country]].''

== The movement today ==

The [[gay]] rights social movement comprises a collection of loosely aligned [[civil rights]] groups, [[human rights]] groups, support groups and [[political activist]]s seeking acceptance, [[tolerance]] and [[social equality|equality]] for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[transgender]] people, and related causes. Although it is typically referred to as the ''gay'' rights movement, members also promote the [[rights]] of groups of individuals who do not necessarily identify as being gay - see the article [[Homosexuality and Transgender]].

These views are considered controversial by some, and the [[gay]] rights movement is opposed by a variety of individuals and groups including some religious and political (traditionally  style=&quot;font-size:24px&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; | &amp;#2624;

Dotted circles represent the bearer consonant.  Vowels are always pronounced after the consonant they are attached to. Thus, Sihari is always written to the left, but pronounced after the character on the right.

== Halant ==

The Halant (&amp;#2637;) character is not used when writing Punjabi in Gurmukhi. However, it may occasionally be used in Sanskritised text or in dictionaries for extra phonetic information. When it is used, it represents the suppression of the inherent vowel.

The affect of this is shown below:

:&amp;#2581; – Ka

:&amp;#2581;&amp;#2637; – K

== Numerals ==

Gurmukhi has its own set of numerals that behave exactly as [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]] do. These are used extensively in older texts. In modern contexts, they are being replaced by standard Latin numerals although they are still in widespread use.

:0 - &amp;#2662;

:1 - &amp;#2663;

:2 - &amp;#2664;

:3 - &amp;#2665;

:4 - &amp;#2666;

:5 - &amp;#2667;

:6 - &amp;#2668;

:7 - &amp;#2669;

:8 - &amp;#2670;

:9 - &amp;#2671;

== Other Signs ==

Bindi (&amp;#2562;) and Tippi (&amp;#2672;) are used for [[nasalisation]] (similar to the ‘n’ sound in words ending in ‘ing’). In general, Onkar (&amp;#2625;) and Dulankar (&amp;#2626;) take Bindi in their initial forms and Tippi when used after a consonant. All other short vowels take Tippi and all other long vowels take Bindi. Older texts may not follow these conventions.

The use of Addak (&amp;#2673;) indicates that the following consonant is [[geminate]]. This means that the subsequent consonant is doubled or reinforced.

== Visarg ==
The Visarg symbol (&amp;#2563;) is used very occasionally in Gurmukhi. It can either represent an abbreviation (like period is used in English) or it can act like a [[Sanskrit]] [[Visarga]] where a voiceless ‘h’ sound is pronounced after the vowel.

== Ek Onkar ==

[[Ek Onkar]] (&amp;#2676;) is a Gurmukhi symbol that is often used in [[Sikh]] literature. It literally means ‘one God’.

== Gurmukhi in Unicode ==

The [[Unicode]] range for Gurmukhi is U+0A00 to U+0A7F.  Using Unicode for Gurmukhi has only recently started to become widespread.  Many sites still use proprietary fonts that convert Latin ASCII codes to Gurmukhi [[glyph|glyphs]].

:'''''Geneva College''' was the original name of [[Hobart College]]. 

'''Geneva College''' is a small, private, liberal arts college located in the [[Pittsburgh]] suburb of [[Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania]]. Founded in [[1848]] in [[Northwood, Ohio]], by the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America]], Geneva was named after the Swiss center of the Reformed faith movement. In [[1880]], the College moved to Beaver Falls and built a campus on land donated by the [[Harmony Society]].

Geneva offers undergradate degree programs in the arts and sciences, and masters degree programs in Counseling, Higher Education, Business Administration, Organizational Leadership, and Special Education.

The school's sports teams are called the Golden Tornadoes.  Except for the [[college football|football]] team, the teams participate in the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] and the [[American Mideast Conference]].  The football team participates in the [[Mid-States Football Association]].  In 2005, Geneva began participating in the [[Presidents' Athletic Conference]] of [[NCAA]] Division III as a provisional member.  Geneva is expected to become a full member in [[2011]].

Geneva College bills itself the &quot;Birthplace of College Basketball.&quot;  The first recorded basketball game involving a college team occurred at Geneva College on [[April 8]], [[1893]] when the Geneva College Covenanters defeated the [[New Brighton, Pennsylvania|New Brighton]] [[YMCA]].

Greater Poland (Wielkopolska) was the core of the early medieval Polish state, often called ''the cradle of Poland'', and at times was called simply ''Poland'' (Latin: ''Polonia''). The name of Greater Poland is mentioned first in the Latin form ''Polonia Maior'' in [[1257]], and in Polish form ''w Wielkej Polszcze'' in [[1449]]. The name of the region can be understood as ''Old Poland'', as opposed to ''New Poland'' ([[Lesser Poland]], Małopolska, Polonia Minor, a region in south-eastern Poland with [[Kraków]] as its capital) and in opposition to the whole [[Poland]] as a state and country. In its wide meaning, Greater Poland consists of all of the [[Greater Poland Voivodship]] and parts of the [[Lubusz Voivodship]], the [[Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodship]] and the [[Łódź Voivodship]].

==Geography==
Greater Poland consists of two major geographic regions: the lake district, full of post-glacial lakes and hills in the north, and the rather flat plain in the south.

'''Gorillaz''' is a [[virtual band]], comprised of four fictional animated band members: 2D, Murdoc, fabian stockwin, Noodle and Russel. They play a variety of music styles – to quote one of their lyrics, they have recorded everything from &quot;Rap, Hip-Hop, Punk, Ska, to Heavy Metal&quot;. The band was created by [[Damon Albarn]] from the Britpop band [[Blur]], and [[Jamie Hewlett]], the creator of the comic book ''[[Tank Girl]]''.

The band's first album, 2001's ''[[Gorillaz (album)|Gorillaz]]'', sold over 3 million copies and earned them an entry in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' as the Most Successful Virtual Band[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=57561]. Their second studio album, ''[[Demon Days]]'', released was in 2005 and included the hit singles &quot;[[Feel Good Inc.]]&quot;, &quot;[[Dirty Harry (song)|Dirty Harry]]&quot; and &quot;[[Dare (song)|Dare]]&quot;.

==History==
===Formation===
[[Image:Gorilla2wh.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Hewlett's artwork in their early career was more detailed than the artwork that would come during the band's fame.]]

The people behind Gorillaz, [[Damon Albarn]] and [[Jamie Hewlett]], formed in April 1998.{{fact}} They originally identified themselves under the name &quot;Gorilla,&quot; and first song they recorded was &quot;Ghost Train&quot; (1998), later released as a [[B-side]] on their single &quot;[[Rock the House]]&quot; and &quot;[[G-Sides]]&quot;.

===Phase One: Celebrity Take Down===
The band's first release was the [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Tomorrow Comes Today]]'', released in 2000. It was very well received in the [[UK]] underground music scene and generated a lot of [[Word of mouth|word-of-mouth]] advertising, as well as a large shroud of mystery over who was behind Gorillaz and what could be expected from the band in the months to come. Promo outlets circulated a promotional booklet to promote the backstory behind the band.

The band's official website, [http://www.gorillaz.com/ www.gorillaz.com], was a virtual representation of Kong Studios, the band's fictional studio and home. Inside, you could browse through each member's bedroom, their recording environment and even the hallways and bathrooms. Each room also had bonus surprises and games to play: for example, the lobby had a remix machine, the cafeteria contained the [[message board]] on the wall and [http://www.murdocswinnebago.com/ Murdoc's Winnebago] (accessible only by using the [[Enhanced CD|enhanced section]] of the [[Gorillaz (album)|Gorillaz]] album) contained a voodoo doll of 2D. Each member also had his or her own computer which contained pictures, samples used in various Gorillaz songs, their favorite websites and their e-mail inboxes. Because of the nature of the site, an official fansite, [http://fans.gorillaz.com/ fans.gorillaz.com], was created to hold the standard band website information, including news, a discography and the band's touring schedules.

The band's first [[Single (music)|single]], &quot;[[Clint Eastwood (song)|Clint Eastwood]]&quot;, was released on [[March 5]] [[2001]]. It became a smash hit and put Gorillaz into the global spotlight. Due to this, the fictional band members' [[Hotmail]] accounts were abandoned (and later hacked) and the inboxes on the site were never updated. Later that same month, their first full-length album, the [[self-titled]] ''[[Gorillaz (album)|Gorillaz]]'' was released, producing four singles: &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;, &quot;[[19-2000]]&quot;, &quot;[[Tomorrow Comes Today (single)|Tomorrow Comes Today]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Rock the House]]&quot;.

Each of the singles' videos contained humorous and often ridiculous storylines and imagery, though &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; and &quot;19-2000&quot; were the only singles to break through the [[United States|American]] music scene. &quot;19-2000&quot; became popular after being featured in both an [[Icebreaker (disambiguation)|Icebreakers]] commercial, as well as in EA Sports' FIFA 2001.  Also the trumpets from the song &quot;Rock the House&quot; can be heard in various MTV shows. The only time the video for &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot; was played in the States was when [[Toonami]] broadcast a &quot;Midnight Run&quot; special where they played animated music videos from Gorillaz, [[Daft Punk]], and [[Kenna]].

* Historically, the consonants ב ''bet'', ג ''gimel'', ד ''dalet'', כ ''kaf'', פ ''pe'', and ת ''tav'' each had two sounds: one hard ([[plosive consonant]]), and one soft ([[fricative consonant]]), depending on the position of the letter and other factors.  When vowel diacritics are used, the hard sounds are indicated by a central dot called ''[[dagesh]]'' (דגש), while the soft sounds lack a ''dagesh''.  In [[masoretic]] manuscripts, the soft fricative consonants are indicated by a small line on top of the letter; this diacritical mark is called ''raphe'' (רפה), but its use has been largely discontinued in printed texts.
* א ''alef'', ה ''he'', ו ''vav'' and י ''yod'' are consonants that can sometimes fill the position of a vowel. ''vav'' and ''yod'' in particular are more often vowels than they are consonants.
* ש ''shin'' and ''sin'' are two separate [[phoneme|phonemes]] written with the same letter. They are not mutually [[allophony|allophonic]].  When vowel diacritics are used, the two phonemes are differentiated with a ''shin-dot'' or ''sin-dot''; the shin-dot is above the upper-right side of the letter, and sin-dot is above the upper-left side of the letter.
* In [[Israel]]'s general population, many consonants have merged to the same pronunciation.  They are:
** א ''alef'' with ''ayin'' and (varyingly) ה ''he''
** ב ''bet'' (without ''dagesh'') with ו ''vav''
** ח ''het'' with כ ''kaf'' (without ''dagesh'')
** ט ''tet'' with ת ''tav'' (both with and without dagesh)
** כ ''kaf'' (with ''dagesh'') with ק ''qof''
** ס ''samekh'' with שׂ ''sin'' (but not with שׁ ''shin'')
** צ ''tsadi'' with the consonant cluster תס ''tav-samekh''

===Vowel formation===

Some of the letters, as well as their consonantal function, also acted as ''matres lectionis'' to represent vowels, as follows:

===Ancient Hebrew===

Some of the variations in sound mentioned above are due to a systematic feature of [[Ancient Hebrew]]. The six consonants /p t k b d g/ were pronounced differently depending on their position. These letters were also called BeGeDKePHeT ([[IPA chart for English|pronounced]] {{IPA|/beɪgɛd'kɛfɛt/}}) letters.  (The full details are very complex; this summary omits some points.) They were pronounced as stops [p t k b d g] at the beginning of a syllable, or when doubled. They were pronounced as [[fricative]]s {{unicode|[p̄ ṯ ḵ ḇ ḏ ḡ]}} &amp;mdash; [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|[f θ x v ð ɣ]}} when preceded by a vowel. The stop and double pronunciations were indicated by the ''dagesh''. In Modern Hebrew the sounds {{unicode|[ḏ]}} and {{unicode|[ḡ]}} have reverted to [d] and [g] respectively, and {{unicode|[ṯ]}} has become [t], so only the remaining three consonants /b k p/ show variation.

ו ''vav'' was a semivowel /w/ (as in English, not as in German).

ח ''het'' and ע ''ayin'' were [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] [[fricative consonant|fricatives]], צ ''tsadi'' was an [[emphatic consonant|emphatic]] /s/, ט ''tet'' was an emphatic /t/, and ק ''qof'' was /q/. All these are common [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[consonant]]s.

שׂ ''sin'' (the /s/ variant of ש ''shin'') was originally different from both שׁ shin and ס ''samekh'', but had become /s/ the same as ס ''samekh'' by the time the vowel pointing was devised.  Because of [[cognate]]s with other [[Semitic language]]s, this phoneme is known to have originally been a [[lateral consonant]], most likely [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] the [[fricative]] {{IPA|/ɬ/}} (as in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''ll'') or the [[affricate]] {{IPA|/tɬ/}} (as in [[Náhuatl]] ''tl'').

==History==

[[Archaeology|Archeological]] evidence indicates that the original Hebrew script is related to the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician script]] that was in wide use in the [[Middle East]] region at the end of the [[2nd millennium BCE]].  (Eventually, in [[Europe]], this alphabet evolved  into the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Roman alphabet|Roman]] alphabets). Phoenician script was borrowed by the [[Hebrews]] during the [[12th century BCE|12th]] or [[11th century BCE]], and around the [[9th century BCE]], a distinct Hebrew variant, the original &quot;Hebrew script&quot;, emerged. This script was widely used in the ancient kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Israel|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] until they fell in the [[8th century BCE|8th]] and [[6th century BCE|6th]] centuries BCE, respectively.

Following the [[Babylonian captivity of Judah|Babylonian exile]], [[Jew|Jews]] gradually stopped using the Hebrew script, and instead adopted the [[Babylon|Babylonian]] [[Aramaic script]] (which was also originally derived from the Phoenician script). This script, used for writing Hebrew, later evolved into the Jewish, or &quot;square&quot; script, that is still used today. &quot;Square&quot;-related scripts were in use all over the Middle East for several hundred years, but following the rise of [[Christianity]] (and later, the rise of [[Islam]]), they gave way to the [[Roman alphabet|Roman]] and [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] alphabets, respectively. According to traditional [[Judaism|Jewish]] thought, the Hebrew writing system contained all the current letters at the time of [[Moses]], although [[Ezra]] is known for his contribution to the square form. 

Following the decline of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]] as the spoken languages of the Jews, the Hebrew alphabet was adopted in order to write down the languages of the Jewish diaspora ([[Karaim language|Karaim]], [[Judeo-Arabic language|Judæo-Arabic]], [[Ladino language|Ladino]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], etc.). The Hebrew alphabet was retained as the alphabet used for writing down the [[Hebrew language]] during its rebirth in the end of the [[19th century]], despite several unsuccessful attempts to replace it with the Latin alphabet.

'''Horatio Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford''', more commonly known as '''Horace Walpole''', ([[September 24]], [[1717]] &amp;ndash; [[March 2]], [[1797]]), was a politician, writer, architectural innovator and namesake of his cousin [[Horatio Nelson]].

He was born in [[London]], the youngest son of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Robert Walpole]]. He was educated at [[Eton College]] and [[King's College, Cambridge]].  His homosexual preference revealed itself early, and he is believed to have had affairs with the poet [[Thomas Gray]], and with [[Henry Fiennes Pelham-Clinton, 2nd Duke of Newcastle|Henry Fiennes Clinton, 9th Earl of Lincoln]] (later 2nd [[Duke of Newcastle]]). Gray accompanied Walpole on the [[Grand Tour]], but they quarrelled, and Walpole returned to England in [[1741]] and entered parliament.  He was never politically ambitious, but remained an MP even after the death of his father in [[1745]] left him a man of independent means.

Following his father's politics, he was a devotee of King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] and Queen [[Caroline of Ansbach|Caroline]], siding with them against their son, [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]], about whom Walpole wrote spitefully in his memoirs. Walpole's home, [[Strawberry Hill, London|Strawberry Hill]], near [[Twickenham]], was a fanciful concoction of neo-Gothic which began a new architectural trend.  In [[1764]], he published his [[Gothic novel]], ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'', setting a literary trend to go with the architecture.  From [[1762]] on, he published his ''Anecdotes of Painting in England'', based on [[George Vertue]]'s manuscript notes. His memoirs of the Georgian social and political scene, though heavily biased, are a useful primary source for historians.  He also coined the term [[Serendipity]].

His father was created [[Earl of Orford]] in 1742. Horace's elder brother, [[Robert Walpole, 2nd Earl of Orford]] (c.1701-1751), passed the title on to his son [[George Walpole, 3rd Earl of Orford]] (1730-1791). When George died unmarried, Horace Walpole became the 4th Earl of Orford. When Horace Walpole died in 1797 the title became extinct. It was recreated in 1806 for Horace's cousin [[Horatio Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford]] (1723-1809). The great-grandson of the first earl of this creation, [[Horatio William Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford|Horatio William Walpole]] (1813-1894), became the 4th Earl of Orford of the 1806 creation. The 1806 creation became extinct on the death of [[Robert Horace Walpole, 5th Earl of Orford]] (1854-1931). Descendants of a younger brother of the 1st Earl of the 1806 creation have inherited older baronies, including one once held by Horace.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Horace Engdahl''' (born [[December 30]], [[1948]]) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] literary historian and critic. He has been the permanent secretary of the [[Swedish Academy]] since 1999.

Engdahl was born in [[Karlskrona]], Sweden. He earned his B.A. in 1970 at [[Stockholm University]], and began his doctoral studies there; he completed his Ph.D. only in 1987, with a study on Swedish [[romanticism]], but had meanwhile been active as a literary critic, translator and journal editor, and was one of the introducers of the continental tradition of literary scholarship in Sweden. He is currently adjunct professor of Scandinavian literature at the [[University of Aarhus]] in [[Denmark]]. He speaks [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] fluently.

In 1997, Engdahl became a member of the [[Swedish Academy]], elected to the seat vacated by the death of [[Johannes Edfelt]]; in [[1999]], he succeeded [[Sture Allén]] as the Academy's permanent secretary, i.e. its executive member and spokesperson. As such, he has the annual task of announcing the recipient of the [[Nobel prize in literature]] to the press.

He is married to [[Ebba Witt-Brattström]], professor of literature at the [[Södertörn University College]] outside [[Stockholm]]. Together they have the sons Caspar, Marcel and Fabius.

'''Hebrew''' (עִבְרִית ''‘Ivrit'') is a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]] of the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic language family]] spoken by more than 7 million people, mainly in [[Israel]], the [[West Bank]], the [[United States]] and by [[Jews|Jewish]] communities around the world. The core of the [[Tanakh]] (sometimes referred to as the [[Hebrew Bible]]), the [[Torah]] (which [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] traditionally hold to have been first recorded in the time of [[Moses]] 3,300 years ago), is written in (Biblical) [[Classical Hebrew]]. [[Jew]]s have always called it {{Ivrit|&amp;#1500;&amp;#1513;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1503; &amp;#1492;&amp;#1511;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1491;&amp;#1513;}} ''Leshon ha-Kodesh'' (&quot;The Sacred Language&quot;) as the scriptures written in this language were considered sacred. Most scholars agree that after the first destruction of [[Jerusalem]] by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] and the [[Babylon]]ians in [[586 BCE]], the kind of Hebrew prevalent in the [[Tanakh]] was replaced in daily use by [[Mishnaic]] Hebrew and a local version of [[Aramaic]]. After the depletion of the Jewish population of parts of [[Iudaea Province|Roman occupied Judea]], it is believed that Hebrew gradually ceased to be a spoken language roughly around [[200|200 CE]], but remained a major written language throughout the centuries. Not only religious, but texts for a large variety of purposes: letters and contracts, science, philosophy, medicine, poetry, protocols of courts&amp;mdash;all resorted to Hebrew, which thus adapted itself to various new fields and terminologies by borrowings and new inventions. 

Hebrew was revitalized as a spoken language during the late 19th and early [[20th century]] as Modern Hebrew, replacing a score of languages spoken by the Jews at that time, such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Ladino language|Ladino]] (also called Judezmo), [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and other languages of the [[Jewish diaspora]] as the spoken language of the majority of the [[Jewish]] people living in [[Israel]].

Because of its large disuse for centuries, Hebrew lacked many modern words. Several were adapted from the Hebrew Bible or from other languages by [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]]. Largely because of this, modern Hebrew became an official language in British-ruled Palestine in 1921, and the primary official language of [[Israel |the State of Israel]], (Arabic maintained its official language status). The Hebrew name for the language is {{Ivrit|&amp;#1506;&amp;#1489;&amp;#1512;&amp;#1497;&amp;#1514;}}, or ''‘Ivrit'' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/iv&amp;#690;rit/}})

==History==
While the term &quot;Hebrew&quot; as a nationality is customarily used to refer to the ancient [[Israelite]]s, the classical Hebrew language was extremely similar to the [[Canaanite languages]] spoken by their neighbors, such as [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]; indeed, [[Moabite language|Moabite]] and Hebrew are often considered to be two dialects of the same language.

Hebrew strongly resembles [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and to a lesser extent South-Central [[Arabic language|Arabic]], sharing many linguistic features with them.

===Early history===
Hebrew is an Afro-Asiatic language. This language family is generally thought by linguists to have originated somewhere in northeastern [[Africa]], and began to diverge around the [[8th millennium BCE]], although there is much debate about the exact date and place. (The theory is espoused by most archeologists and linguists, but at odds with traditional reading of the Torah.)  One branch of this family, [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], eventually reached the [[Middle East]]; it gradually differentiated into a variety of related languages.

By the end of the [[3rd millennium BCE]] the ancestral languages of [[Aramaic]], [[Ugaritic]], and other various [[Canaanite]] languages were spoken in the [[Levant]] alongside the influential dialects of [[Ebla]] and [[Akkad]]. As the Hebrew founders from northern [[Harran|Haran]] filtered south into and came under the influence of the Levant, like many sojourners into Canaan including the [[Philistines]], they adopted Canaanite dialects. The first written evidence of distinctive Hebrew, the [[Gezer calendar]], dates back to the [[10th century BCE]], the traditional time of the reign of [[David]] and [[Solomon]]. It presents a list of seasons and related agricultural activities. The [[Gezer]] calendar (named after the city in whose proximity it was found) is written in an old Semitic script, akin to the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] one that through the [[ancient Greece|Greek]]s and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]]s later became the [[Roman script]]. The Gezer calendar is written without any vowels, and it does not use consonants to imply vowels even in the places where more modern spelling requires it (see below).

[[Image:Silwan-inscr.jpg|left|300px|thumb|The [[Shebna]] lintel, from the tomb of a royal steward found in [[Siloam]], dates to the 7th century BCE.]]
Numerous older tablets have been found in the region with similar scripts written in other Semitic languages, for example [[Protosinaitic]]. It is believed that the original shapes of the script go back to the hieroglyphs of the Egyptian writing, though the phonetic values are instead inspired by the [[acrophonic]] principle. The common ancestor of Hebrew and Phoenician is called [[Canaanite]], and was the first to use a Semitic alphabet distinct from Egyptian. One ancient document is the famous [[Moabite Stone]] written in the Moabite dialect; the [[Siloam Inscription]], found near [[Jerusalem]], is an early example of Hebrew. Less ancient samples of Old Hebrew include the [[ostracon | ostraka]] found near [[Lachish]] which describe events preceding the final capture of Jerusalem by [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadnezzar]] and the Babylonian captivity of [[586 BCE]].

The most famous work originally written in Hebrew is the [[Tanakh]], though the time at which it was written is a matter of dispute (see [[dating the Bible]] for details). The earliest extant copies were found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], written between the [[2nd century BCE]] and the [[1st century]] CE.

The formal language of the latter [[Babylonia|Babylonian Empire]] was Aramaic (its name is either derived from &quot;Aram Naharayim&quot;, Upper Mesopotamia, or from &quot;Aram,&quot; the ancient name for Syria). The [[Persian Empire]], which had captured Babylonia a few decades later under Cyrus, adopted Aramaic as the official language. [[Aramaic]] is also a North-West Semitic language, quite similar to Hebrew. Aramaic has contributed many words and expressions to Hebrew, mainly as the language of commentary in the [[Talmud]] and other religious works.

In addition to numerous words and expressions, Hebrew also borrowed the [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic writing system]]. Although the original Aramaic letter forms were derived from the same Phoenician alphabet that was used in ancient Israel, they had changed significantly, both in the hands of the Mesopotamians and of the Jews, assuming the forms familiar to us today around the [[1st century|first century]] CE. Writings of that era (most notably, some of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] found in [[Qumran]]) are written in a script very similar to the &quot;square&quot; one still used today.

===Later history===
The Jews living in the Persian Empire adopted Aramaic, and Hebrew quickly fell into disuse. It was preserved, however, as the literary language of Bible study. Aramaic became the vernacular language of the renewed Judaea for the following 700 years. Famous works written in Aramaic include the [[Targum]], the [[Talmud]] and several of [[Flavius Josephus]]' books (several of the latter were not preserved, however, in the original.) Following the [[Destruction of Jerusalem|destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple]] in [[70]] CE, the Jews gradually began to disperse from Judaea into foreign countries (this dispersion was hastened when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem (and turned it into a pagan city named ''Aelia Capitolina'') in 135 CE after putting down [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]].) For many hundreds of years Aramaic remained the spoken language of Mesopotamian Jews, and [[Lishana Deni]], one of several [[Judæo-Aramaic language]]s, is a modern descendant that is still spoken by a few thousand Jews (and many non-Jews) from the area known as [[Kurdistan]]; however, it gradually gave way to Arabic, as it had given way to other local languages in the countries to which the Jews had gone.

Hebrew was not used as a mother tongue for roughly 1800 years. However the Jews have always devoted much effort to maintaining high standards of literacy among themselves, the main purpose being to let any Jew read the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] and the accompanying religious works in the original (see [[rabbinic literature]], [[Halakha#Codes of Jewish law | Codes of Jewish law]], [[Judaism#The Traditional Jewish Bookshelf | The Jewish Bookshelf]]). It is interesting to note that the languages that the Jews assimilated from their adopted nations, namely [[Ladino language|Ladino]] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], were not directly connected to Hebrew (the former being based on Spanish and Arabic borrowings, and the latter being a remote dialect of [[Middle High German]]), however, both were written from right to left using the Hebrew script and incorporated many Hebrew words. Hebrew was also used as a language of communication among Jews from different countries, particularly for the purpose of international trade.

The most important contribution to preserving traditional Hebrew pronunciation in this period was that of scholars called [[Masoretes]] (from ''masoret'' meaning &quot;tradition&quot;), who from about the seventh to the tenth centuries CE devised detailed markings to indicate vowels, stress, and [[cantillation]] (recitation methods). The original Hebrew texts used only consonants, and later some consonants were used to indicate long vowels. By the time of the Masoretes this text was considered too sacred to be altered, so all their markings were in the form of pointing in and around the letters.

===Revival===
[[Image:Ben-yehuda.jpg|thumb|Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]]
The revival of Hebrew as a [[mother tongue]] was initiated by the efforts of [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]] ([[1858]]-[[1922]]) ({{Ivrit|&amp;#1488;&amp;#1500;&amp;#1497;&amp;#1506;&amp;#1494;&amp;#1512; &amp;#1489;&amp;#1503;&amp;#1470;&amp;#1497;&amp;#1492;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1491;&amp;#1492;}}).  He joined the [[Zionism|Jewish national movement]] and in [[1881]] emigrated to [[Eretz Israel]], then a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Motivated by the surrounding ideals of renovation and rejection of the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]] &quot;[[shtetl]]&quot; lifestyle, Ben-Yehuda set out to develop tools for making the [[literary language|literary]] and [[liturgical language]] into everyday [[spoken language]]. 

However, his brand of Hebrew followed norms that had been replaced in [[Eastern Europe]] by more modern grammar and style, in the writings of people like [[Asher Ginsberg|Achad Ha-Am]] and others. His organizational efforts and involvement with the establishment of schools and the writing of textbooks  pushed the [[vernacular|vernacularization]] activity into a gradually accepted movement. It was not, however, until the 1904-1905 &quot;[[Aliyah|Second aliyah]]&quot; that Hebrew had caught real momentum in Ottoman Palestine with the new and better organized enterprises set forth by the new group of immigrants. When the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] recognized Hebrew as one of the country's three official languages (English, Arabic, and Hebrew, in 1922), its new formal status contributed to its diffusion.

While many saw his work as fanciful or even blasphemous{{ref|blasphemy}}, many soon understood the need for a common language amongst Jews of pre-state Israel who at the turn of the [[20th century]] were arriving in large numbers from diverse countries and speaking different languages. A Committee of the Hebrew Language was established. Later it became the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]], an organization that exists today. The results of his and the Committee's work were published in a dictionary (''The Complete Dictionary of Ancient and Modern Hebrew''). Ben-Yehuda's work fell on fertile ground, and by the beginning of the 20th century, Hebrew was well on its way to becoming the main language of the Jewish population of both Ottoman and British pre-State Israel.

=== Hebrew language in the USSR ===
{{main articles|[[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union]] and [[Yevsektsiya]]}}

The Soviet authorities considered Hebrew a &quot;reactionary language&quot; since it was associated with both [[Judaism]] and [[Zionism]], and it was officially banned by the Narkompros (Commissariat of Education) as early as [[1919]]. Hebrew books and periodicals ceased to be published and were seized from the libraries. Despite numerous protests in the West{{ref|Klatzkin}}, teachers and students who attempted to study Hebrew language were pilloried and sentenced for &quot;counter revolutionary&quot; and later for &quot;anti-Soviet&quot; activities.

==Dialects==
According to Ethnologue, dialects of Hebrew include Standard Hebrew (General Israeli, Europeanized Hebrew), Oriental Hebrew (Arabized Hebrew, Yemenite Hebrew).

In practice, there is also [[Ashkenazi Hebrew language|Ashkenazi Hebrew]], still widely used in Ashkenazi Jewish religious services and studies in Israel and abroad. It was influenced by the [[Yiddish language]].

[[Sephardi Hebrew language|Sephardi Hebrew]] is the basis of Standard Hebrew and not all that different from it, although traditionally it has had a greater range of [[phoneme]]s. It was influenced by the [[Ladino language]].

[[Mizrahi Hebrew language|Mizrahi (Oriental) Hebrew]] is actually a collection of dialects (including [[Yemenite Hebrew language|Yemenite]]) spoken liturgically by Jews in various parts of the [[Arab]] and [[Islam|Islamic]] world.  It was influenced by the [[Arabic language]].

Nearly every immigrant to Israel is encouraged to adopt Standard Hebrew as their daily language. Phonologically, this &quot;dialect&quot; may most accurately be described as an amalgam of pronunciations preserving Sephardic vowel sounds and Ashkenazic consonant sounds&amp;mdash;its recurring feature being simplification of differences among a wide array of pronunciations.  This simplifying tendency also accounts for the collapse of the Ashkenazic /t/ and /s/ pronunciations of unaspirated and aspirated &amp;#1514; into the single phoneme /t/.  Most Sephardic dialects differentiated between these two pronunciations as /t/ and /&amp;theta;/.  Within Israel, the pronunciation of &quot;Standard Hebrew&quot;, however, more often reflects the national or ethnic origin of the individual speaker, rather than the specific recommendations of the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language|Academy]].  For this reason, over half the population pronounces &amp;#1512; as {{unicode|[&amp;#640;]}}, (a uvular trill, as in Yiddish and some varieties of [[German language|German]]) or as {{unicode|[&amp;#641;]}} (a uvular fricative, as in [[French language|French]] or many varieties of German), rather than as [r], an apical trill, as in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].  The pronunciation of this phoneme is often used among Israelis as a [[shibboleth]], or determinant when ascertaining the national origin of perceived foreigners.

==Languages strongly influenced by Hebrew==
''See main article [[Jewish languages]]''

[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[Ladino language|Ladino]], [[Karaim language|Karaim]], and [[Judeo-Arabic language|Judaeo-Arabic]] were all highly influenced by Hebrew.  Although none is completely derived from Hebrew, they all make extensive use of Hebrew [[loanword]]s.

In a less direct manner, the revival of Hebrew is often cited by proponents of [[International auxiliary language|International auxiliary languages]] as the best proof that languages long dead, with small communities, or modified or created artificially can become living languages used by a large number of people.

==Sounds==
{{IPA notice}}
Hebrew has two kinds of [[lexical stress|stress]]: on the last syllable (''milra&amp;lsquo;'') and on the penultimate syllable (the one preceding the last, ''mil&amp;lsquo;el''). The former is more frequent. Specific rules connect the location of the stress with the length of the vowels in the last syllable; however due to the fact that Modern Hebrew does not distinguish between long and short vowels, these rules are often ignored in everyday speech. Interestingly enough, the rules that specify the [[vowel length]] are different for verbs and nouns, which influences the stress; thus the ''mil&amp;lsquo;el''-stressed ''ókhel'' (=&quot;food&quot;) and ''milra&amp;lsquo;''-stressed ''okhèl'' (=&quot;eats&quot;, masculine) are written in the same way. Little ambiguity exists, however, due to nouns and verbs having incompatible roles in normal sentences. This is, however, also true in English, in, for example, the English word &quot;conduct,&quot; in its nominal and verbal forms.

===Vowels===
[[Image:Hebrew vowel chart.png|right|The vowel phonemes of Modern Israeli Hebrew]]
The Hebrew word for [[vowel]]s is ''tnu&amp;lsquo;ot''.  The marks for these vowels are called [[Niqqud]].  Modern Israeli Hebrew has 5 vowel [[phoneme]]s:

* /a/ (as in &quot;car&quot;) - The vowels qamatz and patakh
* /e/ (as in &quot;set&quot;) - The vowels seggol and tzereh
* /i/ (as in &quot;beak&quot;)- The vowel khiriq
* /o/ (as in &quot;horn&quot;)- The vowel kholam
* /u/ (as in &quot;room&quot;)- The vowels shuruq and qubbutz

In [[Biblical Hebrew]], each vowel had three forms: short, long and interrupted (''hataf''). However, there is no audible distinction between the three in modern Israeli Hebrew.

Hebrew [[phonetics]] include a special feature called [[schwa | shva (schwa)]]. According to &quot;Ha-Yesod, the Fundamentals of Hebrew&quot; by Luba Uveeler and Norman M. Broznick, this feature is pronounced &quot;Shva&quot; and is spelled Shin Vav He. There are two kinds of shva: resting (''nax'') and moving (''na' ''). The resting shva is pronounced as a brief stop of speech. The moving shva sounds much like the English ''a'' in '''a'''bout.

Hebrew also has ''[[dagesh]],'' a strengthening. There are two kinds of strengthenings: light (''qal'', known also as ''dagesh lene'') and heavy (''hazaq'' or ''dagesh forte''). There are two sub-categories of the heavy dagesh: structural heavy (''hazaq tavniti'') and complementing heavy (''hazaq mashlim''). The light affects the  phonemes /b/ /k/ /p/ in the beginning of a word, or after a resting schwa. Structural heavy emphases belong to certain vowel patterns (''mishkalim'' and ''binyanim''; see the section on grammar below), and correspond originally to doubled consonants. Complementing strengthening is added when [[assimilation (linguistics)|vowel assimilation]] takes place. As mentioned before, the emphasis influences which of a pair of (former) [[allophone]]s is pronounced. Interestingly enough, historical evidence indicates that /g/, /d/ and /t/ used to have strengthened versions of their own, however they had disappeared from virtually all the spoken dialects of Hebrew. All other consonants except [[guttural]]s may receive the heavy emphasis, as well.

One-letter words are always attached to the following word. Such words include: the definite [[article (grammar)|article]] ''h'' (=&quot;the&quot;); [[preposition]]s ''b'' (=&quot;in&quot;), ''m'' (=&quot;from&quot;), ''l'' (=&quot;to&quot;); [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]]s ''sh'' (=&quot;that&quot;), ''k'' (=&quot;as&quot;, &quot;like&quot;), ''v'' (=&quot;and&quot;). The vowel that follows the letter thus attached depends in general on the beginning of the next word and the presence of a definite article which may be swallowed by the one-letter word. 

The rules for the prepositions are complicated and vary with the formality of speech. In most cases they are followed by a moving schwa, and for that reason they are pronounced as ''be'', ''me'' and ''le''. In more formal speech, if a preposition is put before a word which begins with a moving schwa, then the preposition takes the vowel /i/ (and the initial consonant is weakened), but in colloquial speech these changes do not occur. For example, colloquial ''be-kfar'' (=&quot;in a village&quot;) becomes ''bi-khfar''. If ''l'' or ''b'' are followed by the definite article ''ha'', their vowel changes to /a/. Thus *''be-ha-matos'' becomes ''ba-matos'' (=&quot;in the plane&quot;). However it does not happen to ''m'', therefore ''me-ha-matos'' is a valid form, which means &quot;from the plane&quot;.

:''* indicates that the given example is not grammatically correct''

===Consonants===
The Hebrew word for consonants is ''&amp;lsquo;itsurim'' (&amp;#1506;&amp;#1497;&amp;#1510;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1512;&amp;#1497;&amp;#1501;).

&amp;#1506; was once pronounced as a [[voiced pharyngeal fricative]]. Modern [[Ashkenazi]] (Northern and Eastern European Jews) reading tradition ignores this; however, [[Mizrahi Jew|Mizrahi]] (Middle Eastern and North African Jews) and Israeli Arabs accent these phonemes in a traditional semitic fashion which resembles [[Arabic language|Arabic]] `ain &amp;#1593;. Georgian Jews pronounce it as a glottalized g. Western European [[Sephardim]] and Dutch [[Ashkenazi]]m traditionally pronounce it {{IPA|[ŋ]}} (like ''ng'' in ''sing'') &amp;#8212; a pronunciation which can also be found in the [[Italki]] tradition and, historically, in south-west Germany.

{{fnb|1}} Postalveolar sounds (with the exception of {{IPA|/&amp;#643;/}}) are not native to Hebrew, and only found in borrowings.

{{fnb|2}} The pairs (/b/, /v/), (/k/, /x/), (/p/, /f/), written respectively by the letters bet (&amp;#1489;), kaf (&amp;#1499;) and pe (&amp;#1508;) have historically been allophonic.  In Modern Hebrew, however, all six sounds are phonemic, due to mergers involving formerly distinct sounds (/v/ merging with /w/, /k/ merging with /q/, /x/ merging with {{IPA|/&amp;#295;/}}), loss of consonant gemination (which formerly distinguished the stop members of the pairs from the fricatives when intervocalic), and the introduction of syllable-initial /f/ through foreign borrowings.

===Historical sound changes===
Standard (non-Oriental) Israeli Hebrew (SIH) has undergone a number of splits and mergers in its development from [[Biblical Hebrew]] {{ref|Hetzron}}.
* BH /b/ had two [[allophone]]s, [b] and [v]; the [v] allophone has merged with /w/ into SIH /v/
* BH /k/ had two allophones, [k] and [x]; the [k] allophone has merged with /q/ into SIH /k/, while the [x] allophone has merged with {{Unicode|/ḥ/}} into SIH /x/
* BH /t/ and {{IPA|/ṭ/}} have merged into SIH /t/
* BH {{IPA|/ʕ/}} and {{IPA|/ʔ/}} have merged into SIH {{IPA|/ʔ/}}
* BH /p/ had two allophones, [p] and [f]; the incorporation of loanwords into Modern Hebrew has probably resulted in a split, so that /p/ and /f/ are separate phonemes

==Grammar==
''See main article [[Hebrew grammar]]

'''Hebrew grammar''' is mostly [[analytic language|analytical]], expressing such forms as [[dative case|dative]], [[ablative case|ablative]], and [[accusative case|accusative]] using [[preposition]]al particles rather than [[grammatical case]]s. However inflection does play an important role in the formation of the verbs, nouns and the [[genitive case|genitive]] construct, which is called &quot;smikhut&quot;. Words in smikhut are often combined with [[hyphen]]s.

==Writing system==  
Modern Hebrew is written from right to left using the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. Modern scripts are based on the &quot;square&quot; letter form. A similar system is used in handwriting, but the letters tend to be more circular in their character, and sometimes vary markedly from their printed equivalents. Biblical Hebrew text contains nothing but consonants and spaces, and most modern Hebrew texts contain only consonants, spaces and western-style [[punctuation]]. A pointing system (nikud, from the root word meaning &quot;points&quot; or &quot;dots&quot;) developed around the 5th Century C.E. is used to indicate vowels and syllabic stresses in some religious books,  and is almost always found in modern poetry, children's literature, and texts for beginning students of Hebrew. The system is also used sparingly to avoid certain ambiguities of meaning &amp;#8212; such as when context is insufficient to distinguish between two identically spelled words &amp;#8212; and in the transliteration of foreign names.

All Hebrew consonant phonemes are represented by a single letter. Although a single letter might represent two phonemes &amp;#8212; the letter &quot;bet,&quot; for example, represents both /b/ and /v/ &amp;#8212; the two sounds are always related &quot;hard&quot; ([[plosive]]) and &quot;soft&quot; ([[fricative]]) forms, their pronunciaton being very often determined by context. In fully pointed texts, the hard form normally has a dot, known as a [[dagesh]], in its center.
   
The letters hei, vav and yud can represent consonantal sounds (/h/, /v/ and /i/, respectively) or serve as a markers for vowels. In the latter case, these letters are called &quot;emot qria&quot; (&quot;[[mater lectionis|matres lectionis]]&quot; in Latin, &quot;mothers of reading&quot; in English). The letter hei at the end of a word usually indicates a final /a/, which in turn is usually indicative of feminine gender. Vav may represent /o/ or /u/, and yod may represent /i/. There is no consonantal marker for /e/. In some modern Israeli texts, the letter alef is used to indicate long /a/ sounds in foreign names, particularly those of Arabic origin.
   
Terminal syllabic emphasis is most common. Fully pointed texts will note variations with a vertical line placed underneath the first consonant of the emphasized syllable, to the left of the vowel mark if there is one.
   
===Romanization===  
''See also [[Romanization of Hebrew]]''
   
The Hebrew language is normally written in the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. Due to publishing difficulties, and the unfamiliarity of many readers with the alphabet, there are many ways of transcribing Hebrew into [[Roman alphabet|Roman letters]]. The most accurate method is the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]. It is used (in a simplified [[ASCII]] form) in the section concerned with [[Hebrew language/Phonology|phonology]], to describe the sounds of the Hebrew language. However, the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] is not well known, and is often considered cumbersome for transcribing pronunciations for a general audience. Therefore this article uses a different system to express Hebrew pronunciation, and at least some orthographic peculiarities. The system comes down to the following:  
   
* The letter tzadik (&amp;#1510;) is transcribed by &quot;s,&quot; although &quot;ts&quot; or &quot;tz&quot; is usually acceptable.  
* The letter &amp;lsquo;ayin (&amp;#1506;) is transcribed ', the same as alef.  In word-final position, this phoneme is always preceded by the vowel /a/. 
* The letter shin (&amp;#1513;) is transcribed by &quot;sh&quot;, and the letter sin as &quot;s&quot;.  
* Both the letter tav (&amp;#1514;) and the letter tet (&amp;#1496;) are transcribed by &quot;t&quot;.  
* The letter hey (&amp;#1492;) at the end of a word, in those cases where it marks feminine gender, is transcribed by &quot;ah&quot; (it is read /a/).
* The letter chet (&amp;#1495;) is usually transcribed by &quot;ch&quot;. &quot;kh&quot; is usually acceptable but not as common. &quot;h&quot; is occasionally used but often avoided as &quot;h&quot; is also used for hey (&amp;#1492;).
* The letter qof (&amp;#1511;) is transcribed by &quot;q&quot; (it is pronounced /k/ by many speakers).  
* Single-letter prepositions and the definite article are separated with a dash (-) from their subject.  
* Stresses and schwas are not marked.
* The vowels are always written.  
* The letter yod is usually transcribed by &quot;y&quot;.

[[Elsa Lanchester]] from ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935), [[Claude Rains]] from ''[[The Invisible Man (movie)|The Invisible Man]]'' (1933), [[Bela Lugosi]] from ''[[Dracula (1931 film)|Dracula]]'' (1931), Claude Rains from ''[[Phantom of the Opera (1943 movie)|Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1943), &quot;The Creature&quot; from ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' (1954), [[Boris Karloff]] from ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' (1931), [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] from ''[[The Wolf Man]]'' (1941) and Boris Karloff from ''[[The Mummy (1932 movie)|The Mummy]]'' (1932)]]

In film, the '''horror''' [[cinematic genre|genre]] is characterized by the attempt to make the viewer experience [[dread]], [[fear]], [[fear#Terror|terror]], [[disgust]] or [[horror (emotion)|horror]]. Its plots often involve the intrusion of an [[evil]] force, event, or personage, sometimes of [[supernatural]] origin, into the mundane world.
  
Some of the most common elements include [[vampire]]s, [[zombie]]s (and other forms of [[Undead|resurrected corpses]]), [[werewolf|werewolves]], ancient [[curse|curses]], [[ghost]]s, [[demon|demons]] and/or [[spiritual possession|demonic possession]], [[Satanism]], [[devil-child movies|evil children]], '[[slasher film|slasher villain]]s', vicious animals, inanimate objects brought to life by [[black magic]] or [[mad scientist|twisted science]], [[haunted house]]s, [[cannibalism|cannibals]], and malicious [[extraterrestrials]]. The [[serial killer]] movie is sometimes regarded as part of the horror genre.

Specific stories and characters, often derived from classic literature, have also proven popular, and have inspired many [[sequel]]s, [[remake]]s, and copycats. These include [[Dracula]], [[Frankenstein]], [[The Mummy]], [[The Wolf Man]], [[The Phantom of the Opera]] and [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]].

The horror film is often associated with low budgets and [[exploitation film|exploitation]], but major studios and well-respected [[film director|director]]s have made intermittent forays into the genre. The genre's marginal status has caused it to receive much critical dismissal or moral condemnation over the course of film history. However, during the past few decades new generations of critics - more inclined to take popular genres seriously - have given horror substantial attention and analysis, especially with regard to its perceived subversive content.  Over the same period, it has become more than ever a source of controversy, as its level of graphic violence has increased and accusations of [[misogyny]] have been leveled, especially by [[feminist]] critics.

Some horror films owe a substantial amount to other genres, particularly [[science fiction films|science fiction]], [[fantasy film|fantasy]] and the [[thriller film|thriller]].  The lines between horror and these other categories are often a subject of debate among fans and critics.

== History ==

=== Early milestones===
[[Image:NosferatuShadow.jpg|thumb|250 px|1922's ''Nosferatu'']]
The horror genre is nearly as old as film itself.  The first depictions of supernatural events appear in several of the silent shorts created by film pioneers such as [[Georges Méliès]] in the late [[1890s]], the most notable being his [[1896 in film|1896]] ''Le Manoir du Diable'' (aka &quot;The Devil's Castle&quot;) which is sometimes credited as being the first horror film. Another of his horror projects was the [[1898 in film|1898]] ''La Caverne maudite'' (aka &quot;The Cave of the Demons&quot;). [http://pages.emerson.edu/organizations/fas/latent_image/issues/1990-05/horror.htm]

The early 20th century brought more milestones for the horror genre including the first monster to appear in a full-length horror film, [[Quasimodo]], the hunchback of Notre-Dame who had appeared in [[Victor Hugo]]'s book, &quot;[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame|Notre-Dame de Paris]]&quot; (published in [[1831 in literature|1831]]). Films featuring Quasimodo included [[Alice Guy]]'s ''Esmeralda'' ([[1906 in film|1906]]), ''The Hunchback'' ([[1909 in film|1909]]), ''The Love of a Hunchback'' ([[1910 in film|1910]]) and ''Notre-Dame de Paris'' ([[1911 in film|1911]]). [http://www.moria.co.nz/horror/hunchback39.htm]
      
Many of the earliest feature length 'horror films' were created by [[Cinema of Germany|German]] film makers in [[1910]]s and [[1920s]], many of which were a significant influence on later Hollywood films. [[Paul Wegener]]'s ''[[The Golem (film)|The Golem]]'' ([[1915 in film|1915]]) was seminal; in [[1919 in film|1919]] [[Robert Wiene]]'s ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' was both controversial with American audiences, due to postwar sentiments, and influential in its [[German Expressionism|Expressionistic]] style; the most enduring horror film of that era was probably the first vampire-themed feature, [[F. W. Murnau]]'s ''[[Nosferatu]]'' ([[1922 in film|1922]]), an unauthorized adaptation of [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]''. [http://silentmoviemonsters.tripod.com/germanexpressionism.html]

Early [[Hollywood]] dramas dabbled in horror themes, including versions of ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' ([[1923 in film|1923]]) and ''[[The Monster]]'' ([[1925 in film|1925]]) (both starring [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]], the first [[United States|American]] horror [[movie star]]). His most famous role, however, was in ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925), perhaps the true predecessor of [[Universal Horror|Universal's famous horror series]]. [http://www.filmsite.org/horrorfilms.html]

=== 1930s &amp; 1940s ===
[[Image:Catpeople.jpg|left|thumb|Poster art for ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'' (1942)]]
It was in the early [[1930s]] that [[United States|American]] [[Movie studio|film producers]], particularly [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures Co. Inc.]], popularized the horror film, bringing to the screen a series of successful [[Gothic novel|Gothic]] features including ''[[Dracula (1931 film)|Dracula]]'' ([[1931 in film|1931]]), and ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' ([[1932 in film|1932]]), some of which blended [[science fiction film]]s with Gothic horror, such as [[James Whale]]'s ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' (1931) and ''[[The Invisible Man (movie)|The Invisible Man]]'' ([[1933 in film|1933]]).  These films, while designed to thrill, also incorporated more serious elements, and were influenced by the German expressionism of the [[1920s]].  Some actors began to build entire careers in such films, most notably [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Bela Lugosi]].

Other studios of the day had less spectacular success, but [[Rouben Mamoulian]]'s ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' ([[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], 1931) and [[Michael Curtiz]]'s ''[[Mystery of the Wax Museum]]'' ([[Warner Brothers]], 1933) were both important horror films.

Universal's horror films continued into the [[1940s]] with ''[[The Wolf Man]]'' [[1941 in film|1941]], not the first [[werewolf]] film, but certainly the most influential. Throughout the decade Universal also continued to produce more sequels in the ''[[Frankenstein]]'' series, as well as a number of films teaming up several of their monsters. Also in that decade, [[Val Lewton]] would produce a series of influential and atmospheric [[B-movie|B-pictures]] for [[RKO Pictures]], including ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'' ([[1942 in film|1942]]), ''[[I Walked with a Zombie]]'' ([[1943 in film|1943]]) and ''[[The Body Snatcher (film)|The Body Snatcher]]'' ([[1945 in film|1945]]).

=== 1950s ===

With the dramatic changes in technology that occurred in the [[1950s]], the tone of horror films shifted away from the gothic and further toward science fiction. A seemingly endless parade of low-budget productions featured humanity overcoming threats from &quot;outside&quot;: [[alien invasion]]s and deadly [[mutation]]s to people, plants, and insects. These films provided ample opportunity for audience exploitation, with gimmicks such as [[3-D film|3-D]] and &quot;Percepto&quot; (producer [[William Castle]]'s electric-shock technique used for [[1959 in film|1959]]'s ''[[The Tingler]]'') drawing audiences in week after week for bigger and better scares. The classier horror films of this period, including ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'' ([[1951 in film|1951]]; attributed on screen to [[Christian Nyby]] but widely considered to be the work of [[Howard Hawks]]) and [[Don Siegel]]'s ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' ([[1956 in film|1956]]) managed to channel the [[paranoia]] of the [[Cold War]] into atmospheric creepiness without resorting to direct exploitation of the events of the day. Filmmakers would continue to merge elements of science fiction and horror well into the future. [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0412/is_1_29/ai_73036226] 

The late 1950s and early [[1960s]] saw the rise of studios centered specifically around horror. Notable were [[United Kingdom|British]] production company [[Hammer Horror|Hammer Films]], which specialized in bloody remakes of classic horror stories often starring [[Peter Cushing]] and [[Christopher Lee]], including ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]'' ([[1957 in film|1957]]) and ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' ([[1958 in film|1958]]). Hammer, and director [[Terence Fisher]], are widely acknowledged as pioneers of the modern horror movie. 

[[American International Pictures]] (AIP) also made a series of [[Edgar Allan Poe]] themed films produced by [[Roger Corman]] and starring [[Vincent Price]]. These sometimes controversial productions paved the way for more explicit violence in both horror and mainstream films.

=== 1960s ===

[[image:Nightofthelivingdead_screenshot.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A young [[zombie]] and her victim, from ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968)]]

In the 1960s the genre moved towards &quot;[[psychological horror]]&quot;, with thrillers such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho]]'' ([[1960 in film|1960]]) using all-too-human monsters rather than [[supernatural]] ones to scare the audience; [[Michael Latham Powell|Michael Powell]]'s ''ndah''.

==Usage in French== 

In the French language, the name of the letter is pronounced {{IPA|/a&amp;#643;/}}.

The French language classifies words that begin with this letter in two ways that must be learned to use French properly, even though it is a silent letter either way. The ''h muet'', or &quot;mute ''h''&quot;, is considered as though the letter were not there at all, so masculine nouns get the article ''le'' replaced by the sequence ''l'''. Similarly, words such as ''un'', whose pronunciation would [[elision|elide]] onto the following word would do so for a word with ''h muet''. 

For example ''Le'' plus ''Hébergement (accommodation)'' becomes ''L'Hébergement''.

The other way is called ''h aspiré'', or &quot;aspirated ''h''&quot; (though it is still not aspirated) and is treated as a phantom consonant. Hence masculine nouns get the ''le'', separated from the noun with a bit of a glottal stop. There is no elision with such a word; the preceding word is kept separate by similar means. 

Most words that begin with an ''h muet'' (or &quot;a&quot; ''h muet'', interestingly) come from Latin (''honneur'') or from Greek through Latin (''hécatombe''), whereas most words beginning with an ''h aspiré'' come from Germanic (''harpe'') or non-Indo-European (''harem'', ''hamac'') languages. As is generally the case with French, there are numerous exceptions. In some cases, an ''h muet'' was added to disambiguate the {{IPA|[v]}} and semivowel {{IPA|[&amp;#613;]}} pronunciations: ''huit'' (from ''uit'', ultimately from Latin ''octo''), ''huître'' (from ''uistre'', ultimately from Greek through Latin ''ostrea'').

Some of these distinctions have been preserved in English through Anglo-French: ''an honour'' vs. ''a harp''.

Dictionaries mark those words that have this second kind of ''h'' with a preceding mark, either an [[asterisk]], a [[dagger (typography)|dagger]], or a little circle lower than a degree-symbol. 

==Usage in German==
In the German language, the name of the letter is pronounced /haː/.

In the [[German language]], this letter is used in the digraph &quot;ch&quot; and the trigraph &quot;sch&quot; to indicate completely different sounds. Following a vowel, it often silently indicates that the vowel is  long: In the word &quot;erhöhen&quot;, only the first &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;h&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; is pronounced as /h/. This is the origin of the spelling (or pronunciation) of the English ejaculation &quot;Eh?&quot; which is not at all like an English pronunciation of the letter &quot;e&quot;.

A century ago, there was a [[spelling reform]] which eliminated the silent &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;h&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; in all instances of &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; in native German words such as ''Thee'' or ''Neanderthal''. Due to opposition by monarchists, the word ''Thron'' &quot;throne&quot; was exempted from this and left with &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

In [[Unicode]] the [[majuscule|capital]] H is codepoint U+0048 and the [[minuscule|lowercase]] h is U+0068.

The [[ASCII]] code for capital H is 72 and for lowercase h is 104; or in [[Binary numeral system|binary]] 01001000 and 01101000, correspondingly.

The [[EBCDIC]] code for capital H is 200 and for lowercase h is 136.

The [[numeric character reference]]s in [[HTML]] and [[XML]] are &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#72;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#104;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; for upper and lower case respectively.

==Meanings for H==
* In [[astronomy]],
** H stands for an April 16 through 30 discovery, in the provisional designation of a comet (e.g. [[C/1874 H1]], Comet Coggia) or asteroid (e.g. [[(4662) 1984 HL]]).

* In [[chemistry]], H is the symbol for [[hydrogen]].
* In [[computing]]:
** [[^H]] is often used jokingly to indicate the intended deletion of the previous letter (see also [[W]]). This is because some operating systems use the control character ^H to delete the previous letter on a line.
** The [[file extension]] .h is used for [[C Programming Language|C]] [[header file]]s.
** H is an [[ITU-T]] series of recommendations on ''Audiovisual and multimedia systems'' and used in their names such as [[H.323]]. See [[:Category:ITU-T recommendations|ITU-T recommendations]].

It is likely to have originated in the [[science fiction fandom|fannish]] [[catch phrase]] “[[Beer|Bheer]] is the One True [[God|Ghod]]!” from the mid-[[20th Century]]. The ''h'' infix marking of &quot;Ghod&quot; and other words spread into the [[1960s]] [[counterculture]] via [[underground comics]], and into early [[hacker culture|hackerdom]] either from the counterculture or from [[science fiction fandom|SF fandom]] (the three communities overlapped heavily at the time).  More recently, the ''h'' infix has become an expected feature of [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] names (Dhrystone, Rhealstone, etc.); this is probably patterning on the original [[Whetstone]] (the name of a laboratory) but influenced by the fannish/counterculture ''h'' infix.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about horseshoe, as used on animals. For the game, see [[Horseshoes]].  For the home football stadium of [[Ohio State University]], see [[Ohio Stadium]].''

[[image:Horseshoe.jpg|thumb|250px|Modern horseshoes are most commonly made of [[iron]] and nailed onto the hoof.]]

A '''horseshoe''' is a U-shaped piece of [[iron]], [[rubber]], [[plastic]], rawhide or a [[laminate]] of these, [[nail (engineering)|nail]]ed or [[glue]]d to the [[hooves]] of [[horses]] and some other [[draught animal]]s--like a [[shoe]].  They are used to protect the animal's hooves from wear and tear. Early horseshoes had &quot;calkins&quot; or protruding tabs at the ends of the shoe to provide additional traction (these are still used on some competition horses in sports like team penning).  Kept as a talisman, horseshoes are said to bring [[luck]].  Horseshoes are also used for a popular game, '''[[horseshoes]]'''.

The horseshoe seems to have been introduced to Western culture by the [[Greeks]] in the 4th Century. Horseshoes are available in a wide variety of materials and styles, developed for different types of horses and the work they do. Common materials are [[steel]], [[aluminum]] and [[plastic]], and some specialized shoes are made from [[magnesium]], [[titanium]] or [[copper]].

==Reasons for use in domestic environment==

===The traditional point of view===
Since the early history of the domestication and use of horses, many factors have contributed to the need for the bottoms of domestic horses' feet (hooves) to have additional protection over and above their natural hardness. 

;Less healthy food: Live [[Poaceae|grass]]es, [[weed]]s and [[shrub]]s, which are eaten in the wild, are high in [[nutrient]]s such as [[carotene|beta carotene]].  Cultivated feeds lose a high proportion of their carotene within hours of harvesting and so do not provide this vital ingredient to the horse.  The hoof is made of horn, much as the human [[fingernail]], and grows hard, tough and flexible only with optimal nutrition.

;Less varied terrain: Horseshoes are not needed in nature as the horse walks and [[graze]]s continuously over a wide variety of surfaces.  The consequence of this nonstop travel on the horse's feet is to keep them worn to a small, smooth, even and hard state. The continual stimulation and irritation of the sole of the foot keeps it thick and hard, much like a [[callus]]. However, in [[domestication]], the customary amount of ground covered by a horse on a daily basis is greatly reduced. Therefore, the hooves harden much less and are more vulnerable to injury.

;Added weight: Horses' hooves can become quite worn out when subjected to the added weight/stress of a [[human being|human]], pack loads, cart or [[wagon]] traces.

;Wetter climate: Horses have moved from the more arid steppes to the wetter climate of northern Europe. This wetter climate and heavy soils softened the hooves and made them prone to splitting, making hoof protection necessary, and consequently it was in northern Europe that the first practical horseshoe arose.

;Exposure to ammonia: The hooves of horses that are kept in stalls or small turnouts are constantly exposed to ammonia from urine.  The hoof capsule is mostly made from [[keratin]], a [[protein]], and is weakened by this exposure.  Wearing shoes does not prevent or reduce damage from ammonia exposure.  Rather, they are meant to reduce wear on weakened hooves.    

;Consequences of less healthy hooves: In captivity, absent the natural conditioning factors present in the wild, the feet of horses grow overly large, long, fragile and soft.  Hence, protection from rocks, pebbles and hard, uneven surfaces is lacking.  Cracks in overgrown and overly brittle hoof walls are a constant danger, as is bruising of the soft tissues within the foot because of inadequately thick and hard sole material.

;Corrective shoeing: The shape, weight, and thickness of a horseshoe can significantly affect the horse's gait. [[Farrier]]s trained in [[hot shoeing]] can make custom shoes to help horses with bone or musculature problems in their legs.

;Traction: Traction devices such as [[borium]] for ice, studs for muddy or slick conditions, calks, and rims are useful for performance horses such as [[eventing|eventers]], [[show jumping|show jumpers]], [[polo|polo ponies]], and other horses that perform at high speeds, over changing terrain, or in less-than-ideal footing.

;Gait Manipulation: Some breeds such as the [[Saddlebred]], [[Tennessee Walker| Tennessee Walking Horse]], and other gaited horses are judged on their high-stepping movement. Special shoeing can help enhance their natural movement.

===New ideas about horseshoeing===
The traditional point of view on horseshoeing has been deeply reviewed in the last years based on physiological, scientific arguments. Observations on wild horses and horses in natural boarding situations (and [[barefoot horses|barefoot]] trimmed) have suggested that domesticated horses in domestic situations can grow hooves as healthy as those of wild/feral horses and do not need shoes if properly cared for. However, a long tradition of conventional horse keeping, stall boarding and shoeing has meant that these ideas have been slow to take off.

There are several variations on the theme of barefoot trimming and natural horse keeping with their main differences stemming from different philosophies on the limits of invasive trimming techniques and differing strategies during the 'transition phase' when a horse is transitioned from a traditional keeped and shod lifestyle to a natural and barefoot lifestyle. Two horse care practitioners who have been particularly influential on the barefoot horse movement are [[Jaime Jackson]] and Dr. [[Hiltrud Strasser]].

==History==

===Earliest horseshoes===
Horse owners have sought to remedy the problems shown above with supplemental support and [[armor]], beginning in the earliest days with [[rawhide boot]]s which could be tied onto the hoof.

===Metal horseshoes===
Since then, [[metal]] ([[iron]]) horseshoes have been developed.  These are nailed to the rim of the sole with nails which find a purchase in the hoof wall.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Horseshoes.jpg|framed|These [[Roman villa]] horseshoes from about 294 CE challenge assumptions about horseshoe history.]] --&gt;

There has been some debate about when metal horseshoes were first invented - some historians believe that horseshoes were invented during the [[Middle Ages]], but the image on the right shows two of several horseshoes that were part of a much larger loot from a [[Roman villa]], found in a river near [[Neupotz, Germany|Neupotz]], [[Germany]]. They are dated to the year 294. (From Kuenzl, Ernst, ''Die Alamannenbeute aus dem Rhein bei Neupotz: Plünderungsgut aus dem römischen Gallien.'' Mainz 1993.)  In any case, metal horse shoes were not commonly used until the middle ages.

== For luck==
[[Image:Horseshoe lucky on door.jpg|thumb|A horseshoe on a door is regarded a protective [[amulet|talisman]] in some cultures]]

Horseshoes are considered a good [[luck]] charm in many cultures. A common tradition is that if a horseshoe is hung on a door with the two ends pointing up (as shown here) then good luck will occur. However, if the two ends point downwards then bad luck will occur.  Traditions do differ on this point, though.  In some cultures, the horseshoe is hung ''points down'' (so the luck pours onto you); in others, it is hung ''points up'' (so the luck doesn't fall out); still in others it doesn't matter so long as the horseshoe has been used (not new), was found (not purchased), and can be touched.

In some traditions, any good or bad luck achieved will only occur to the ''owner'' of the horseshoe, not the person who hangs it up. Therefore, if the horseshoe was stolen, borrowed or even just found then the ''owner'', not the person who found or stole the horseshoe will get any good or bad luck.  Other traditions require that the horseshoe be found to be effective.

One reputed origin of the tradition of lucky horseshoes is the story of [[Dunstan|Saint Dunstan]] and the Devil. Dunstan, who would became the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in AD 959, was a blacksmith by trade. The story relates that he once nailed a horseshoe to the Devil's hoof when he was asked to reshod the Devil's horse. This caused the Devil great pain, and Dunstan only agreed to remove the shoe and release the Devil after the Devil promised never to enter a place where a horseshoe is hung over the door.

Another theory concerning the placing of horseshoes above doorways is to ward off [[Faeries]] (the Celtic kind); the theory being that Faeries are repelled by iron and as horseshoes were an easily available source of iron, they could be nailed above a door to prevent any unwanted, otherworldly guests. One can see how the custom, as people began to forget the stories concerning the Fair Folk, eventually morphed into a simple good luck charm. It is also possible that the Romans, when arriving in Celtic countries, came across horseshoes nailed above doors and simply borrowed the concept of horseshoes as good luck charms, failing to understand the background of the Celtic custom, and made their use more widespread.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Hemoglobin.jpg|thumb|300px|3-dimensional structure of hemoglobin. The four subunits are shown in red and yellow, and the heme groups in green.]]
'''Hemoglobin''' or '''haemoglobin''' (frequently abbreviated as '''Hb''') is the [[iron]]-containing [[oxygen]]-transport [[metalloprotein]] in the [[red blood cell|red cells]] of the [[blood]] in [[mammal]]s and other animals. Hemoglobin transports oxygen from the [[lung]]s to the rest of the body, such as to the [[muscle]]s, where it releases the oxygen load.

The name ''hemoglobin'' is the concatenation of ''heme'' and ''globin'', reflecting the fact that each [[subunit]] of hemoglobin is a [[globular protein]] with an embedded [[heme]] (or haem) group; each heme group contains an iron atom, and this is responsible for the binding of oxygen. The most common types of hemoglobin contains four such subunits.

Mutations in the [[gene]] for the hemoglobin protein result in a group of [[hereditary disease|hereditary diseases]] termed the ''[[hemoglobinopathy|hemoglobinopathies]]'', the most common members of which are [[sickle-cell disease]] and [[thalassemia]].

==Structure==
[[Image:Heme.png|right|framed|Heme group]]

The Hemoglobin [[molecule]] is an assembly of four [[globular protein]] subunits. Each [[subunit]] is composed of a [[protein]] chain tightly associated with a non-protein [[heme]] group.  

Each individual protein chain arranges in a set of [[alpha-helix]] structural segments connected together in a &quot;[[myoglobin]] fold&quot; arrangement, so called because this arrangement is the same folding motif used in the heme/globin proteins. This folding pattern contains a pocket which is suitable to strongly bind the heme group. 

A heme group consists of an iron atom held in a [[heterocyclic]] ring, known as a ''[[porphyrin]]''.  This iron atom is the site of oxygen binding. The iron atom is bonded equally to all four [[nitrogen]]s in the center of the ring, which lie in one plane. Two additional bonds perpendicular to the plane on each side can be formed with the iron to form the fifth and sixth positions, one connected strongly to the protein, the other available for binding of oxygen. The iron atom can either be in the Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; state, but ferrihaemoglobin ([[Methaemoglobin]]) (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) cannot bind oxygen. 

In adult humans, the most common hemoglobin type is a [[tetramer]] (which contains 4 subunit proteins) called '''hemoglobin A''', consisting of two &amp;alpha; and two &amp;beta; subunits non-covalently bound. This is denoted as &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The subunits are structurally similar and about the same size. Each subunit has a molecular weight of about 16,000 [[dalton (unit)|dalton]]s, for a total [[molecular weight]] of the tetramer of about 64,000 daltons. Haemoglobin A is the most intensively studied of the haemoglobin molecules.

The four [[polypeptide chains]] are bound to each other by [[salt bridge (protein)|salt bridge]]s, [[hydrogen bonds]] and [[hydrophobic interaction]]. There are two kinds of contacts between the &amp;alpha; and &amp;beta; chains: &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

It is also spoken in former colonial settlements, for instance in [[Romania]] (''[[Transylvania]]''), [[Russia]], [[USA]] or [[Namibia]].

&quot;High&quot; refers to the [[mountain]]ous areas of central and southern Germany and the [[Alps]], as opposed to the [[Low Germanic languages]] spoken along the flat sea coasts of the north. High Germanic can be subdivided into [[Upper German]] and [[Central German]] (''Oberdeutsch, Mitteldeutsch'').

The German term ''Hochdeutsch'' is also used loosely, but not by linguists, to mean [[German language|standard written German]] as opposed to dialect, because the standard language developed out of High rather than Low Germanic.  This is based on a misunderstanding, and the attempt to rationalise it by suggesting that &quot;high&quot; means &quot;official&quot; doesn't solve the problem. In English, &quot;High Germanic&quot; has never been used to mean &quot;Standard German&quot;.

==History==
High Germanic as used in Southern Germany, Bavaria and Austria was an important basis for the development of standard German.

The historical forms of the language are [[Old High German]] and [[Middle High German]].

==Classification==
High Germanic are distinguished from other Western Germanic varieties in that they took part in the [[High German consonant shift]] (c. AD 500).
To see this, compare German ''Pfanne'' with [[English language|English]] ''pan'' ({{IPA|[pf]}} to {{IPA|[p]}}), German ''zwei'' with English ''two'' ({{IPA|[ts]}} to {{IPA|[t]}}), German ''machen'' with English ''make'' ({{IPA|[x]}} to {{IPA|[k]}}).
In the [[Alemannic German|High Alemannic dialects]], there is a further shift; ''Sack'' (like English &quot;sack&quot;) is pronounced {{IPA|[z&amp;#805;akx]}} ({{IPA|[k]}} to {{IPA|[kx]}}).

==Family tree==
Note that divisions between subfamilies of Germanic are rarely precisely defined; most form continuous clines, with adjacent [[dialect]]s being mutually intelligible and more separated ones not. In particular, there never has been an original &quot;[[Proto-language|Proto-High German]]&quot;.

'''Hannes Bok''', pseudonym for '''Wayne Woodard''' ([[July 2]], [[1914]]-[[April 11]], [[1964]]), was an American illustrator and writer of fantasy fiction. His illustrations mainly appeared on the covers of [[science fiction]] novels and such magazines as [[If (magazine)|If]], [[Weird Tales]], [[Other Worlds (magazine)|Other Worlds]], Fantasy Fiction, Imagination, [[Castle of Frankenstein]], [[Planet Stories]] and [[The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]. 

He was born  in [[Duluth, Minnesota]] as Wayne Woodard, though occasionally the more common surname name &quot;Woodward&quot; is applied to him. The pseudonym derives from [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (whose name can be rendered both as &quot;Johann S. Bach&quot; and &quot;Johannes Bach&quot;). His early career was assisted by [[Ray Bradbury]]; he corresponded with [[Maxfield Parrish]].
 
He is most famously known for his novels ''Sorcerer's Ship'' and ''Beyond the Golden Stair'', both included in the [[Ballantine Adult Fantasy series]]. His striking wraparound cover for the [[November]] [[1963]] issue of [[The_Magazine_of_Fantasy_&amp;_Science_Fiction|F&amp;SF]], illustrating [[Roger Zelazny|Roger Zelazny's]] ''[[A Rose For Ecclesiastes]]'', was published in the last months of his life.

A member of the [[Futurians]], Bok won the debut [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo_Award_for_Best_Professional_Artist|Best Cover/Professional Artist]] in [[1953]]. His work was collected in ''A Hannes Bok Treasury'' (1993) and ''A Hannes Bok Showcase'' (1995).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot;''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|pronounced]] /{{IPA|h&amp;#603;:n wla:d vən'ha:daɪ}}/, usually translated as ''The Land of My Fathers'', but literally ''old country of my fathers'') is by tradition the [[national anthem]] of [[Wales]]. The words were written by [[Evan James]] and the tune composed by his son, [[James James]], both residents of [[Pontypridd]], [[Glamorgan]], in January [[1856]]. The earliest written copy survives and is part of the collections of the [[National Library of Wales]].

==Glan Rhondda==
The song &amp;ndash; ''Glan Rhondda'' (Banks of the river Rhondda) as it was known when first composed &amp;ndash; was performed for the first time in the vestry of Capel Tabor chapel, [[Maesteg]], in either January or February 1856, by a singer called Elizabeth John from Pontypridd, and it soon became popular in the locality.

==Popularity==
The popularity of the song increased after the [[Llangollen]] [[Eisteddfod]] of 1858. Thomas Llewelyn of [[Aberdare]] won a competition for an unpublished collection of Welsh airs with a collection that included ''Glan Rhondda''. The adjudicator of the competition, Owain Alaw (John Owen, 1821-1883) asked for permission to include ''Glan Rhondda'' in his publication, ''Gems of Welsh melody'' (1860-64). This volume gave ''Glan Rhondda'' its more famous title, ''Hen wlad fy nhadau'', and was sold in large quantities and ensured the popularity of the national anthem across the whole of Wales.

At the [[Bangor, Wales|Bangor]] [[Eisteddfod]] of 1874 ''Hen Wlad fy Nhadau'' gained further popularity when it was sung by [[Robert Rees]] (Eos Morlais), one of the leading Welsh soloists of his day. It was increasingly sung at patriotic gatherings and gradually it developed into a national anthem.

==First recorded Welsh-language song==
''Hen wlad fy nhadau'' was also one of the first [[Welsh language|Welsh]] songs recorded when Madge Breese sang it on [[11 March]] [[1899]], for the Gramophone Company. This was the first recording in the [[Welsh language]].

==National anthem==
Though it has no official or legal status, ''Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau'' is recognised and used as an anthem at both national and local events in Wales. Usually this will be the only anthem sung, such as at national sporting events, and it will be sung only in Welsh using the first stanza and refrain. But on some official occasions, especially those with royal connections, it is used in conjunction with the state anthem of the [[United Kingdom]], ''[[God Save the Queen]]''.

The existence of a separate national anthem for Wales has not always been apparent to those from outside the country. In [[1993]] the newly-appointed [[Secretary of State for Wales]] [[John Redwood]] was embarrassingly videotaped trying to guess the words during a communal singing of the national anthem, clearly unaware of them; the pictures were frequently cited as evidence of his unsuitability for the post.  According to [[John Major]]'s autobiography, the first thing his successor [[William Hague]] said, on being appointed, was that he had better find someone to teach him the words.  He found [[Ffion Jenkins]], and later married her.

Versions of ''Hen Wlad fy Nhadau'' are used as anthems in both [[Cornwall]], as ''[[Bro Goth Agan Tasow]]'', and [[Brittany]], as ''[[Bro Goz ma Zadoù]]''.

==Lyrics==

===Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau===

Mae hen wlad fy nhadau yn annwyl i mi,&lt;br&gt;
Gwlad beirdd a chantorion, enwogion o fri;&lt;br&gt;
Ei gwrol ryfelwyr, gwladgarwyr tra mâd,&lt;br&gt;
Dros ryddid collasant eu gwaed.

:Gwlad, gwlad, pleidiol wyf i'm gwlad.&lt;br&gt;
:Tra môr yn fur i'r bur hoff bau,&lt;br&gt;
:O bydded i'r hen iaith barhau.&lt;br&gt;

Hen Gymru fynyddig, paradwys y bardd,&lt;br&gt;
Pob dyffryn, pob clogwyn i'm golwg sydd hardd;&lt;br&gt;
Trwy deimlad gwladgarol, mor swynol yw si&lt;br&gt;
Ei nentydd, afonydd, i mi.

Os treisiodd y gelyn fy ngwlad tan ei droed,&lt;br&gt;
Mae hen iaith y Cymry mor fyw ag erioed,&lt;br&gt;
Ni luddiwyd yr awen gan erchyll law brad,&lt;br&gt;
Na thelyn berseiniol fy ngwlad.&lt;br&gt;

== Translation ==

===Land Of My Fathers===

O land of my fathers, O land of my love,&lt;br&gt;
Dear mother of minstrels who kindle and move,&lt;br&gt;
And hero on hero, who at honour's proud call,&lt;br&gt;
For freedom their lifeblood let fall.

:Wales! Wales! O but my heart is with you!
:And long as the sea
:Your bulwark shall be,
:To Wales my heart shall be true. 

O land of the mountains, the bard's paradise,&lt;br&gt;
Whose precipice, valleys lone as the skies,&lt;br&gt;
Green murmuring forest, far echoing flood&lt;br&gt;
Fire the fancy and quicken the blood.

For tho' the fierce foeman has ravaged your realm,&lt;br&gt;
The old speech of Wales he cannot o'erwhelm,&lt;br&gt;
Our passionate poets to silence command&lt;br&gt;
Or banish the harp from your strand.

''The above is a fairly free translation in verse.''  
''A more literal translation would be:''

&lt;!-- ===The Old Land Of My Fathers===

The old land of my fathers is dear to me,&lt;br&gt;
Land of poets and singers, famous men of renown;&lt;br&gt;
Her brave warriors, very splendid patriots,&lt;br&gt;
For freedom shed their blood.

:Nation [or country], Nation, I am partial to my Nation.
:While the sea [is] a wall to the pure, most loved region,
:O may the old language [''sc.'' Cymraeg] endure.

Old mountainous Wales, paradise of the bard,&lt;br&gt;
Every valley, every cliff, to me is beautiful.&lt;br&gt;
Through patriotic feeling, so charming is the murmur&lt;br&gt;
Of her brooks, rivers, to me.

If the enemy oppresses my land under his foot, &lt;br&gt;
The old language of the Welsh is as alive as ever.&lt;br&gt;
The muse is not hindered by the hideous hand of treason,&lt;br&gt;
Nor [is] the melodious harp of my country.


''Another possible translation is:''

--&gt;===The Land Of My Fathers===

The land of my fathers is dear unto me,&lt;br&gt;
Old land where the minstrels are honored and free;&lt;br&gt;
Its warring defenders so gallant and brave,&lt;br&gt;
For freedom their life's blood they gave.

:Home, home, true am I to home,
:While seas secure the land so pure,
:O may the old language endure.

Old land of the mountains, the Eden of bards,&lt;br&gt;
Each gorge and each valley a loveliness guards;&lt;br&gt;
Through love of my country, charmed voices will be &lt;br&gt;
Its streams, and its rivers, to me.

Though foemen have trampled my land 'neath their feet, &lt;br&gt;
The language of Cambria still knows no retreat;&lt;br&gt;
The muse is not vanquished by traitor's fell hand,&lt;br&gt;
Nor silenced the harp of my land.

== Parodies ==

[[Swansea]] poet [[Nigel Jenkins]] wrote an English phonetic version of the first verse for the benefit of non-Welsh speakers[http://www.paulflynnmp.co.uk/commonsdetail.jsp?id=873], said to be inconspicuous in chorus as long as one doesn't smile:

:My hen laid a haddock, one hand oiled a flea,&lt;br&gt;
:Glad farts and centurions threw dogs in the sea,&lt;br&gt;
:I could stew a hare here and brandish Dan’s flan,&lt;br&gt;
:Don’s ruddy bog’s blocked up with sand.

:Dad! Dad! Why don’t you oil Auntie Glad?&lt;br&gt;
:Can whores appear in beer bottle pies,&lt;br&gt;
:O butter the hens as they fly!

Popular among fans of [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City Football Club]] is this parody[http://www.footballchants.org/viewChants.php?divs=D2&amp;teams=53&amp;let=B#12796]:

:Wales, Wales, bloody great fishes are Wales,&lt;br&gt;
:They swim in the sea,&lt;br&gt;
:We eat them for tea,&lt;br&gt;
:Oh bloody great fishes are Wales.

[[Image:Herman brood.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]
'''Herman Brood''' (pronounced &quot;Broat&quot; /bro:t/; [[Zwolle]], [[November 5]], [[1946]] &amp;ndash; [[Amsterdam]], [[July 11]], [[2001]]) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[musician]], [[painter]] and [[media]] personality. Brood was the Dutch [[personification]] of ''[[sex, drugs and rock 'n roll]]''.

After playing [[piano]] in [[Cuby and the Blizzards]] and several other bands since [[1964]], Brood started his own group, Herman Brood and His Wild Romance, in [[1977]]. The band had their first hit single, ''Saturday Night'', in [[1978]]. But even more than his music, it was his outspoken statements in the press about sex and [[drug use]] that made Herman Brood famous in the Netherlands. For a while in the early [[Eighties]] he was romantically involved with similarly outrageous [[Germany|German]] [[artist]], [[Nina Hagen]], with whom he appeared together in the movie ''Cha Cha.'' Brood relished the [[media]] attention and became the most famous [[hard drug]] user of the Netherlands. In the [[Nineties|1990s]] he took up painting and became as successful as a painter as he was as a musician.

With the band 'Herman Brood and his Wild Romance' he made his best known album 'Schpritz' (a play on the German word for injection needle), containing anti-drug use songs like 'Dope Sucks', but also 'Saturday Night'. Brood swore off most drugs, reducing his drug use to [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and a daily shot of [[amphetamine|speed]]. When in [[2001]], he found out that he had only a few months left to live, Herman took matters into his own hands and, depressed by the failure of his drug rehabilitation programme, committed [[suicide]] on [[July 11]] by jumping off the [[Amsterdam]] [[Hilton Hotel|Hilton]] at the age of 54.

== Herman Brood, the artist ==

Although Herman Brood was famous mostly among music fans outside of Holland, in his own country of origin he is primarily known and loved for his contributions to [[public art]], particularly for creating [[murals]] in different public places in Amsterdam. Most art critics still have a hard time trying to describe the unique Herman Brood style, but many of his murals have definitely made a great contribution to the ever young beauty of the Dutch capital.

Herman Brood had a great impact on the following generation of Dutch street and public artists.

    <title>Homomorphism</title>
    <id>13564</id>

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This word should not be confused with [[homeomorphism]].''

In [[abstract algebra]], a '''homomorphism''' is a structure-preserving [[map (mathematics)|map]] between two [[algebraic structure]]s (such as [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, or [[vector space]]s). The word ''homomorphism'' comes from the [[Greek language]]: ''homo'' meaning &quot;same&quot; and ''morphos'' meaning &quot;shape&quot;.

==Informal discussion==

Because abstract algebra studies [[set]]s with [[operator|operation]]s that generate interesting structure or properties on the set, the most interesting [[function (mathematics)|function]]s are those which preserve the operations. These functions are known as ''homomorphisms''.

For example, consider the [[natural number]]s with addition as the operation.  A function which preserves addition should have this property:  ''f''(''a'' + ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') + ''f''(''b'').  Note that ''f''(''x'') = 3''x'' is a homomorphism, since ''f''(''a'' + ''b'') = 3(''a'' + ''b'') = 3''a'' + 3''b'' = ''f''(''a'') + ''f''(''b'').  Note that this homomorphism maps the natural numbers back onto themselves.

Homomorphisms do not have to map between sets which have the same operations.  For example, operation-preserving operations exist between the set of real numbers with addition and the set of positive real numbers with multiplication.  A function which preserves operation should have this property:  ''f''(''a'' + ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') * ''f''(''b''), since addition is the operation in the first set and multiplication is the operation in the second.  Given the laws of [[exponent]]s, ''f''(''x'') = e&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; satisfies this condition.

A particularly important property of homomorphisms is that if an [[identity element]] is present, it is always preserved, that is, mapped to the identity.  Note in the first example ''f''(0) = 0, and 0 is the additive identity.  In the second example, ''f''(0) = 1, since 0 is the additive identity, and 1 is the multiplicative identity.

If we are considering multiple operations on a set, then all operations must be preserved for a function to be a considered a homo{{IPA|/ rα:mα: /}}

''The Handbook of the International Phonetic Association'' also describes the [[near-close near-front unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/ ɪ /}})&lt;!--This can be clearly heard in the way many Hindi speakers pronounce लिखना and मिलना for example --&gt; the [[near-close near-back rounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/ ʊ /}}) as occurring in Hindi phonology.

===Consonants===
Hindi has a large [[consonant]] system, with about 38 distinct consonant [[phoneme]]s. An exact number cannot be given, since the regional varieties of Hindi differ in the details of their consonant repertoire. To what extent certain sounds that appear only in foreign words should be considered part of Standard Hindi is also a matter of debate. The traditional core of the consonant system, inherited from [[Sanskrit]], consists of a matrix of 25 [[plosive]]s and 8 [[sonorant]]s and [[fricative]]s.  The system is filled out by 7 sounds that originated in Persian, but are now considered Hindi sounds. The table below shows the phonology of the Hindi consonants. Note that all nasals, trills, flaps, approximants and lateral approximants in Hindi are regarded as [[voiced consonant]]s.

The 25 plosives occur in five groups, with each group sharing the same position of articulation. These positions in their traditional order are: [[velar]], [[retroflex]], [[palatal]], [[dental]], and [[bilabial]]. In each position, there are five varieties of consonant, with four oral stops and one nasal stop. An oral stop may be [[Voiced consonant|voiced]], [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]], both, or neither. This four-way opposition is the hardest aspect of Hindi pronunciation for a speaker of English. The table below shows the traditional listing of the Hindi consonants (in its [[Devanagari script]])  with the (nearest) equivalents in English/Spanish. Each consonant shown below is deemed to be followed by the neutral vowel [[schwa]] ({{IPA|/ ə /}}), and is named in the table as such. The Roman script equivalent that is ''normally'' used to transcribe Hindi in ''casual transliteration'' is also given in the second line.

At the end of the traditional table of alphabets, three cosonantal clusters are also added: क्ष {{IPA|/ kʃə /}} (in Hindi), त्र {{IPA|/ t̪rə /}} and ज्ञ {{IPA|/ gjə /}} (pronunciation given for Hindi). Other than these, sounds borrowed from the other languages like Persian and Arabic are written with a dot (''bindu'' or ''nukta'') beneath the nearest approximate alphabet. They are not included in the traditional listing. Many native Hindi speakers, especially those who come from rural backgrounds and do not speak really good khariboli or Urdu, confused these sounds (except {{IPA|/ ɽ / and / ɽ&lt;sup&gt;ɦ&lt;/sup&gt; /}} and pronounce them as the nearest equivalents in Sanskritized Hindi (listed in column 4).

===Additional notes on the consonants===
Some additional features of Hindi consonant system are given here, as well as some useful tips to those whose native langugae is English but are interested in learning Hindi language.
*No nasal consonant except / m / and / n / can start a word in Hindi. Hence all the other nasal consonants in modern Hindi tend to be pronounced as either / m / or / n /.
*The distinction between the aspirated and the unaspirated consonants is really very strong, not only in Hindi, but also in Sanskrit and all other Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages of India.
*The distinction between the dental plosives and the retroflex plosives is also very stark in all Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages.
*The retroflex flaps cannot start a word. They did not exist as such in Sanskrit—they have sprung up as the allophonic flap variants of Sanskrit's simple [[voiced retroflex plosive]]s. The other Indo-Aryan languages and Dravidian languages tend to use retroflex flaps in their vocabulary even more frequent than Hindi does.
*Aspiration is actually a ''puff of breath'' that may follow a plosive consonant. English speakers should try to pronounce the voiceless aspirates by speaking these words in a quick but clear liason-like fashion:
**&quot;ta'''ke h'''im&quot;, &quot;ge'''t h'''im&quot;, &quot;di'''tch h'''im&quot;, &quot;sla'''p h'''im&quot;.
**One could also try speaking the words &quot;'''k'''ite&quot;, &quot;'''t'''ake&quot;, &quot;'''ch'''ip&quot; and &quot;'''p'''at&quot; with a greater-than-usual puff of breath after the first consonant. The corrsponding ''unaspirated'' plosives must be pronounced with '''no''' significant puff of breath at all.
*For practising the voiced aspirates, one could try: &quot;dra'''g h'''im&quot;, &quot;sai'''d h'''im&quot;, &quot;enra'''ge h'''im&quot;, &quot;gra'''b h'''im&quot;.
*The dental consonants in Hindi are as in Spanish or French. They can be pronounced by pronouncing /t/ and /d/ (of English) by pressing the tip of the tongue against the back of the teeth rather than against the back of the alveolar ridge as done by English speakers. 
*The retroflex consonants are the most difficult to pronounce. They are pronounced by curling the tongue such that its tip touches the roof of the mouth, like how the Americans pronounce their &quot;r&quot;. However in normal Hindi speech, bringing the tip of the tongue a bit above the normal alveolar ridge would also work fine. The retroflex flaps are pronounced in a similar way, by bringing the tongue's tip to the roof of the mouth and giving it a sharp flap downwards.
*Sanskrit / r / is retroflex, but Hindi / r / is alveolar [[trill]], as in Scottish English.
*The palatal plosives of Hindi do not have a sharp frictional sound following them. These are more of pure plosives than [[affricate]]s.
*Hindi has neither / v / nor / w /. Its nearest equivalent is {{IPA|/ ʋ /}}, which is very close to /v/, but does not have a friction or buzzing sound associated with it. But replacing it with / v / will also work fine.
*The retroflex sibilant {{IPA|/ ʂ /}} need not be worried about, because it has been replaced by {{IPA|/ ʃ /}} in modern Hindi pronunciation.
*It is doubtful whether Hindi has a voiced glottal fricative {{IPA|/ɦ/}} (for the alphabet ह) or not. Sanskrit does have this. But it would cause no problem to use the normal English &quot;h&quot; (&quot;'''h'''ome) for it.
*The standard transliteration of Hindi into the Roman (English) alphabet) is usually the [[IAST]] scheme, whereby the retroflex consonants (retroflex ''t'', ''d'', their aspirates, ''n'', vowel-like ''r'') and the breath ''h'' are shown with a dot beneath; the long vowels are shown with a macron or a bar (as {{Unicode|ā}} above; aspiration of a plosive is shown with a following ''h'', and {{Unicode|ś}} is used for ''sh''; and ''c'' is used for ''ch''. Rest other alphabets are pronounced as in normal English. Another transliteration ([[ITRANS]]) uses capital letters of English to transcribe the long vowels and retroflex consonants. However, since English is a lingua franca of the educated Indians, and since computer keyboards do not have features for typing the IAST characters, Indians today use a casual transliteration into English for Hindi words; in such a casual transliteration, the retroflex and dental consonants are not differentiated, and neither the short and the long vowels (except that sometimes people double the alphabet to indicate a long vowel).

===Supra-segmental features===
Hindi has a stress accent, but it not so important as in English. Usually in a multisyllabic Hindi word, the stress falls on the last syllable if all the syllables are due to long vowels or all are due to short vowels. If the word contains a mixture or short and long vowels, the stress falls automatically on the long vowels almost equally. The [[schwa]] {{IPA|/ ə /}} has a strong tendency to vanish into nothing if its syllable is unaccented. Also note that although in Hindi, many words end in short / u / or short / i /, while speaking, the ending is often converted to long / i: / and long / u: /. The tone of speaking is very important in Hindi (although Hindi is not a tonal language like Chinese) —to express the sentiments of respect, politeness, question, etc.

==Writing system==
Hindi is written in the standardized [[Devanagari script]] which is written from left to right. The [[Devanagari]] script represents the sounds of spoken Hindi very closely, so that a person who knows the Devanagari letters can sound out a written Hindī text comprehensibly, even without knowing what the words mean. The entire alphabet has been discussed in the preceding section on phonogy.

The next table gives the system of combining two consonants, ie., making a consonant cluster. To write a consonant cluster {{IPA|/ XYə /}} from {{IPA|/ Xə /}} and {{IPA|/ Yə /}} syllables, Hindi usually converts the alphabetic symbol of the initial consonant X into the corresponding half-consonant (sic)—mostly achieved by cutting the right-side portion of the alphabet. To write the cluster {{IPA|/ XYZə /}}, similarly, both X and Y would be &quot;cut&quot;. There are many variants for this consonant cluster writing in devanagari script. The most common system is shown below for the traditional table. Here the second vowel is taken to be / n /, followed by the [[schwa]].

This table gives only theoretical combination of consonant clusters. In practice, the number of allowable consonant clusters of Hindi is limited.

==Grammar==
''Main article'': [[Hindi grammar]]

Despite Hindi and English both being Indo-European languages, Hindi grammar can be very complex and is different in many ways from what English speakers are used to. Most notably, Hindi is a subject-object verb language, meaning that verbs usually fall at the end of the sentence rather than after the subject (as in English).  Hindi also shows mixed ergativity so that, in some cases, verbs agree with the object of a sentence rather than the subject.

In addition, Hindi uses [[postposition]]s (so called because they are placed after nouns) where English uses prepositions. Other differences include gender, honorifics, interrogatives, use of cases, and different tenses. While being complicated, Hindi grammar is fairly regular, with irregularities being relatively limited. Despite differences in vocabulary and writing, Hindi grammar is nearly identical with Urdu. The concept of punctuation having been entirely unknown before the advent of the Europeans, Hindi punctuation uses western conventions for commas, exclamation points, and question marks. Periods are sometimes used to end a sentence, though the traditional &quot;full stop&quot; (a vertical line) is more generally used.

===Genders===
In Hindi (and of course in Urdu too), there are only '''two''' genders for nouns. All male human beings and male animals (or those animals and plants which are perceived to be &quot;masculine&quot;) are '''masculine'''. All female human beings and female animals (or those animals and plants which are perceived to be &quot;feminine&quot;) are '''feminine'''. Things, inanimate articles and abstract nouns are also either masculine or feminine according to convention, which must be ''learnt by heart'' by non-Hindi speakers if they wish to learn correct Hindi. The ending of a word, if a vowel, usually helps in this gender classification. Among ''tatsam'' words, the masculine words of Sanskrit remain masculine in Hindi, and same is the case for the feminine. Sanskrit neuter nouns usually become masculine in Hindi. Among the ''tadbhav'' words, if a word end in long / α: /, it is normally masculine. If a word ends in / i: / or / in/, it is normally feminine. Similarly, the gender is also tried to be preserved for words borrowed from Arabic and Persian. The categorization of Hindi words directly borrowed from English (which are numerous) is very arbitrary—but could be influenced by the ending. Adjectives ending in long / α: / must get inflected to agree with the gender of the noun.

===Interrogatives===
Besides the standard interrogative terms of who (''kaun''), what (''kyaa''), why (''kyõ''), when (''kab''), where (''kahã''), how (''kaisé''), how many (''kitnaa''), what type (''kaisaa''), etc, the Hindi word kyaa (क्या) can be used as a generic interrogative often placed at the beginning of a sentence to turn a statement into a Yes/No question. This makes it clear when a question is being asked. Questions can also be formed simply by modifying intonation, exactly as some questions are in English.

===Pronouns===
Hindi has pronouns in the first, second and third person, '''all''' for one gender only. Thus, unlike English, there is no difference between '''he''' or '''she'''. More strictly speaking, the third person of the pronoun is actually the same as the demonstrative pronoun (this / that). The verb, upon conjugation, usually indicates the difference in the gender. The pronouns have additional cases of [[accusative]] and [[genitive]]. There may also be multiple ways of inflecting the pronoun, which are given in parentheses. Note that for the second person of the pronoun (''you''), Hindi has three levels of honorifics:
*'''&amp;#2310;&amp;#2346;''' (/ α:p /): Formal and respectable form for ''you''. Has no difference between the singular and the plural. Used in all formal settings and speaking to persons who are senior in job or age. Plural could be stressed by saying &amp;#2310;&amp;#2346; &amp;#2354;&amp;#2379;&amp;#2327; (/ α:p log / ''you people'') or &amp;#2310;&amp;#2346; &amp;#2360;&amp;#2348; (/ α:p səb /) ''you all'').
*'''&amp;#2340;&amp;#2369;&amp;#2350;''' (/ tum /): Informal form of ''you''. Has no difference between the singular and the plural. Used in all informal settings and speaking to persons who are junior in job or age. Plural could be stressed by saying &amp;#2340;&amp;#2369;&amp;#2350; &amp;#2354;&amp;#2379;&amp;#2327; (/ tum log / ''you people'') or &amp;#2340;&amp;#2369;&amp;#2350; &amp;#2360;&amp;#2348; (/ tum səb /) ''you all'').
*'''&amp;#2340;&amp;#2370;''' (/ tu: /): Extremely informal form of ''you'', as ''thou''. Strictly singular, its plural form being / tum /. Except for very close friends or poetic language involving God, it could be perceived as offensive in India.

Because imperatives can already include politeness, the word &quot;kripayā&quot;, which can be translated as &quot;please&quot;, is much less common than in spoken English; it is generally only used in writing or announcements, and its use in common speech is usually intended as mockery.

Unlike English, Hindi has '''no''' definite article (''the''). The numeral ''ek'' might be used as the indefinite singular article (''a/an'') if this needs to be stressed.

===Word order===
The standard word order in Hindi is, in general, [[Subject Object Verb]], but where different emphasis or more complex structure is needed, this rule is very easily set aside (provided that the nouns/pronouns are always followed by their postpositions or case markers). More specifically, the standard order is 1. Subject 2. Adverbs (in their standard order) 3. Indirect object and any of its adjectives 4. Direct object and any of its adjectives 5. Negation term or interrogative, if any, and finally the 6. Verb and any auxiliary verbs. (Snell, p93) The standard order can be modified in various ways to impart emphasis on particular parts of the sentence. Negation is formed by adding the word &quot;nahiin&quot; (&quot;no&quot;), in the appropriate place in the sentence, or by utilizing the particle &quot;na&quot; in some cases.

===Common tenses and aspects of Hindi verbs===
Some of the most common verb [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] include the present imperfect, present continuous, past imperfect, past continuous, past perfect, and future. Present imperfect is used for habitual actions or states of being. The present continuous is used for ongoing actions, while the past continuous reflects actions that were occurring at a particular time. The past imperfect is used for past habitual actions or conditions, while the past perfect reflects completed actions and has three forms including simple past perfect and two forms akin to where English would use have or had &quot;done&quot;. Hindi also has imperative, sunjunctive and the conditional moods. Usually, the aspect, tense and the mood is shown by a variety of auxillaries. Note that the verbs must be properly conjugated not only to show the number of the noun / pronoun, but also its gender.

''See also:'' [[Grammatical aspect]].
&lt;!-- Did not cover subjunctive or conditional. I also didn’t distinguish anything about aspect because I don’t know much about it.  Tenses are present, past, and future.  Common aspects are continuous, progressive, imperfect or habitual, and perfective (for completed actions).  Hindi makes use of the progressive, while English does not distinguish between progressive and continuous.  I believe subjunctive is a mood.--&gt;

===Case===
Hindi is a poorly inflected language; the relationship of a noun in a sentence is usually shown by '''postpositions''' (i.e., prepositions that ''follow'' the noun). Hindi has three cases for nouns. The '''Direct case''' is used for nouns not followed by any postpositions, typically for the subject case. The '''[[Oblique case]]''' is used for any nouns that is followed by a postposition. Some nouns have a separate '''Vocative case'''. Hindi has two numbers: singular and plural—but they may not be shown distinctly in all declinations.

===Postpositions===
Hindi uses postpositions to show the relationship between the noun and the verb. Postpositions are those prepositions that follow the noun / pronoun rather than preceeding it.

==Literature==
''Main article: [[Hindi literature]]''

The beginnings of [[Hindi Literature|Hindi literature]] can be traced to the [[Prakrit]]s of classical [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit plays]]. [[Tulasidas]]'s [[Ramacharitamanasa]] attained wide popularity. Modern litterateurs include [[Jaishankar Prasad]], [[Sumitranandan Pant]], [[Maithili Sharan Gupta]], [[Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala']], [[Mahadevi Varma]], [[Sachchidananda Hirananda Vatsyayana]] 'Ajneya' and [[Munshi Premchand]].

==Hindi cinema==
No mention of Hindi may be deemed complete without mentioning the Hindi films. The mighty Hindi film industry [[Bollywood]] is located at [[Mumbai]] (Bombay), in the Marathi-speaking state [[Maharashtra]] in India. The dialogues and the songs use the dialects of Khariboli of Hindi-Urdu, [[Awadhi]], [[Rajasthani]], [[Bhojpuri]], [[Punjabi]] and quite often [[Bambaiya Hindi]] (along with many English words). These Hindi movies are full of songs and dances—songs which are almost always upon the lips of any Indian (and often many Pakistanis, Afghans, Bangladeshis, Iranians, etc.), whether a native Hindi speaker or not. Most of the songs are in Urdu ''shaayari'' style. Some of the hit films include [[Mahal]] (1949), [[Shree 420]] (1955), [[Mother India]] (1957), [[Mughal-e-Azam]] (1960), [[Guide]] (1965), [[Pakeezah]] (1972), [[Bobby]] (1973), [[Zanjeer]] (1973), Yaadon ki Baraat (1973), [[Deewaar]] (1975), [[Sholay]] (1975), [[Mr. India]] (1987), [[Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak]] (1988), [[Maine Pyar Kiya]] (1989), Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander (1991), [[Hum Aapke Hain Koun]] (1994), [[Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge]] (1995), [[Dil To Pagal Hai]] (1997), [[Kuch Kuch Hota Hai]] (1998), [[Taal]] (1999), [[Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai]] (2000), [[Lagaan]] (2001), [[Dil Chahta Hai]] (2001), [[Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham]] (2001), [[Devdas (2002 film)|Devdas]] (2002), [[Saathiya]] (2002), [[Munnabhai MBBS]] (2003), [[Kal Ho Naa Ho]] (2003), [[Dhoom]] (2004), [[Veer-Zaara]] (2004), [[Swades]] (2004), [[Salaam Namaste]] (2005), etc.

===History of Hindi Cinema===

The first Hindi film made in India -- ''Raja Harishchandra'' was released in year 1913. It was a silent film that depicted the story of king Harishchandra, who sacrificed his family and kingdom for the sake of truth. It was made by Dada Saheb Falke, regarded as the ''father of hindi cinema''. The film had an all-male cast.

Initially hindi films were made on mythological topics and invariably had gods or goddesses as their protagonists.

''Alam Ara'' ushered the era of talking films or talkies in India in year 1931. The film had seven songs in it. Soon songs became an integral part of hindi cinema with some movies films having as many as 71 songs in them.

===Hindi television serials===
In addition to Bollywood cinema, the Hindi television serials are also worth a mention. They include soap operas, detective serials, horror shows, dramas, cartoons, comedies, host shows for Hindi songs, Hindu mythology, Persio-Arabic mythology and documentaries. In addition to the govenment's official TV channel ''Doordarshan'',  several private channels have come up in the 1990's, e.g., Zee TV, Sony Entertainment Television, Sahara TV, Start Plus, as well as Hindi versions of Cartoon Network and Discovery Channel. One of the most popular soap operas is ''Kyonki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi'' (lit., Because the mother-in-law too was once a daughter-in-law).

==Common difficulties faced in learning Hindi==
* the ''[[phonetics|phonetic]] mechanism of some sounds peculiar to Hindi (eg. rda, dha etc)'' The distinction between aspirated and unaspirated consonants will be difficult for English speakers. In addition, the distinction between dental and alveoloar (or retroflex) consonants will also pose problems. English speakers will find that they need to carefully distinguish between four different d-sounds and four different t-sounds. 
* ''pronunciation of vowels'': In English, unstressed vowels tend to have a &quot;[[schwa]]&quot; quality. The pronunciation of such vowels in English is changed to an &quot;uh&quot; sound; this is called reducing a vowel sound. The second syllable of &quot;unify&quot; is pronounced /{{IPA|ə}}/, not &quot;ee.&quot; The same for the unstressed second syllabe of &quot;person&quot; which is also pronounced /{{IPA|ə}}/ rather than &quot;oh.&quot; In Hindi, English-speakers must constantly be careful not to reduce these vowels. 
**In this respect, probably the most important mistake would be for English speakers to reduce final &quot;ah&quot; sounds to &quot;uh.&quot; This can be especially important because an English pronunciation will lead to misunderstandings about grammar and gender. In Hindi, &quot;vo bolta hai&quot; is &quot;he talks&quot; whereas &quot;vo bolti hai&quot; is &quot;she talks.&quot; A typical English pronunciation in the first sentence would be &quot;vo boltuh hai,&quot; which will be understood as &quot;she talks&quot; by most Hindi-native speakers.
* The 'a' ending of many Sanskrit and Sanskrit borrowed gender-masculine words, due to [[Romanization]], is highly confused by non-native speakers, because the short 'a' is dropped in Hindi. There are exceptions, of course, if the devanagari script itself dictates the additional diacritical mark for the vowel &quot;long ā&quot; at the end of certain masculine words, like [[Brahma (god)|Brahmā]] (ब्रह्मा).
* ''the Verbal [[concordance]]''; Hindi exhibits [[split ergativity]]; see [[Ergative-absolutive language]] for an example.
* ''[[Postpositions]] (''ne'')''
* ''Relative-correlative constructions''. In English interrogative and relative pronouns are the same word. In &quot;Who are you?&quot; the word &quot;who&quot; is an interrogative, or question, pronoun. In &quot;My friend who lives in Chicago can speak Hindi,&quot; the word &quot;who&quot; is not an interrogative, or question, pronoun. It is a relative, or linking, pronoun. In Hindi, there are different words for each. The interrogative pronoun tends to start with the &quot;k&quot; sound:&quot; kab = when?, kahaaN = where?,  kitna = how much? The relative pronouns are usually very similar but start with &quot;j&quot; sounds: jab = when, jahaaN = where, jitna = how much.
* ''Honorifics''. For many English speakers, the fact that Hindi uses a three-part system of honorifics in the second person pronoun (&quot;you&quot;) is deeply mystifying. It shouldn't be. The more formal pronouns are used in situations in which it's proper to express a degree of social respect. The less formal pronouns depart from this and indicate, on the one hand, intimacy, or on the other, an absence of social respect. The most formal is &quot;aap&quot; and is the safest for foreigners to use in all situations. It is used in situations that range from deeply respectful to the merely businesslike. When first meeting adults, whether at the bank, hotel or a restaurant, we should use &quot;aap.&quot; The more intimate &quot;tum&quot; would be acceptable in talking with children or with adults with whom one is on more intimate terms. The safest thing with adults is wait and see what pronoun they use with you. They will almost certainly start off with &quot;aap,&quot; but might, over time, start to use &quot;tum&quot; if your relationship becomes more like that of close friends. If your Hindi is too weak to determine whether they are using &quot;aap&quot; or &quot;tum,&quot; then by all means, you should use &quot;aap.&quot; Many grammars say that foreigners will rarely have the chance to use &quot;tum&quot; with Indian colleagues, but that is true only if one behaves like a &quot;memsahib&quot; or &quot;sahib.&quot; The most intimate pronoun is &quot;tu&quot;, which is only used in situations where there is a total absence of human formality: it is used in addressing servants, very close friends, younger siblings and deities. The use of &quot;tu&quot; with another adult may express the intimacy of lovers (but even here &quot;tum&quot; is safer) or extraordinary anger. What's the connection? All of these situations involve the lack of social respect.

* ''[[Optative mood|Optative]] and Conditional moods'' in verbs

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Odin hrafnar.jpg|thumb|240px|Huginn and Muninn sit on [[Odin]]'s shoulders in this illustration from an 18th century [[Iceland]]ic manuscript.]]

'''Huginn and Muninn''', sometimes Anglicized '''Hugin''' and '''Munin''', are a pair of [[raven]]s associated with the [[Norse god]] [[Odin]]. Hugin and Munin travel the world bearing news and information to Odin. Hugin is &quot;[[thought]]&quot; and Munin is &quot;[[memory]]&quot;. They are sent out at dawn to gather information and return in the evening. They perch on the god's shoulders and whisper the news into his ears. It is from these ravens that the [[kenning]] 'raven-god' for Odin is derived.

The name ''Munin'' has its roots in the [[Old Norse]] word for memory.

From [[Grímnismál]]:

:The whole world wide, every day,
:Fly Hugin and Munin;
:I worry lest Hugin should fall in flight,
:Yet more I fear for Munin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Thermodynamic cycles}}In [[engineering]] and [[thermodynamics]], a '''heat engine''' performs the conversion of [[heat]] [[energy]] to [[mechanical work]] by exploiting the [[temperature]] gradient between a hot &quot;[[source]]&quot; and a cold &quot;[[sink]]&quot;. Heat is [[heat transfer|transferred]] to the sink from the  source, and in this process some of the heat is converted into [[energy|work]].

==Everyday examples==
Examples of everyday heat engines include: the [[steam engine]], the [[diesel engine]], and the gasoline (petrol) engine in an [[automobile]].  
All of these familiar heat engines are powered by the expansion of heated gases.  
The general surroundings are the heat sink, providing relatively cool gases which when heated, expand rapidly to drive the mechanical motion of the engine.

==Examples of heat engines==
=== Phase change cycles ===
In these cycles and engines the working fluids are gases and liquids.  The engine converts the working fluid from a gas to a liquid.    
* [[Rankine cycle]] (classical [[steam engine]])
* [[Regenerative cycle]] Are more efficient than [[Rankine cycle]].
* [[Drinking bird]] cycle
* [[Frost heaving]] - Water changing from Ice to water and back again can lift rock up to 60m.
=== Gas only cycles ===
In these cycles and engines the working fluid are always like gas:
* [[Carnot cycle]] ([[Carnot heat engine]])
* [[Brayton cycle]] or [[Joule cycle]] ([[Gas turbine]])
* [[Ericsson Cycle]]
* [[Stirling cycle]] ([[Stirling engine]])
* [[Internal combustion engine]] (ICE):
** [[Otto cycle]] (eg. [[Gasoline/Petrol engine]], high-speed [[diesel engine]])
** [[Diesel cycle]] (eg. low-speed [[diesel engine]])
** [[Atkinson Cycle]]
** [[Lenoir cycle]] (eg [[pulse jet engine]])
** [[Miller cycle]]
=== Electron cycles ===
* Thermoelectric ([[Peltier-Seebeck effect]])
* [[thermionic emission]]
* [[Thermotunnel cooling]]
=== Photon cycles ===
* [[Solar sail]]
=== Cycles used for refrigeration ===
A [[refrigerator]] is a [[heat pump]]: a heat engine in reverse.  Work is used to create a heat differential.
* [[Carnot refrigeration]]
* [[Vuilleumier refrigeration]]
* [[Absorption refrigeration]]

==Efficiency==
The efficiency of a heat engine relates how much useful power is output for a given amount of heat energy input.

From the laws of [[thermodynamics]]:

::&lt;math&gt; dW \ =  \ dQ_c \ - \  (-dQ_h) &lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt; dW = -PdV &lt;/math&gt; is the work extracted from the engine. (It is negative since work is ''done by'' the engine.)
::&lt;math&gt; dQ_h = T_hdS_h &lt;/math&gt; is the heat energy taken from the high temperature system .(It is negative since heat is extracted from the source, hence &lt;math&gt;(-dQ_h)&lt;/math&gt; is positive.)
::&lt;math&gt; dQ_c = T_cdS_c &lt;/math&gt; is the heat energy delivered to the cold temperature system. (It is positive since heat is added to the sink.)

In other words, a heat engine absorbs heat energy from the high temperature heat source, converting part of it to useful work and delivering the rest to the cold temperature heat sink.

In general, the efficiency of a given heat transfer process (whether it be a refrigerator, a heat pump or an engine) is defined informally by the ratio of &quot;what you get&quot; to &quot;what you put in.&quot;

In the case of an engine, one desires to extract work and puts in a heat transfer.

::&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac{-dW}{-dQ_h} = \frac{-dQ_h - dQ_c}{-dQ_h} = 1 - \frac{dQ_c}{-dQ_h}&lt;/math&gt; 

The ''theoretical'' maximum efficiency of any heat engine depends only on the temperatures it operates between.  This efficiency is usually derived using an ideal imaginary heat engine such as the [[Carnot heat engine]], although other engines using different cycles can also attain maximum efficiency. Mathematically, this is due to the fact that in [[Thermodynamic reversibility | reversible]] processes, the change in [[entropy]] of the cold reservoir is the negative of that of the hot reservoir (i.e., &lt;math&gt;dS_c = -dS_h&lt;/math&gt;), keeping the overall change of entropy zero. Thus:

::&lt;math&gt;\eta_{max} = 1 - \frac{T_cdS_c}{-T_hdS_h} \equiv 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T_h&lt;/math&gt; is the [[absolute temperature]] of the hot source and &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; that of the cold sink, usually measured in [[kelvin|kelvins]]. Note that &lt;math&gt;dS_c&lt;/math&gt; is positive while &lt;math&gt;dS_h&lt;/math&gt; is negative; in any reversible work-extracting process, entropy is overall not increased, but rather is moved from a hot (high-entropy) system to a cold (low-entropy one), decreasing the entropy of the heat source and increasing that of the heat sink.

The reasoning behind this being the '''maximal''' efficiency goes as follows.  It is first assumed that if a more efficient heat engine than a Carnot engine is possible, then it could be driven in reverse as a heat pump.  Mathematical analysis can be used to show that this assumed combination would result in a net decrease in [[entropy]]. Since, by the [[second law of thermodynamics]], this is forbidden, the Carnot efficiency is a theoretical upper bound on the efficiency of ''any'' process.

Empirically, no engine has ever been shown to run at a greater efficiency than a Carnot cycle heat engine.

==Other criteria of heat engine performance==
One problem with the ideal Carnot efficiency as a criterion of heat engine performance is the fact that by its nature, any maximally-efficient Carnot cycle must operate at an infinitesimal temperature gradient. This is due to the fact that ''any'' transfer of heat between two bodies at differing temperatures is irreversible, and therefore the Carnot efficiency expression only applies in the infinitesimal limit. The major problem with that is that the object of most heat engines is to output some sort of power, and infinitesimal power is usually not what is being sought.

A much more accurate measure of heat engine efficiency is given by the '''endoreversible process''', which is identical to the Carnot cycle except in that the two processes of heat transfer are ''not'' treated as reversible. As derived in Callen (1985), the efficiency for such a process is given by:

::&lt;math&gt;\eta = 1 - \sqrt{\frac{T_c}{T_h}}&lt;/math&gt;

The accuracy of this model can be seen in the following table (Callen):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

In this case, part of the root is also written in hiragana. Hiragana are also used to give the pronunciation of kanji in a reading aid called ''[[furigana]]''. The article [[Japanese writing system]] discusses in detail when the various systems of writing are used.

There are two main systems of [[Kana#Collation|ordering hiragana]], the old-fashioned [[iroha]] ordering, and the more prevalent [[gojūon]] ordering.

==The hiragana writing system==

The hiragana consist of a basic set of characters, the ''gojūon'' , which can be modified in various ways. By adding a ''[[dakuten]]'' marker ゛ an unvoiced  consonant such as ''k'' or ''t'' is turned into a voiced consonant such as ''g'' or ''d'': ''k''→''g'', ''t''→''d'', ''s''→''z'', and ''h''→''b''.
Hiragana beginning with an ''h'' can also add a ''[[handakuten]]'' marker ゜ changing the ''h'' to a ''p''. A small version of the hiragana for ''ya'', ''yu'' or ''yo'' (ゃ, ゅ or ょ respectively) may be added to hiragana ending in ''i''. This changes the ''i'' vowel sound to a glide [[palatalization]]. Addition of the small ''y'' kana is called [[yōon]]. A small ''tsu'' っ called a ''[[sokuon]]'' indicates a [[geminate]] (doubled) consonant. It appears before fricatives and stops, and sometimes at the end of sentences. This is represented in [[romaji|rōmaji]] by doubling the following consonant. 

In informal writing small versions of the five vowel kana are sometimes used to represent trailing off sounds (はぁ, ねぇ).

There are a few hiragana which are rarely used.  ''Wi'' ゐ and ''we'' ゑ are obsolete. ''V'' ゔ is a modern addition used to represent the &quot;v&quot; sound in foreign languages such as English, but since Japanese does not have a ''v'' sound, it is pronounced as a ''b''. It is rarely seen because [[loan words]] and [[Transliteration|transliterated]] words are usually written in [[katakana]].

==Table of hiragana==

The following table shows hiragana together with their [[Hepburn romanization]]. The obsolete kana are shown in &lt;font color=red&gt;red&lt;/font&gt; romanization.

The sound ''ti'' is spelt てぃ, but this sequence of sounds is found only in [[loan word]]s, so is normally written only in [[katakana]].

==Spelling rules==

With a few exceptions for sentence particles は, を, and へ (''wa'', ''o'', and ''e''), and a few other arbitrary rules, Japanese is spelled as it sounds. This has not always been the case: a previous system of spelling, now referred to as [[historical kana usage]] had many spelling rules; the exceptions in modern usage are the legacy of that system. The exact spelling rules are referred to as {{nihongo|''kanazukai''|仮名遣い|}}, &quot;kana use&quot;.

There are two hiragana pronounced ''ji'' (じ and ぢ) and two hiragana pronounced ''zu'' (ず and づ). These pairs are not interchangeable. Usually, ''ji'' is written as じ and ''zu'' is written as ず. There are some exceptions. If the first two syllables of a word consist of one syllable without a ''dakuten'' and the same syllable with a ''dakuten'', the same hiragana is used to write the sounds.  For example ''chijimeru'' (‘to boil down’ or ‘to shrink’) is spelled ちぢめる. For compound words where the dakuten reflects ''[[rendaku]]'' voicing, the original hiragana is used. For example, ''chi'' (血 &quot;blood&quot;) is spelled ち in plain hiragana. When 鼻 hana (“nose”) and 血 combine to make ''hanaji'' 鼻血 &quot;nose bleed&quot;), the sound of  血changes from ''chi'' to ''ji''.  So ''hanaji'' is spelled はなぢ according to ち: the basic hiragana used to transcribe 血.  Similarly, ''Tsukau'' (使う; &quot;to use&quot;) is spelled つかう in hiragana, so ''kanazukai'' (かな使い; &quot;kana use&quot; .. or .. &quot;kana orthography&quot;) is spelled かなづかい in hiragana. 

However, this does not apply when kanji are used to  make words which do not relate directly to their elemental meaning.  The Japanese word for ‘lightning’, for example, is ''inazuma'' (稲妻).  The ‘稲’ component means ‘rice plant’, is written いな in hiragana and is pronounced: ''ina''.  The 妻 component means ’wife’ and is pronounced ''tsuma'' (つま) when written in isolation or frequently as ''zuma'' (ずま) when it features after another syllable. Neither of these components have anything to do with ‘lightning’, but together they do when they compose the word for ‘lightning’. In this case, the default spelling in hiragana  いなずま rather than いなづま is used. 

Hiragana usually spells [[long vowel]]s with the addition of a second vowel kana. The [[chōon]] (vowel extender mark) (ー) used in katakana is rarely used with hiragana, for example in the word らーめん, [[ramen]], but this usage is considered non-standard.

A word cannot begin with the kana ん (''n''). This is at the basis of the word game [[shiritori]].  However, ''n'' is sometimes directly followed by a vowel.  For example, ''ren'ai'' 恋愛 (&quot;romantic love, emotion&quot;) is written in hiragana as れんあい rather than れない ''renai'' (a nonexistant word).

==History==
Hiragana developed from ''[[manyogana|man'yōgana]]'', [[Chinese language|Chinese]] characters used for their pronunciations, a practice which started in the [[5th century]]. The forms of the hiragana originate from the ''[[grass script|sōsho]]'' style of [[Chinese calligraphy]].  The figure below shows the derivation of hiragana from manyōgana via sōsho. The upper part shows the character in the [[Regular Script|kaisho]] form, the centre character in red shows the sōsho form of the character, and the bottom shows the equivalent hiragana.

[[Image:Hiragana_origin.jpg]]

When they were first created, hiragana were not accepted by everyone. Many felt that the language of the educated was still Chinese.  Historically, in Japan, the ''kaisho'' form of the characters was used by men, so-called {{nihongo|''onode''|男手|}}, &quot;men's writing&quot;, and the sōsho form of the kanji was used by women. Thus hiragana first gained popularity among women, who were not allowed access to the same levels of education as men. From this comes the alternative name of {{nihongo|''onnade''|女手|}} &quot;women's writing&quot;. For example, ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' and other early novels by female authors used hiragana extensively or exclusively.  

Male authors came to write literature using hiragana. Hiragana, with its flowing style, was used for unofficial writing such as personal letters, while katakana and Chinese were used for official documents. In modern times, hiragana has become preferred over [[katakana]], which is now relegated to special uses such as recently borrowed words (i.e., since the [[19th century]]), names in [[transliteration]], the names of animals, in telegrams, and for emphasis.

Originally, all sounds had more than one hiragana. In 1900, the system was simplified so each sound had only one hiragana. Other hiragana are known as {{nihongo|[[hentaigana]]|変体仮名|}}

The poem ''[[Iroha]]-uta'' (&quot;Song/poem of colours&quot;), which dates to the 10th century, uses every hiragana (except ''n'' ん) once. In the chart below, the romanization shows the hiragana; the reading in modern Japanese is in parentheses.

== Hiragana in Unicode ==
In [[Unicode]], Hiragana occupies code points U+3040 to U+309F:
{{Unicode chart Hiragana}}

The Unicode hiragana block contains precomposed characters for all hiragana in the modern set, including small vowels and yōon kana for compound syllables, plus the archaic ''wi'' and ''we'' and the rare ''vu''. All combinations of hiragana with ''dakuten'' and ''handakuten'' used in modern Japanese are available as precomposed characters, and can also be produced by using a base hiragana followed by the combining dakuten and handakuten characters (U+3099 and U+309A, respectively). This method is used to add the diacritics to kana that are not normally used with them, for example applying the dakuten to a pure vowel or the handakuten to a kana not in the h-group.

Characters U+3095 and U+3096 are small か (''ka'') and small け (''ke''), respectively. U+309F is a digraph of より (''yori'') occasionally used in vertical text. U+309B and U+309C are spacing (non-combining) equivalents to the combining dakuten and handakuten characters, respectively.

There are no characters at code points U+3040, U+3097, or U+3098.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Hohenstaufen.png|thumb|right|Arms of the Hohenstaufen]]
The '''Hohenstaufen''' were a dynasty of [[List of German Kings and Emperors|Kings of Germany]], many of whom were also crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Duke of Swabia|Dukes of Swabia]]. In 1194 the Hohenstaufen became also [[List of monarchs of Naples and Sicily|Kings of Sicily]]. The proper name, taken from their castle in [[Swabia]], is '''Staufen'''. Therefore the dynasty is sometimes also called '''Swabian dynasty''' after the family's origin.

When the last male member of the [[Salian]] dynasty, [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor]], died without an heir there was controversy about the succession.  Frederick and Conrad, the two current male Staufens, were grandsons of [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]] and nephews of Henry V.  After the death of the intervening king and emperor [[Lothair II, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair II]], in 1137, Conrad became [[Conrad III]] of Germany.

===Members of the Hohenstaufen family===

====Holy Roman Emperors and Kings of Germany====

*[[Conrad III]], king 1138-1152
*[[Frederick Barbarossa|Frederick I Barbarossa]], king 1152-1190, Emperor after 1155
*[[Henry VI of Germany|Henry VI]], king 1190-1197, Emperor after 1191
[[image:Hohenstaufen-1905.jpg|frame|Hohenstaufen in 1905]]
*[[Philip of Swabia]], king 1198-1208
*[[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], king 1208-1250, Emperor after 1220

*[[Conrad IV]], king 1237-1254 (until 1250 under his father Frederick II)

Like the first ruling Hohenstaufen, Conrad III, also the last one, Conrad IV, was never crowned emperor. After a 20 year period the first [[Habsburg]] was elected king.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{History of Malaysia}}

The '''history of Malaysia''' is a relatively recent offshoot of the history of the wider Malay-Indonesian world. Culturally and linguistically, there was until recent times little to distinguish the territories which now constitute Malaysia from the lands of the [[Malay Archipelago]]. Today the Malay world is divided into six states - Malaysia, [[Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Brunei]] and [[East Timor]] &amp;#8211; largely as the result of outside influences.

Malaysia&amp;#8217;s geographical position places it between the great civilisations. To the west are [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[India]], the [[Islam|Islamic]] [[Middle East]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Europe]]. To the north-east are [[China]] and [[Japan]]. The shipping routes from China to the west pass through the region, and the most direct route passes through the [[Strait of Malacca]]. This has made Malaysia a natural meeting place of trade routes and cultures, something which has brought the area great wealth, but has also made it difficult for the Malay peoples to resist foreign influence and domination.

==Overview==

The history of the Malaysian area can be seen as four successive phases of outside influence, followed by the final assertion of Malay independence.

*The first phase saw the domination of [[Hindu]] culture imported from [[India]], which reached its peak in the great [[Srivijaya]] civilisation based in [[Sumatra]], which ruled most of the Malay world from the 7th to the 14th centuries.
*The second phase began with the arrival of [[Islam]], which began in the 10th century, and led to the conversion of most of the Malay-Indonesian world and the breakup of the Srivijayan empire into many smaller sultanates, the most prominent of which was the [[Sultanate of Malacca|Melaka]] (Malacca). Islamic culture has had a profound influence on the Malay peoples, but has also been influenced by them.
*The third phase was the intrusion into the area of the European colonial powers: first the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], who captured Melaka in [[1511]], then the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and finally the [[United Kingdom|British]], who established bases at [[Penang]] and [[Singapore]]. European domination led to the most fateful event in Malay history &amp;#8211; the Anglo-Dutch treaty of [[1824]], which drew a frontier between British Malaya and the [[Netherlands East Indies]], which became Indonesia. This arbitrary division of the Malay world has proved permanent.
*European domination also led to the fourth phase of foreign influence: the mass immigration of Chinese and Indian workers to meet the needs of the colonial economy created by the British in the Malay Peninsula and North Borneo. The Chinese and Indians posed a profound threat to the Malays, dominating economic life and the professions, and at one time threatening to make the Malays a minority in their own country.

British power in East Asia was fatally wounded by the Japanese occupation of the region in [[1942]]-[[1945|45]]. Although short-lived, the Japanese occupation unleashed the forces of colonial nationalism in Malaya as elsewhere. But Malay nationalism triggered a reaction from the Chinese, who feared Malay and Islamic domination and turned in large numbers to the [[Malayan Communist Party]]. It took a tough military response from the British, and concessions by both the Malay and Chinese political leaderships, to end the Communist insurgency and bring about the establishment of an independent, multi-racial [[Federation of Malaya]] in [[1957]].

In [[1963]] Malaya became Malaysia with the acquisition of the British territories in North Borneo and Singapore. The Chinese-majority [[Singapore]] and the Federation decided to part ways in [[1965]]. Malaysia survived this crisis as well as [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation|confrontation with Indonesia]], but nearly succumbed to its own internal tensions in the race riots of [[1969]]. This crisis led to the imposition of emergency rule and a curtailment of political life and civil liberties which has never been reversed. Since 1970 the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) has ruled Malaysia almost as a one-party state, co-opting the Chinese and Indian leaderships through the device of the &amp;#8220;[[National Front (Malaysia)|National Front]] coalition.&amp;#8221e>Hebrew morphology</title>

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about the grammar of Modern Hebrew. For information on the various historical forms of Hebrew, see [[Hebrew language]].''

'''[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[grammar]]''' is mostly [[analytic language|analytical]], expressing such forms as [[dative case|dative]], [[ablative case|ablative]], and [[accusative case|accusative]] using [[preposition]]al particles rather than [[declension|morphological cases]]. However, inflection does play an important role in the formation of the verbs, some prepositions, and the [[genitive case|genitive]] construct of nouns.

==Word order==
Word order of sentences is somewhat arbitrary, as sentences and clauses can be [[Subject Verb Object|Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)]] or [[Verb Subject Object|Verb-Subject-Object (VSO)]]. In order to keep the object separate from the subject, definite direct objects are marked with the special preposition את ''et'', which has no analog in English. For example, the first sentence of the Hebrew Bible is VSO: ...ברא אלוהים את השמים... ''...bara elohim et ha-shamayim...'' (...created God את the heavens...)

==== Adjectives ====
In Hebrew, adjectives follow nouns, unlike in English, where they precede them. Thus, in the sentence החתול הקטן אכל את הגבינה ''Ha-khatul ha-katan akhal et ha-g'vina'' (The small cat ate the cheese):

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| ''ha-g'vina'' || ''et'' || ''akhal'' || ''ha-katan'' || ''ha-khatul''
|-
| .הַגְּבִינָה || אֶת || אַכַל|| הַקָטָן || הֶחָתוּל
|-
| '''the cheese''' || object marker || '''ate''' || '''the small''' || '''the cat'''
|-
| ''object'' ||  || ''predicate'' || ''adjective'' || ''subject''
|-
|+ ''The&amp;nbsp;small&amp;nbsp;cat&amp;nbsp;ate&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;cheese.''  (Read&amp;nbsp;from&amp;nbsp;right&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;left).
|}

==Verbs==
The Hebrew word for verb is פועל ''po'al'', and as in English, verbs in Hebrew can express both action and status.  Hebrew verbs stem from a root (שֹרֶש ''shoresh''), consisting of 3 or 4 consonants, which is modified to bring the verb into different uses. Hebrew verbs can have one of 7 combinations of 4 [[Voice (grammar)|voices]] (active, passive, causative, and reflexive) and three tenses (past, present, and future).  Additionally, a verb can be conjugated into an imperative tense and into an infinitive. 

===Classification of roots===
A root is classified according to the letters that appear in it. Roots that contain certain letters are conjugated differently.

Roots that contain a ו ''vav'' as the 2nd letters are called hollow roots. The ו ''vav'' rarely appears in any conjugation and it is usually not written as part of the root. These are often treated as 2-letter roots. Examples of hollow roots: שר ''shar'' (sang), גר ''gar'' (lived), דן ''dan'' (discussed), דג ''dag'' (fished).

Roots that contain at least one of the weak letters, י ''yod'', נ ''nun'', ח ''khet'', ע ''ayin'', א ''alef'', and ה ''hei'', are called weak roots. Each weak letter/position pairing results in a slightly different conjugation pattern. The largest group of these are those that end with ה ''hei''. Examples of weak roots: שתה ''shata'' (drank), עלה ''ala'' (went up), ירד ''yarad'' (went down), נפל ''nafal'' (fell).

Roots that do no fit into the other 2 categories are called strong or complete roots.

===Voice: the ''binyan''===
Verb roots can be conjugated according to one of seven forms, בניינים ''binyanim'' (buildings), which generally indicate the [[voice (grammar)|voice]] of the verb. Most roots are only conjugated in two to five of the seven buildings.

For example, using the root k-t-v (כתב), we might find the forms:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Form || Transliteration || Hebrew || Translation
|-
| ''Pa'al'' || '''katavti''' ||align=right| '''כָּתַּבתִי''' || first-person singular, past tense, active voice: “I wrote”
|-
| ''Nif'al'' || '''nikhtavim''' ||align=right| '''נִכתַּבִים''' || masculine plural, present tense, passive voice: “they are being written”
|-
| ''Hif'il'' || '''hakhtivi''' ||align=right| '''הַכתִּבִי''' || feminine singular, imperative: “dictate!”
|-
| ''Hitpa'el'' || '''yitkatev''' ||align=right| '''יִתכַּתֶב''' || third-person masculine singular, future tense: “he will correspond”
|}

There are relationships between these forms, described below. Although they often accurately describe the relationship between the binyanim, there are many exceptions.

==== Intensification: ''pa'al'' to ''pi'el'' ====
''Pa'al'' and ''pi'el'' are both really &quot;simple active&quot; forms and usually mutually exclusive; verbs that can be conjugated into one form cannot usually be conjugated into the other.  But of those verbs which can be conjugated into both, the ''pi'el'' form connotes an intensified form of the ''pa'al'' form.

| ''Pa'al'' || '''shavar''' ||align=right| '''שָׁבַר''' || Break
|-
| ''Pi'el'' || '''shiber''' ||align=right| '''שִׁבֵּר''' || Shatter
|}

==== The interpersonal triangle: ''pi'el'', ''pu'al'', ''hitpa'el'' ====
Often the ''pi'el'', ''pu'al'' and ''hitpa'el'' forms form a triangle of actions taken between two people (or between a person and his or herself). For instance, from the root g-l-kh (גלח):

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Form || Transliteration || Hebrew || Translation
|-
| ''Pi'el'' || '''gile'akh''' ||align=right| '''גִלֵחַ'''|| to shave (someone)
|-
| ''Pu'al'' || '''gulakh''' ||align=right| '''גֻלַּח''' ||  to be shaved (by someone)
|-
| ''Hitpa'el'' || '''hitgale'akh''' ||align=right| '''הִתְגַּלֵּחַ''' || to shave (oneself)
|}

==== Causative and co-operative: ''hif'il'', ''hitpa'el'' ====
''Hif'il'' is usually the causative of the ''pa'al'' or ''pi'el'' and the ''hitpa'el'' is usually the reflexive, co-operative or &quot;continuous passive&quot;. An example, with k-t-v (כתב):

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Form || Transliteration || Hebrew || Translation
|-
| ''Pa'al'' || '''katav''' ||align=right| '''כָּתַב'''|| to write
|-
| ''Nif'al'' || '''nikhtav''' ||align=right| '''נִכְתּב''' || to be written
|-
| ''Hif'il'' || '''hikhtiv''' ||align=right| '''הִכְתּיב''' || to dictate
|-
| ''Huf'al'' || '''hukhtav''' ||align=right| '''הֻכְתּב''' || to be dictated
|-
| ''Hitpa'el'' || '''hitkatev''' ||align=right| '''הִתְכַּתֵּב''' || to correspond (with)
|}

''Hitgale'akh'' is an example of reflexive ''hitpa'el'' and ''hitkatev'' is reciprocal ''hitpa'el''. However, there also exists a sort of &quot;continuous passive&quot; '''hitpa'el'''. With the root tz-l-m (צלמ):

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Form || Transliteration || Hebrew || Translation
|-
| ''Pi'el'' || '''tzilem''' ||align=right| '''צִלֵּם''' || to photograph
|-
| ''Pu'al'' || '''tzulam''' ||align=right| '''צֻלַּם''' || to be photographed
|-
| ''Hitpa'el'' || '''hitz'talem''' ||align=right| '''הִצְטַלֵּם''' || to become photographed
|}

The difference between tzulam and hitz'talem is this. ''Ani m'tzulam'' (אֲנִי מְצֻלָּם) means ''I am photographed'' (there exists a photo of me) while ''ani mitz'talem'' (אֲנִי מִצְטַלֵּם) means ''I am being photographed'' (I am in the act of being photographed).

===Tense===
Once a verb is cast into a certain form, it then undergoes conjugation into one of the three tenses: past, present, and future.

====Present tense====
A verb in the present tense (הוֹוֶה ''hove'') agrees with its subject in gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural), such that each verb has four present-tense forms:

Personal pronouns are not necessary in the past tense and are often dropped, although colloquially they are sometimes used in the third person.

====Future tense====
A verb in the future tense (עָתִיד ''atid'') agrees with its subject in person and number, and in the second- and third-person singular, gender. The second-person singular masculine and third-person singular feminine forms are identical for all verbs in the future tense. Historically, there were separate feminine forms for the second- and third-person plural (with a נָה- ''nah'' ending, as in תְּשַׁמֵּרְנָה ''tishmarnah'' or תִּגְדַּלְנָה ''tigdalnah''), but these are nowadays considered very archaic.

Like the past tense, personal pronouns are not strictly necessary in the future tense, as the verb forms are sufficient to identify the subject, but colloquially they are frequently used.

===Imperative===
Except for the strictly passive binyanim (''pu'al'' and ''huf'al''), each binyan has distinct imperative forms in the second person. This imperative form is only used for affirmative commands. ''Pa'al'', ''nif'al'', ''pi'el'', and ''hif'il'' form their imperatives by dropping the initial ת of the future-tense form (e.g., ''tiftakh'' (singular, masc.) &amp;rarr; ''ptakh!'' &quot;open!&quot;, ''tishm'ri'' (singular, fem.) &amp;rarr; ''shimri!'' &quot;guard!&quot;); the fifth, ''hitpa'el'', forms its imperative by replacing this initial ת with ה (''titbatel'' &amp;rarr; ''hitbatel'' &quot;do nothing!&quot;).

Negative commands use the particle אל ''al'' followed by the future-tense form. For example, ''al tid'ag'' means &quot;don't worry&quot; (masculine, singular).

The future tense is commonly used for affirmative commands when making requests, so that for example, ''tiftakh'' can mean either &quot;you will open&quot; or &quot;open&quot; (masculine, singular).

The infinitive can be used as a &quot;general imperative&quot; when addressing nobody in particular (e.g. on signs, or when giving general instructions to children or large groups), so that for example, ''lo liftoakh'' can mean either &quot;not to open&quot; or &quot;no opening,&quot; &quot;no one open.&quot;

===Participles ===  

Present participles are identical to present tense forms: ''nerot bo'arim'' (burning candles), ''ha-yalda hi maksima'' (the girl is charming).

Only the pa'al binyan has a true past participle: from k-t-v we have ''katuv'', (written). This gives Hebrew a limited ability to distinguish between a completed action, e.g.:

*''ha-sfarim ketuvim'' (the books have been written)

And, using the present tense of nif'al, which is often the passive of pa'al, a continuing action:

*''ha-sfarim nikhtavim'' (the books are being written)

The passive participle is commonly used as an adjective, as in ''ha-p'kuda ha-katuva'' (the written order).

The present tense of the pu'al and huf'al are used as passive participles for the pi'el and hif'il respectively, e.g. from hif'il ''he'ir'' (light up) we get ''kheder mu'ar'' (illuminated room).

===Infinitives===
Infinitives (''shem hapo'al'') in Hebrew are primarily formed by adding the letter lamed (ל) to the front of the word. The vowels change systematically according to the binyan. 

*כתב ''katav'' (wrote, pa'al) &amp;rarr; לכתוב ''likhtov'' (to write)

*מדבר ''m'daber'' (speak, pi'el) &amp;rarr; לדבר ''l'daber'' (to speak)

*התחיל ''hitkhil'' (start, hif'il) &amp;rarr; להתחיל ''l'hatkhil'' (to start)

*התפלל ''hitpalel'' (pray, hit'pael) &amp;rarr; להתפלל ''l'hitpalel'' (to pray)

*נפגש ''nifgash'' (meet with, nif'al) &amp;rarr; להיפגש ''l'hipagesh'' (to meet with)

There is no infinitive for Pu'al or Huf'al verbs.

===Gerunds ===  

Gerunds (''shmot pe'ula'') are nouns expressing an action. Gerunds are created in Hebrew by putting the root of a verb in a &quot;mishkal&quot; (which will be explained more thoroughly in the &quot;Nouns&quot; later on). Four of the binyanim have gerunds: pa'al, pi'el, hif'il, and hitpa'el. For example:

*שמר  ''shamar'' (guarded &amp;mdash; pa'al) &amp;rarr; שמירה ''sh'mira'' (guarding)
**שב ''shav'' (returned &amp;mdash; hollow pa'al) &amp;rarr; שיבה ''shiva'' (a return)
**שתה  ''shata'' (drank &amp;mdash; weak pa'al) &amp;rarr; שתייה ''sh'tiya'' (drinking)
*ביקר ''biker'' (visited &amp;mdash; pi'el) &amp;rarr; ביקור ''bikur'' (a visit)
*הפתיע ''hiftia'' (surprised &amp;mdash; hif'il) &amp;rarr; הפתעה ''hafta'a'' (a surprise)
*התחמם ''hitkhamem'' (warmed up &amp;mdash; hitpa'el) &amp;rarr; התחממות ''hitkham'mut'' (warming)

==Nouns==  
The Hebrew word for &quot;noun&quot; is שם עצם ''shem etsem''.
   
Hebrew nouns are inflected by gender, number (and sometimes by possession) but not by [[grammatical case|case]]. Nouns are generally correlated to verbs (by shared roots), but their forming is not as systematic, often due to [[loanword|loanwords]] from foreign languages.  
   
===Gender===  
Hebrew distinguishes between masculine nouns&amp;mdash;such as ספר ''sefer'' (book)&amp;mdash;and feminine nouns&amp;mdash;such as דלת ''delet'' (door). 

Feminine nouns can generally be identified by the characteristic endings -a, or -t. There are a large number of nouns, especially ancient ones, that are in some way irregular in their gender. For example, זית ''zayit'' (olive) has a feminine ending, but is masculine and has a masculine plural. עיר ''ir'' (city) has a masculine ending and a masculine plural, but is feminine and takes feminine adjectives.
   
===Number===  
Generally, Hebrew distinguishes between singular and plural forms of a noun. 

Masculine nouns generally form their plural by adding ''-im'':
*מחשב ''makhshev'' (computer) &amp;rarr; מחשבים ''makhshevim''

The addition of the extra syllable often causes the vowel in the first syllable to shorten:
*דבר ''davar'' (thing) &amp;rarr; דברים ''d'varim''

Many common two-syllable masculine nouns, called ''segolates'' because most (but not all) of them have the vowel ''segol'' (''-e-'') in both syllables, undergo more drastic characteristic vowel changes in the plural:
*ילד ''yeled'' (boy) &amp;rarr; ילדים ''y'ladim''
*בוקר ''boker'' (morning) &amp;rarr; בקרים ''b'karim''
*חדר ''kheder'' (room) &amp;rarr; חדרים ''khadarim''

Feminine nouns ending in ''-a'' or ''-at'' generally drop this ending and add ''-ot'', usually without any vowel changes:
*מיטה ''mita'' (bed) &amp;rarr; מיטות ''mitot''
*מסעדה ''mis'ada'' (restaurant) &amp;rarr; מסעדות ''mis'adot''
*צלחת ''tsalakhat'' (plate) &amp;rarr; צלחות ''tsalakhot''

Nouns ending in ''-et'' also replace this ending with ''-ot'', with an ''-e-'' in the preceding syllable usually changing to ''-a'':
*מחברת ''makhberet'' (notebook) &amp;rarr; מחברות ''makhbarot''

Nouns ending in ''-ut'' replace this ending with ''-uyot'':
*חנות ''khanut'' (store) &amp;rarr; חנויות ''khanuyot''

Similarly, nouns ending in ''-it'' replace this ending with ''-iyot'':
*אשכולית ''eshkolit'' (grapefruit) &amp;rarr; אשכוליות ''eshkoliyot''

====Plural exceptions====
A large number of masculine nouns take the &quot;feminine&quot; ending ''-ot'' in the plural:
*מקום ''makom'' (place) &amp;rarr; מקומות ''m'komot''
*חלון ''khalon'' (window) &amp;rarr; חלונות ''khalonot''

A small number of feminine nouns take the &quot;masculine&quot; ending ''-im'':
*מילה ''mila'' (word) &amp;rarr; מילים ''milim''
*שנה ''shana'' (year) &amp;rarr; שנים ''shanim''

Many plurals simply cannot be predicted from the singular at all and must be separately memorized:
*עיר ''ir'' (city) &amp;rarr; ערים ''arim''
*עפרון ''iparon'' (pencil) &amp;rarr; עפרונות ''efronot''
*איש ''ish'' (man/person) &amp;rarr; אנשים ''anashim''

====Dual====
Hebrew also has a dual number, expressed in the ending ''-ayim'', but even in ancient times its use was very restricted. In modern times it is used in expressions of time and number. These nouns have plurals as well, which are used for numbers higher than two, for example:

{|
! Singular || Double || Triple
|-
| פעם אחת ''pa'am akhat'' (once)
| פעמיים ''pa'amayim'' (twice) 
| שלוש פעמים ''shalosh pa'amim'' (thrice)
|-
| שבוע אחד ''shavua ekhad'' (one week)
| שבועיים ''shavuayim'' (two weeks)
| שלושה שבועות ''shalosha shavuot'' (three weeks)
|-
| מאה ''mei'a'' (one hundred)
| מאתיים ''ma'atayim'' (two hundred)
| שלוש מאות ''shalosh me'ot'' (three hundred)
|}

The dual is also used for some body parts, for instance:

*רגל ''regel'' (leg) &amp;rarr; רגליים ''raglayim'' (legs)
*אוזן ''ozen'' (ear) &amp;rarr; אוזניים ''oznayim'' (ears)

In this case, even if there are more than two, the dual is still used, for instance לכלב יש ארבע רגליים ''l'kelev yeish arba raglayim'' (a dog has four legs).

The dual is also used for certain objects that are &quot;inherently&quot; dual. These words have no singular, for instance משקפיים ''mishkafayim'' (eyeglasses) and מספריים ''misparayim'' (scissors). As in the English &quot;two pairs of pants&quot;, the plural of these words uses the word זוג ''zug'' (pair), e.g. שני זוגות מספריים ''shnai zugot misparayim'' (two pairs of scissors).

===Noun construct===
Hebrew's [[genitive case]] is achieved by placing two nouns next to each other. This is called a noun construct, or סמיכות ''s'mikhut''. The second noun can be viewed as an adjective modifying the first noun.

The first noun in a noun construct must be in its ''construct form''. The construct form can generally be derived easily:
*The masculine plural ending ים- ''-im'' changes to י- ''-ei''
*The feminine singular ending ה- ''-a'' changes to ת- ''-'at''

There are many words (usually ancient ones) that have other changes in vocalization in the construct form. For example, the construct form of בית ''bayit'' (house) is ''beit''.

In addition, the definite article is placed on the second word. 

*בית ספר ''beit sefer'' (a school) literally, &quot;house of book&quot; or &quot;book house&quot;
*בית הספר ''beit ha-sefer'' (the school)
*בתי חולים ''b'tei kholim'' (hospitals) literally, &quot;houses of sick people&quot; or &quot;sick people houses&quot;
*עוגת השוקולד ''ugat ha-shokolad'' (the chocolate cake)
*דואר אוויר ''do'ar avir'' (air mail)
*כלב רחוב ''kelev r'khov'' (a street dog)
*בקבוק החלב ''bakbuk ha-khalav'' (the bottle of milk)

===Possession=== 
Possession is generally indicated by conjugating the possessive [[pronoun]] של ''shel'' (of, belonging to):
*הספר שלי ''ha-sefer sheli'' (my book)
*הדירה שלך ''ha-dira shelkha'' (your apartment).
*המשחק של אנדר ''ha-miskhak shel ender'' ([[Ender's Game]])

In literary style, nouns are inflected to show possession through noun declension; a personal suffix is added to the construct form of the noun (the same form used by the סמיכות ''smikhut''). So, ספרי ''sifrei'' (books, construct form) can be inflected to form ספריי ''sifrai'' (my books), ספרייך ''sifraikha'' (your books), ספרינו ''sifreinu'' (our books) and so forth, while דירת ''dirat'' (apartment, construct form) gives דירתי ''dirati'' (my apartment), דירתך ''diratkha'' (your apartment), דירתינו ''dirateinu'' (our apartment), etc.

While the use of these forms is mostly restricted to formal and literary speech, they are in regular use in some colloquial phrases, for instance, מה שלומך ''ma shlomkha?'' (&quot;what is your peace?&quot; or &quot;how are you?&quot;) or לדעתי ''l'da'ati'' (in my opinion).

In addition, the inflected possessive is commonly used for terms of kinship, for instance בני ''bni'' (my son), בתם ''bitam'' (their daughter), אשתו ''ishto'' (his wife) are preferred to הבן שלי ''ha-ben sheli'', הבת שלכם ''ha-bat shelahem'', and האשה שלו ''ha-isha shelo''.

===Noun derivation===  
In the same way that Hebrew verbs are conjugated by applying various prefixes, suffixes and internal vowel combinations, Hebrew nouns can be formed by applying various &quot;meters&quot; (Hebrew ''mishkalim'') to the same roots. Gerunds are one example (see above). 

The words for many abstract concepts are derived by adding the ending ''-ut'' to another noun or a verb (usually hit'pael):
*ספר ''sefer'' (book) &amp;rarr; ספרות ''sifrut'' (literature)
*התייעץ ''hitya'etz'' (consult) &amp;rarr; התייעצות ''hitya'atzut'' (advice)
*התרגש ''hitragesh'' (get excited) &amp;rarr; התרגשות ''hitrag'shut'' (excitement)

The ''katlan'' meter, applied to a verb, indicates &quot;someone who does this&quot;:
*שיקר ''shiker'' (lie) &amp;rarr; שקרן ''shakran'' (liar)
*פחד ''pakhad'' (be afraid) &amp;rarr; פחדן ''pakhdan'' (coward)

The suffix ''-on'' denotes a smaller version of something:
*ספר ''sefer'' (book) &amp;rarr; ספרון ''sifron'' (booklet)
*מחשב ''makhshev'' (computer) &amp;rarr; מחשבון ''makhshevon'' (calculator)

Repeating the last two letters of a noun or adjective can also denote a smaller or lesser version:
*כלב ''kelev'' (dog) &amp;rarr; כלבלב ''k'lavlav'' (puppy)
*קצר ''katsar'' (short) &amp;rarr; קצרצר ''k'tsartsar'' (very short)

The ''katelet'' mishkal can have a variety of meanings:
*אדום ''adom'' (red) &amp;rarr; אדמת ''ademet'' (measles)
*כלב ''kelev'' (dog) &amp;rarr; כלבת ''kalevet'' (rabies)
*נייר ''n'yar'' (paper) &amp;rarr; ניירת ''naiyeret'' (paperwork)
*כסף ''kesef'' (money) &amp;rarr; כספת ''kasefet'' (a safe)

New nouns are also often formed by the addition of two existing stems:
*קול ''kol'' (sound) + נוע ''noa'' (motion) &amp;rarr; קולנוע ''kolnoa'' (cinema)

A combination of methods (The example has the katlan meter plus the ending ''-ut''):
*תועלת ''to'elet'' (benefit) &amp;rarr; תועלתנות ''to'al'tanut'' (utilitarianism)

==Adjectives==
The Hebrew adjective שם תואר ''shem toar'' comes after the noun and agrees with it in gender and number:
*ספר קטן ''sefer katan''  (small book)
*ספרים קטנים ''sfarim k'tanim'' (small books)
*בובה קטנה ''buba k'tana'' (small doll)
*בובות קטנות ''bubot k'tanot'' (small dolls)

Adjectives ending in ''-i'' have slightly different forms:
*איש מקומי ''ish m'komi'' (a local man)
*אשה מקומית ''isha m'komit'' (a local woman)
*אנשים מקומיים ''anashim m'komiyim'' (local people)
*נשים מקומיות ''nashim m'komiyot'' (local women)

Masculine nouns that take the &quot;feminine&quot; plural ending ''-ot'' still take masculine plural adjectives, e.g. מקומות יפים ''m'komot yafim'' (beautiful places). The reverse goes for feminine plural nouns ending in ''-im'', e.g. מילים ארוכות ''milim arukot'' (long words).

Note also that many adjectives, like segolate nouns, change their vowel structure in the feminine and plural.

===Use of the definite article with adjectives===
In Hebrew, an adjective that modifies a definite noun (including proper nouns) also takes the definite article:
*הספר הקטנים ''ha-sefer ha-katan'' (the small book)
*הבובות הקטנות ''ha-bubot ha-k'tanot'' (the small dolls)
*רותי הקטנה ''ruti ha-k'tana'' (little Ruthie; Ruthie the small)

===Adjectives derived from verbs===
Many adjectives in Hebrew are derived from the present tense of verbs. These adjectives are inflected the same way as the verbs they are derived from:
*סוער ''so'er'' (stormy, pa'al) &amp;rarr; סוערת ''so'eret'', סוערים ''so'arim'', סוערות ''so'arot''
*מנותק ''menutak'' (alienated, pu'al) gives מנותקת ''menuteket'', מנותקים ''menutakim'', מנותקות ''menutakot''
*מרשים ''marshim'' (impressive, hif'il) gives מרשימה ''marshima'', מרשימים ''marshimim'', מרשימות ''marshimot''

==Adverbs==
The Hebrew term for adverb is תואר הפועל ''toar ha'po'al''.

Hebrew forms adverbs in several different ways.

A few common adjectives can use the masculine singular form as an adverb as well, for instance חזק ''khazak'' (strongly), יפה ''yafe'' (nicely) or ברור ''barur'' (clearly).

Some adjectives have a unique adverb that must be memorized, for instance מהר ''maher'' (quickly) or לאט ''l'at'' (slowly). These forms cannot be used as adjectives (the corresponding adjectives are מהיר ''mahir'' and איטי ''iti'').

In most cases, though, the adverb will be expressed by some sort of '''adverbial phrase'''. Many adjectives prefer the prefix ''b'-'' plus a noun, for instance ''b'zehirut'' (carefully); בעדינות ''b'adinut'' (gently). 

Others prefer באופן ''b'ofen'' (in a nature/fashion) plus a masculine singular adjective, or בצורה ''b'tsura'' (in a form) plus a feminine singular, e.g. באופן מאפיין ''b'ofen me'afyen'' (characteristically) or בצורה אלגניטית ''b'tsura elegantit'' (elegantly).

The use of one of these methods does not necessarily preclude the use of the others: even though לאט ''l'at'' exists, for instance, one may also use באיטיות ''b'itiut'' to express &quot;slowly&quot; in a more elegant way.

== Miscellaneous ==
=== Indirect objects ===
Indirect objects are objects requiring a preposition other than את ''et''. The preposition used depends on the verb, and these can be very different than the one used in English. A good dictionary is required to look these up. In the case of definite indirect objects, the preposition will replace את ''et''.

* אני שכחתי מהבחירות ''ani shakhakhti me-ha-b'khirot'' (I forgot about the election)

The Hebrew grammar distinguishes between various kinds of indirect objects, according to what they specify. Thus, there is a division between objects for time (''te'ur z'man''), objects for place (''te'ur makom''), objects for reason (''te'ur siba'') and many others.
&lt;!-- Additionally, Hebrew distinguishes between various kinds of verbless fragments according to their use, such as ''t'mura'' for elaboration, ''k'ri'a'' for exclamation, ''p'niya'' for approach and ''hesger'' for disclosing the opinion of another party using direct speech (e.g. לדעת הרופא, העישון מזיק לבריאות ''l'da'at ha'rofe, ha'ishun mazik la'briut'' (in the doctor's opinion, smoking is harmful to health'').--&gt;

=== Impersonal sentences ===
A sentence may lack a subject. In this case it is called סתמי ''s'tami'', or indefinite. If several parts of the sentence have the same function and are attached to the same word, they are called ''kolel'', or collective. Two or more sentences that do not share common parts and are separated by comma are called משפט מחובר ''mishpat m'khubar'', or joined sentences. In many cases, the second sentence uses a pronoun that stands for the other's subject; they are generally interconnected.

=== Relative clauses ===
A sentence in which one or more of the parts are replaced by a clause (''p'sukit'') is called a ''mishpat murkav'' (compound sentence). Compound sentences usually use the conjunctional prefix ש ''she-'' (usually &quot;that&quot;). For example, in the sentence ''Yosi omer she-hu okhel.'' (Yosi says that he is eating.), ''Yosi omer'' (Yosi says) is the main sentence and ''hu okhel'' (he is eating) is the direct subject clause that follows it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hebrew [[phonology]]''' must take into account that the [[Hebrew language]] has been used primarily for [[liturgy|liturgical]] purposes for most of the past two millennia. As a consequence, its pronunciation has been strongly influenced by the [[vernacular]] of each individual [[Jew]]ish community. In contrast to the varied development of these pronunciations is the relatively rapid development of modern [[Israel]]i Hebrew.

==Basic Hebrew alphabet==

===Consonants===

''Note:  dagesh and mappiq symbols, the dots in otherwise identical letters, are often omitted in writing.  For instance, &amp;#64305; is often written as &amp;#1489;.  The use or omission of such marks is usually consistent throughout any given context.''

==Notes on writing==

# The [[phoneme]] /v/ is represented by two letters: vet (&amp;#1489;, unemphasized bet) and vav (&amp;#1493;). Although modern Hebrew pronunciation does not differentiate between the two, the latter is historically weaker due to its being a semi-vowel (/w/).
# The phoneme /k/ is represented by two letters: kaf (&amp;#1499;) and quf (&amp;#1511;). Although modern Israeli Hebrew pronunciation doesn't differentiate between the two, the latter is pronounced by some speakers like an Arabic /[[voiceless uvular plosive|q]]/.
# The phoneme /t/ is represented by two letters: tet (&amp;#1496;) and tau (&amp;#1514;, compare to the [[Greek language|Greek]] theta &amp;#952; and tau &amp;#964;). As mentioned earlier, the former was once pronounced with emphasis. However, it seems that the letter ''tau'', when intervocalic and non-doubled (i.e. without dagesh) once represented a [[voiceless interdental fricative|fricative]] phoneme {{IPA|/&amp;#952;/}}. For example, what in Modern Hebrew sounds as &quot;Beit Lexem&quot; was transcribed (through Greek, which is ill-equipped to represent /h/) into English from Old Hebrew as &quot;Bethleem&quot;, also demonstrating note nr. 5. The traditional Ashkenazi pronunciation of tau without dagesh as &quot;s&quot; appears to be a continuation of this former distinction.
# Similar to Modern [[Arabic language|Arabic]], old Hebrew had the phonemes {{IPA|/&amp;#678;/}} and /t/ (written by the letter tet) emphasized. Currently, the only community of Hebrew-speakers which expresses this in speech are [[Yemenite Jew]]s, whose Hebrew is much-influenced by Arabic phonetics (or rather ''not'' influenced by [[Yiddish]] and other European languages); however the emphasis led to several types of phonetic change that still exist. The exact nature of the emphatic feature is a matter of debate; the most commonly suggested possibilities are pharyngealization (as in Arabic) and glottalization (as in [[Geez language|Ethiopic]]).
# In the speech of Ashkenazi modern Hebrew speakers, the phoneme /x/ is represented by two letters: xet (&amp;#1495;) and khaf (&amp;#1499;). Xet is presumed to historically have been a [[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]] (like Arabic &amp;#1581;).  The voiceless pharyngeal fricative pronunciation {{unicode|/&amp;#7717;/}} is found in the speech of many Teimanim, Mizrachim and Sephardim, who, like Ashkenazim, pronounce khaf as /x/.

On the other hand, no lexical items exist for &quot;son&quot; and &quot;daughter&quot;, but the words for &quot;boy&quot; and &quot;girl&quot; are applied with possessive suffixes. Nevertheless, the terms are differentiated with different declension or lexemes:

==Writing system==
For more information see also [[Hungarian alphabet]].

Hungarian is written using a variant of the [[Latin alphabet]], and has a [[phoneme|phonemic]] orthography, i.e. pronunciation can generally be predicted from the written language. In addition to the standard letters of the Latin alphabet, Hungarian uses several additional letters.  These include letters with acute accents ''(á,é,í,ó,ú)'' which represent long vowels, with umlauts (''ö'' and ''ü'') and their long counterparts ''ő'' and ''ű''. Sometimes ''ô'' or ''õ'' is used for ''ő'' and ''û'' for ''ű'', due to the limitations of the [[ISO 8859-1|Latin-1 / ISO-8859-1 codepage]], though these are not part of the Hungarian language. Hungarian can be properly represented with the [[ISO 8859-2|Latin-2 / ISO-8859-2 codepage]], but this codepage is not always available. (Hungarian is the only language using both ''ő'' and ''ű''.) Of course, [[Unicode]] includes them, and they therefore can be used on the Internet.

For a complete table of the pronunciation of the Hungarian alphabet, see [[:hu:X-SAMPA Magyar nyelvhez|the X-SAMPA description in the Hungarian Wikipedia]] (in Hungarian, but the table is obvious), which transliterates Hungarian letters into [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] and [[X-SAMPA]] characters.

Additionally, the letter pairs &amp;lt;ny&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;ty&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;gy&amp;gt; represent the palatal consonants {{IPA|/&amp;#626;/}}, {{IPA|/c/}}, and {{IPA|/&amp;#607;/}} (a little like the &quot;dy&quot; sound in British &quot;''du''ke&quot; or American &quot;woul''d y''ou&quot;).
Hungarian uses &amp;lt;s&amp;gt; for {{IPA|/&amp;#643;/}} and &amp;lt;sz&amp;gt; for /s/, which is the reverse of [[Polish language|Polish]]. &lt;zs&gt; is {{IPA|/&amp;#658;/}} and &amp;lt;cs&amp;gt; is {{IPA|/&amp;#679;/}}. All these digraphs are considered single letters.  &lt;ly&gt; is also a &quot;single letter digraph&quot;, but is pronounced like /j/ (English &amp;lt;y&amp;gt;), and mostly appears in old words. More exotic letters are &amp;lt;dz&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;dzs&amp;gt; {{IPA|/&amp;#676;/}}. They are hard to find even in a longer text. Examples are ''madzag'' (&quot;string&quot;), ''edzeni'' (&quot;to train (athletically)&quot;) and ''dzsungel'' (&quot;jungle&quot;).

Single R's are tapped, like the Spanish &quot;pero&quot;; Double R's and initial R's are trilled, like the Spanish &quot;perro&quot;.

Hungarian distinguishes between long and short vowels, where the long vowels are written with acutes, and between long consonants and short consonants, where the long consonants are written double. The digraphs, when doubled, become trigraphs: &lt;sz&gt;+&lt;sz&gt;=&lt;ssz&gt;, but when wrapping a line, all letters are written out:
:... ''busz-''
:''szal''...

Usually a trigraph is a double digraph, but there are a few exceptions: ''tizennyolc'' &quot;eighteen&quot; is ''tizen'' + ''nyolc''. There are doubling minimal pairs: ''tol'' (''push'') vs. ''toll'' (''feather'' or ''pen'').

While it seems unusual to English speakers at first, once one learns the new orthography and pronunciations, written Hungarian is nearly totally phonemic.

==Name order==
The Hungarian language uses the so-called eastern [[Personal name#Name order|name order]], in which the [[family name]] comes first and the [[given name]] comes last. However, as a rule, names are represented in the western name order when used in foreign languages. Thus for example [[Edward Teller]], the Hungarian-born physicist, is known in Hungary as '''Teller Ede'''.

On the other hand, western names retain their order when used in Hungarian. Therefore:

*''Kiss János'', amikor Los Angelesben járt, látta ''John Travoltát''.
translates to
*When ''János Kiss''{{ref|nametr}} was in Los Angeles, he saw ''John Travolta''.

'''Note:'''

{{note|nametr}} or ''John Kiss''. While common prior to the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, given names are usually not translated into English.

See also: [[Hungarian name]].

==Examples==
When a word has its own stress (rather than clinging on the previous ones), it is practically always placed on the first syllable in Hungarian.

*Hungarian (person, language): ''magyar'' {{IPA|[mɑɟʝɑr]}}
*hello: ''szia'' {{IPA|[siɑ]}} (informal) (sounds almost exactly like American &quot;see ya&quot;) But you only say this to people that you know well. When you address a stranger you use the more formal &quot;good day&quot;: ''jó napot (kívánok)'' {{IPA|[joːnɑpot]}}
*good-bye: ''viszontlátásra'' (formal) (see above), ''viszlát'' {{IPA|[vislaːt]}} (semi informal)
*please: ''kérem (szépen)''  {{IPA|[keːrɛm seːpɛn]}} (This literally means &quot;I ask (it) well&quot;.  See next for a more common form of the polite request)
*I would like ____, please: ''Szeretnék ____'' {{IPA|[sɛrɛtneːk]}} (This example illustrates the use of the [[conditional tense]], as a common form of a polite request) 
*sorry: ''bocsánat'' {{IPA|[botʃaːnɑt]}}
*thank you: ''köszönöm'' {{IPA|[køsønøm]}}
*that/this: ''az'' {{IPA|[ɑz]}} ''ez''{{IPA|[ɛz]}}
*how much?: ''mennyi?'' {{IPA|[mɛɲɲi]}}
*how much does it cost?: ''mennyibe kerül?'' {{IPA|[mɛɲɲibe kɛryl]}}
*yes: ''igen'' {{IPA|[iɡɛn]}}
*no: ''nem'' {{IPA|[nɛm]}}
*I don't understand: ''nem értem'' {{IPA|[nɛm eːrtɛm]}}
*I don't know: ''nem tudom'' {{IPA|[nɛm tudom]}}
*Where's the toilet?: ''Hol van a vécé?'' {{IPA|[hol vɑn ɑ veːtseː]}} (vécé/veːtseː is the Hungarian pronouncation of the English abbreviation of &quot;Water Closet&quot;), more polite (and word-for-word) version ''Hol van a mosdó?'' {{IPA|[hol vɑn ɑ moʃdoː]}}
*generic toast: ''egészségedre!'' {{IPA|[ɛɡeːsʃeːɡɛdrɛ]}}
*juice: ''gyümölcslé'' {{IPA|[ɟʝymøltʃleː]}}
*water: ''víz'' {{IPA|[viːz]}}
*wine: ''bor'' {{IPA|[bor]}}
*beer: ''sör'' {{IPA|[ʃør]}}
*tea: ''tea'' {{IPA|[tɛɑ]}}
*milk: ''tej'' {{IPA|[tej]}}
*Do you speak English?: ''Beszél angolul?''  {{IPA|[bɛseːl ɑnɡolul]}}
*I love you: ''szeretlek'' {{IPA|[sɛrɛtlɛk]}}
*Help!: ''Segítség!'' {{IPA|[ʃɛɡiːtʃeːɡ]}}

===Marc Martin===

The book ''Járt utat kétszer járj'' (&quot;Tread twice the trodden path&quot;, 
ISBN 9633675820) was published in 2004, a sultry declaration of love for the Hungarian language, written by a native Frenchman, a translator, Marc Martin. (His name is given on the cover in the Hungarianized form, ''Martin Márk''.) He first met the language through a record of [[Bluebeard's Castle]] by [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]]. The back cover dedication was written by [[Péter Nádas]] (whose novel ''A Book of Memories'' he had translated into French). The &quot;trodden path&quot; refers to his original life, family, neighbourhood, which he wanted to break away from, by being re-born into a new life and a new language.

== Controversy over origins==

Mainstream linguistics holds that Hungarian is part of the Uralic family of languages, related ultimately to languages such as [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Nenets language|Nenets]]. However, there exist various alternative speculations about the origins of the Hungarian language, even fanciful ideas about Hungarian being derived from the [[Sumerian language]], but these are dismissed by linguists owing to a lack of evidence:
* Hungarian has often been claimed to be related to [[Hunnic language|Hunnish]], since Hungarian legends and histories show close ties between the two peoples. (although the name &quot;Hunor&quot; can also show a link with Khanti.) Some people believe that the [[Székely]], a part of the Hungarians living in Romania, are descended from the [[Huns]]. However, the link with Hunnish is uncertain, and it is not even known which languages the Huns spoke. 
* For many years (from [[1869]]), it was matter of dispute whether Hungarian was a Finno-Ugric/Uralic language, or was more closely related to the [[Turkic languages]], a controversy known as the &quot;Ugric-Turkish war&quot;. Hungarians did absorb some Turkic influences during several centuries of co-habitation. For example, it appears that the Hungarians learned animal breeding techniques from the Turkic [[Chuvash]], as a high proportion of words specific to agriculture and livestock are of Chuvash origin. There was also a strong Chuvash influence in burial customs. Furthermore, all Ugric languages, not just Hungarian, have Turkic loanwords related to horse riding. Nonetheless, the science of linguistics shows that the basic wordstock and morphological patterns of the Hungarian language are solidly based on a Uralic heritage.

The '''Hewlett-Packard Company''' {{nyse|HPQ}}, commonly known as '''HP''', is one of the world's largest [[information technology]] corporations. Headquartered in [[Palo Alto, California]], [[United States]], it has a global presence in the fields of computing, printing, and digital imaging, and also sells software and services.

==Company history==
===From 1939 until the seventies===
HP was founded as a manufacturer of test and measurement instruments with a [[United States dollar|US$]]500 investment in a [[Palo Alto]], [[California|CA]] [http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/garage/ garage] in [[1939]] by [[William Hewlett|Bill Hewlett]] and [[David Packard|Dave Packard]]. They had both graduated from [[Stanford University]] in [[1934]]. Their first product was a precision audio [[oscillator]], the Model 200A. Their innovation was the use of a small night-[[light bulb]] as a temperature dependent [[resistor]] in a critical portion of the circuit. This allowed them to sell the Model 200A for $54.40 when competitors were selling less stable oscillators for over $200. Their company's name, Hewlett-Packard, was derived from their last names and had Bill not won the coin toss, the company today could have been known as Packard-Hewlett. One of the company's earliest customers was [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]], who bought eight Model 200B oscillators (at $71.50 each) for use in testing the [[Fantasound]] [[surround sound|stereophonic sound]] system for the movie ''[[Fantasia (movie)|Fantasia]]''.

===First Computers===
[[Image:HP0100A 1.jpg|thumb|&quot;The new Hewlett-Packard 9100A personal computer&quot; is &quot;ready, willing, and able ... to relieve you of waiting to get on the big computer.&quot;]]
HP is [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.12/mustread.html?pg=11 acknowledged by] ''[[Wired Magazine|Wired]]'' magazine as the producer of the world's first [[personal computer]], in [[1968]], the Hewlett-Packard 9100A. HP called it a desktop calculator because, as Bill Hewlett said, &quot;If we had called it a computer, it would have been rejected by our customers' computer gurus because it didn't look like an [[IBM mainframe|IBM]]. We therefore decided to call it a calculator, and all such nonsense disappeared&quot;.   An engineering triumph at the time, the logic circuit was produced without any [[integrated circuits]]; the assembly of the CPU having been entirely executed in discrete components.  The mathematical functions and programmability rival the most powerful scientific calculators of the present day.   With CRT readout, magnetic card storage, and printer the price was around $5000.

The company earned global respect for a variety of products. They introduced the world's first ''handheld scientific electronic [[calculator]]'' in [[1972]] (the [[HP-35]]), the first ''handheld programmable'' in [[1974]] (the [[HP-65]]), the first ''alphanumeric, programmable, expandable'' in [[1979]] (the [[HP-41|HP-41C]]), and the first symbolic and graphing calculator [[HP-28C]].  Like their scientific and business calculators, their [[oscilloscope]]s, [[logic analyzer]]s, and other measurement instruments have a reputation for sturdiness and usability (the latter products are now part of spin-off [[Agilent Technologies|Agilent]]'s product line).  The company's design philosophy in this period was summarized as &quot;design for the guy at the next bench&quot;.

HP is recognized as the symbolic founder of [[Silicon Valley]], although it did not actively investigate semiconductor devices until a few years after the &quot;[[Traitorous Eight]]&quot; had abandoned [[William Shockley]] to create [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] in [[1957]].   Hewlett-Packard's [[HP Associates]] division, established around [[1960]], developed semiconductor devices primarily for internal use. Instruments and calculators were some of the products using these devices.

===The eighties and beyond===
In [[1984]], HP introduced both [[inkjet printer|inkjet]] and [[laser printer]]s for the desktop.  Along with its [[scanner (computing)|scanner]] product line, these have later been developed into successful [[multifunctional|multifunction]] products, the most significant being single-unit printer/scanner/copier/fax machines.  As of [[2003]], HP's major competitors in this growing part of the [[Small Office, Home Office|home office]] market are [[Brother Industries, Ltd.|Brother]], [[Canon (company)|Canon]], [[Epson]], and [[Lexmark]]. Another vendor of note who rivals HP printers is [[Dell, Inc.|Dell]], who rebrands and repackages Lexmark products.

In the [[1990s]], HP expanded their computer product line, which initially had been targeted at university, research, and business customers, to reach consumers.  HP also grew through acquisitions, buying [[Apollo Computer]] in 1989, [[Convex Computer]] in 1995, and [[Compaq]] in 2002.  Compaq itself had bought [[Tandem Computers]] in 1997 (which had been started by ex-HP employees), and [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] in 1998.  Following this strategy HP became a major player in desktops, laptops, and servers for many different markets.  The buyout made HP the world's largest manufacturer of personal computers.

In [[1987]], the [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] garage where Hewlett and Packard started their business was designated as a California State historical landmark. However, [[Agilent Technologies]], not HP, bears the legacy of the original company founded in 1939, as evidenced by Agilent's portfolio of electronic instruments descended from HP's earliest products. Agilent was spun off from HP in [[1999]].

'''HPshopping.com''' was launched in [[1998]] as HP's direct-to-consumer e-commerce store, and in [[1999]] became incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary. In [[2002]], [[Compaq]]'s direct-to-consumer e-commerce store, CompaqAtHome, joined [[hpshopping.com]], creating a comprehensive, one-stop, on-line store for HP and Compaq home and home-office products. 

Many long-time HP calculator users were surprised and disappointed when HP announced in March 2002 that the company would no longer manufacture financial and scientific calculators &amp;ndash; a product line and, indeed, a market, that HP had started thirty years before. The decision was especially hard to fathom in light of the [[HP-48]] graphing calculator range's success. However, despite its spring 2002 press release stating the opposite, the company nevertheless returned to the market during the fall of [[2003]] with several new models (flagship: [[HP-49G_Plus#hp_49g.2B|HP-49g+]]) competing against similar offerings from competitor [[Texas Instruments]].  The extremely popular [[HP-12C]] financial calculator, introduced in 1981, still remains in production today.

==HP today==
In 2002, Hewlett-Packard merged with [[Compaq]], a controversial move intended to make the company the personal computing leader.  The merger opposition was led by [[Walter Hewlett]], son of original founder William Hewlett.

Hewlett-Packard is a supporter of [[FOSS]] and [[Linux]]. Some HP employees, such as Linux CTO and former [[Debian]] Project Leader Bdale Garbee actcenturies, and their change due to the influence of the [[Irish language]] on these forms of English. The linguistic interference of the Irish language on the English spoken in Ireland is most clearly seen in those areas where Irish is still spoken as a mother tongue or where it has survived until recently.

The standard spelling and grammar are the same as UK English but, especially in the spoken language, there are some unique characteristics, due to the influence of the [[Irish language]] on pronunciation.

== Pronunciation ==
Hiberno-English retains many [[phonemic differentiation]]s merged in other accents of English. Phonetic transcriptions are given using [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]].

* With some local exceptions (most notably [[Drogheda]] and some other eastern towns, whose accent is distinctly [[non-rhotic]]), 'r' is pronounced wherever it occurs in the word, making Irish English a generally [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]] dialect.
* 't' is rarely pronounced as a plosive when not at the beginning of a word, instead being a fricative between 's' and 'sh'
* The distinction of ''w'' {{IPA|[w]}} and ''wh'' {{IPA|[&amp;#653;]}}, as in ''wine'' vs ''whine'' is preserved.
* In some varieties, [[Phonological history of the low back vowels#Father-bother merger|Merger of the vowels in ''father'' and ''bother'']] in Southern Irish English; {{IPA|/fɑːðɚ/}} and {{IPA|/bɑːðɚ/}}.
* In some varieties /{{IPA|θ/}} becomes /t&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;/, and /{{IPA|ð/}} and /d/ merge, making ''thin'' and ''tin'' and ''then'' and ''den'' near-homonyms, with the pair ''tin'' and ''den'' employing [[alveolar]] pronunciation (as in other varieties of English), while the pair ''thin'' and ''then'' are distinuished by using [[dental]] pronunciations, as in e.g. [[French language|French]]. In still other varieties, only /{{IPA|θ/}} is hardened to /t&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;/, with /{{IPA|ð}}/ left unchanged; some dialects of Gaelic pronounce &quot;slender&quot; (palatalized) ''d'' as {{IPA|/ð&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;/}}.
* The distinction between {{IPA|/ɔːɹ/}} and {{IPA|/oʊɹ/}} in ''horse'' and ''hoarse'' is preserved.
* The distinction between {{IPA|[&amp;#603;&amp;#633;]}}-{{IPA|[&amp;#618;&amp;#633;]}}-{{IPA|[&amp;#652;&amp;#633;]}} in ''herd-bird-curd'' is preserved.
* &quot;l&quot; is clear wherever it occurs in a word, as in French
* 'Pure' vowels: &quot;boat&quot;, in a traditional accent, is pronounced {{IPA|/boːt/}}, and cane is pronounced {{IPA|/keːn/}}
* The &quot;i&quot; in &quot;night&quot; may be pronounced {{IPA|/ɔɪ/}}. 
* The &quot;u&quot; in Dublin may be pronounced {{IPA|/ʊ/}}. 
* In [[County Cork]], some vowel sounds are often altered. An &quot;e&quot; sound becomes an &quot;i&quot; (&quot;well&quot; becomes &quot;will&quot;). Also &quot;Cork&quot; is locally pronounced as {{IPA|/kɑːɹk/}}.
* An accent unique to Dublin known as the [[Dublin 4]] intonation (referring to the local [[Dublin postal districts|postal district]]) is an urban/suburban middle class feature. This is an oft derided [[posh]] [[dialect]] that renders words such as 'car' as 'core' and 'far' as 'fore'. [[Dublin 4]] speakers often end a sentence with the [[high rising terminal|rising question]] 'Do you know what I mean?' contracted and pronounced rapidly as 'Dja kneww whad I min?'
* Similarly the [[working-class]] Dublin accent is a unique urban feature resembling the [[blue-collar]] accents of [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]] in [[England]]. This dialect includes phrases such as 'What's the story, Bud?' meaning 'How are you, friend?' pronounced 'Wats de stary bud?' and 'Mad out of it!' pronounced 'Mad ou vih!' meaning [[drunk]] or intoxicated by [[Psychoactive drug|drugs]]. 'Giddup de yaard' or 'gerrup de yaard' means 'Get lost!' or 'I disagree.'
* In some old-fashioned varieties, words spelled with ''ea'' and pronounced with {{IPA|[i&amp;#720;]}} in RP are pronounced with {{IPA|[e&amp;#720;]}}, for example ''meat'', ''beat''.
* In words where &quot;oo&quot; usually forms an {{IPA|/ʌ/}} sound, it may be changed to an {{IPA|/uː/}} sound, e.g. ''book'' is pronounced &quot;buke&quot;.

== Grammar derived from Irish ==

The Irish language has no words which directly translate as &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, instead the verb in a question is repeated in an answer.  People in Ireland have a tendency to repeat the verb, positively or negatively, instead of using &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot; 

* &quot;Are you coming home soon?&quot;  &quot;I am.&quot;
* &quot;Is your mobile charged?&quot; &quot;It isn't.&quot;

(However, quite a number of people in Ireland, especially younger people, exclusively use the words '''yes''' and '''no''', as elsewhere in the English-speaking world.) 

Alternatively, it is common for Irish English-speakers to use the word &quot;aye&quot; as a weak form of &quot;yes&quot; (somewhat akin to &quot;sure&quot; or &quot;yeah&quot;).
* &quot;It's getting late, is it?&quot; &quot;Aye, it is.&quot;  or &quot; It is, aye. &quot; in [[County Donegal|Donegal]].
* &quot;Is that okay with you?&quot; &quot;Aye.&quot;

Irish verbs have two present tenses, one indicating what is occurring at this instant and another used for continuous actions. For example, 'you are now' is ''tá tú anois'' (literally 'are you now'), but 'you are every day' is ''bíonn tú gach lá'' (literally 'be you each day'; or, 'you do be every day').

Irish speakers of English, especially in rural areas, especially north Mayo/Sligo, use the verb &quot;to be&quot; in English similarly to how they would in Irish, using a &quot;does be/do be&quot; (or &quot;bes&quot;, although less frequently) construction to indicate this latter continuous present:
* &quot;He does be working every day.&quot;
* &quot;They do be talking on their mobiles a lot.&quot; 
* &quot;They bes doing a lot of work at school.&quot; (rare)
* &quot;It's him I do be thinking of.&quot;

Irish has no pluperfect tense: instead, &quot;after&quot; is added to the present continuous (a verb ending in &quot;-ing&quot;).  The idiom for &quot;I had done X when I did Y&quot; is &quot;I was after doing X when I did Y&quot;, modelled on the Irish usage of the compound prepositions ''i ndiaidh'', ''tar éis'', and ''in éis'': ''bhí mé tar éis/i ndiaidh/in éis X a dhéanamh, nuair a rinne mé Y''.  This can most commonly be heard used by Dubliners.
* &quot;Why did you hit him?&quot; &quot;He was after insulting me.&quot;
A similar construction is seen with the 'hot news perfect', used to express extreme excitement at something which has happened recently:
* &quot;Jaysus, I'm after hitting him with de car!&quot;
* &quot;Would ya look at yer one &amp;mdash; she's after losing five stone in five weeks!&quot;

Less explosively, using what might be termed the 'warm news perfect', the Irish perfect can indicate a recent action of less stellar importance, strongly resembling the [[German language|German]] spoken perfect in structure:
* &quot;I have the car fixed.&quot; ''Tá an glúisteán atosaithe agam.''
* &quot;I have me breakfast eaten.&quot; ''Tá an bricfeasta ite agam.''

Mirroring the Irish language and almost every other European language, the plural 'you' is distinguished from the singular, normally by use of the otherwise archaic English word 'ye' (the word 'yous' (sometimes written as 'youse') also occurs, but primarily only in Dublin and north Ulster, from [[Donegal|Co. Donegal]] across to [[County Antrim|Co. Antrim]]):
* &quot;Did ye/youse all go to see it?&quot;
Also, in some areas in Leinster, and also north Mayo/Sligo, the hybrid word 'ye-s', pronounced 'yis', may be used.
* &quot;Are yis not finished yet?&quot;

In rural areas the reflexive version of pronouns is often used for emphasis or to refer indirectly to a particular person, etc., according to context: 
* &quot;Was it all of ye or just yourself?&quot;
* &quot;'Tis herself that's coming now.&quot; ''Is sí féin atá ag teacht anois.''
- where 'herself' might, for example, be the boss or the woman of the house. Use of 'herself' or 'himself' in this way often indicates that the speaker attributes some degree of arrogance or selfishness to the person in question.  Note also the indirectness of this construction relative to, for example, 'She's coming now' and the use of &quot;'Tis&quot; rather than the more standard contraction &quot;It's&quot;.

It is also common to end sentences with 'no?' or 'yeah?'

* &quot;He's not coming today, no?&quot; ''Níl sé ag teacht inniú, nach bhfuil?''
* &quot;The bank's closed now, yeah?&quot; ''Tá an banc dúnta anois, an bhfuil?''

Though because of the particularly insubstantive yes and no in Irish, (the 
''nach bhfuil?'' and ''an bhfuil?'' being the interrogative positive and negative of the verb 'to be') the above may also find expression as

* &quot;He's not coming today, sure he isn't?&quot; ''Níl sé ag teacht inniú, nach bhfuil?''
* &quot;The bank's closed now, isn't it?&quot; ''Tá an banc dúnta anois, nach bhfuil?''

Irish English also always uses the &quot;light l&quot; sound, and the naming of the letter 'h' as 'haitch' is standard.  A is often pronounce &quot;Ah&quot; and Z as &quot;Ezed&quot;

When describing something, rural Hiberno-English speakers may use the term 'in it' where 'there' would usually be used. This is due to the Irish word ''ann'' (pronounced &quot;oun&quot;) fulfilling both meanings.

* Is it yourself that's in it? ''An é tusa a bhfuil ann?''

This isn't limited only to the verb 'to be': it's also used with 'to have' when used as an auxiliary; and, with other verbs, the verb 'to do' is used. This is most commonly used for intensification.

* This is strong stuff, so it is.
* We won the game, so we did.
* She's a right lash, so she is.

There are some language forms that stem from the fact that there is no verb 'to have' in Irish.  Instead, possession is indicated in Irish by using the preposition 'at,' (in Irish, ''ag.'').  To be more precise, Irish uses a prepositional pronoun that combines ''ag'' &quot;at&quot; and ''me'' &quot;me&quot; to create ''agam''.   
In English, the verb &quot;to have&quot; is used, along with a &quot;with me&quot; or &quot;on me&quot; that derives from ''Tá ....agam.'' 
This gives rise to the frequent 
* The book, I have it with me.   
* Do you have the book? I have it with me.
* Have you change for the bus on you?
* I have my phone on me, if you want to use it.

Somebody who can speak a language 'has' a language, in which Hiberno-English has borrowed the grammatical form used in Irish.

* She doesn't have Irish. ''Níl Gaeilge aici.'' literally 'There is no Irish at her'.

Another idiom is this thing or that thing described as 'this man here' or 'that man there', which also features in [[Newfoundland English]] in [[Canada]]. 
*This man here. ''An fear seo.''
*That man there. ''An fear sin.''

The reported clause is also often preserved in its direct form, for example 'John asked me to buy a loaf of bread' becomes 'John asked me would I buy a loaf of bread'.

'''Bring''' and '''take''': Irish use of these words differs from that of English, because it follows the Gaelic grammar for ''beir'' and ''tóg''.  English usage is determined by direction; Irish usage is determined by person.   So, in English, one &lt;big&gt;takes&lt;/big&gt; &quot;''from'' here ''to'' there&quot;, and &lt;big&gt;brings&lt;/big&gt; it &quot;''to'' here ''from'' there&quot;.  But, in Irish, a person &lt;big&gt;takes&lt;/big&gt; only when accepting a transfer of possession of the object from someone else &amp;mdash; and a person &lt;big&gt;brings&lt;/big&gt; at all other times, irrespective of direction (to or from).  Thus someone might say &quot;Don't forget to bring your umbrella with you when you go&quot; or, to a child, &quot;Hold my hand: I don't want someone to take you.&quot;

== Preservation of older English and Norman French usage ==

In old-fashioned usage, &quot;it is&quot; can be freely abbreviated &quot;'tis&quot;, even as a standalone sentence.  This also allows the double contraction &quot;'tisn't&quot;, for &quot;it is not&quot;.

The word &quot;ye&quot;, &quot;yis&quot; or &quot;yous&quot;, otherwise archaic, is still used in place of &quot;you&quot; for the second-person plural. &quot;Ye'r&quot; &quot;Yisser&quot; or &quot;Yousser&quot; are the possessive forms, e.g. &quot;What's yisser weather like over in France this time o' the year?&quot;
 
The verb &quot;mitch&quot; is common in Ireland, indicating being truant from school.  This word appears in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], but is seldom heard these days in [[British English]], although pockets of usage persist in some areas (notably South [[Wales]], [[Devon]], and [[Cornwall]]).

In some parts of Ireland, in particular the eastern seaboard, when someone is telling tall tales he is said to be &quot;blowing&quot; or &quot;bilowen&quot; out of him/her, which is likely to be a preservation of the [[Middle English]] &quot;bilowen&quot; or &quot;bi-lyen&quot;, as seen in [[Piers Plowman]] (by [[William Langland]] ): &quot;2.22 - And bilowen hire to lordes þat lawes han to kepe.&quot;

&quot;Gassin&quot; is a common descriptor in rural areas for a child, and derives from the word &quot;garcon&quot; (meaning &quot;boy&quot;) as used by 12th century [[Norman]] settlers.

For influence from [[Scotland]] see [[Ulster Scots language|Ulster Scots]].

==Turns of phrase==

'''Amn't''' is used as an abbreviation of &quot;am not&quot;, by analogy with &quot;isn't&quot; and &quot;aren't&quot;.  This can be used as a tag question (&quot;I'm making a mistake, amn't I?&quot;), or as an alternative to &quot;I'm not&quot; (&quot;I amn't joking&quot;), and the double negative is also used (&quot;I'm not late, amn't I not?&quot;).

'''Arra''' is used also. Arra tends to be used after something bad has happened, when someone is looking on the bright side (&quot;Arra, we'll go next week&quot;, &quot;Arra, 'tis not the end of the world&quot;).
&lt;!--- Is &quot;arra&quot; based on &quot;alright&quot;/&quot;all right&quot;?  Or is it just a nondescript groany interjectiony sort of word, like &quot;ohhhhh&quot; or &quot;urrrrgghhh&quot; or &quot;ahhhh&quot; or &quot;owwww&quot;?  I hope someone will fill in the etymology of &quot;arra&quot; here. ---&gt;

'''Come here to me now''' or '''Come here and I'll tell ya something''' is used to mean &quot;Listen to this&quot; or &quot;I have something to tell you&quot; and can be used as &quot;Come here and tell me&quot;. The phrase &quot;Tell me this&quot;, short for &quot;Tell me this and tell me no more&quot;, is also common. These phrases tend to imply a secretiveness or revelatory importance to the upcoming bit of information.

'''The devil''' is used in Irish as an expletive, eg. ''Cén áit sa diabhal a bhfuil sé?'' &quot;Where the devil is he?&quot; (the Irish version is literally &quot;What place in the devil is he?&quot;). This has been translated into Irish as a mild expletive, used in the song &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot; in the line &quot;But the devil take the women, for they never can be easy&quot;. ''Diabhal'' is also used for negation in Irish, and this usage might be carried over to Hiberno-English: ''diabhal fear'' &quot;devil a man&quot;, for &quot;not a soul&quot;.

Various '''insults''' have been transferred directly from Irish and have a very mild meaning in English: e.g. ''Lúdramán'', ''Amadán'', ''pleidhce'', ''rogue'', ''eejit'' (''idiot''), all (loosely) meaning &quot;fool&quot; or &quot;messer&quot; (''messer'' is also a Hiberno-Irish turn of phrase). &quot;Langer&quot; is a variant used especially in Cork.

Also more prevalent in [[Cork]] is a profligation of colourful emphasis-words; in general any turn of phrase associated with a superlative action is used to mean ''very'', and are often calculated to express these in a negative light and therefore often unpleasant by implication - &quot;he's a howling/ thundering/ rampaging/ galloping/ screeching langer, so he is.&quot; The practice is widespread in the rest of Hiberno-English but such a feature of Corkonian speech that it is now commonly lampooned when imitating the accent.

'''[[Reduplication]]''' is not an especially common feature of Irish; nevertheless in rendering Irish phrases into English it is occasionally used:
* ''ar bith'' corresponds to English ''at all'', so the stronger ''ar chor ar bith'' gives rise to the form '''at all at all'''
**''I've no money at all at all.''
* ''ar eagla go...'' (lit. ''on fear that'') means ''in case ...''.  The variant ''ar eagla na heagla'', (lit ''on fear of fear'') implies the circumstances are more unlikely.  The corresponding Hiberno-English phrases are ''to be sure'' and '''to be sure to be sure'''.  In this context, these are not, as might be thought, disjuncts meaning 'certainly'; they could better be translated ''in case'' and ''just in case''.  Nowadays normally spoken with conscious levity.
** ''I brought some cash in case I saw a bargain, and my credit card 'to be sure to be sure'.''

'''So''' is often used for emphasis (&quot;I can speak Irish, so I can&quot;), or it may be tacked on to the end of a sentence to indicate agreement (&quot;Bye so&quot;, &quot;Let's go so&quot;, &quot;That's fine so&quot;, &quot;We'll do that so&quot;). The word is also used to contradict a negative statement (&quot;You're not pushing hard enough&quot; - &quot;I am so!&quot;).

'''Sure''' is often used as a tag word, emphasising the obviousness of the statement. Can be used as &quot;to be sure&quot;, the famous Irish stereotype phrase. Or &quot;Sure, I can just go on Wednesday&quot;, &quot;I will not, to be sure.&quot; &quot;Sure Jayzus&quot; is often used as a very mild expletive to express dismay.


Casual conversation in many parts of Ireland includes a variety of colourful turns of phrase. Some examples:

*'''Yer man''' (your man) and '''Yer wan''' (your one) are used in referring to an individual known by the party being addressed, but not being referred to by name. The phrases are an unusual sort of half-translation of a parallel Irish-language phrase, &quot;mo dhuine&quot; (literally 'my person'). The nearest equivalents in colloquial English usage would be &quot;whatsisname&quot; and &quot;whatsername&quot;. Note also &quot;wan&quot; for female person may be a direct usage of the Irish 'bean' (woman).  In Newfoundland the same form exists as 'buddy,' who is a generic nameless person.  They use the word not always in the sense of 'my friend' but more in the sense of 'what's his name'.  'I went inside to ask for directions and buddy said to go left at the lights'.

*'''a soft day''' &amp;ndash; referring to a rainy day with that particular soft drizzle, and an overcast sky, but yet relatively bright. This is a translation of the Irish &quot;lá bog&quot;.

*'''Fecking''' is a mild abusive equivalent in force to &quot;bleeding&quot; or &quot;darned.&quot;  It is not a parallel of the English word &quot;[[fuck]]ing&quot;, despite their similarity, and is generally less offensive.  &quot;Feck&quot; is the corresponding expletive. The noun &quot;fecker&quot; is slightly stronger but not vulgar.  These terms were lately introduced to Britain by [[Father Ted]]. In old Dubliner slang, &quot;to feck' is also slang for &quot;to steal&quot;, as in the phrase, &quot;We went to the orchard and fecked some apples.&quot;  It can also mean &quot;to throw&quot;, especially if something is being thrown where it shouldn't, as in &quot;We fecked his schoolbag into the river.&quot;  Some areas of South Yorkshire use the word &quot;fetch&quot; to mean bring, &quot;fetch me a glass of water, I'm gagged.&quot; throw &quot; I fetched it up the tree and now its stuck&quot; or arrive &quot;We fetched up in Barnsley before 4 o'clock&quot;

*'''Yoke''' is typically used in place of the word &quot;thing&quot;, for instance &quot;gimme that yoke there&quot;. It's also used as an insult: &quot;you're some yoke&quot;.

*'''Now''' is often used at the end of sentences or phrases as a semantically empty word, completing an utterance without contributing any apparent meaning.  Examples include &quot;Bye now&quot; (= &quot;goodbye&quot;), &quot;There you go now&quot; (= when giving someone something), &quot;Ah now!&quot; (= expressing dismay), &quot;Hold on now&quot; (= &quot;wait a minute&quot;), &quot;Now then&quot; as a mild attention-getter, etc. This usage is universal among English dialects, but occurs more frequently in Hiberno-English.

*'''To''' is often omitted from sentences where it would exist in British English. For example, &quot;I am not allowed go out tonight&quot;, instead of &quot;I am not allowed ''to'' go out tonight&quot;.

There are many terms for having consumed a drop too much drink, many are used elsewhere, but the Irish tendency is to attempt to find the most descriptive adjective yet on each occasion. Some examples: &quot;scuttered&quot;, &quot;stocious/stotious&quot;, &quot;locked&quot;, ''&quot;langered&quot;'', &quot;mouldy&quot; (pron. mowldy as in &quot;fowl&quot;), &quot;polluted&quot;, &quot;flootered&quot;, &quot;plastered&quot;, ''&quot;bolloxed&quot;'', &quot;well out of it&quot;, ''&quot;wankered&quot;'', ''&quot;fucked&quot;'', ''&quot;fuckered&quot;'', &quot;binned&quot;, ''&quot;gee-eyed&quot;'', &quot;buckled&quot;, ''&quot;steaming&quot;'', &quot;messy&quot;, &quot;sloppy&quot;, &quot;wasted&quot;, &quot;paralytic&quot;, &quot;full as a boot&quot;, &quot;legless&quot;, &quot;hammered&quot; , &quot;blootered&quot;, &quot;squooshed&quot;, &quot;banjoed&quot;,  &quot;bingoed&quot; . (''Phrases in italics are more &quot;colourful&quot;'')

Some turns of phrase are more localised and their meaning may not be widespread throughout the country, while others are more transient and fall out of use after a number of years.

==Lexicon==

Hiberno-English vocabulary is largely the same as British English, though there are variances, especially with reference to certain goods, services and institutions. Examples that would come into everyday conversation include:

*To '''banjax''' something is to break it, ruin it, or render it incapable of use. As in &quot;My mobile's been banjaxed since I dropped it in the toilet.&quot;
*'''Bold''' describes someone (usually a child) who is impudent, naughty or badly behaved.
*'''Crack''' or '''craic''' is a good time, good company, good atmosphere and conversation. If you are enjoying yourself, it is good craic. [http://globalgateway.monster.ie/nationaltour_culture_culture.asp] The word may also be used to refer to events, news, or gossip, as in the phrases '''what's the craic?''' and '''how's the craic?'''.
*'''College''', more like American English than British English, would usually be referring to any sort of third-level education, be it college, university or [[Regional Technical College|Institute of Technology]]. This is because the [[Leaving Certificate Examinations]] (the rough equivalent of [[A-levels]] or [[NVQ]]s in the UK) are taken in secondary school in Ireland, so there is no intermediary college like sixth-form colleges in Britain.  (The probable origin of this usage is that, until the 1970s, the only [[tertiary education]] available was at university level, through the Colleges (Dublin, Cork, Galway, Maynooth) of the [[National University of Ireland]] or [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College, Dublin University]] or the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]].
*'''Couple''' often means &quot;a few&quot;, somewhere between two and (?) four or five - whereas in British and American English it means precisely two.
*'''Cute''' can mean shrewd or clever, as in &quot;cute hoor&quot;.
*'''Delph''' meaning [[Dishware]], occasionally meaning [[artificial teeth]].  ''From the name of the original source of supply, [[Delft]] in [[the Netherlands]].  See [[Delftware]].''
*'''Dinner''' can often still mean the meal eaten in the middle of the day, especially in rural Ireland.  
*'''[[Electricity Supply Board|ESB]]''' (Electricity Supply Board), being the only national electricity supplier in Ireland, is regularly used in reference to this type of service. Whereas in other countries one would use the term &quot;mains supply&quot; or &quot;power supply&quot; when referring to the electricity supply that comes to their house/business, in Ireland a lot of people would say &quot;ESB supply&quot;.
*'''Flag''' can mean the conventional [[Flag]] it can also be a [[Flagstone]]
*'''Footpath''' is used in Ireland where &quot;pavement&quot; is in British English and &quot;sidewalk&quot; in American English.
*'''Guards''' refers to the [[Garda Síochana]], the Republic's police force, the equivalent in Irish '''Gardaí''' being used more formally, usually in the media. The singular '''Garda''' is widely used, the female equivalent, '''Bangharda''' less so. The word &quot;police&quot; generally refers to police in other countries.
*'''Grand''' can be used as a response to refer to a person or thing as being alright, for instance, &quot;I'm grand&quot; or &quot;That's grand&quot;.
*'''Handy''' has more meanings in Hiberno-Irish than just &quot;useful&quot;: it usually also means &quot;great&quot;, &quot;terrific&quot;. It is also used to describe a person's skill at a particular task; &quot;Paul is pretty handy with a golf club&quot; meaning &quot;Paul is a good golfer&quot;.
*'''Hiace''' (as in [[Toyota Hiace]]) is used by many to refer to any light commercial van, much like &quot;Transit&quot; or &quot;Transit van&quot; (as in [[Ford Transit]]) in the UK.
*'''Jacks''' :  toilet, usually in a pub or similar.  As in &quot;mind my handbag while I go to the jacks&quot;.  From 16th century English &quot;Jakes&quot;.  ('''mind''' means &quot;look after&quot;) the words Bog and Loo are also used.
*'''Jeep''', much like &quot;Hiace&quot;, is used by many to refer to any sort of off road vehicle, be it a small 4x4 like a [[Suzuki Jimny]] or large SUV like a long [[wheelbase]] [[Mitsubishi Pajero]]. This comes from U.S. military usage of the term, while, oddly enough, actual [[Chrysler]] [[Jeep]]s were never officially sold in Ireland until the 1990s, and the word was just as common before then.
*'''Messages''' means [[groceries]] or [[errands]]. ''She's gone to the shop to get the messages.'' ''I had a few messages to do in town.''
*'''Minerals''' means [[soft drinks]]   
*'''Oul' fella''' and '''oul' wan''' are used to describe one's father or mother respectively.
*'''Oxter''' means [[Armpit]] ''He had a book under his oxter.'' (sounds similar to the [[german language|German]] ''Achsel'' (axel))
*'''Press''' is almost invariably used instead of [[Cupboard]]. The hot press is the airing cupboard.
*'''Rubber''' means an eraser (not a [[condom]]!) (Note to American readers:  this is standard British English too)
*'''Runners''' or '''tackies''', or in the north '''gutties''', refers to &quot;trainers&quot; (British English) or &quot;sneakers&quot; (American English).
*'''[[Scallion]]''' is almost always used instead of Spring Onion (British English) or Green Onion (American English). However, since the proliferation of British supermarkets such as [[Tesco Ireland]], some people have also started to use the term Spring Onion.
*'''Scoop''' is used to describe an alcoholic bevarage i.e. &quot;Going for a few scoops&quot;. It is rarely, if ever, used in the singular (for example &quot;I left my scoop on the table&quot; is not a phrase that would ever be used). Also used is the word '''Jars''' (giving rise to the expression to be intoxicated '''jarred'''), usually referring to pints (of [[Guinness]])
*'''[[Tayto]]''' (an Irish brand of potato crisps) has become synonymous with any sort of crisps, regardless of brand. In Dublin, especially in working class areas, the alternative '''crips''' is commonly used (as in ''&quot;Get us a packet o' crips will ye?&quot;'')
*'''Tin''' means &quot;can&quot;, especially for processed foods. ''Give us a tin of beans.'' &quot;Can&quot; is usually reserved for soft drinks or beer/cider.
*'''Topper''', '''pointer''' and '''parer''' are often used to refer to a &quot;pencil sharpener&quot;.
*'''Wean''' an abbreviated form of the [[Scots language|Scots]] '''wee ane''', is used to refer to a child, but almost exclusively in [[Ulster]] and north [[Leinster]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Harmonic analysis''' is the branch of [[mathematics]] which studies the representation of functions or signals as the superposition of basic [[wave]]s. It investigates and generalizes the notions of [[Fourier series]] and [[Fourier transform]]s. The basic waves are called &quot;[[harmonic]]s&quot;, hence the name &quot;harmonic analysis.&quot;  In the past two centuries, it has become a vast subject with applications in areas as diverse as [[signal processing]], [[quantum mechanics]], and [[neuroscience]].

The classical Fourier transform on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is still an area of ongoing research, particularly concerning Fourier transformation on more general objects such as [[tempered distribution]]s. For instance, if we impose some requirements on a distribution f, we can attempt to translate these requirements in terms of the Fourier transform of f.  The [[Paley-Wiener theorem]] is an example of this. The Paley-Wiener theorem immediately implies that if f is a nonzero [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] of [[compact support]] (these include functions of compact support), then its Fourier transform is never compactly supported.  This is a very elementary form of an [[uncertainty principle]] in a harmonic analysis setting. See also [[classic harmonic analysis]].

Fourier series can be conveniently studied in the context of [[Hilbert space]]s, which provides a connection between harmonic analysis and [[functional analysis]].

==Abstract harmonic analysis==

One of the more modern branches of harmonic analysis, having its roots in the mid-twentieth century, is [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] on [[topological group]]s. The core motivating idea are the various [[Fourier transform]]s, which can be generalized to a transform of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s defined on [[local compactness|locally compact groups]]. 

The theory for [[abelian group|abelian]] locally compact groups is called [[Pontryagin duality]]; it is considered to be in a satisfactory state, as far as explaining the main features of harmonic analysis goes. It is developed in detail on its dedicated page.

Harmonic analysis studies the properties of that duality and Fourier transform; and attempts to extend those features to different settings, for instance to the case of non-abelian [[Lie group|Lie groups]]. 

For general nonabelian locally compact groups, harmonic analysis is closely related to the theory of unitary group representations.  For compact groups,
the [[Peter-Weyl theorem]] explains how one may get harmonics by choosing one irreducible representation out of each equivalence class of representations. This choice of harmonics enjoys some of the useful properties of the classical Fourier transform in terms of carrying convolutions to pointwise products, or otherwise showing a certain understanding of the underlying group structure.

If the group is neither abelian nor compact, no general satisfactory theory is currently known. By &quot;satisfactory&quot; one would mean ''at least'' the equivalent of [[Plancherel theorem]]. However, many specific cases have been analyzed, for example [[General linear group|SL&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]]. In this case, it turns out that [[Group representation|representations]] in infinite dimension play a crucial role.

==Other branches==

*Study of the [[eigenvalue]]s and [[eigenvector]]s of the [[Laplacian]] on [[domain]]s, [[manifold]]s and (to a lesser extent), [[graph]]s, is also considered a branch of harmonic analysis. See e.g., [[hearing the shape of a drum]].
* Harmonic analysis on Euclidean spaces deals with properties of the Fourier transform on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; which have no analog on general groups. For example, the fact that the Fourier transform is invariant to rotations. Decomposing the Fourier transform to its radial and spherical components leads to topics such as [[Bessel function]]s and [[spherical harmonic]]s. See the book reference.
* Harmonic analysis on tube domains is concerned with generalizing properties of [[Hardy space]]s to higher dimensions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{otheruses}}
In [[baseball]], a '''home run''' is a [[hit (baseball)|base hit]] in which the [[batting (baseball)|batter]] is able to circle all the bases, ending at home plate and scoring a [[run (baseball)|run]] himself (along with a run scored by each [[baserunning|runner]] who was already on base), with no [[error (baseball)|errors]] by the defensive team on the play which result in the batter advancing for extra bases.

Home runs are among the most popular aspects of baseball, and the biggest (and best-paid) stars are often the players who hit the most of them. It was once said that &quot;[[single (baseball)|Singles]] hitters drive [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]], and home run hitters drive [[Cadillac]]s.&quot; There is also a legend that [[Babe Ruth]] was asked by a reporter about the fact that his salary was higher than that of President [[Herbert Hoover]]; Ruth's response was, &quot;How many home runs did ''he'' hit last year?&quot; (It is worth noting that Ruth had been an official endorser of [[Al Smith]] for President in [[U.S. presidential election, 1928|1928]], according to Marshall Smelser's ''The Life That Ruth Built''.)

==Types of home runs==
In addition to the general term &quot;home run,&quot; certain plays in baseball have been given names to denote which they are a special type of home run. These home runs are generally considered to be special because of their rarity, but also because of the kind of excitement, specific to the game situation, that they can create.

===Inside-the-park home run===

In almost all cases nowadays, a home run involves hitting the ball over the [[outfield]] fence in [[fair ball|fair territory]]. Very rarely, a batter can hit the ball in play and circle all the bases before the fielders can throw him out; this is called an '''[[inside-the-park home run]]''', and typically requires that the batter be a quick runner, and that either the fielder misplay the ball in some way or that the ball is made difficult to play by caroming in unexpected ways, or by becoming difficult for a fielder to reach due to structural variances and peculiarities of different ballparks. If the misplay is labeled an error by the official scorer, however, the batter is not credited with a home run.

===Grand slam===

A '''[[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]]''' home run occurs when the bases are &quot;loaded&quot; (that is, there are base runners standing at first, second, and third base) and the batter hits a home run. An '''inside-the-park grand slam''' is a grand slam without the ball leaving the field, and it is very rare. The last major league inside-the-park grand slam was hit by [[Randy Winn]] of the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] on [[October 3]], [[1999 in baseball|1999]].

===Walk-off home run===

A '''[[walk-off home run]]''' is a term coined by famous relief pitcher [[Dennis Eckersley]] to signify a home run that immediately ends the game, so named because after the run is scored, the players can &quot;walk off&quot; the field. In order for this to happen, a member of the home team must hit a home run in the bottom of the last inning to either come from behind or break a tie.

===Hitting for the cycle===

A batter '''[[hitting for the cycle|hits for the cycle]]''' when he collects a single, [[double (baseball)|double]], [[triple (baseball)|triple]] and home run in the same game. As home runs usually demonstrate batting power and triples indicate speed, hitting for the cycle is highly regarded for the way it indicates a player's varied abilities. Collecting the hits in the order above is called a &quot;natural cycle.&quot;

==History of the home run==

In the [[History of baseball in the United States|early days of the game]], when the ball was less lively and the ballparks generally had very large outfields, most home runs were of the inside-the-park variety. The &quot;home&quot; run was literally descriptive. Home runs over the fence were rare, and only in ballparks where a fence was fairly close.

The home run's place in baseball changed dramatically when the [[Live Ball Era|lively ball]] was introduced after [[World War I]]. Batters such as [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Rogers Hornsby]] took full advantage of it during the 1920s, especially as the game's popularity boomed and more outfield seating was built, shrinking the size of the outfield. The teams with the sluggers, especially the [[New York Yankees]], became the championship teams, and other teams had to change their focus from the &quot;inside game&quot; to the &quot;power game&quot; in order to keep up.

Prior to 1931, a ball that bounced over an outfield fence during a major league game was considered a home run. The rule was changed to require the ball to clear the fence on the fly, and balls which reached the seats on a bounce became ground-rule doubles in most parks.

Also, until around that time, the ball had to not only go over the fence fair, but to land in the bleachers fair. The rule stipulated &quot;when last seen&quot; by the [[umpire (baseball)|umpires]]. Photos from that era in ballparks such as the [[Polo Grounds]] show ropes strung from the foul poles to the back of the bleachers, in a straight line with the foul line, as a visual aid for the umpires. Babe Ruth's 60th home run in [[1927 in baseball|1927]] was somewhat controversial, because it landed just fair in the stands down the right field line.

Further, the rules once stipulated that an over-the-fence home run in a sudden-victory situation would only count for as many bases as was necessary to &quot;force&quot; the winning run home. For example, if a team trailed by 2 runs with the bases loaded, and the batter hit a fair ball over the fence, it only counted as a triple, because the runner immediately ahead of him had technically already scored the game-winning run. That rule was changed in the 1920s as home runs became increasingly frequent and popular. Babe Ruth's career total of 714 would have been one higher had that rule not been in effect in the early part of his career.

The all-time career record for home runs in a professional career is held by Japan's [[Sadaharu Oh]] with 868. In Major League Baseball, the record is 755, held by [[Hank Aaron]] since [[1974 in baseball|1974]]. Only three other major league players have hit as many as 600: Babe Ruth (714), [[Barry Bonds]] (708 as of September 2005), and [[Willie Mays]] (660). The single season record is 73, set by Barry Bonds in [[2001 in sports|2001]]. [[Negro league baseball|Negro League]] slugger [[Josh Gibson]] may have hit even more home runs than Oh, but official records from the Negro Leagues are sketchy at best and in some cases nonexistent. The ''Guinness Book of World Records'' lists Gibson's lifetime home run total at 800.

Other legendary home run hitters include [[Ted Williams]], [[Mark McGwire]], [[Sammy Sosa]], [[Mickey Mantle]] (who hit what is considered the longest home run ever at an estimated distance of 643 feet on [[September 10]], [[1960 in baseball|1960]]), [[Reggie Jackson]], [[Ernie Banks]], [[Eddie Mathews]] and the other members of Major League Baseball's [[500 home run club]].

==Home run slang==

[[Baseball slang|Slang terms]] for home runs include: ''big-fly'', ''blast'', ''bomb'', ''circuit clout'', ''dinger'', ''four-bagger'', ''homer'', ''jack'', ''round-tripper'', ''shot'', ''moonshot'', ''tape-measure shot'', ''swat'', ''tater'', ''wallop'' and ''gopherball'' (because the batter &quot;goes for&quot; it). The act of hitting a home run can be called ''going yard''. A game with many home runs in it can be referred to as a ''slugfest''. A player who hits a home run is said to have &quot;dialed 9&quot;, from the practice of having to dial 9 from a hotel room telephone to get &quot;long distance&quot;.

Player nicknames that describe home run-hitting prowess include:
*The ''Sultan of Swat'', the ''Colossus of Clout'', the ''Wali of Wallop'' (Babe Ruth)
*The ''Crown Prince of Swat'' ([[Lou Gehrig]], playing on Ruth's nickname)
*The ''Rajah of Swat'' (Rogers Hornsby, likewise)
*''Hammerin' Hank''. ''The Hammer'', ''The New Sultan of Swat'' (Hank Aaron)
*''Joltin' Joe'' ([[Joe DiMaggio]])
*''Kong'' ([[Dave Kingman]])
*''Juan Gone'' ([[Juan Gonzalez]])
*''Downtown'' ([[Ollie Brown]])
*[[Frank Baker|Frank &quot;Home Run&quot; Baker]]
*''Two Man Swat Team'' [[Manny Ramírez]] and [[David Ortiz]]
*''The Bash Brothers'' (Mark McGwire and [[José Canseco]])
*''Slammin' Sammy'' (Sammy Sosa)
*''[[Murderers' Row]]'' (the entire [[New York Yankees]] lineup for [[1927 in baseball|1927]])
*The &quot;Big Hurt&quot; ([[Frank Thomas (AL baseball player)|Frank Thomas]])

: '''5''', by [[George Hall (baseball player)|George Hall]], Philadelphia Athletics (NL), [[1876 in baseball|1876]] (70 game schedule)
: '''9''', by [[Charley Jones]], [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Red Stockings]] (NL), [[1879 in baseball|1879]] (84 game schedule)
:'''14''', by [[Harry Stovey]], Philadelphia Athletics (AA), [[1883 in baseball|1883]] (98 game schedule)
:'''27''', by [[Ned Williamson]], [[Chicago Cubs|Chicago White Stockings]] (NL), [[1884 in baseball|1884]] (112 game schedule)
::Williamson benefitted from a very short outfield fence in his home ballpark, [[Union Base-Ball Grounds|Lakeshore Park]]. During the park's previous years, balls hit over the fence in that park were ground-rule doubles, but in 1884 (its final year) they were credited as home runs. Williamson led the pace, but several of his Chicago teammates also topped the 20 HR mark that season. Of Williamson's total, 25 were hit at home, and only 2 on the road. Noticing the fluke involved, fans of the early 20th century were more impressed with [[Buck Freeman]]'s total of 25 home runs in [[1899 in baseball|1899]] or [[Gavvy Cravath]]'s [[1915 in baseball|1915]] total of 24.
:'''29''', by [[Babe Ruth]], [[Boston Red Sox]] (AL), [[1919 in baseball|1919]] (140 game schedule)
::Even with that relatively small quantity, Ruth outslugged 10 of the other 15 major league clubs. The second-highest individual total was 12, by Gavvy Cravath of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. Ruth homered in every park in the league, the first time anyone had achieved that goal.
:'''54''', by Ruth, [[New York Yankees]] (AL), [[1920 in baseball|1920]] (154 game schedule)
::Ruth hit just a few more home runs on the road (26) than he had the previous year (20), but he hit far more (29) in the Polo Grounds in New York (where the Yankees played at the time) than he had in [[Fenway Park]] (9) in Boston the year before, as he took full advantage of the nearby right field wall. Of the other 15 major league clubs, only the Philadelphia Phillies exceeded Ruth's single-handeded total, hitting 64 in their bandbox ballpark [[Baker Bowl]]. The second-highest individual total was the [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]]' [[George Sisler]]'s 19. Ruth's major-league record slugging percentage (total bases / at bats) of .847 stood for the next 80 years.
:'''59''', by Ruth, New York (AL), [[1921 in baseball|1921]] (154 game schedule)
::Ruth's slugging percentage was just .001 less than his record-setting average the previous year.
:'''60''', by Ruth, New York (AL), [[1927 in baseball|1927]] (154 game schedule)
::Ruth hit more home runs in 1927 than any of the other seven American League ''teams''.  His closest rival was his teammate [[Lou Gehrig]], who hit 47 homers that year.
:'''61''', by [[Roger Maris]], New York (AL), [[1961 in baseball|1961]] (162 game schedule)
::Pushing Maris that year was teammate [[Mickey Mantle]]; slowed by an injury late in the season, Mantle finished with 54.
:'''70''', by [[Mark McGwire]], [[St. Louis Cardinals]] (NL), [[1998 in baseball|1998]] (162 game schedule)
::Pushing McGwire that year was [[Sammy Sosa]] of the [[Chicago Cubs]], who finished with 66. When McGwire hit his 62nd home run to break the record, the Cardinals were playing at home ([[Busch Stadium]] in [[Saint Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]) against the Cubs. In a tremendous show of sportsmanship, Sosa, who was playing in the [[right fielder|outfield]], actually ran in to celebrate with McGwire, who in return honored Sosa by saluting him in Sosa's own trademark fashion. McGwire also went to the stands to honor Maris' family, who were in attendance at the game. The following day, newspapers throughout the United States printed commemorative sports pages in honor of the milestone.
:'''73''', by [[Barry Bonds]], [[San Francisco Giants]] (NL), [[2001 in baseball|2001]] (162 game schedule)
::Far less press surrounded Bonds's chase for the record than surrounded McGwire's for three main reasons. First, most attention was still focused on the recent [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11 terrorist attacks]]. Second, the record at that time had stood for only three years. Third, Barry Bonds' surly relationship with the news media contrasted significantly with the relative openness of McGwire and the expressiveness of Sosa in 1998. Bo'. 

Beside the ''jamo'', Hangul originally employed [[diacritic mark]]s to indicate [[pitch accent]]. A syllable with a high pitch was marked with a dot (·) to the left of it (when writing vertically); a syllable with a rising pitch was marked with a double dot, like a colon (:). These are no longer used. However, although [[vowel length]] is phonemic in Korean, it was never indicated in Hangul, except that syllables with rising pitch necessarily have long vowels. 

Although some aspects of Hangul are shared with [[Mongolian alphabet|Phagspa]] (and thus [[Brahmic family|Indic]] [[phonology]]), such as the relationships among the [[wiktionary:homorganic|homorganic]] jamo and the [[alphabet|alphabetic principle]] itself, other aspects are shared with [[Chinese writing]], such as syllablic blocks and the basic consonants. [[tenuis consonant|Tenuis]] (non-voiced, non-aspirated) plosives, ''g'' for ㄱ {{IPA|[k]}}, ''d'' for ㄷ {{IPA|[t]}}, and ''b'' for ㅂ {{IPA|[p]}} were considered basic in Chinese, but not Indic languages; as well as the sibilant ''s'' for ㅈ {{IPA|[ts]}} and the liquid ''l'' for ㄹ {{IPA|[l]}}. (Korean ㅈ was pronounced {{IPA|[ts]}} in the 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century.)

The ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye'' explains the designs and derivations of the consonants according to [[articulatory phonetics]]; and the vowels according to the principles of [[yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']] and [[vowel harmony]].

====Consonant ''jamo'' design====
The letters for the consonants fall into five [[wiktionary:homorganic|homorganic]] groups, each with a basic shape, and one or more letters derived from this shape by means of additional strokes. The basic shapes model the articulation the [[tongue]], [[palate]], [[teeth]], and [[throat]] take when making these sounds. 

The Korean names for the groups are the traditional [[Sino-Korean]] phonetic terminology.

*[[Velar consonant]]s (아음, 牙音 ''a-eum'': &quot;molar sounds&quot;):
** ㄱ ''g'' {{IPA|[k]}}, ㅋ ''k'' {{IPA|[kʰ]}}
** Basic shape: ㄱ is a side view of the back of the tongue raised toward the velum (soft palate). (For illustration, access the external link below.) The ㅋ is derived from ㄱ, with an extra stroke for the burst of aspiration. 
*[[Coronal consonant]]s (설음, 舌音 ''seol-eum'': &quot;lingual sounds&quot;): 
** ㄴ ''n'' {{IPA|[n]}}, ㄷ ''d'' {{IPA|[t]}}, ㅌ ''t'' {{IPA|[tʰ]}}, ㄹ ''r''/''l''
** Basic shape: ㄴ is a side view of the tip of the tongue raised toward the [[alveolar ridge]] (gum ridge). The letters derived from ㄴ are pronounced with the same basic articulation. The line topping ㄷ represents firm contact with the roof of the mouth. The middle stroke of ㅌ represents the burst of aspiration. The top of ㄹ represents a [[flap consonant|flap]] of the tongue. 
*[[Bilabial consonant]]s (순음, 唇音 ''sun-eum'': &quot;labial sounds&quot;): 
** ㅁ ''m'' {{IPA|[m]}}, ㅂ ''b'' {{IPA|[p]}}, ㅍ ''p'' {{IPA|[pʰ]}}
** Basic shape: ㅁ represents the outline of the lips in contact with each other. The top of ㅂ represents the release burst of the ''b''. The top stroke of ㅍ is for the burst of aspiration.
*[[Sibilant]]s (치음, 齒音 ''chieum'': &quot;dental sounds&quot;):
** ㅅ s {{IPA|[s̬]}}, ㅈ j {{IPA|[c]}}, ㅊ ch {{IPA|[cʰ]}}
** Basic shape: ㅅ was originally shaped like a wedge ʌ, without the [[serif]] on top. It represents a side view of the teeth. The line topping ㅈ represents firm contact with the roof of the mouth. The stroke topping ㅊ represents an additional burst of aspiration. 
*[[Glottal consonant]]s (후음, 喉音 ''hueum'': &quot;throat sounds&quot;): 
** ㅇ ''ng'' {{IPA|[ʔ, ŋ]}}, ㅎ ''h'' {{IPA|[h]}}
** Basic shape: ㅇ is an outline of the throat. Originally ㅇ was two letters, a simple circle for silence (null consonant), and a circle topped by a verticle line, ㆁ, for the nasal ''ng''. A now obsolete letter, ㆆ, represented a glottal stop, which is pronounced in the throat and had closure represented by the top line, like ㄱㄷㅈ. Derived from ㆆ is ㅎ, in which the extra stroke represents a burst of aspiration.

The phonetic theory inherent in the derivation of glottal stop ㆆ and aspirate ㅎ from the null ㅇis more accurate than modern [[International phonetic alphabet|IPA]] usage. In the IPA, the glottal consonants are posited as having a specific &quot;glottal&quot; place of articulation. However, recent phonetic theory has come to view the glottal stop and [h] to be isolated features of 'stop' and 'aspiration' without a true place of articulation, just as their hangul representations based on the null symbol assume.

====Vowel ''jamo'' design====
Vowel letters are based on three elements: 
* A horizontal line representing the flat Earth, the essence of ''[[yin and yang|yin]]''.
* A point for the Sun in the heavens, the essence of ''[[yin and yang|yang]]''. (This becomes a short stroke when written with a brush.)
* A vertical line for the upright Human, the neutral mediator between the two. 

Dots (now short lines) are added to these three basic elements to derive the other simple vowel ''jamo''. 
* Simple vowels
** Horizontal letters: these are mid-high back vowels.
*** ㅗ ''o''
*** ㅜ ''u''
*** ㅡ ''eu'' (''ŭ'')
** Vertical letters: these were once low or front vowels. (ㅓ ''eo'' has since migrated to the back of the mouth.)
*** ㅏ ''a''
*** ㅓ ''eo'' (''ŏ'')
*** ㅣ ''i''
* Compound ''jamo''. Hangul never had a ''w'', except for [[Sino-Korean]] [[etymology]]. Since an ''o'' or ''u'' before an ''a'' or ''eo'' became a {{IPA|[w]}} sound, which occurred nowhere else, {{IPA|[w]}} could always be analyzed as a [[phoneme|phonemic]] ''o'' or ''u'', and no letter for {{IPA|[w]}} was needed. However, vowel harmony must be observed: ''yin'' ㅜ with ''yin'' ㅓ; ''yang'' ㅏ with ''yang'' ㅗ. The compound ''jamo'' ending in ㅣ ''i'', on the other hand, were originally [[diphthong]]s. However, several have since evolved into pure vowels.
** ㅐ = ㅏ + ㅣ
** ㅔ = ㅓ + ㅣ
** ㅘ = ㅗ + ㅏ
** ㅙ = ㅗ + ㅏ + ㅣ
** ㅚ = ㅗ + ㅣ
** ㅝ = ㅜ + ㅓ
** ㅞ = ㅜ + ㅓ + ㅣ
** ㅟ = ㅜ + ㅣ
** ㅢ = ㅡ + ㅣ
* Iotized vowels: There is no ''jamo'' for Roman ''y-''. Instead, this sound is indicated by doubling the stroke attached to the base line. 
** ㅑ = ㅏ + a stroke
** ㅕ = ㅓ + a stroke
** ㅛ = ㅗ + a stroke
** ㅠ = ㅜ + a stroke
** ㅒ = ㅐ + a stroke
** ㅖ = ㅔ + a stroke

Two methods were used to organize and classify these vowels, [[vowel harmony]] and iotation. 

Of the seven vowels, four could be preceded by a ''i-'' sound (&quot;iotated&quot;). These four were written as a dot next to a line: ㅓㅏㅜㅗ. (Through the influence of Chinese calligraphy, the dots soon became connected to the line, as seen here.) Iotation was then indicated by doubling this dot: ㅕㅑㅠㅛ. The three vowels which could not be iotated were written with a single stroke: ㅡㆍㅣ. 

The Korean language of this period had vowel harmony to a greater extent than it does today. Vowels alternated according to their environment, and fell into &quot;harmonic&quot; groups. This affected the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of the language, and Korean phonology described it in terms of ''yin'' and ''yang'': If a word had ''yang'' ('bright') vowels, then most suffixes also had to have a ''yang'' vowel; and conversely, if the root had ''yin'' ('dark') vowels, the suffixes needed to be ''yin'' as well. There was a harmonic third group called &quot;mediating&quot; ('neutral' in Western terminology) that could coexist with either ''yin'' or ''yang'' vowels. 

The Korean neutral vowel was ㅣ ''i''. The ''yin'' vowels were ㅡㅜㅓ ''eu, u, eo''; the dots are in the ''yin'' directions of 'down' and 'left'. The ''yang'' vowels were ㆍㅗㅏ, ''ə, o, a'', with the dots in the ''yang'' directions of 'up' and 'right'. As mentioned above, the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum'' states that the shapes of the non-dotted ''jamo'' ㅡㆍㅣ were also chosen to represent the concepts of ''yin'', ''yang'', and mediation. (The dot ㆍ ''ə'' is now obsolete.) 

There was yet a third parameter for designing the vowel ''jamo'': namely, choosing ㅡ as the graphic base of ㅜ and ㅗ, and ㅣ as the base of ㅓ and ㅏ. A full understanding of what these horizontal and vertical groups had in common would require knowing the exact sound values these vowels had in the 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. Our uncertainty is primarily with the ''jamo'' ㆍㅓㅏ. Some linguists reconstruct these as {{IPA|*a, *ɤ, *e}}, respectively; others as {{IPA|*ə, *e, *a}}. However, the horizontal ''jamo'' ㅡㅜㅗ do appear to have all been mid to high back vowels, {{IPA|[*ɯ, *u, *o]}}.

====Ledyard's theory of consonant ''jamo'' design====
[[Image:Phagspa-Hangul comparison.png|thumb|240px|
(Top) Phagspa letters {{IPA|[k, t, p, s, l]}}, and their supposed hangul derivatives {{IPA|[k, t, p, ts, l]}}. Note the lip on both Phagspa {{IPA|[t]}} and hangul ㄷ.&lt;br&gt;
(Bottom) Derivation of Phagspa ''w, v, f'' from variants of the letter {{IPA|[h]}} (left) plus a subscript [w], and analogous composition of hangul ''w, v, f'' from variants of the basic letter {{IPA|[p]}} plus a circle.]]

There are several theories on what sources may have inspired King Sejong's creation of Hangul. Although none have wide acceptance, Professor [[Gari Ledyard]] of Columbia University believes that five consonants were derived from the Mongol [[Phagspa]] alphabet of the [[Yuan dynasty]], and the rest derived internally, essentially as described in the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum''. However, these basic consonants were not the graphically simplest letters of the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum'', but the basic consonants in Chinese phonology.

The ''Hunmin Jeong-eum'' states that King Sejong adapted 古篆 &quot;''Gǔ'' script(s)&quot; in creating hangul. The primary meaning of 古 is ''old'', frustrating philologists because hangul bears no functional similarity to Chinese 篆字 [[seal script]]s. However, 古 may also have been a pun on ''Mongol'' (蒙古 ''Měnggǔ''), and 古篆 may have been an abbreviation of 蒙古篆字 &quot;Mongol Seal Script&quot;, that is, a formal variant of the Phagspa alphabet written to look like the Chinese seal script. There were certainly Phagspa manuscripts in the Korean palace library, and several of Sejong's ministers knew the script well. 

If this was the case, Sejong's evasion on the Mongol connection can be understood in light of Korea's relationship with Ming China after the fall of the Yuan dynasty, and of the literati's contempt for the Mongols as &quot;barbarians&quot;.

According to Ledyard, the five borrowed letters were graphically simplified, which allowed for ''jamo'' clusters and left room to derive the aspirate plosives, ㅋㅌㅍㅊ. But in contrast to the traditional account, the non-plosives (''ng'' ㄴㅁ and ㅅ) were derived by ''removing'' the top of these letters. While it's easy to derive ㅁ from ㅂ by removing the top, it's not clear how to derive ㅂ from ㅁ, since ㅂ is not analogous to the other plosives.

The explanation of ''ng'' also differs from the traditional account. Many Chinese words began with ''ng'', but by King Sejong's day, ''ng'' was either silent or pronounced {{IPA|[ŋ]}} in China, and was silent when these words were borrowed into Korean. Also, the expected shape of ''ng'' (vertical line left by removing the top stroke of ㄱ) would have looked the same as the vowel ㅣ {{IPA|[i]}}. Sejong's solution solved both problems: the vertical stroke from ㄱ was added to the null symbol ㅇ to create ᇰ (a circle with a vertical line on top), iconically capturing both {{IPA|[ŋ]}} in the middle or end of a word, and silence at the beginning. (The distinction between ㅇ and ᇰ was eventually lost.)

Additionally, the composition of obsolete ᇢᇦᇴ ''w, v, f'' (for Chinese [[Syllable onset|initials]] 微非敷), by adding a small circle under ㅁㅂㅍ (''m, b, p''), is parallel to the Phagspa addition of a small loop under three variants of ''h''. In Phagspa, this loop also represented ''w'' after vowels. The Chinese initial 微 represented either ''m'' or ''w'' in various dialects, and this may be reflected in the choice of ㅁ [m] plus ㅇ (from Phagspa [w]) as the elements of hangul ᇢ, for another letter composed of two elements to represent two regional pronunciations. 

Finally, most of the borrowed hangul letters were simple geometric shapes, at least originally, but ㄷ ''d'' [t] always had a small lip protruding from the upper left corner, just as the Phagspa ''d'' [t] did. This can be traced back to the Tibetan letter ''d'', ད. 

See [[Gari Ledyard]] for details.

===''Jamo'' order===
The alphabetical order of Hangul does not mix consonants and vowels as the Western alphabets ([[Latin alphabet]] and [[Cyrillic alphabet]]) do. Instead, the order is of the [[Shiva Sutra|Indic type]], first velar consonants, then coronals, labials, sibilants, ''etc.'' However, the consonants come before the vowels rather than after as in [[Sanscrit]] and [[Tibetan language|Tibetan]]. 

The modern alphabetic order was set by [[Choi Sejin]] in 1527. This was before the development of the Korean tense consonants and the double ''jamo'' that represent them. The conflation of the two letters ㅇ and ㆁ also occurred after the alphabetic order was set. Therefore, when the [[South Korea]]n and [[North Korea]]n governments implemented full use of Hangul, they ordered these letters differently, with South Korean grouping similar letters together, and North Korea placing the new letters at the end. 

====South Korean order====
The modern order of the consonantal ''jamo'' is:

ㄱ ㄲ ㄴ ㄷ ㄸ ㄹ ㅁ ㅂ ㅃ ㅅ ㅆ ㅇ ㅈ ㅉ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ

Double consonantal ''jamo'' are placed immediately after the simple ''jamo'' they are based on. No distinction is made between silent and nasal ㅇ. 

The order of the vocalic ''jamo'' is:

ㅏ ㅐ ㅑ ㅒ ㅓ ㅔ ㅕ ㅖ ㅗ ㅘ ㅙ ㅚ ㅛ ㅜ ㅝ ㅞ ㅟ ㅠ ㅡ ㅢ ㅣ

The modern [[monophthong]]al vowels come first, with the derived forms interspersed according to their form: first added ''i'', then yotized, then yotized with added ''i''. [[Diphthong]]s beginning with ''w-'' are ordered according to their spelling as ㅏ or ㅓ plus a second vowel, not as separate [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s.

====North Korean order====
North Korea maintains a more traditional order. 

The modern order of the consonantal ''jamo'' is:

(null) ㄱ ㄴ ㄷ ㄹ ㅁ ㅂ ㅅ ㅇ ㅈ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ ㄲ ㄸ ㅃ ㅆ ㅉ (null-ㅇ)

The first ㅇ is the nasal ㅇ ''ng'', which occures in the final in the modern language. ㅇ used at the initial, on the other hand, goes after ㅉ, because it is a placeholder. A letter with no final consonant goes right before that letter with ㄱ at the final, however.

Note that the &quot;new&quot; letters, the double ''jamo'', are placed at the very end of the alphabet, just before the null ㅇ, so as not to alter the traditional order of the rest of the alphabet.  

The order of the vocalic ''jamo'' is: 

ㅏ ㅑ ㅓ ㅕ ㅗ ㅛ ㅜ ㅠ ㅡ ㅣ ㅐ ㅒ ㅔ ㅖ ㅚ ㅟ ㅢ ㅘ ㅝ ㅙ ㅞ

All digraphs and [[trigraph]]s, including the old diphthongs ㅐ and ㅔ, are placed after all basic vowels, again maintaining Choi's alphabetic order.

===''Jamo'' names===
The Hangul arrangement is called &quot;the ''ganada'' order&quot; (가나다 순), after the first three ''jamo'' (''g'', ''n'', and ''d'') affixed to the first vowel (''a''). The ''jamo'' were named by [[Choi Sejin]] in 1527. North Korea regularized the names when it made Hangul its official orthography.

====Consonantal ''jamo'' names====
The modern consonants have two-syllable names, with the consonant coming both at the beginning and end of the name, as follows:

{| border=1 style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse&quot;
|-
! Letter !! South Korean Name !! North Korean name
|-
| ㄱ || ''giyeok'' (기역) || ''gieuk'' (기윽)
|-
| ㄴ || colspan=2 | ''nieun'' (니은)
|-
| ㄷ || ''digeut'' (디귿) || ''dieut'' (디읃)
|-
| ㄹ || colspan=2 |  ''rieul'' (리을)
|-
| ㅁ || colspan=2 |  ''mieum'' (미음)
|-
| ㅂ || colspan=2 |  ''bieup'' (비읍)
|-
| ㅅ || ''siot'' (시옷) || ''sieut'' (시읏)
|-
| ㅇ || colspan=2 |  ''ieung'' (이응)
|-
| ㅈ || colspan=2 |  ''jieut'' (지읒)
|-
| ㅊ || colspan=2 |  ''chieut'' (치읓)
|-
| ㅋ || colspan=2 |  ''kieuk'' (키읔)
|-
| ㅌ || colspan=2 |  ''tieut'' (티읕)
|-
| ㅍ || colspan=2 |  ''pieup'' (피읖)
|-
| ㅎ || colspan=2 |  ''hieut'' (히읗)
|}

All ''jamo'' in North Korea, and all but three in the more traditional nomenclature used in South Korea, have names of the format of ''letter'' + ''i'' + ''eu'' + ''letter''. For example, Choi wrote ''bieup'' with the ''hanja'' 非 (''bi'') 邑 (''eup''). The names of ''g'', ''d'', and ''s'' are exceptions because there are no ''hanja'' for ''euk'', ''eut'', and ''eus''. 役 ''yeok'' is used in place of ''euk''. Since there is no ''hanja'' that ends in ''t'' or ''s'', Choi chose two ''hanja'' to be read in their Korean gloss, 末 ''kkeut'' (&quot;end&quot;) and 衣 ''os'' (&quot;clothes&quot;).

Originally, Choi gave ''j'', ''ch'', ''k'', ''t'', ''p'', and ''h'' the irregular one-syllable names of ''ji'', ''chi'', ''ki'', ''ti'', ''pi'', and ''hi'', because they should not be used as final consonants, as specified in ''Hunmin jeong-eum''. But after the establishment of the new orthography in 1933, which allowed all consonsants to be placed as the final consonants, the names were changed to the present forms.

The double ''jamo'' precede the parent consonant's name with the word 쌍 ''ssang'', meaning &quot;twin&quot; or &quot;double&quot;, or with 된 ''doen'' in North Korea, meaning &quot;strong&quot;.  Thus:

{| border=1 style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse&quot;
|-
! Letter !! South Korean Name !! North Korean name
|-
| ㄲ || ''ssanggiyeok'' (쌍기역) || ''doengieuk'' (된기윽)
|-
| ㄸ || ''ssangdigeut'' (쌍디귿) || ''doendieut'' (된디읃)
|-
| ㅃ || ''ssangbieup'' (쌍비읍) || ''doenbieup'' (된비읍)
|-
| ㅆ || ''ssangsiot'' (쌍시옷) || ''doensieut'' (된시읏)
|-
| ㅉ || ''ssangjieut'' (쌍지읒) || ''doenjieut'' (된지읒)
|}

In North Korea, an alternate way to refer to the ''jamo'' is by the name ''letter'' + ''eu'' (ㅡ), for example, 그 ''geu'' for the ''jamo'' ㄱ, 쓰 ''sseu'' for the ''jamo'' ㅆ, etc.

====Vocalic ''jamo'' names====
The vocalic ''jamo'' names are simply the vowel itself, written with the null initial ㅇ ''ieung'' and the vowel being named. Thus:

{|
! Letter !! Name
|-
| ㅏ || ''a'' (아)
|-
| ㅐ || ''ae'' (애)
|-
| ㅑ || ''ya'' (야)
|-
| ㅒ || ''yae'' (얘)
|-
| ㅓ || ''eo'' (어)
|-
| ㅔ || ''e'' (에)
|-
| ㅕ || ''yeo'' (여)
|-
| ㅖ || ''ye'' (예)
|-
| ㅗ || ''o'' (오)
|-
| ㅘ || ''wa'' (와)
|-
| ㅙ || ''wae'' (왜)
|-
| ㅚ || ''oe'' (외)
|-
| ㅛ || ''yo'' (요)
|-
| ㅜ || ''u'' (우)
|-
| ㅝ || ''wo'' (워)
|-
| ㅞ || ''we'' (웨)
|-
| ㅟ || ''wi'' (위)
|-
| ㅠ || ''yu'' (유)
|-
| ㅡ || ''eu'' (으)
|-
| ㅢ || ''ui'' (의)
|-
| ㅣ || ''i'' (이)
|}

===Obsolete ''jamo''===
Several ''jamo'' are obsolete. These include several that represent Korean sounds that have since disappeared from the standard language, as well as a larger number used to represent the sounds of the Chinese [[rime table]]s that were never used in Korean at all. The most frequently encountered of these archaic letters are:

* ㆍ or 丶 ''ə'' (''arae-a'' 아래아 &quot;lower ''a''&quot;): Pronounced as [[International Phonetic Alphabet for English|IPA]] {{IPA|[ʌ]}}, similar to modern ''eo''.
*:''Ə'' formed a medial of its own, or was found as the diphthong ㆎ ''area-ae''. The word ''ahə'' (&quot;child&quot;), which was originally written using this letter, has been changed to ''ai'' (아이).
* ㅿ ''z'' (''bansios'' 반시옷): A rather unusual sound, perhaps IPA {{IPA|[ʝ͂]}} (a [[nasalized]] [[Voiced palatal fricative|palatal fricative]]). (If your browser doesn't show it, the ''jamo'' looks like an equilateral triangle.)
* ㆆ ’ (''yeorin hieuh'' 여린 히읗 &quot;light hieuh&quot; or ''doen ieung'' 된 이응 &quot;strong ieung&quot;): A [[glottal stop]], &quot;lighter than ㅎ and harsher than ㅇ&quot;.
* ㆁ ''ng'' (''yet-ieung'' 옛이응): The original ''jamo'' for {{IPA|[ŋ]}}; now conflated with ㅇ ''ieung''. (With some computer [[typeface|fonts]], ''yet-ieung'' is shown as a flattened version of ''ieung'', but the correct form is with a long peak, longer than what you would see on a [[serif]] version of ''ieung''.)
* ㅸ ''β'' (''gabyeoun bieup'' 가벼운 비읍): IPA {{IPA|[f]}}. This letter appears to be a digraph of ''bieup'' and ''ieung'', but it may be more complicated than that. There were three other less common ''jamo'' for sounds in this section of the Chinese rhyme tables, ᇢ ''w'' (IPA [w] or [m]), a theoretical ᇴ ''f'', and ㅹ ''ff'' {{IPA|[v̤]}}. 

There were two other now-obsolete double ''jamo'',
* ㆅ ''x'' (''ssanghieuh'' 쌍히읗 &quot;double ''hieuh''&quot;): IPA {{IPA|[ɣ̈ʲ]}} or {{IPA|[ɣ̈]}}. 
* ㆀ (''ssang-ieung'' 쌍이응 &quot;double ''ieung''&quot;): Another ''jamo'' used to represent the rime tables. 

In the original Hangul system, double ''jamo'' were used to represent Chinese voiced (濁音) consonants (which survive in the [[Shanghainese (dialect)|Shanghainese]] [[slack voice|slack]] consonants), and were not used for Korean words. It was only later that a similar convention was used to represent the modern &quot;tense&quot; ([[Faucalized voice|faucalized]]) consonants of Korean.

The sibilant (&quot;dental&quot;) consonants were modified to represent the two series of Chinese sibilants, [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] and [[Retroflex consonants|retroflex]], a &quot;round vs. sharp&quot; distinction which was never made in Korean, and which was even being lost from northern Chinese. The alveolar ''jamo'' had longer left stems, while retroflexes had longer right stems:

{| border=1 style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse&quot;
|-
! Original consonants
| ㅅ || ㅆ || ㅈ || ㅉ || ㅊ
|-
! ''Chidu-eum'' (alveolar sibilant)
| ᄼ || ᄽ || ᅎ || ᅏ || ᅔ
|-
! ''Jeongchi-eum'' (retroflex sibilant)
| ᄾ || ᄿ || ᅐ || ᅑ || ᅕ
|}

There were also [[consonant cluster]]s that have since dropped out of the language, such as ㅴ ''bsg'' and ㅵ ''bsd'', as well as [[diphthong]]s that were only used to represent Chinese medials, such as ㆇ, ㆈ, ㆊ, ㆋ.

Some of the sounds represented by these ''jamo'' for &quot;obsolete&quot; Korean (as opposed to for Chinese) still exist in some dialects of Korean.

==Syllabic blocks==
Except for a few grammatical morphemes in the early days of Hangul, no ''jamo'' may stand alone to represent the Korean language. Instead, ''jamo'' are grouped into [[syllable|syllabic]] blocks containing, at minimum, an initial ([[syllable onset|syllabic onset]]) and a medial ([[syllable nucleus|syllabic nucleus]]). When a syllable has no initial consonant, the null initial ㅇ''ieung'' is used as a placeholder. No placeholder is needed when there is no final ([[syllable coda|syllabic coda]]). 

The null initial was originally just that, null, but since it was only used in initial position, and the consonant ''ng'' was silent when initial as well as having a similar shape to the null character, the two came to be seen as the same letter. 

Syllabic blocks may be composed of two or three ''jamo'':

# Two ''jamo'': an initial (a consonant or [[consonant cluster]], or the null ㅇ) + a medial (a vowel or [[diphthong]])
# Three jamo: an initial + a medial + a final (a consonant or consonant cluster)

The placement, or &quot;stacking&quot;, of ''jamo'' in the block follows set patterns: 
# The components of a complex ''jamo'' are written left to right. The most complex are two: ㅄ, ㅝ, etc. (Obsolete combinations are more complex: ㅵ, ㆋ, etc.)
# All modern Hangul vowels have either a vertical or horizontal axis. 
#*''Vertical'' vowel ''jamo'' are written to the ''right'' of the initial: ㅣ ''i''. 
#*''Horizontal'' vowel ''jamo'' are written ''under'' the initial: ㅡ ''eu''.
#*When a vowel ''jamo'' has both horizontal and vertical components, it ''wraps'' around the intitial from the bottom to the right: ㅢ ''ui''. 
# A final ''jamo'', if there is one, is added at the bottom. This is called 받침 ''batchim'' &quot;supporting floor&quot;.
# Blocks are always written in phonetic order, initial-medial-final. Therefore, 
#*Syllables with a horizontal vowel ''jamo'' are written downward: 읍 ''eup''. 
#*Syllables with a vertical vowel ''jamo'' and simple final are written clockwise: 쌍 ''ssang''. 
#*Syllables with a wrapping vowel ''jamo'' switch direction (down-right-down): 된 ''doen''. 
#*Syllables with a complex final are written left to right at the bottom: 밟 ''balp''.

The resulting block is written within a rectangle of the same size and shape as a ''[[hanja]]'', so to a naive eye syllabic blocks may be confused with ''hanja''.

Not including obsolete ''jamo'', there are some 11,571 possible Hangul blocks.

There was a very minor movement in the [[twentieth century]] to abolish syllabic blocks and write the ''jamo'' individually and in a row, in the fashion of the Western alphabets: ㄱㅡㄷ ''geut''. However, the blocks make Hangul very efficient to read, as each syllable has a unique shape. Now that Hangul orthography is [[Morphophonology|morphophonemic]] (see below), this means that Hangul ''words'' have easily recognizable shapes. This is a great help to the reader; a similar word-recognition advantage has kept the Semitic [[abjad]]s vowel-free for millennia. Indeed, people raised reading Chinese or Korean often report that reading the strings of letters in an alphabet like English is like trying to read [[Morse code]], and the Korean linear writing movement has never gained much support.

==Orthography==
Until the 20th century, no official orthography of Hangul had been established. Due to liaison, heavy consonant assimilation, dialectical variants and other reasons, a Korean word can potentially be spelled in various ways. King Sejong seemed to prefer [[Morphophonology|morphophonemic]] spelling (representing the underlying morphology) rather than a [[phoneme|phonemic]] one (representing the actual sounds). However, early in its history, Hangul was dominated by phonemic spelling. Over the centuries the orthography became partially morphophonemic, first in nouns, and later in verbs. Today it is as morphophonemic as is practical. 

*Pronunciation and translation:
:{{IPA|[mo.tʰa.nɯn.sa.ɾa.mi]}} 
:''a person who cannot do it''
*Phonemic orthography: 
:모타는사라미 
:{{IPA|/mo.tʰa.nɯn.sa.la.mi/}}
*Morphophonemic orthography: 
:못하는사람이
:{{IPA|&lt;nowiki&gt;|mos.ha.nɯn.sa.lam.i |&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
Morpheme-by-morpheme [[gloss]]:
{|
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||못-하-는||사람-이
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||mos-ha-neun||saram-i
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||cannot-do-[modifier]||person-[subject]
|}

After [[Gabo Reform]] in 1894, [[Joseon Dynasty]] and later [[Korean Empire]] started to write all official documents in Hangul. Under the government's management, proper usage of Hangul, including orthography, was discussed, until Korea was [[Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty|annexed]] by Japan in 1910.

The Japanese [[Government-General of Chosen]] established the writing style of a mixture of Hanja and Hangul, as in the Japanese writing system. The government revised the spelling rules in 1912, 1921 and 1930, which were relatively phonemic.

The [[Hangul Society]], originally founded by [[Ju Si-gyeong]], announced a proposal for a new, strongly morphophonemic orthography in 1933, which became the prototype of the contemporary orthographies in both North and South Korea. After Korea was divided, the North and South revised orthographies separately. The guiding text for Hangul orthography is the called the ''[[Hangeul machumbeop]],'' whose last South Korean revision was published in 1988 by the Ministry of Education.

===Mixed scripts===
During the Japanese colonial era, ''hanja'' were used for lexical (noun and verb) roots, and Hangul for grammatical words and inflections, much as ''kanji'' and ''kana'' are used in Japanese. However, ''hanja'' have been almost entirely phased out of daily use in North Korea, and in South Korea they are now mostly restricted to parenthetical glosses for proper names and for disambiguating homonyms. 

Arabic numerals can also be mixed in with hangul, as in 2005년 7월 5일 ([[5 July]], [[2005]]). 

The Latin alphabet, and occasionally other alphabets, may be sprinkled within Korean texts for illustrative purposes, or for unassimilated loanwords.

==Style==
Hangul may be written either vertically or horizontally. The traditional direction is the Chinese style of writing top to bottom, right to left. Horizontal writing in the style of the Roman alphabet was promoted by [[Ju Si-gyeong]], and has become overwhelmingly preferred.

In ''[[Hunmin Jeongeum (document)|Hunmin Jeong-eum]]'', Hangul was printed in sans-serif angular lines of even thickness.  This style is found in books published before about 1900, and can be found today in stone carvings (on statues, for example).

Over the centuries, an ink-brush style of [[calligraphy]] developed, employing the same style of lines and angles as Chinese calligraphy. This brush style is called ''[[myeongjo]]'' after the Chinese [[Ming Dynasty]] (Chinese ''[[Ming Dynasty|míngcháo]]'', Japanese ''[[minchō]]''), and is used today in books, newspapers, and magazines, and several computer [[typeface|fonts]] (e.&amp;nbsp;g. [[Batang|바탕]]).

A [[sans-serif]] style with lines of equal width has re-emerged with pencil and pen writing, and is often the default typeface of Web browsers. A minor advantage of this style is that it makes it easier to distinguish ''-eung'' from ''-ung'' even in small or untidy print, as the ''jongseong ieung'' (ᆼ) of such fonts (e.&amp;nbsp;g. [[Gulim|굴림]], [[Dotum|돋움]]) usually lacks a [[serif]] that could be mistaken for the ㅜ ''(u) jamo''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'s short vertical line.

'''Henry Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley''' ([[November 23]], [[1887]]-[[August 10]], [[1915]]) was an [[England|English]] [[physics|physicist]].  His main contribution to science, the justification of the concept of [[atomic number]], advanced [[chemistry]].

==Biography==
Moseley was born in [[Weymouth]], England, 1887. In [[1906]] he entered [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]] of the [[University of Oxford]], and on graduation from that institution went to [[University of Manchester|Manchester University]] to work with [[Ernest Rutherford]]. For his first year at Manchester, he had a full teaching load, but after a year he was relieved of his teaching duties and began full-time research.

In [[1913]], by using [[x-ray]] [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]] obtained by [[diffraction]] in [[crystal]]s, he found a systematic relation between [[wavelength]] and [[atomic number]], [[Moseley's law]]. Previous to this, atomic numbers had been thought of as an arbitrary number, based on sequence of [[atomic weight]]s, but altered when necessary (for example, by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]]) to put an [[chemical element|element]] in the appropriate place in the [[periodic table]]. Moseley's discovery showed that atomic numbers were not arbitrary but had an experimentally measurable basis. In addition, Moseley showed that there were gaps in the sequence at numbers 43, 61 and 75 (now known to be radioactive, non-naturally-occurring, [[technetium]] and [[promethium]], and the last discovered naturally-occurring element [[rhenium]], respectively). Mendeleev had previously predicted [[technetium]], and [[Bohuslav Brauner]] had previously predicted promethium; Moseley confirmed their predictions, predicted one additional undiscovered element, and showed there were no other gaps in the periodic table between aluminum and gold.

In [[1914]] he resigned at Manchester to return to Oxford to pursue his research, but when World War I broke out, he turned down a job offer and enlisted in the [[Royal Engineers]]. He fought at [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]], where he was killed in action by a sniper in 1915. Many have since speculated that he could have won the Nobel Prize, but was unable to because it is only awarded to the living.

Only twenty-seven years old at death, Moseley could in many scientists' opinions have contributed much to the knowledge of atomic structure had he lived. It is speculated that because of Moseley's death in the War that the British government no longer allowed their scientists to enlist in combat.

'''The Game of Life''' is a [[board game]] designed by [[Reuben Klamer]] and originally published by [[Milton Bradley Company]] (now a subsidiary of [[Hasbro]]) in [[1960]] to celebrate Milton Bradley's centennial.
[[Image:Game of life board.jpg|thumb|300px|rihgt|Early stages in a game of 'The Game of Life']]
Between 2 and 10 players each get a plastic car in which they can collect their &quot;family&quot; throughout the game. Each turn consists of spinning a wheel with the numbers 1 to 10 on it, and obeying the instructions of the space they land on. As one progresses through the game, one collects cards with life events on them (''e.g.'' climb [[Mount Everest|Mt. Everest]], cure the [[common cold]] ''etc.''). The game board also has small mountains and other similar pieces, so the board does not appear flat. The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.

The game was endorsed by [[Art Linkletter]] in the [[1960s]] and was updated in [[1992]] to reward players for &quot;good&quot; behavior, such as recycling trash. It is now part of the permanent collection of the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]]'s [[National Museum of American History]].

'''Prince Henry of Wales''' (Henry Charles Albert David [[Mountbatten-Windsor]]) (born [[September 15]], [[1984]]), informally named '''Prince Harry''' by his parents,{{ref|parents}} is the third in the line of succession to the British throne and the thrones of other [[Commonwealth Realm]]s, behind his father, the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]], and his elder brother, [[Prince William of Wales]]. He is the grandson of Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]]. He has generally been regarded as a carefree, fun-loving, and rebellious member of the [[British Royal Family]]. 

==Birth and childhood==
Harry was born on [[September 15]], [[1984]] at [[St Mary's Hospital (London)|St Mary's Hospital]], [[Paddington]], in central [[London]]. His father is His Royal Highness [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles, Prince of Wales]], the eldest son of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]. His mother is the late [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], the former wife of the Prince of Wales, who died in 1997. He has an elder brother, [[Prince William of Wales|Prince William]].

He was christened on [[December 21]] [[1984]] at [[St. George's Chapel]] [[Windsor Castle]] by the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Robert Alexander Kennedy Runcie|Dr. Robert Runcie]]. His godparents were: his uncle the [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Duke of York]], [[Lady Sarah Chatto]], Lady Vestey, Mrs William Bartholomew; the portrait painter, Mr. Bryan Organ; and Mr. Gerald Ward. 

The prince's official family name is that of Windsor, according to his grandmother's royal proclamation of 1960, but some of the descendants of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] appear to utilize the surname [[Mountbatten-Windsor]] as personal preference. At school, Prince Harry is known as Officer Cadet Wales or Mr Wales.

Charles is said to have wanted a daughter, and to have been deeply disappointed when the baby was a boy; worse, according to Diana's version of events, Harry, Charles ruefully noted, had &quot;ruddy hair&quot;, a Spencer family trait. Biographers agree that their marriage was already troubled before then, and became irreparably broken shortly afterwards. Some people note that Harry shares red hair colour with Diana's lover [[James Hewitt]], and see this superficial characteristic enough to doubt Charles' paternity.  Hewitt's affair with Diana may not have begun, however, until well after Harry was born. On 29th June 2005, the Sun newspaper published extracts from a close friend of Princess Diana, that proved Prince Charles was Harry's father.  Harry resembles both his paternal grandfather in his youth and increasingly the Prince of Wales.

===Death of Diana, Princess of Wales===
[[Image:Harry and William.jpg|thumb|200px|Prince Harry with his brother Prince William in an official portrait for his 21st birthday]]
On [[August 31]], [[1997]], Harry's mother died following in a car accident in [[Paris]], with her partner [[Dodi Al-Fayed]] and their driver [[Henri Paul]] (although a bodyguard survived, probably because he was the only one in the car wearing a seat belt). Her death came days after she spent a holiday in Southern France with William and Harry. The princes were staying at [[Balmoral Castle]]; it was Charles who awoke them and broke the tragic news.

At Diana's celebrity-studded funeral - which was broadcast live throughout the world - the princes, their father, grandfather (Prince Philip), and uncle ([[Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer |the Earl Spencer]]) walked behind Diana's funeral cortege from [[Buckingham Palace]] to [[Westminster Abbey]]. On Diana's coffin was a card from Harry, made out to ''Mummy''. Cameras were barred from showing the princes during the service itself; Harry reportedly broke down and sobbed several times. Both princes were praised for their strength shown on that day.

Contrary to his eulogy, in which he promised that Diana's &quot;blood family&quot; would take over her less-traditional upbringing of them, the boys have seen little of the Earl Spencer and the other members of Diana's family.

Harry attended the Mrs. Jane Mynors's nursery school in West [[London]], the same as William. He later followed his brother to the pre-prep [[Wetherby School]], and later to [[Ludgrove School]] in [[Berkshire]]. He later attended the prestigious [[Eton College]] in [[Eton, Berkshire]]. In June 2003, he finished Eton with two [[A-level]]s in Geography and Art, of grades D and B respectively.

At school, he developed his love of sport, particularly [[polo]] and [[rugby union]]. He has also participated in the [[Eton Wall Game]].

After finishing [[Eton College|Eton]], Harry undertook a [[gap year]], visiting [[Australia]] and [[Africa]]. In Australia he worked on a cattle station, and watched the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]] being held in the country. In Africa, he worked in an orphanage in [[Lesotho]]. Later in the year he travelled to [[Argentina]] on vacation, but returned amid rumours of drunkenness and a kidnapping attempt.

==Army==
On [[May 8]] [[2005]], the Prince entered the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]].  There he was known as Officer Cadet Wales instead of using his royal title, and was part of [[Alamein Company]]. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4526077.stm]  

Clarence House announced that he will, upon commissioning in April 2006, join the [[Blues and Royals]], regiment of the [[Household Cavalry]], and train as a reconnaissance troop commander. [http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/princes/harry/060125_harry_regiment.html]
Since then it was reported that he was expected to deploy to [[Iraq]] in May 2007 as part of the [[1st Mechanised Brigade]] of the [[3rd (UK) Mechanised Division]]. The [[Blues and Royals]] would form part of the force patrolling the governorate of [[Maysan]] on the Iran-Iraq border.

==Romances==
The prince's only serious romance has been with [[Chelsy Davy]] (born 1985), a [[Zimbabwe]]-born heiress to an [[African]] [[ranch]]ing and real estate fortune. According to published reports quoting the young woman's uncle Paul Davy, she and the prince discussed marriage in December 2004. This desire, however, resulted in no public announcements of any engagement, formal or informal, and the couple reportedly broke off their relationship in February 2005. However, in an interview conducted for his twenty-first birthday in September 2005, Prince Harry referred to Chelsy as his girlfriend and the press reported that their relationship was at that time eighteen months old, strongly contradicting reports they were no longer a couple.

==Controversies==
===Drinking and alleged drug-taking ===
Some of Harry's reported actions have provoked widespread media attention. In January 2002, it was revealed that the prince had admitted smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and had allegedly engaged in under-age drinking, raising the possibility that criminal charges would be filed against him in the summer of 2001. A subsequent police investigation cleared Harry of wrongdoing and Harry's father Charles was praised for his handling of the situation, which included taking Harry to visit a drug rehabilitation facility in [[London]]. However, the basement of Charles's [[Highgrove]] home is rumoured to be a private nightclub nicknamed &quot;Club H&quot;, where Harry and his friends can entertain themselves free of observation by the press.

===Altercation with paparazzo===
On the morning of [[October 21]], [[2004]], HRH Prince Harry had an altercation with  [[paparazzi|paparazzo]] photographer Chris Uncle as he left [[Pangaea Nightclub|Pangaea]], a [[Piccadilly Circus]] nightclub. The photographer was left with a cut lip whilst the Prince left unharmed. After the story appeared in the tabloids, he issued a statement in which he stated that his behaviour had been &quot;disappointing&quot; and in which he publicly apologised to Charles.

===Nazi costume===
[[Image:Sun harry the nazi.jpg|150px|thumb|right|The &quot;Harry the Nazi&quot; photo on the cover page of ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]''.]] On [[January 8]], [[2005]], Harry attended a [[costume party|fancy-dress party]] (costume party) on the theme of &quot;Colonials and Natives&quot; at the country estate of Olympic show jumper Richard Meade in [[Wiltshire]]. Choosing not to use any British reference, Harry came to the party wearing a [[military uniform|military tunic]] with a [[Flag of Germany|German flag]] on the arm; when he took it off, the pale [[khaki]] shirt underneath showed a [[Wehrmacht]] national emblem on the collar and a [[swastika]] armband. A reporter from ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' who had been tipped off previously took a photo of Harry that also showed him holding a [[cigarette]] and a [[Alcoholic beverage|drink]]. The incongruity of his costume was punctuated by the fact that the swastika on the armband was of the type used by the [[Finnish Defence Forces|Finnish military]]. After the photo was published in the [[January 13]], [[2005]] issue of ''The Sun'', an intense controvethe Svevs dynasty ended the Tuscans and Dante re-discovered it (see ''De Vulgari Eloquentia'' and ''Vita Nova'')and integrated the Sicilians into Florence's linguistic heritage. 

The ''[[dolce stil novo]],'' the platonic school of courtly love, can be considered the link between the old southern school and Tuscan poetry which aimed to express the new intellectual sensibility and fervor of the newly-born city-states, as Florence. Dante's work, ''Divina Commedia'' was the first of its kind to be written in a dialect (though sensibly enriched compared with its spoken counterpart), as opposed to the traditional Latin. The success of his work spread the Florentine dialect, and gave it prestige and acceptance. For this he is referred to as the father of the Italian Language. 

By the time Italy was unified [[1861]], the Italian standard had further been influenced by Florentine through the work of the [[Accademia della Crusca]] (Cardinal [[Pietro Bembo]] and followers). Bembo laid the foundation for what is today's modern standard. But Bembo was a purist and had accepted no other influence than that from Dante, Petrarca and Boccaccio. As time went on, the language was losing touch with linguistic change, and could not put up with technology and science. The much-needed update would have to wait a little longer until, in what is commonly regarded as the first modern novel of the Italian literature, [[The Betrothed|''I Promessi Sposi'']] (The Betrothed), [[Alessandro Manzoni]] further refined his widely read novel by &quot;rinsing&quot; it in the waters of the [[Arno]] ([[Florence]]'s river), as he states in his 1840 Preface. 

However, Manzoni refused the Crusca's purist, written Florentine-only attitude and admitted a certain influence from other dialects, though he reduced it as compared to the first edition of ([[1821]]). After unification the huge number of civil servants and soldiers recruited from all over the country introduced many more words and idioms from their home dialects (&quot;ciao&quot; is Venetian, &quot;panettone&quot; is Milanese etc.), in fact confirming Manzoni's linguistic views.

Tuscan has thus become one of the twenty official dialects of Italy. Though technically speaking the division between dialect and language is purely conventional, it has been used by scholars (e.g., by Francesco Bruni) to distinguish between the languages that made up the Italian ''[[koine]],'' and those which had very little or no part in it, as [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Südtirolean language|Südtirolean]], [[Ladino language|Ladino]], [[Friulian language|Friulian]] and [[Occitan language|Occitan]], which are still spoken by small minorities.  

Dialects are generally not used for general communication (e.g., on TV), but are limited to native speakers in informal contexts. Dialect is often deprecated  as a sign of poor education. Younger generations, especially those under 35 (though it may vary in different areas), speak almost exclusively standard Italian in all situations, usually with local accents.{{fact}}  Different accents can be recognized from various factors: the openness of vowels, the length of the consonants, and influence of the local dialect (for example, ''annà'' for ''andare'' in the area of Rome).

Dialects have their share of enthusiasts, but in most areas of Italy this is a small niche of the population. The promotion of dialects by political forces such as the [[Lega Nord]] has possibly damaged rather than promoted their status.  Throughout Italy, some singers and actors use dialects as their language, but the language they use is, in most cases, strongly influenced by Italian.

Dialects and accents are often used in movies to provide comic relief or to produce stereotypes: northern dialects can be connected to self-made entrepreneurs; a Roman accent is associated with arrogant, simple-minded bullies; Neapolitan reminds of dishonest slackers, or of people living from hand to mouth; and, even in Italy, Sicilian is often associated with the [[Mafia]]. However, many screenwriters also explore the more expressive and spontaneous features of a dialect, often to challenge the common cliches and present a richer, less explored reality.

==Sounds==
Main Page: [[Italian phonology]]
{{IPA notice}}
&lt;!-- Description of the sound set of the language can include phoneme charts and example words for each phoneme like in [[French language]]. If there is significant discussion here, it is probably best to divide the section into vowels and consonants subsections. --&gt;

===Vowels===

Italian has seven vowel phonemes: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/ɔ/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}.  The pairs {{IPA|/e/}}-{{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}-{{IPA|/ɔ/}} are seldom distinguished in writing and often confused, even though each variety of Italian employs both phonemes consistently. Compare, for example: {{IPA|/per'kɛ/}} (because) and {{IPA|/'senti/}} (you listen), employed by some northern speakers, with {{IPA|/per'ke/}} and {{IPA|/'sɛnti/}}, as pronounced by most central and southern speakers. As a result, the usage is strongly indicative of a person's origin. The standard (Tuscan) usage of these vowels is listed in vocabularies, and employed outside Tuscany mainly by the more educated people, especially actors and (television) journalists.
These are truly different [[phonemes]], however: compare {{IPA|/'peska/}} (fishing) and {{IPA|/'pɛska/}} (peach), both spelled &quot;pesca&quot; ({{Audio|It-pesca.ogg|listen}}). Similarly {{IPA|/'botte/}} (barrel) and {{IPA|/'bɔtte/}} (beatings), both spelled as &quot;botte&quot;, discriminate {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} ({{Audio|It-botte-mp.ogg|listen}}).

In general, vowel combinations usually pronounce each vowel separately.  [[Diphthong]]s exist,(e.g. &quot;uo&quot;, &quot;iu&quot;, &quot;ie&quot;, &quot;ai&quot;),  but are limited to the pattern:
(unstressed &quot;u&quot; or &quot;i&quot;, or zero) + (stressed vowel) + (unstressed &quot;u&quot; or &quot;i&quot;, or zero)

The unstressed &quot;u&quot; in a diphthong approximates the English semivowel &quot;w&quot;, the unstressed &quot;i&quot; approximates the semivowel &quot;y&quot;.  E.g.: ''buono'', ''ieri''.
As a semivowel, &quot;j&quot; is an alternate spelling of i, currently obsolete but common until early 20th century and preserved in specific words like &quot;Jesi&quot; (a town) or &quot;Jacopo&quot; (a first name).

[[Triphthong]]s are limited to a diphthong plus an unstressed &quot;i&quot;. (e.g. ''miei'', ''tuoi''.)   Other sequences of three vowels exist (e.g. ''noia'', ''febbraio''), but they are not triphthongs; they consist of a vowel followed by a diphthong.

===Consonants===

Two symbols in a table cell denote the voiceless and voiced consonant, respectively.

The phoneme {{IPA|/n/}} undergoes assimilation when followed by a consonant, e.g., when followed by a velar ({{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/g/}}) it's pronounced {{IPA|[ŋ]}}, etc.

Italian plosives are not [[aspirated]] (unlike in English).  Italian speakers hear the difference as a foreign accent.

Italian has geminate, or double, consonants, which are distinguished by length. Length is distinctive for all [[consonant]]s except for {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, {{IPA|/ʦ/}}, {{IPA|/ʣ/}}, {{IPA|/ʎ/}} {{IPA|/ɲ/}}, which are always geminate, and {{IPA|/z/}} which is always single. 
Geminate plosives and affricates are realized as lengthened closures. Geminate fricatives, nasals, and {{IPA|/l/}} are realized as lengthened [[continuant]]s. Geminate {{IPA|/ɾ/}} is realized as the trill {{IPA|[rr]}}.

===Assimilation===

Italian has few diphthongs, and so most unfamiliar diphthongs heard in foreign words (in particular, those with a first vowel that is not &quot;i&quot; or &quot;u&quot;, or a first vowel that is stressed), will be assimilated as the corresponding [[dieresis]] (i.e., the vowel sounds will be pronounced separately).   Italian [[phonotactics]] don't usually permit words to end on consonants, so foreign words may receive extra terminal vowel sounds.

==Vocabulary==

This section should contain a discussion of any special features of the vocabulary (or lexicon) of the language, like if it contains a large number of borrowed words or a different sets of words for different politeness levels, taboo groups, etc.
--&gt;

==Writing system==
[[Image:Jon Hawk.jpg|right|thumb|280px|Example of Italian]]
Italian is written using the [[Latin alphabet]]. The letters ''J'', ''K'', ''W'', ''X'' and'' Y'' are not part of the standard Italian alphabet, but are seen in imported words (such as ''jeans'', ''whiskey'', ''taxi''). ''J'' may also appear in many words from different dialects. Each of these foreign letters had an Italian equivalent spelling: ''gi'',  ''ch'', ''u'', ''cs'' or ''s'', and ''i'', but these are now obsolete.

* Italian uses the [[acute accent]] over the letter ''E'' (as in ''perché'', why/because) to indicate a mid-close vowel, and the [[grave accent]] (as in ''tè'', tea) to indicate a mid-open vowel. The [[grave accent]] is also used on letters ''A'', ''I'', ''O'', and ''U'' to mark the stress position when it is on the last letter of a word (for instance ''gioventù'', youth). Typically, the penultimate syllable is stressed. If other syllables are stressed, marking an accent is not mandatory, as is instead done in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and, in virtually all cases, no accent is marked. In some cases, when the word is ambiguous (as ''principi''), the accent is sometimes marked in order to disambiguate the meaning (in this case, ''príncipi'', princes, or ''princípi'', principles; ''balia'', nurse or ''balìa'', force

* The letter ''H'' is always silent when it begins a word, and is only used to distinguish ''ho'', ''hai'', ''ha'', ''hanno'' (present indicative of ''avere'', to have) from ''o'' (or), ''ai'' (to the), ''a'' (to), ''anno'' (year). ''H'' is otherwise used for some combinations with other letters (see below), but the /h/ sound does not exist in Italian.

* The letter ''Z'' is pronounced {{IPA|/dz/}}, for example: ''Zanzara'' {{IPA|/dzanˈdzara/}} (mosquito), or sometimes {{IPA|/ts/}}, for example: ''Nazione'' {{IPA|/naˈtsione/}} (nation), depending on context, though there are few minimal pairs. The same goes with ''S'', which can be pronounced {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/z/}}. However, these two phonemes are in complementary distribution everywhere except between two vowels in the same word, and even in such environment there are extremely few minimal pairs, therefore this distinction is being lost in most accents.

* The letters ''C'' and ''G'' are [[affricate]]s: {{IPA|/ʧ/}} as in &quot;chair&quot; and {{IPA|/ʤ/}} as in &quot;gem&quot;, respectively, before the [[front vowel]]s ''I'' and ''E''.  They are pronounced as [[plosive]]s {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/g/}} (as in &quot;call&quot; and &quot;gall&quot;) otherwise&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. But, the normally silent ''H'' is added between ''CI'', ''CE'', ''GI'' or ''GE'' if the consonant is to be a plosive.  For example:

:{| border=2 cellpadding=2
!
|Before back vowel:  plosive
|Before front vowel:  affricate
|With &quot;H&quot;:  plosive
|-
!&quot;C&quot;
|'''cara''' ({{IPA|ˈkara}})
|'''ciao''' ({{IPA|/ˈʧao/}})
|'''chiaro''' ({{IPA|/ˈkjaro/}})
|-
!&quot;G&quot;
|'''gallo''' ({{IPA|/ˈgallo/}})
|'''genere''' ({{IPA|/ˈʤɛnere/}})
|'''ghetto''' ({{IPA|/ˈgetto/}})
|}

:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;font size=-1&gt;(Front/back vowel rules for ''C'' and ''G'' are similar in [[French language|French]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and to some extent [[English language|English]] (including [[Old English]]).  [[swedish language|Swedish]] and [[norwegian language|Norwegian]] have similar rules for ''K'' and ''G''.  See also [[palatalization]].)&lt;/font&gt;

* There are two special [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] in Italian:  ''GN'' and ''GL''.  ''GN'' is always pronounced {{IPA2|ɲ}} ,for the spanish, between &quot;n&quot; and &quot;e&quot;, and ''GL'' (only in italian) is pronounced {{IPA2|λ}}) palatal lateral consonant (between &quot;l&quot; and &quot;e&quot; long) or but only before i, and never when at the beginning of the word, except in the plural form ''gli'' of the masculine [[definite article]].  (Compare with [[Spanish language|Spanish]] &quot;ñ&quot; and &quot;ll&quot;, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] &quot;nh&quot; and &quot;lh&quot;.)

* In general all letters are clearly pronounced, and always in the same way. (The only notable allophonic variations in the pronunciation of phonemes in standard Italian are the assimilation of /n/ before consonants, and vowel length (vowels are long in stressed open syllables, and short elsewhere) &amp;mdash; compare with the enormous number of allophones of the English phoneme /t/. Spelling is clearly phonetic and difficult to mistake given a clear pronunciation.  Exceptions are generally only found in foreign borrowings. There is less [[dyslexia]] than in languages like English.


=== Usage among Younger Generations ===
Some variations in the usage of the writing system may be present in practical use. Most scholars consider these to be mistakes, but they are so common that knowledge of these may be useful to read an Italian text.
* Usage of '''x''' instead of ''per'': this is very common among teenagers and in [[SMS]] abbreviations. Since ''per'' means &quot;to&quot;, &quot;for you&quot; becomes ''x te'', similar to the English ''4 U''. Words containing ''per'' can also have it substituted with ''x'', and once a university student allegedly pronounced the surname of Italian revolutionary [[Nino Bixio]] as ''Biperio'' at an oral exam[http://pacs.unica.it/rassegna/rassegna0905.txt]. ''Perché'' (both &quot;why&quot; and &quot;because&quot;) is often shortened as ''x`''.
* Usage of foreign letters such as ''k'', ''j'' and ''y'', especially in nicknames and SMS language: ''ke'' instead of ''che'', ''Giusy'' instead of ''Giuseppina''. This is curiously mirrored in the usage of ''i'' in English names such as ''Staci'' instead of ''Stacey'', or in the usage of ''c'' in Northern Europe (''Jacob'' instead of ''Jakob''). The letter ''k'' also appears to give words a certain strength and threatening aspect, possibly because it is associated with [[Germany]]. Politician [[Francesco Cossiga]] used to be nicknamed ''Kossiga'' by rioting students as early as 1968, because of his role as minister of internal affairs.
* Accents are often substituted by apostrophes, such as in ''perche''' instead of ''perché''. ''È'' is particularly rare, as it is absent from the Italian keyboard layout. Few are aware of the distinction between grave and acute accents.

==Examples==

*cheers (generic toast): ''cin cin'' {{IPA|}}
*English: ''inglese'' {{IPA|/inˈgleze/}}
*good-bye: ''arrivederci'' {{IPA|/arriveˈdertʃi/}}
*hello: ''ciao'' {{IPA|/ˈtʃao/}} (informal); ''buongiorno'' {{IPA|/bwonˈdʒorno/}} (good morning/good afternoon), ''buonasera'' {{IPA|/bwonaˈsera/}} (good evening)
*Yes: ''sì'' {{IPA|/si/}} 
*No: ''no'' {{IPA|/nɔ/}}
*Sorry: ''scusi'' /{{IPA|ˈskuzi}}/
*Again: ''di nuovo'' /{{IPA|di ˈnwɔvo}}/
*Always: ''sempre'' /{{IPA|ˈsɛmpre}}/
*When: ''quando'' {{IPA|/ˈkwando/}}
*Why? / Because: ''perché'' {{IPA|/per'ke/}} 
*how much?: ''quanto'' {{IPA|/ˈkwanto/}} 
*thank you!: ''grazie!'' {{IPA|/ˈgrattsje/}}
*Bon appetit: ''Buon appetito'' {{IPA|/ˌbwɔn appeˈtito/}}
*you're welcome!: ''prego!'' {{IPA|/ˈprɛgo/}}
*I love you: ''Ti amo'' {{IPA|/ti ˈamo/}}

'''2:1''' In quei giorni, un decreto di Cesare Augusto ordinava che si facesse un censimento di tutta la terra. '''2''' Questo primo censimento fu fatto quando Quirino era governatore della Siria. '''3''' Tutti andavano a farsi registrare, ciascuno nella propria città. '''4''' Anche Giuseppe, che era della casa e della famiglia di Davide, dalla città di Nazaret e dalla Galilea si recò in Giudea nella città di Davide, chiamata Betlemme, '''5''' per farsi registrare insieme a Maria, sua sposa, che era incinta. '''6''' Proprio mentre si trovavano lì, venne il tempo per lei di partorire. '''7''' Mise al mondo il suo primogenito, lo avvolse in fasce e lo depose in una mangiatoia, poiché non c'era posto per loro nella locanda.

'''Tracy Morrow''' (born [[February 16]], [[1958]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]]), better known as '''Ice-T''' or '''Ice T''', is an [[United States|American]] [[rapping|rapper]], [[singer]], and [[actor]]. He is one of the pioneers of [[gangsta rap]] and was also instrumental in creating [[rapcore]].  His subject matter stands as a mixture between the political awareness of [[Public Enemy]] and the hedonism of [[NWA]].

==Career==

After high school, Ice-T joined the Army and served as a ranger in the 25th Infantry. He did not enjoy the experience explaining &quot;I didn't like total submission to a leader other than myself.&quot; [http://videoeta.com/person/1181] [http://media.www.dailytargum.com/media/paper168/news/2004/02/23/PageOne/IceT-Addresses.Group.Provides.Inspiration-614605.shtml?sourcedomain=www.dailytargum.com&amp;MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com]

===Musician===
Ice-T started out with other [[West Coast hip hop|West Coast]] rap pioneers such as [[Kid Frost]], [[DJ Flash]], and [[Egyptian Lover]] with [[Electro (music)|Electro]] recordings. Later on, he changed his style and was the first West Coast rapper to be accepted by the [[East Coast rap|East Coast]]. &quot;6'n The Morning&quot; is sometimes seen as the track that triggered the whole [[gangster rap]] movement. It was produced by [[ The Unknown DJ]], who produced electro funk tracks before and went on to produce ''[[Compton's Most Wanted]]''. The song was inspired by [[Schoolly D]]'s &quot;PSK&quot; and became itself the inspiration for [[Eazy E]] and [[N.W.A.]]'s &quot;Boyz N The Hood.&quot;  Ice-T went on to work with [[Afrika Islam]], the man behind the beats on [[1987]]'s ''Rhyme Pays'', [[1988]]'s ''Power'' and [[1989]]'s ''The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech... Just watch what you say''. 

As the title of this third album suggests, Ice-T was from the start not merely a gangster rapper&amp;mdash;although he was one of the driving forces behind the new style&amp;mdash;but also used rap music as a platform for [[social activism|social]] and [[political activism]]; [[Seymour Stein]] called him &quot;the [[Bob Dylan]] of rap.&quot; On &quot;[[Freedom of Speech]],&quot; Ice-T attacked [[Tipper Gore]] for introducing the [[Parental Advisory]] sticker. In [[1991]], Ice T's fourth album, ''[[Original Gangster]]'', came out; including raps about child abuse and drunk driving as well as the theme song from the movie ''[[New Jack City]]'' by [[Mario Van Peebles]], the movie that re-launched Ice's career as an actor. 

In [[1991]], Ice formed the [[rapcore]]/[[crossover]] band [[Body Count]]. Their debut self-titled album contained a song called &quot;[[Cop Killer]].&quot; which led to the [[Cop Killer controversy]].  This escalated to the point where death threats were sent to Warner Bros executives and stockholders threatened to pull out of the company. This eventually caused the album to be re-issued with &quot;Cop Killer&quot; removed, and [[Warner Brothers Records]] to drop him from the label. He answered the controversy by saying the song was written in character, and that &quot;if you beims there is only one. 

However, phonemic transcriptions may also be broad or narrow, or perhaps it would be better to say abstract vs. concrete. They may show a fair amount of phonetic detail, usually of a phoneme's most common allophone, but because they are abstract symbols they do not need to directly resemble any sound at all. Phonemic symbols will frequently be chosen to avoid diacritics as much as possible, under a 'one sound one symbol' policy, or may even be restricted to the [[ASCII]] symbols of a typical keyboard. For example, the English word ''church'' may be transcribed as {{IPA|/tʃɚtʃ/}}, a close approximation of its actual pronunciation, or more abstractly as {{IPA|/crc/}} (three phonemes, three symbols), which is easier to type. Phonemic symbols should always be explained, especially when they are as divergent from actual pronunciation as {{IPA|/crc/}}.  

Occasionally a transcription will be enclosed in [[vertical bar|pipes]] (&quot;| |&quot;). This goes beyond phonology into [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] analysis. For example, the words ''pets'' and ''beds'' could be transcribed phonetically as {{IPA|[pʰɛʔts]}} and {{IPA|[b̥ɛdz]}} (in a fairly narrow transcription), and phonemically as {{IPA|/pets/}} and {{IPA|/bedz/}}. Because /s/ and /z/ are separate [[phoneme]]s in English (unlike Spanish, for example), they receive separate symbols in the phonemic analysis. However, you probably recognize that underneath this, they represent the same plural ending. This can be indicated with the pipe notation. If you believe the plural ending is essentially an ''s'', as English spelling would suggest, the words can be transcribed {{IPA|&lt;nowiki&gt;|pets|&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} and {{IPA|&lt;nowiki&gt;|beds|&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}. If, as most linguists would probably suggest, it is essentially a ''z'', these would be {{IPA|&lt;nowiki&gt;|petz|&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} and {{IPA|&lt;nowiki&gt;|bedz|&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}.

To avoid confusion with IPA symbols, it may be desirable to specify when native orthography is being used, so that, for example, the English word ''jet'' is not read as &quot;yet&quot;. This is done with [[Bracket|angle brackets]] or ''chevrons'': {{Unicode|〈jet〉}}. It is also common to italicize such words, but the chevrons indicate specifically that they are in the original language's orthography, and not in English [[transliteration]].

The Extended IPA for [[speech pathology]] has added additional bracket notations. Parentheses are used to indicate ''mouthing'' (silent articulation), as in {{IPA|(ʃːː)}}, a silent sign to hush; parentheses are also used to indicate silent pauses, for example (...). Double parentheses indicate obscured or unintelligible sound, as in ((2 syll.)), two audible but unidentifiable syllables. Curly brackets with Italian musical terms are used to mark prosodic notation, such as {{IPA|[{&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;''falsetto''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; hɛlp &lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;''falsetto''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}]}}.

The [[pulmonic egressive|pulmonic]] consonant table, which includes most consonants, is arranged in rows that designate [[manner of articulation]] and columns that designate [[place of articulation]]. The main chart only includes consonants with a single place of articulation.

Notes:
* Asterisks (*) mark reported sounds that do not (yet) have official IPA symbols. See the articles for ''ad hoc'' symbols found in the literature. 
* Daggers (†) mark IPA symbols that do not yet have official [[Unicode]] support. Since May 2005, this is the case of the [[labiodental flap]], symbolized by a right-hook ''v'': [[Image:Labiodental flap (Gentium).png|20px|Labiodental flap]] [http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/N2945.pdf]. In the meantime the similarly shaped [[izhitsa]] (ѵ) is used here.
* In rows where some symbols appear in pairs (the ''[[obstruent]]s''), the symbol to the right represents a [[voiced consonant]] (except for [[breathy voice|breathy-voiced]] {{IPA|[ɦ]}}). However, {{IPA|[ʔ]}} cannot be voiced. In the other rows (the ''[[sonorant]]s''), the single symbol represents a voiced consonant.
* Although there is a single symbol for the coronal places of articulation for all consonants but fricatives, when dealing with a particular language, the symbols are treated as specifically alveolar, post-alveolar, ''etc.'', as appropriate for that language. 
* Shaded areas indicate articulations judged to be impossible.
* The symbols {{IPA|[ʁ, ʕ, ʢ]}} represent either voiced fricatives or approximants. 
* It is primarily the shape of the tongue rather than its position that distinguishes the fricatives {{IPA|[ʃ ʒ]}}, {{IPA|[ɕ ʑ]}}, and {{IPA|[ʂ ʐ]}}. 
* The labiodental nasal {{IPA|[ɱ]}} is not known to exist as a phoneme in any language.

Notes: 
* All clicks are doubly articulated and require two symbols: a velar or uvular stop, plus a symbol for the anterior release: {{IPA|[k͡ǂ, ɡ͡ǂ, ŋ͡ǂ, q͡ǂ, ɢ͡ǂ, ɴ͡ǂ]}} ''etc.'', or {{IPA|[ǂ͡k, ǂ͡ɡ, ǂ͡ŋ, ǂ͡q, ǂ͡ɢ, ǂ͡ɴ]}}. When the dorsal articulation is omitted, a {{IPA|[k]}} may usually be assumed. 
* Symbols for the [[voiceless consonant|voiceless]] implosives {{IPA|[ƥ, ƭ, ƈ, ƙ, ʠ]}} are no longer supported by the IPA, though they remain in Unicode. Instead, the IPA uses the voiced equivalent with a voiceless diacritic: {{IPA|[ɓ̥, ʛ̥]}}, ''etc''. 
* Although not confirmed from any language, and therefore not &quot;explicitly recognized&quot; by the IPA, a [[Voiced retroflex implosive|retroflex implosive]], &lt;span title=&quot;U+1D91&quot;&gt;{{Unicode|[&amp;#7569;]}}&lt;/span&gt;, is supported in the Unicode Phonetic Extensions Supplement, added in version 4.1 of the Unicode Standard, or can be created as a composite {{IPA|[ɗ̢]}}.
* The ejective symbol is often seen for [[Glottalic consonant|glottalized]] but pulmonic [[sonorant]]s, such as {{IPA|[mʼ], [lʼ], [wʼ], [aʼ]}}, but these are more properly transcribed as creaky ({{IPA|[m̰], [l̰], [w̰], [a̰]}}).

== Vowels ==
[[media:IPA vowel chart 2005.png|Closeup of the vowel chart of the IPA]]
{{CSS IPA vowel chart}}

Notes:
*Where symbols appear in pairs, the one to the right represents a rounded vowel, as does {{IPA|[ʊ]}} (at least prototypically). All others are unrounded.
*{{IPA|[ɶ]}} is not confirmed as a distinct phoneme in any language.
*{{IPA|[a]}} is officially a front vowel, but there is little distinction between front and central open vowels, and {{IPA|[a]}} is frequently used for an open central vowel.

==Affricates and double articulation==

'''[[Affricate]]s''' and '''[[Doubly articulated consonant|doubly articulated]] stops''' are represented by two symbols joined by a tie bar, either above or below the symbols. The six most common affricates are optionally represented by ligatures, though this is no longer official IPA usage, due to the great number of ligatures that would be required to represent all affricates this way. A third affricate transcription sometimes seen uses the superscript notation for a consonant release, for example {{IPA|tˢ}} for {{IPA|t​͡s}}, paralleling {{IPA|kˣ}} ~ {{IPA|k͡x}}. The symbols for the palatal plosives, {{IPA|&lt;c ɟ&gt;,}} are often used as a convenience for {{IPA|[t​͡ʃ d͡ʒ]}} or similar affricates, even in official IPA publications, so they must be interpreted with care.

Note:
*With regard to tone diacritics, Unicode encodes marks for some contour tones, but not all. In Unicode version 4.1, only hacek (rising) and circumflex (falling) diacritics were encoded. Subsequent versions may also include six additional diacritics for contour tones, such as the macron-acute and the grave-acute-grave ligatures. (See an image [[media:IPA suprasegmentals 2005.png|here]].) Note that contour tone diacritics are not encoded as sequences of level tone diacritics in Unicode.
*With regard to tone letters, Unicode does not have separate encodings for contour tones. Instead, sequences of level tone letters are used, with proper display dependent on the font, usually by means of OpenType font rendition: {{IPA|[˥˩]}} or {{IPA|[˦˥˧]}}. (These are probably not displaying correctly in your browser. See the [[media:IPA suprasegmentals 2005.png|image]] for a sample of how they should appear.) Since few fonts support combination tone letters (see the external links for one that is free), a common solution is to use the old system of superscript numerals from '1' to '5', for example [e&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;, e&lt;sup&gt;312&lt;/sup&gt;]. However, this depends on local linguistic tradition, with '5' generally being high and '1' being low for Asian languages, but '1' being high and '5' low for African languages. An old IPA convention sometimes still seen is to use sub-diacritics for low contour tones: {{IPA|[e̖, e̗]}} for ''low-falling'' and ''low-rising''. 
*The upstep and downstep modifiers are superscript arrows. Unicode version 4.1 does not encode these, though subsequent versions will. The arrows for upstep and downstep should not be confused with the full-height arrows, which are used to indicate airflow direction.

== Diacritics ==
[[media:IPA diacritics 2005.png|Closeup of the diacritic section of the IPA chart]]&lt;br&gt;
Sub-diacritics may be placed above a symbol with a descender, i.e. {{IPA|ŋ̊}}. The dotless i, &lt;ı&gt;, is used when the dot would interfere with the diacritic. Other IPA symbols may appear as diacritics to represent phonetic detail: {{IPA|tˢ}} (fricative release), {{IPA|bʱ}} (breathy voice), {{IPA|ˀa}} (glottal onset), {{Unicode|ᵊ}} (epenthetic schwa), o&lt;sup&gt;{{IPA|ʊ}}&lt;/sup&gt; (diphthongization).

Notes:

#With aspirated voiced consonants, the aspiration is also voiced. Many linguists prefer one of the diacritics dedicated to breathy voice.

===Extended IPA diacritics===
[[Media:ExtIPA.png|The letters and diacritics of the ExtIPA]]

The ExtIPA has widened the use of some of the regular IPA symbols, such as {{IPA|ʰp}} for pre-aspiration, {{IPA|tʶ}} for uvularization, or {{IPA|s̼}} for a linguolabial sibilant, as well as adding some new ones. Some of the ExtIPA diacritics are occasionally used for non-disordered speech, for example for the unusual airstream mechanisms of [[Damin]].  

One modification is the use of subscript parentheses around the [[phonation]] diacritics to indicate partial phonation; a single parenthesis at the left or right of the voicing indicates that it is partially phonated at the beginning or end of the segment. For example, {{IPA|₍s̬₎}} is a partially voiced [s], {{IPA|₍s̬}} shows partial initial voicing, and {{IPA|s̬₎}} partial final voicing; also {{IPA|₍z̥₎}} is a partially devoiced [z], {{IPA|₍z̥}} shows partial initial devoicing, and {{IPA|z̥₎}}
partial final devoicing. These conventions may be convenient for representing various [[voice onset time]]s.

Phonation diacritics may also be prefixed or suffixed rather than placed directly under the segment to represent relative timing. For instance, {{IPA|&amp;nbsp;̬z}} is a [[Pre-voicing (phonetics)|pre-voiced]] [z], {{IPA|z&amp;nbsp;̬}}
a post-voiced [z], and {{IPA|a&amp;nbsp;̰}} is an [a] with a [[creaky voice|creaky]] offglide.  

Other ExtIPA diacritics are,

In addition to these symbols, a subscript &lt; or &gt; indicates that an articulation is laterally offset to the left or right. 

====Prosodic notation====
The ExtIPA also makes use of Italian musical notation for the [[tempo]] and [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] of connected speech. These are subscripted on the insides of a {brace} notation that indicates that they are comments on the [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]. 

Pauses are indicated with periods or numbers inside parentheses.

==Obsolete symbols, nonstandard symbols, and capital variants==
The IPA inherited alternate symbols from various traditions, but eventually settled on one for each sound. The other symbols are now considered obsolete. An example is {{IPA|ɷ}} for standard {{IPA|ʊ}}. Several symbols indicating secondary articulation have been dropped altogether, with the idea that such things should be indicated with diacritics: {{IPA|ƍ}} for {{IPA|zʷ}} is one. In addition, the rare voiceless implosive series {{IPA|ƥ ƭ ƈ ƙ ʠ}} has been dropped. 

There are also unsupported symbols from local traditions that find their way into publications that otherwise use the standard IPA. This is especially common with affricates such as {{IPA|ƛ}}. 

While the IPA does not itself have a set of capital letters (the ones that look like capitals are actually small capitals), many languages have adopted symbols from the IPA as part of their orthographies, and in such cases they have invented capital variants of these. This is especially common in Africa. An example is [[Kabye language|Kabye]] of northern [[Togo]], which has {{unicode|Ɔ Ɛ Ŋ Ɣ Ʃ}} (capital {{IPA|ʃ}}). Other pseudo-IPA capitals supported by unicode are {{unicode|Ɓ/Ƃ Ƈ Ɗ/Ƌ Ə/Ǝ Ɠ Ħ Ɯ Ɲ Ɵ Ʈ Ʊ Ʋ Ʒ}}.

===How to transcribe sounds that don't have symbols in the IPA charts===
The remaining blank cells on the IPA chart can be filled without too much difficulty if the need arises. Some ''ad hoc'' symbols have appeared in the literature, for example for the lateral flaps and voiceless lateral fricatives, the epiglottal trill, and the labiodental plosives. Diacritics can supply much of the remainder, which would indeed be appropriate if the sounds were allophones. For example, the Spanish bilabial approximant is commonly written as a lowered fricative, {{IPA|[β̞]}}. Similarly, voiced lateral fricatives would be written as raised lateral approximants, {{IPA|[ɭ˔ ʎ̝ ʟ̝]}}. A few languages such as [[Banda language|Banda]] have a bilabial flap as the preferred allophone of what is elsewhere a labiodental flap. It has been suggested that this be written with the labiodental flap symbol and the advanced diacritic, {{IPA|[v̛̟]}}. Similarly, a labiodental trill would be written {{IPA|[ʙ̪]}} (bilabial trill and the dental sign). Palatal and uvular taps, if they exist, and the epiglottal tap could be written as extra-short plosives, {{IPA|[ɟ˘ ɢ˘ ʡ˘]}}. A retroflex trill can be written as a retracted {{IPA|[r̠]}}, just as retroflex fricatives sometimes are. The remaining consonants, the uvular laterals and the palatal trill, while not strictly impossible, are very difficult to pronounce and are unlikely to occur even as allophones in the world's languages.

The vowels are similarly manageable by using diacritics for raising, lowering, fronting, backing, centering, and mid-centering. For example, the unrounded equivalent of {{IPA|[ʊ]}} can be transcribed as mid-centered {{IPA|[ɯ̽]}}, and the rounded equivalent of [æ] as raised {{IPA|[ɶ̝]}}. True mid vowels are lowered {{IPA|[e̞ ø̞ ɘ̞ ɵ̞ ɤ̞ o̞]}}, while centered {{IPA|[ɪ̈ ʊ̈] and [ä]}} are near-close and open central vowels, respectively. The vowels that aren't representable in this scheme are the [[rounded vowel|compressed]] vowels, which would require a dedicated diacritic.

==Names of the symbols==
It is often desirable to distinguish an IPA symbol from the sound it is intended to represent, since there is not a one-to-one correspondance between symbol and sound in broad transcription. The symbol's names and phonetic descriptions are described in the ''Handbook of the International Phonetic Association''. The symbols also have nonce names in the [[Unicode]] standard. In some cases, the Unicode names and the IPA names do not agree. For example, IPA calls {{IPA|ɛ}} &quot;epsilon&quot;, but Unicode calls it &quot;small letter open E&quot;.

===The letters===
The traditional names of the Latin and Greek letters are used for unmodified symbols. In Unicode, some of the symbols of Greek origin have Latin forms for use in IPA; the others use the symbols from the Greek section. 

Examples:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! style=&quot;width:2em;&quot; | !! IPA symbol name !! phonetic description !! Unicode name
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | p || (lower-case) P || [[voiceless bilabial plosive]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER P
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | x || (lower-case) X || [[voiceless velar fricative]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER X
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | r || (lower-case) R || [[alveolar trill|coronal trill]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER R
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | {{IPA|β}} || [[beta]] || [[voiced bilabial fricative]] || GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | {{IPA|ɛ}} || [[epsilon]] || [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN E
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | {{IPA|ɣ}} || [[gamma]] || [[voiced velar fricative]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER GAMMA
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | {{IPA|θ}} || [[theta]] || [[voiceless dental fricative]] || GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | {{IPA|χ}} || [[Chi (letter)|chi]] || [[voiceless uvular fricative]] || GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | {{IPA|ɸ}} || [[phi]] || [[voiceless bilabial fricative]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER PHI
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | {{IPA|ʊ}} || upsilon {{footnote|1}} || [[near-close near-back rounded vowel]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER UPSILON
|-
|}

'''Note'''
#The Latin &quot;[[upsilon]]&quot; is frequently called &quot;[[horseshoe|horseshoe u]]&quot; in order to distinguish it from the Greek upsilon. Historically, it derives from a Latin small capital &lt;tt&gt;U&lt;/tt&gt;.

The IPA standard includes some small capital letters, such as {{IPA|ʀ}}, although it is common to refer to these symbols as simply &quot;capital&quot; or &quot;cap&quot; letters, because the IPA standard does not include any full-size capital letters.

A few letters have the forms of cursive or script letters. Examples:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! style=&quot;width:2em;&quot; | !! IPA symbol name !! phonetic description !! Unicode name
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | {{IPA|ɑ}} || script A || [[open back unrounded vowel]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER ALPHA
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | {{IPA|ɡ}} || opentail G {{footnote|1}} || [[voiced velar plosive]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER SCRIPT G
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | {{IPA|ʋ}} || cursive V {{footnote|2}} || [[labiodental approximant]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER V WITH HOOK
|}
'''Note'''
#The &quot;looptail G&quot; [[Image:Looptail g.PNG|10 px]] is not strictly an IPA character, but is an acceptable alternative.
#In form and origin, but not in name, this is the Greek upsilon.

Ligatures are called precisely that, although some have alternate names. Examples:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! style=&quot;width:2em;&quot; | !! IPA symbol name !! phonetic description !! Unicode name
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | {{IPA|œ}} || (lower-case) o-e ligature || [[open-mid front rounded vowel]] || LATIN SMALL LIGATURE OE
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | {{IPA|ɮ}} || L-Ezh ligature || [[voiced alveolar lateral fricative|voiced coronal lateral fricative]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER LEZH
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | {{IPA|æ}} || [[Ash (letter)|ash]]; (lower-case) a-e ligature || [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER AE
|}

Many letters are ''turned'', or rotated 180 degrees. Examples:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! style=&quot;width:2em;&quot; | !! IPA symbol name !! phonetic description !! Unicode name
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | {{IPA|ʎ}} || turned Y || [[palatal lateral approximant]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED Y
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | {{IPA|ɥ}} || turned H || [[labial-palatal approximant]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED H
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | {{IPA|ɒ}} || turned script A || [[open back rounded vowel]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED ALPHA
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | {{IPA|ʌ}} || turned V || [[open-mid back unrounded vowel]] || LATIN SMALL TURNED V
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | {{IPA|ɔ}} || open O || [[open-mid back rounded vowel]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O
|}

The symbol {{IPA|ɔ}} can be described as a ''turned cee'', but it is almost always referred to as ''open o'', which described both its articulation and its shape. The symbol {{IPA|ʌ}} is often also called &quot;[[caret]]&quot; or &quot;wedge&quot; for it similarity to that diacritic.

A few letters are ''reversed'' (flipped on a vertical axis): '''{{IPA|ɘ}}''' ''reversed E'', '''{{IPA|ɜ}}''' ''reversed epsilon'', '''{{IPA|ʕ}}''' ''reversed glottal stop'' [often called by its Arabic name, ''[[ayin]]'']. 

One letter is ''inverted'' (flipped on a horizontal axis): '''{{IPA|ʁ}}''' ''inverted R''. ('''{{IPA|ʍ}}''' could also be called an ''inverted double-u'', but ''turned double-u'' is more common.)

When a horizontal stroke is added, it is called a ''bar'': '''{{IPA|ħ}}''' ''barred H'', '''{{IPA|ɵ}}''' ''barred o'', '''{{IPA|ʢ}}''' ''reversed barred glottal stop'' or ''barred ayin'', '''{{IPA|ɟ}}''' ''barred dotless J'' or ''barred gelded J'' [apparently never 'turned F'], '''{{IPA|ǂ}}''' ''double-barred pipe'', etc.

One letter instead has a ''slash'' through it: '''{{IPA|ø}}''' ''slashed O''.

The implosives have ''hook'' tops: '''{{IPA|ɓ}}''' ''hook-top B'', as does '''{{IPA|ɦ}}''' ''hook-top H''.

Such an extension at the bottom of a letter is called a ''tail''. It may be specified as ''left'' or ''right'' depending on which direction it turns: '''{{IPA|ɳ}}''' ''right-tail N'', '''{{IPA|ɻ}}''' ''right-tail turned R'', '''{{IPA|ɲ}}''' ''left-tail N'' [note that '''{{IPA|ŋ}}''' has its own traditional name, ''[[engma]]''], '''{{IPA|ɱ}}''' ''left-tail em'', '''{{IPA|ʐ}}''' ''tail Z'' [or just ''retroflex Z''], etc.

When the tail loops over itself, it's called ''curly'': '''{{IPA|ʝ}}''' ''curly-tail jay'', '''{{IPA|ɕ}}''' ''curly-tail C''. 

There are also a few unique modifications: '''{{IPA|ɬ}}''' ''belted L'', '''{{IPA|ɞ}}''' ''closed reversed epsilon'' [there was once also a '''{{IPA|ɷ}}''' ''closed omega''], '''{{IPA|ɰ}}''' ''right-leg turned M'', '''{{IPA|ɺ}}''' ''turned long-leg R'' [there was once also a ''long-leg R''], '''{{IPA|ǁ}}''' ''double pipe'', and the obsolete '''{{IPA|ʗ}}''' ''stretched C''.

Several non-English letters have traditional names: '''{{IPA|ç}}''' ''C [[cedilla]]'', '''{{IPA|ð}}''' ''[[Eth (letter)|eth]]'' (also spelled ''edh''), '''{{IPA|ŋ}}''' ''[[engma]]'', '''{{IPA|ə}}''' ''[[schwa]]'', '''{{IPA|ǃ}}''' ''exclamation mark'', '''{{IPA|&lt;nowiki&gt;ǀ&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}''' ''pipe''.

Other symbols are unique to the IPA, and have developed their own quirky names: '''{{IPA|ɾ}}''' ''fish-hook R'', '''{{IPA|ɤ}}''' ''[[ram's horns]]'', '''{{IPA|ʘ}}''' ''[[bull's eye]]'', '''{{IPA|ʃ}}''' ''[[esh (letter)|esh]]'' [apparently never 'stretched ess'], '''{{IPA|ʒ}}''' ''[[ezh]]'' [sometimes also ''[[yogh]]''], '''{{IPA|ɧ}}''' ''hook-top heng''. 

The '''{{IPA|ʔ}}''' is usually called by the sound it represents, ''glottal stop''. This is not normally a problem, because this symbol is seldom used to represent anything else. However, to specify the symbol itself, it is sometimes called a ''gelded question mark''.

===The diacritic marks===
Diacritics with traditional names: 

:'''{{IPA|é}}''' ''[[Acute accent|acute]]'', '''{{IPA|ē}}''' ''[[macron]]'', '''{{IPA|è}}''' ''[[Grave accent|grave]]'', '''{{IPA|ê}}''' ''[[circumflex]]'', '''{{IPA|ě}}''' ''[[caron]], [[wedge]],'' or ''[[háček]]'', '''{{IPA|ë}}''' ''[[diaeresis]]'' or ''[[umlaut]]'', '''{{IPA|ĕ}}''' ''[[breve]]'', '''{{IPA|ẽ}}''' ''(superscript) [[tilde]]'', plus variants such as '''{{IPA|ḛ}}''' ''subscript tilde'', '''{{IPA|ɫ}}''' ''superimposed tilde'', etc. 

Non-traditional diacritics: 

:'''{{IPA|d̼}}''' ''seagull'', '''{{IPA|e˞}}''' ''hook'', '''{{IPA|e̽}}''' ''over-cross'', '''{{IPA|d ̚}}''' ''corner'', '''{{IPA|d̪}}''' ''bridge'', '''{{IPA|d̺}}''' ''inverted bridge'', '''{{IPA|d̻}}''' ''square'', '''{{IPA|e̥}}''' ''under-ring'', '''{{IPA|e̊}}''' ''over-ring'', '''{{IPA|e̜}}''' ''left half-ring'', '''{{IPA|e̹}}''' ''right half-ring'', '''{{IPA|e̟}}''' ''plus'', '''{{IPA|e̠}}''' ''under-bar'', '''{{IPA|e̯}}''' ''arch'', '''{{IPA|d̬}}''' ''subscript wedge'', '''{{IPA|e̝}}''' ''up tack'', '''{{IPA|e̞}}''' ''down tack'', '''{{IPA|e̘}}''' ''left tack'', '''{{IPA|e̙}}''' ''right tack'', '''{{IPA|d͡z}}''' ''tie bar'', '''{{IPA|ẹ}}''' ''under-dot'', '''{{IPA|n̩}}''' ''under-stroke''.

Diacritics are alternately named after their function: The bridge is also called the ''dental sign,'' the under-stroke the ''syllabicity sign,'' etc.

==Comparison to other phonetic notation==
The IPA is not the only phonetic transcription system in use. The other common Latin-based system is the [[Americanist phonetic notation]], devised for representing American languages, but used by some US linguists as an alternate to the IPA. There are also sets of symbols specific to [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Indic languages|Indic]], [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]], and [[Caucasian languages|Caucasian]] linguistics, as well as other regional specialies. The differences between these alphabets and IPA are relatively small, although often the special characters of the IPA are abandoned in favour of diacritics or digraphs. 

Other alphabets, such as [[Hangul]], may have their own phonetic extensions. There also exist featural phonetic transcription systems, such as [[Alexander Bell]]'s [[Visible Speech]] and its derivatives. 

There is an extended version of the IPA for [[Speech disorder|disordered speech]] (extIPA), which has been included in this article, and another set of symbols used for voice quality (VoQS). There are also many personal or idiosyncratic extensions, such as [[#External links|Luciano Canepari's ''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;can&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;IPA'']].

Since the IPA uses symbols that are outside the [[ASCII]] character set, several systems have been developed that map the IPA symbols to ASCII characters. Two notable systems are [[Kirshenbaum]] and [[SAMPA]] (or [[X-SAMPA]]). These systems are often used in electronic media, although their usage has been declining with the development of computer technology, specifically because of spreading support for [[Unicode]].

==Technical note==
Most IPA symbols are not included in [[Times New Roman]], the default font for Latin scripts in [[Internet Explorer]] for Windows. To properly view IPA symbols in Internet Explorer for Windows, you must set your browser font to a typeface that includes the IPA extensions, such as [[Lucida Sans Unicode]], which comes with [[Windows XP]]; [[Gentium]], [[Charis (SIL)]], and [[Doulos (SIL)]], which are freely available (see links above); or [[Arial Unicode MS]], which comes with [[Microsoft Office]]. Alternatively, the style sheet could try using unicode-range specifications to note the gaps where Times does not have glyphs for IPA, Hawaiian [[Okina|‘okina]] (glottal stop), etc. and thus hopefully force the browser to check further down the list of fonts.

On this page, we have fort languages known in his time, [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Sanskrit]], and [[Persian language|Persian]]. Systematic comparison of these and other old languages conducted by [[Franz Bopp]] supported this theory, and Bopp's ''Comparative Grammar'', appearing between [[1833]] and [[1852]] is considered the starting point of [[Indo-European studies]] as an academic discipline. 

The common ancestral (reconstructed) language is called  [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE). There is disagreement as to the original [[geography|geographic]] location (the so-called &quot;[[Urheimat]]&quot; or &quot;original homeland&quot;) from where it originated. There are two main candidates today: 
# the steppes north of the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] (see [[Kurgan]]) 
# [[Anatolia]] (see [[Colin Renfrew]]).
Proponents of the Kurgan hypothesis tend to date the proto-language to ca. [[4000 BC]], while proponents of Anatolian origin usually date it several millennia earlier, associating the spread of Indo-European languages with the Neolithic spread of farming (see [[Indo-Hittite]]).

===Kurgan hypothesis===
{{main|Kurgan hypothesis}}
The Kurgan hypothesis was originally suggested by [[Marija Gimbutas]] in the [[1950s]]. According to the Kurgan hypothesis, early PIE was spoken in the [[chalcolithic]] steppe cultures of the [[5th millennium BC]] between the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Volga]].  

Currently, her theories do not hold credence with most reputable scholars. Ms. Gimbutas's so-called Kurgan peoples theory relies heavily on Kurgan burial mounds. Unfortunately, it is unproven that these so-called Kurgan peoples were ever members of the Indo-European culture-linguistic group. Precisely because '''known''' ancient Indo-European cultures, (i.e. the Indo-Aryans [people of India], the Greeks, Estruscan/Romans, and the ancient norse peoples), universally practiced '''cremation''' and '''not''' burial. This contradiction with known and recorded cultural practices of [[cremation]] amongst proven ancient, yet geographically diverse Indo-Europeans groups, casts doubt on the probability that the so-called Kurgan culture were Indo-European. With these caveats in mind, below is outlined Gimbutas' Kurgan hypothesis.

Timeline
*[[4500 BC|4500]]&amp;ndash;4000: '''Early PIE'''. [[Sredny Stog culture|Sredny Stog]], [[Dnieper-Donets culture|Dnieper-Donets]] and [[Samara culture|Sarama]] cultures, [[domestication of the horse]].
*[[4000 BC|4000]]&amp;ndash;3500: The [[Yamna culture]], the prototypical [[kurgan]] builders, emerges in the steppe, and the [[Maykop culture]] in the northern [[Caucasus (geographic region)|Caucasus]]. [[Indo-Hittite]] models postulate the separation of [[Anatolian languages|Proto-Anatolian]] before this time.
*[[3500 BC|3500]]&amp;ndash;3000: '''Middle PIE'''. The Yamna culture is at its peak, representing the classical reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European society]], with [[Ukrainian stone stela|stone idols]], early two-wheeled proto-chariots, predominantly practicing [[animal husbandry]], but also with permanent settlements and [[hillfort]]s, subsisting on agriculture and fishing, along rivers. Contact of the Yamna culture with late [[Neolithic Europe]] cultures results in the &quot;kurganized&quot; [[Globular Amphora culture|Globular Amphora]] and [[Baden culture|Baden]] cultures. The [[Maykop culture]] shows the earliest evidence of the beginning [[Bronze Age]], and bronze weapons and artefacts are introduced to Yamna territory. Probable early [[Satemization]].
*[[3000 BC|3000]]&amp;ndash;2500: '''Late PIE'''. The Yamna culture extends over the entire Pontic steppe. The [[Corded Ware culture]] extends from the [[Rhine]] to the [[Volga]], corresponding to the latest phase of Indo-European unity, the vast &quot;kurganized&quot; area disintegrating into various independent languages and cultures, still in loose contact enabling the spread of technology and early loans between the groups, except for the Anatolian and Tocharian branches, which are already isolated from these processes. The Centum-Satem break is probably complete, but the phonetic trends of Satemization remain active.
*[[2500 BC|2500]]&amp;ndash;2000: The breakup into the proto-languages of the attested dialects is complete. [[Proto-Greek]] is spoken in the [[Balkans]], [[Indo-Iranian languages|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] north of the Caspian in the [[Sintashta-Petrovka]] culture. The Bronze Age reaches [[Central Europe]] with the [[Beaker culture]], likely composed of various Centum dialects. [[Proto-Balto-Slavic]] (or alternatively, [[Proto-Slavic]] and [[Proto-Baltic]] communities in close contact) develops in north-eastern Europe. The [[Tarim mummies]] possibly correspond to proto-[[Tocharians]].
*[[2000 BC|2000]]&amp;ndash;1500: The [[chariot]] is invented, leading to the split and rapid spread of [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] and [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] from the [[Andronovo culture]] and the [[Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex]] over much of [[Central Asia]], Northern [[India]], [[Iran]] and Eastern [[Anatolia]]. Proto-Anatolian is split into [[Hittite language|Hittite]] and [[Luwian]]. The pre-Proto-Celtic [[Unetice culture]] has an active metal industry ([[Nebra skydisk]]). 
*[[1500 BC|1500]]&amp;ndash;1000: The [[Nordic Bronze Age]] develops (pre-)[[Proto-Germanic]], and the (pre-)[[Proto-Celtic]] [[Urnfield]] and [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] cultures emerge in Central Europe, introducing the [[Iron Age]].  [[Proto-Italic]] migration into the [[Italian peninsula]]. Redaction of the [[Rigveda]] and rise of the [[Vedic civilization]] in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. Flourishing and decline of the [[Hittite Empire]]. The [[Mycenaean civilization]] gives way to the [[Greek Dark Ages]]. 
*[[1000 BC]]&amp;ndash;[[500 BC]]: The [[Celtic languages]] spread over Central and Western Europe. Northern Europe enters the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]], the formative phase of [[Proto Germanic]]. [[Homer]] initiates Greek literature and early [[Classical Antiquity]]. The Vedic Civilization  gives way to the [[Mahajanapadas]]. [[Zoroaster]] composes the [[Gatha]]s, rise of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], replacing the [[Elamites]] and [[Babylonia]]. The [[Cimmerians]] ([[Srubna culture]]) are replaced by [[Scythians]] in the Pontic steppe. [[Armenians]] succeed the [[Urartu]] culture. Separation of Proto-Italic into [[Osco-Umbrian languages|Osco-Umbrian]] and [[Latin-Faliscan languages|Latin-Faliscan]], and foundation of [[Rome]]. Genesis of the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Old Italic alphabet|Old Italic]]  alphabets. A variety of [[Paleo-Balkan languages]] are spoken  in Southern Europe. The Anatolian languages are [[language death|extinct]].

===Competing hypotheses===
[[Colin Renfrew]] in [[1987]] suggested that the spread of Indo-European was associated with the [[Neolithic revolution]], spreading peacefully into Europe from [[Asia Minor]] from around [[7000 BC]] with the advance of farming (''wave of advance''). Accordingly, all of [[Neolithic Europe]] would have been Indo-European speaking, and the Kurgan migrations would at best have replaced Indo-European dialects with other Indo-European dialects.

[[Thomas Gamkrelidze]] and [[Vyacheslav V. Ivanov]] in [[1984]] placed the Indo-European homeland on [[Lake Urmia]]. They suggested that [[Armenian language|Armenian]] was the language which stayed in the Indo-European cradle while other Indo-European languages left the homeland. They are also the originators of the [[Glottalic theory]].

Some people have pointed to the [[Black Sea deluge theory]], dating the genesis of the [[Sea of Azov]] to ca. [[5600 BC]], as a direct cause of the Indo-European expansion. This event occurred in still clearly Neolithic times and is rather too early to fit with Kurgan archaeology. It may still be imagined as an event in the remote past of the [[Sredny Stog culture]], and the people living on the land now beneath the Sea of Azov as possible  pre-Proto-Indo-Europeans.

Other theories exist, often with a [[nationalism|nationalistic]] flavour, sometimes bordering on [[national mysticism]], typically positing the development ''in situ'' of the proponents' respective homes. One prominent example of such are the Indian theories that derive [[Vedic Sanskrit]] from the [[Indus valley civilization]], postulating that Vedic Sanskrit is essentially identical to Proto-Indo-European, and that all other dialects must ultimately trace back to the early Indus valley civilization of ca. 3000 BC. This theory is not widely accepted by scholars. See [[Indo-Aryan migration]] for a discussion. Another example may be the [[Paleolithic Continuity Theory]] proposed by Italian theorists that derives Indo-European from the European [[Paleolithic]] cultures.

==Sound changes==
{{main|Indo-European sound laws}}
As the  Proto-Indo-European language broke up, its sound system diverged as well, according to various [[sound law]]s in the daughter languages. Notable among these are [[Grimm's law]] in [[Proto-Germanic]], loss of prevocalic ''*p-'' in [[Proto-Celtic]], loss of prevocalic ''*s-'' in [[Proto-Greek]], [[Brugmann's law]] in [[Proto-Indo-Iranian]], as well as [[Satemization]] treated above.  [[Grassmann's law]] and [[Bartholomae's law]] may or may not have been still common Indo-European.

'''Illinois''' ([[IPA chart for English|pronounced]] {{IPA|[ˌɪ.lɨˈnɔɪ̯]}} or &quot;ill-i-NOY&quot;) was the [[U.S. state|21st state]] to join the [[United States]], located in the former [[Northwest Territory]].  Its name was given by the state's [[France|French explorers]] after the indigenous [[Illiniwek]] people, a [[consortium]] of [[Algonquian]] tribes that thrived in the area. The word ''Illiniwek'' means simply the &quot;men,&quot; i.e. &quot;people.&quot;

The [[capital]] of Illinois is [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], while its largest city is [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]. The U.S. postal abbreviation for the state is '''IL'''.

The [[USS Illinois|USS ''Illinois'']] was named in honor of this state.

== History ==
{{main|History of Illinois}}

===Pre-[[Christopher Colombus|Columbian]]===
[[Cahokia]], the urban center of the pre-Columbian [[Mississippian culture]], was located near present-day [[Collinsville, Illinois]].  That civilization vanished circa 1400&amp;ndash;1500 for unknown reasons.  The next major power in the region was the [[Illiniwek]] Confederation or Illini, a political alliance among several tribes.  The Illiniwek gave Illinois its name.  The Illini suffered in the seventeenth century as [[Iroquois]] expansion forced them to compete with several tribes for land.  The Illini were replaced in Illinois by the [[Potawatomi]], [[Miami_tribe|Miami]], [[Sauk]], and other tribes.

===European exploration===
[[France|French]] explorers [[Jacques Marquette]], [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]], and [[Louis Joliet]] explored the [[Illinois River]] in 1673.  As a result of their exploration, Illinois was part of the French empire until 1763, when it passed to the [[United Kingdom|British]] as a result of the [[French and Indian War]].  [[George Rogers Clark]] claimed the [[Illinois Country]] for the [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]] during his military campaigns there in 1778.  The area was ceded to the new United States in 1783 and became part of the [[Northwest Territory]].

===The 1800s===
The [[Illinois-Wabash Company]] was an early claimant to much of Illinois.  The [[Illinois Territory]] was created on [[February 3]], [[1809]]. In 1818, Illinois became the 21st U.S. state.  Early U.S. settlement began in the south part of the state and quickly spread northward, driving out the native residents.  With the 1832 [[Black Hawk War]], the last native tribes were driven out of northern Illinois.

The winter of 1830-1831 is called the &quot;[[Winter of the Deep Snow]]&quot;. A sudden, deep snowfall blanketed the state, making travel impossible for the rest of the winter. Travelers lucky enough to find shelter had to stay where they were. Many others perished. Several severe winters followed, including the &quot;[[Winter of the Sudden Freeze]]&quot;. On [[December 20]], [[1836]], a fast-moving cold front passed through, freezing puddles in minutes, killing many travelers who could not reach shelter. The adverse weather resulted in crop failures in the northern part of the state. The southern part of the state shipped food north and this may have contributed to its name: &quot;[[Little Egypt|Egypt]]&quot;, after the [[Biblical]] story of Joseph in Egypt supplying grain to his brothers.

As early as [[1840]], Illinois was called the &quot;[[Sucker State]]&quot;. 

Illinois is known as the &quot;Land of [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]&quot; because it is here that the 16th [[President of the United States|President]] spent most of his life, practicing law and living in [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]]. 

Even so, Illinois was not a strong anti-slavery state.  In 1853 Illinois passed a Black Code which, among other things required any black entering the state and staying more than ten days to pay a fine of $50. If he could not pay, the black could be sold into slavery for a period commensurate with the fine. {{further|[[Black Codes in Northern USA]]}}

[[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] gained prominence as a [[Great Lakes]] port and then as a [[canal]] port after 1848, and as a rail hub soon afterward. By 1857, Chicago was Illinois' largest city. {{further|[[History of Chicago]]}}

===The Civil War===
{{main|Illinois in the Civil War}}

During the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]], over 250,000 Illinois men served in the [[Union Army]], more than any other northern state except [[New York]], [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Ohio]]. Beginning with President Lincoln's first call for troops and continuing throughout the war, Illinois mustered 150 infantry regiments, which were numbered from the 7th IL to the 156th IL. Seventeen cavalry regiments were also gathered, as well as two light artillery regiments.

==Government==
[[Image:Ilolluds.jpg|thumb|right|The sample version of the current [[Illinois]] [[license plate]] introduced in 2001.]]
{{main|Government of Illinois}}

The state government of Illinois is modeled after the federal government with adaptations originating from traditions cultivated during the state's frontier era.  As codified in the state constitution, there are three branches of government: executive, legislative and judicial.  The executive branch is led by the [[Governor of Illinois]].  Legislative functions are given to the [[Illinois General Assembly]], composed of the 118-member [[Illinois State House of Representatives]] and the 59-member [[Illinois State Senate]].  The judiciary is comprised of the [[state supreme court]], which oversees the lower [[court of appeals|appellate court]]s and [[circuit court]]s.

*The '''[[Governor of Illinois]]''' is [[Rod Blagojevich]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]])
*The '''[[Lieutenant Governor of Illinois]]''' is [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Pat Quinn]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]])
*The '''[[Illinois Attorney General|Attorney General of Illinois]]''' is [[Lisa Madigan]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]])

*The '''Junior [[United States Senate|United States Senator]]''' is [[Barack Obama]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]])

Illinois was always a major battleground between the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party ]]. Since 1992 it has moved steadily more Democratic at the national and state level. Illinois voted for Democratic presidential candidates in the last four elections. John Kerry easily won the state's 21 electoral votes in 2004 by a margin of 11 percentage points with 54.8% of the vote.  Traditionally the central cities were Democratic, especially [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] and [[East Saint Louis, Illinois|East Saint Louis]]. The suburbs of Chicago were historically Republican, but GOP margins have been plunging there, causing the overall shift to the Democrats. Small cities and towns are Republican strongholds (except for the old coal mining towns). Rural districts in the northern third of the state have historically been Republican; those in the middle third mixed, and those in [[Little Egypt (region)|Little Egypt]] (the southern third of the state), Democratic.

== Geography ==
[[Image:National-atlas-illinois.png|thumb|300px|right|Illinois, showing major cities and roads]]
{{main|Geography of Illinois}}

Illinois is in the north-central U.S. and borders on [[Lake Michigan]].  Surrounding states are [[Wisconsin]] to the north, [[Iowa]] and [[Missouri]] to the west, [[Kentucky]] to the south, and [[Indiana]] to the east. Illinois also borders Michigan, but only via a water boundary in Lake Michigan.

Illinois has three major geographical divisions. The first is [[Chicagoland]], including the city of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], its suburbs, and the adjoining exurban area into which the metropolis is expanding. This region includes a few counties in Indiana and Wisconsin and stretches across much of northern Illinois toward the Iowa border, generally along Interstates [[Interstate 80|80]] and [[Interstate 90|90]]. This region is cosmopolitan, densely populated, industrialized, and settled by a variety of ethnic groups.  

Southward and westward, the second major division is central Illinois, an area of mostly flat [[prairie]].  Known as the Land of [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] or the Heart of Illinois, it is characterized by small towns and mid-sized cities.  Agriculture, particularly [[maize|corn]] and [[soybeans]], figures prominently.  Major cities include famously average [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]], [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] (the state capital), [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]], [[Bloomington-Normal]] and [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]]-[[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]] (home of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]]).  

The third division is southern Illinois, comprising the area south of [[U.S. Route 50]], and including [[Little Egypt (region)|Little Egypt]]), near the juncture of the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Ohio River]].  This region can ntext</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{English dialects}}
'''International English''' is the concept of the [[English language]] as a global means of communication in numerous dialects, and the movement towards an international standard for the language. It is sometimes referred to as ''Global English'', ''World English'' or ''[[Standard English]]''. Sometimes these terms refer simply to the array of varieties of English spoken throughout the world; sometimes they refer to a desired standardisation. However, consensus on the terminology and path to standardisation has not been reached.

== Historical context ==
The modern concept of International English does not exist in isolation, but is the product of centuries of development of the English language.

The language of [[England]] came to dominance throughout the island of [[Great Britain]] during the Middle Ages and in [[Ireland]] during the 18th century and, especially, the 19th century. In the modern era, printing led to the gradual standardisation of English, and particularly the use of the [[prestige dialect]] of the English ruling classes.

The establishment of the first permanent English-speaking colony in [[North America]] in [[1607]] was a major step towards the globalisation of the language. [[British English]] was only partially standardised when the American colonies were established. Isolated from Britain by the Atlantic Ocean, the settlements evolved a distinct standard form of [[American English]]. In particular, [[Noah Webster]]'s reform of American-English spelling in the early [[19th century]] gave rise to the main division in English spelling that exists today.

In the [[18th century]], British colonialism focused on the [[southern hemisphere]]. The standardisation of [[British English]] was more settled than it had been in the previous century, and this confident English was brought to [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Oceania]]. It developed both as the language of English-speaking settlers from Britain and Ireland, and as the administrative language imposed on speakers of other languages in the various parts of the [[British Empire]]. The first form can be seen in [[New Zealand English]], and the latter in [[Indian English]]. The term [[Commonwealth English]] refers to these groups of English dialects.

The English-speaking nations of [[Canada]] and the [[Caribbean]] are caught between historical connections with British and Commonwealth English, and geographical connections with U.S. English. In some things, and more formally, they tend to follow British standards, in others they follow the U.S. standard.

More recently, American English has become predominant as the preferred version of English in many countries that previously either had no preferred form, or preferred some variant of British English. Since World War II, for example, the governments of China (though not Hong Kong) and Japan have generally used American English, though in the case of China, the puncuation is a mixture of both American and British.

The ebb and flow between the standardisation of the language and its diversification have been ever present throughout its history. The flagship of the former is intelligibility and practicality, while the latter has cultural autonomy and flexibility.

== Modern global language ==
There is a distinction between English as spoken as a [[native language]] around the world (in the [[USA]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and so forth) and as a non-native language spoken as a regional or global [[lingua franca]].

A second distinction is made between those countries where non-native English has official or historical importance (''special significance'', for example, in [[Pakistan]] and [[Uganda]]), and those where it does not (for example, in [[Japan]] and [[Peru]]).

In the terminology of [[Language education|English language teaching]] (ELT), we have:
* English as a native language (ENL), also called ''first language'' (L1).
* [[English as an additional language]] (EAL) or English for speakers of other languages (ESOL):
** English as a second language ([[TESL|ESL]]) in an environment where English has a ''special significance'', also called ''second language'' (L2).
** English as a foreign language (EFL) in places where it has no ''special significance'', also called ''third language'' (L3).

English as a second language might refer either to acquisition of the language in southern India, where it is a prominent, regional lingua franca, or the acquisition of the language by a speaker of another language in a predominantly English-speaking country (a Brazilian living in Barbados, for instance). It may not be an individual's actual second language, but perhaps third or fourth.

In the context of language teaching, English as an additional language (EAL) usually is based on the standards of either British/Commonwealth English or American English. English as an international language (EIL) is EAL with emphasis on learning different major dialect forms; in particular, it aims to equip students with the linguistic tools to communicate internationally.

The term ''International English'' is used in the ''International English Language Testing System'' ([[IELTS]]), an English-language definition and evaluation system owned, developed and delivered through the partnership of the [[British Council]], [[IDP Education Australia]]: IELTS Australia and the [[University of Cambridge]] ESOL Examinations. Though concentrating on a kind of English understood almost everywhere, the basic standard is taken to be [[Commonwealth English]].

== Varying concepts ==

=== Universality and flexibility ===
 
International English sometimes refers to English as it is actually being used and developed in the world; as a language owned not just by native speakers, but by all those who come to use it.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Basically, it covers the English language at large, often (but not always or necessarily) implicitly seen as standard. It is certainly also commonly used in connection with the acquisition, use, and study of English as the world's lingua franca ('TEIL: Teaching English as an International Language'), and especially when the language is considered as a whole in contrast with ''American English'', ''British English'', ''South African English'', and the like. &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;McArthur (2002, p.&amp;nbsp;444&amp;ndash;45)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It especially means English words and phrases generally understood throughout the English-speaking world as opposed to localisms. The importance of non-native English language skills can be recognised behind the long-standing joke that the international language of science and technology is broken English.

=== Neutrality ===

International English reaches towards cultural neutrality. This has a practical use:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;What could be better than a type of English that saves you from having to re-edit publications for individual regional markets! Teachers and learners of English as a second language also find it an attractive idea&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; both often concerned that their English should be neutral, without British or American or Canadian or Australian colouring. Any regional variety of English has a set of political, social and cultural connotations attached to it, even the so-called 'standard' forms.&quot; &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;Peters (2004, ''International English'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to this viewpoint, International English is a concept of English that minimises the aspects defined by either the colonial [[imperialism]] of Victorian Britain or the [[cultural imperialism]] of the 20th century United States. While British [[colonialism]] laid the foundation for English over much of the world, International English is a product of an emerging world culture, very much attributable to the influence of the United States as well, but conceptually based on a far greater degree of cross-talk and linguistic transculturation, which tends to mitigate both U.S. influence and British colonial influence.

The development of International English often centres around academic and scientific communities, where formal English usage is prevalent, and creative and flowery use of the language is at a minimum. This formal International English allows entry into Western culture as a whole and Western cultural values in general.

=== Opposition ===
The continued growth of the English language itself is seen by many as a kind of [[cultural imperialism]], whether it is English in one form or English in two slightly different forms.

Robert Phillipson argues against the possibility of such neutrality in his ''Linguistic Imperialism'' (1992). Learners who wish to use purportedly correct English are in fact faced with the dual standard of American English and British English, and other less known standard Englishes.

Edward Trimnell, author of ''Why You Need a Foreign Language &amp; How to Learn One'' (2005) argues that the international version of English is only adequate for communicating basic ideas. For complex discussions and business/technical situations, English is not an adequate communication tool for non-native speakers of the language. Trimnell also asserts that native English-speakers have become &quot;dependent on the language skills of others&quot; by placing their faith in international English.

=== Appropriation theory ===
There are also some who reject both linguistic imperialism and Crystal's theory of the neutrality of English. They argue that the phenomenon of the global spread of English is better understood in the framework of [[appropriation]] (e.g. Spichtinger 2000), that is English used for local purposes around the world. Demonstrators in non-English speaking countries often use signs in English to convey their demands to TV-audiences around the globe, for instance. 

In English language teaching Bobda shows how [[Cameroon]] has moved away from a mono-cultural, Anglo-centred way of teaching English and has gradually appropriated teaching material to a Cameroonian context. Non Western-topics treated are, for instance, the rule of Emirs, traditional medicine or polygamy (1997:225). Kramsch and Sullivan (1996) describe how Western methodology and textbooks have been appropriated to suit local [[Vietnamese culture]]. The [[Pakistani]] textbook &quot;Primary Stage English&quot; includes lessons such as &quot;Pakistan My Country&quot;, &quot;Our Flag&quot;, or &quot;Our Great Leader&quot; (Malik 1993: 5,6,7) which might well sound jingoistic to Western ears. Within the native culture, however, establishing a connection between ELT, patriotism and Muslim faith is seen as one of the aims of ELT, as the chairman of the Punjab Textbook Board openly states: &quot;The board...takes care, through these books to inoculate in the students a love of the Islamic values and awareness to guard the ideological frontiers of your [the students] home lands&quot; (Punjab Text Book Board 1997).

=== Many Englishes ===
There are many difficult choices that have to be made if there is to be further standardisation of English in the future. These include the choice over whether to adopt a current standard, or move towards a more neutral, but artificial one. A true International English might supplant both current American and British English as a variety of English for international communication, leaving these as local dialects, or would rise from a merger of General American and standard British English with admixture of other varieties of English and would generally replace all these varieties of English.
&lt;blockquote&gt;We may, in due course, all need to be in control of two standard Englishes&amp;mdash;the one which gives us our national and local identity, and the other which puts us in touch with the rest of the human race. In effect, we may all need to become bilingual in our own language. &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;David Crystal (1988: p.&amp;nbsp;265)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is the situation long faced by many users of English who possess a 'non-standard' dialect of English as their birth tongue but have also learned to write (and perhaps also speak) a more standard dialect. Many academics often publish material in journals requiring different varieties of English and change style and spellings as necessary without great difficulty.

=== Dual standard === 

Two approaches to International English are the individualistic and inclusive approach and the new dialect approach.

The individualistic approach gives control to individual authors to write and spell as they wish (within purported standard conventions) and to accept the validity of differences. The ''Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English'', published in 1999, is a descriptive study of both American and British English in which each chapter follows individual spelling conventions according to the preference of the main editor of that chapter.

The new dialect approach appears in ''The Cambridge Guide to English Usage'' (Peters, 2004) which attempts to avoid any language bias and accordingly uses an idiosyncratic international spelling system of mixed American and British forms (but tending more to American spelling).

== Non-U.S. English ==
Sometimes ''International English'' is used to refer to a general standard that is based on [[Commonwealth English|Commonwealth]] and [[British English]], rather than [[American English|U.S. English]]. Whereas the majority of English native speakers use American English, most nations other than the United States use British/Commonwealth English as a standard, which explains the use of the word &quot;international&quot;. However, U.S. English is having a greater influence in the rapidly expanding area of English as a foreign language, due to the economic and cultural influence of the United States.&lt;br&gt;
The international flavour of British/Commonwealth English is dependent on three factors:

# British and Commonwealth English are standard in far more countries around the world than U.S. English.
# Many academic publications outside the United States use the conventions of the [[Oxford University Press]].
# This standard of English has official status in the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]], and it is used as the basis of English-language testing by the ''International English Language Testing System'' ([[IELTS]]).

''International English'' is also sometimes used in this manner in the computer industry. The [[Linux]] community, and other [[Open Software]] groups use the term [[Commonwealth English]] instead, usually in giving users a choice of spellings or wordings for messages. But the English language choices given are in fact normally only between American English and British English with ''-ise'' spellings, the latter being called ''International English'' or ''Commonwealth English''.

However, [[Microsoft]]'s ''[[Encarta]]'' has different versions for American English, Australian English, British English, and Canadian English which does not exhaust what could be provided.

== International organisations ==

There are ''three major English varieties'' used as standards by international organisations:

=== British English with -ize spellings ===
Spellings: centre, programme, labour, defence, cooperation, organize, recognize, but: analyse
&lt;br&gt;[[IANA]] language tag [[en-GB-oed]], this standard is based on the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]

![[ISO/IEC 8859-13|Part&amp;nbsp;13]]
|''Latin-7'' &lt;br /&gt;''Baltic Rim''
|Added some characters for Baltic languages which were missing from Latin-4 and Latin-6.
|-
![[ISO/IEC 8859-14|Part&amp;nbsp;14]]
|''Latin-8'' &lt;br /&gt;''Celtic''
|Covers Celtic languages such as [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] and the [[Breton language]].
|-
![[ISO/IEC 8859-15|Part&amp;nbsp;15]]
|''Latin-9''
|A revision of 8859-1 that removes some little-used symbols, replacing them with the [[Euro]] symbol ''€'' and the letters ''Š'', ''š'', ''Ž'', ''ž'', ''Œ'', ''œ'', and ''Ÿ'', which completes the coverage of [[French language|French]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]].

![[ISO/IEC 8859-16|Part&amp;nbsp;16]]
|''Latin-10'' &lt;br /&gt;''South-Eastern European''
|Intended for [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], but also Finnish, French, German and [[Irish language|Irish Gaelic]] (new orthography). The focus lies more on letters than symbols. The currency sign is replaced with the [[Euro]] symbol.

{{ref 1}}&amp;mdash;only the [[IJ (letter)|Ĳ/ĳ (letter IJ)]] is missing, which is usually represented as IJ.&lt;br&gt;
{{ref 2}}&amp;mdash;missing characters are in ISO 8859-15.&lt;br&gt;
{{ref 3}}&amp;mdash;missing &amp;#1168;/&amp;#1169; characters were reintroduced into Ukrainian in 1991.

Each part of ISO 8859 is designed to support languages that often borrow from each other, so the characters needed by each language are usually accommodated by a single part. However, there are some characters and language combinations that are not accommodated without transcriptions. Efforts were made to make conversions as smooth as possible. For example, German has all its seven special chars at the same positions in all Latin variants (1-4, 9-10, 13-16), and in many positions the characters only differ in the diacritics between the sets.  In particular, variants 1-4 were designed jointly, and have the property that every encoded character appears either at a given position or not at all.

|þ||[[ţ]]||[[ŝ]]||[[ū]]||[[ў]]||style=&quout Esperanto.  These include:

* Esperanto's [[alphabet]] uses six non-Latin letters, three of which are not found in any other existing language; as a result, Esperanto in typing and in Internet e-mail and newsgroups frequently resorts to any of several schemes to represent these special letters.  This leads to the situation where the same word may be displayed any of several different ways.  Ido addresses this issue by using the 26-letter [[Latin alphabet]] with two [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], ''ch'' ({{IPA|/&amp;#679;/}}) and ''sh'' ({{IPA|/&amp;#643;/}}) instead of Esperanto's ''ĉ'' and ''ŝ''. The digraph ''qu'', representing {{IPA|/k&amp;#695;/}}, as in English &quot;quick&quot;, is used instead of Esperanto ''kv'', and likewise ''gu'' is used instead of ''gv''.  Ido orthography is phonetic in the sense that each written word has an unambiguous pronunciation, but it does not have the one-to-one correspondence between letters and [[phoneme]]s that Esperanto has.
* Ido generally does not impose rules of grammatical [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] between grammatical categories within a sentence, believing them to be grammatically complex and redundant in a potential universal second language. For example, in Esperanto, the verb in a sentence is invariable regardless of the number and person of the subject. This principle was not extended in Esperanto to adjectives and nouns, however; as a result, in Esperanto an adjective must agree in number and case with the noun it modifies as with the French ''grands livres'' (large books), where the adjective must be pluralized as well as the noun.  There is no such requirement in English, for example, where number is emphasized by variation of the verb, and Ido eliminates this feature from its grammar.
* Esperanto requires the use of the ''-n'' ending to signify the use of the [[accusative case]]. Ido allows the use of this feature in ambiguous situations where the object of a sentence does not follow the subject, but in all other situations the accusative case was eliminated as redundant.
* Ido imposes consistent rules on the use of endings to transform a word from one meaning or part of speech to another, thus simplifying the amount of vocabulary memorization that is necessary.
* Ido, unlike Esperanto, does not assume the male sex as the default for family relationship words, and thus does not, for example, derive the word for &quot;sister&quot; by adding a feminine suffix to the word for &quot;brother&quot;, as standard Esperanto does. Instead, some relationship root words are defined as sex neutral, and two different suffixes derive masculine- and feminine-specific words from the root&amp;mdash;frato (sibling) &gt; fratulo (brother), fratino (sister).  In other cases, Ido has two or three root words where Esperanto has one&amp;mdash;genitoro (parent), patro (father), matro (mother).
* Ido's vocabulary attempts to use [[cognate]]s that are shared in common by as many of its six source languages as possible.
Nevertheless, modern Esperanto has received some influence from Ido in areas such as a clarification of the rules for word derivation and suffixes like ''-oz-'' (&quot;abundant in&quot;) and ''-end-'' (&quot;required to&quot;).

== Phonology ==

Ido has the same typical five-vowel system (a, e, i, o, u have their [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] values) as Esperanto, and most of the same consonants, omitting two consonant [[phoneme]]s used by Esperanto, IPA {{IPA|/x/}} and {{IPA|/&amp;#676;/}}. (The distinctions between {{IPA|/x/ : /h/}} and between {{IPA|/&amp;#676;/ : /&amp;#658;/}} carry a very low functional load in Esperanto, and so were deemed to be unnecessary in Ido.) Without those two consonant phonemes, the consonants in the language are as follows:

The accent rule in Ido is regular, but slightly more complex than that of Esperanto: all polysyllables are stressed on the penultimate (second from last) syllable except for verb [[infinitive]]s, which are stressed on the ultimate syllable&amp;mdash;'''sko'''lo, ka'''fe'''o and '''ler'''nas for &quot;school&quot;, &quot;coffee&quot; and &quot;learn&quot;, but i'''rar''', sa'''var''', and drin'''kar''' for &quot;to go&quot;, &quot;to know&quot;, and &quot;to drink&quot;.

== Grammar ==

Each word in the Ido vocabulary is built from a root word.  A root word consists of a root and a grammatical ending.  Other words can be formed from that word by removing the grammatical ending and adding a new one, or by inserting certain [[affix]]es between the root and the grammatical ending.  As with Esperanto, Ido is grammatically invariable; there are no exceptions in Ido, unlike in natural languages.

Some of the grammatical endings are defined as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot; | Grammatical form || Ido || Esperanto || English
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot; | [[Noun|Singular noun]] || ''' -o''' (libro)|| '''-o''' libro || book
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot; | [[Noun|Plural noun]] || '''-i''' (libri) || '''-oj''' (libroj) || books
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot; | [[Adjective]] || '''-a''' (varma) || '''-a''' (varma) || warm
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot; | [[Adverb]] || '''-e''' (varme) || '''-e''' (varme) || warmly
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot; | [[Infinitive|Present tense infinitive]] || '''-ar''' (irar) || '''-i''' (iri) || to go
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot; | [[Infinitive|Past tense infinitive]] || '''-ir''' (irir) || N/A || to have gone
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot; | [[Infinitive|Future tense infinitive]] || '''-or''' (iror) || N/A || to be going to go
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot; | [[Present tense|Present]] || '''-as''' (iras) || '''-as''' (iras) || go, goes
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot; | [[Past tense|Past]] || '''-is''' (iris) || '''-is''' (iris) || went
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot; | [[Future tense|Future]] || '''-os''' (iros) || '''-os''' (iros) || will go
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot; | [[Imperative]] || '''-ez''' (irez) || '''-u''' (iru) || go!
|- 
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot; | [[Conditional mood|Conditional]] || '''-us''' (irus) || '''-us''' (irus) || would go
|}


These are the same as in Esperanto except for ''-i'', ''-ir''/''-ar''/''-or'' and ''-ez''.  Esperanto marks noun plurals by an ''agglutinative'' ending ''-j'' (so plural nouns end in ''-oj''), uses ''-i'' for verb infinitives (Esperanto infinitives are tenseless), and uses ''-u'' for the imperative. Verbs in Ido do not conjugate depending on person, number or gender; the -'''as''', -'''is''', and -'''os''' endings suffice whether the subject is I, you, he, she, they, or anything else.

===Syntax===
Ido word order is generally the same as English ([[subject verb object]]), so the sentence ''Me havas la blua libro'' is the same as the English &quot;I have the blue book&quot;, both in meaning and word order. There are a few differences, however:
*Adjectives can be written either before the noun as in English, or after the noun as in [[French language|French]]. Thus, ''Me havas la libro blua'' is also permissible.
*Ido has the optional -n accusative ending that is used when the object of the sentence is not clear, or it may be used to alter word order when desired. ''La blua libron me havas'' is another acceptable way of saying the same thing.

Negation occurs in Ido by simply affixing '''ne''' to the front of a verb: '''Me ne havas libro''' means &quot;I do not have a book&quot;. This as well does not vary, and thus the &quot;I do not&quot;, &quot;He does not&quot;, &quot;They do not&quot; before a verb are simply '''Me ne''', '''Il ne''', and '''Li ne'''. In the same way, past tense and future tense negatives are formed by '''ne''' in front of the conjugated verb. &quot;I will not go&quot; and &quot;I did not go&quot; become '''Me ne iros''' and '''Me ne iris''' respectively.

Yes/no questions are formed by the particle '''ka''' in front of the question. &quot;I have a book&quot; (me havas libro) becomes '''Ka me havas libro?''' (do I have a book?). '''Ka''' can also be placed in front of a noun without a verb to make a simple question, corresponding to the English &quot;is it?&quot; '''Ka Mark?''' can mean &quot;Are you Mark?&quot;, &quot;Is it Mark?&quot;, &quot;Do you mean Mark?&quot; depending on the context.

===Pronouns===
The [[pronoun]]s of Ido were revised to make them more acoustically distinct than those of Esperanto, which all end in ''i''. Especially the singular and plural first-person pronouns ''mi'' and ''ni'' may be difficult to distinguish in a noisy environment, so Ido has ''me'' and ''ni'' instead. Ido also distinguishes between [[T-V distinction|intimate (''tu'') and formal (''vu'')]] second-person singular pronouns as well as plural second-person pronouns (''vi'') not marked for intimacy.  Furthermore, Ido has a pan-gender third-person pronoun ''lu'' (it can mean &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, or &quot;it&quot;, depending on the context) in addition to its masculine (''il''), feminine (''el''), and neuter (''ol'') third-person pronouns.

&lt;small&gt;¹ ''ci'' and ''thou'', while technically the familiar form of the word &quot;you&quot; in Esperanto and English, respectively, are almost never used. Results on Google have shown that while ''tu'' is only slightly less common than ''vu'' in Ido, ''ci'' is used less than half of one percent of the amount ''vi'' is in Esperanto. Esperanto's inventor himself did not include the pronoun in the first book on Esperanto and only later reluctantly; later he recommended against using ''ci'' on the grounds that different cultures have conflicting traditions regarding the use of the familiar and formal forms of &quot;you&quot;, and that a universal language should avoid the problem by simply using the formal form in all situations. Unlike some other languages that use a formal second person pronoun, ''vi'' is not capitalized. {{ref|eventoj}}&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;² ''tiu'', though not a pronoun, is usually used in this circumstance, because many people have a hard time applying &quot;it&quot; to humans.&lt;/small&gt;

It should be noted that ''ol'', like English ''it'' and Esperanto ''ĝi'', is not limited to inanimate objects, but can be used &quot;for entities whose sex is indeterminate: ''babies, children, humans, youths, elders, people, individuals, horses, cows, cats,'' etc.&quot;

''Lu'' is often mistakenly labeled an [[epicene]] pronoun, that is, one that refers to both masculine and feminine beings, but in fact ''lu'' is more properly a &quot;pan-gender&quot; pronoun, as it is also used for referring to inanimate objects. From ''Kompleta Gramatiko Detaloza di la Linguo Internaciona Ido'' by Beaufront:

&lt;small&gt;''Lu'' (like ''li'') is used ''for all three genders.'' That ''lu'' does duty for the three genders at will in the singular is not in itself any more astonishing than seeing ''li'' serve the three genders at will in the plural ... By a decision (1558) the Idist Academy rejected every restriction concerning the use of ''lu.'' One may thus use that pronoun in exactly the same way for a thing and a person of obvious sex as for animals of unknown sex and a person that has a genderless name, like ''baby, child, human,'' etc., these being as truly masculine as feminine.&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;The motives for this decision were given in &quot;Mondo&quot;, XI, 68: ''Lu'' for the singular is exactly the same as ''li'' for the plural. Logic, symmetry and ease demand this. Consequently, just as ''li'' may be used for people, animals, and things whenever nothing obliges one to express the gender,  so ''lu'' may be used for people, animals, and things under the same condition. The proposed distinction would be a bothersome subtlety...&lt;/small&gt;

===Vocabulary===
Vocabulary in Ido is based on words that give the greatest facility to the most number of speakers. During its inception the first 5000+ roots were analyzed compared to the vocabulary of English, French, Spanish, German, Russian and Italian, and the following result was found {{ref|dyer}}:

*2024 roots (38%) belong to 6 languages 
*942 roots (17%) belong to 5 languages
*1111 roots (21%) belong to 4 languages
*585 roots (11%) belong to 3 languages
*454 roots (8%) belong to 2 languages
*255 roots (5%) belong to 1 language
**Total 5371 100%

In addition, a comparison of Ido vocabulary to the six shows the following for the similarities of Ido to the six languages above:

*French 4880: 91% 
*Italian 4454: 83% 
*Spanish 4237: 79% 
*English 4219: 79% 
*German 3302: 61% 
*Russian 2821: 52%

This is consistent with the fact that Ido is sometimes mistaken for French, Italian or Spanish at first sight.

Vocabulary in Ido is often created through a number of official prefixes and suffixes that alter the meaning of the word.  This allows a user to take existing words and modify them to create [[neologism|neologisms]] when necessary, and allows for a wide range of expression without the need to learn new vocabulary each time. Though their number is too large to be included in one article, some examples include:
*The diminutive suffix '''-et-'''. '''Domo''' (house) becomes '''dometo''' (cottage), and '''libro''' (book) becomes '''libreto''' (novelette or short story).
*The pejorative suffix '''-ach-'''. '''Domo''' becomes '''domacho''' (hovel), and '''libro''' becomes '''libracho''' (a shoddy piece of work, pulp fiction, etc.)
*The prefix '''retro-''', which implies a reversal. '''Irar''' (to go) becomes '''retroirar''' (to go back, backward) and '''venar''' becomes '''retrovenar''' (to return).

New vocabulary is generally created through an analysis of the word, its [[etymology]], and reference to the six source languages. If a word can be created through vocabulary already existing in the language then it will usually be adopted without need for a new radical (such as '''wikipedio''' for ''wikipedia'', which consists of '''wiki''' + '''enciklopedio''' for ''encyclopedia''), and if not an entirely new word will be created. The word '''alternatoro''' for example was adopted in [[1926]], likely because five of the six source languages used largely the same [[orthography]] for the word, and because it was long enough to avoid being mistaken for other words in the existing vocabulary. {{ref|neologismo}} Adoption of a word is done through consensus, after which the word will be made official by the [[Uniono por la Linguo Internaciona Ido|union]]. Care must also be taken to avoid [[homonym]]s if possible, and usually a new word undergoes some discussion before being adopted. Foreign words that have a restricted sense and are not likely to be used in everyday life (such as the word ''[[intifada]]'' to refer to the conflict between [[Israel]] and [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]]) are left untouched, and often written in italics.

==Ido-speaking community==

The vast majority of Ido speakers find out about the language after learning about Esperanto, and so the percentage of Idists who know Esperanto is much higher than vice versa. The largest number of Ido speakers are found in [[Germany]], [[France]], and [[Spain]].

As with all constructed languages, gauging the number of speakers of Ido is an extremely difficult task. Moreover, it is also necessary to distinguish between the number of Ido ''speakers'' and Ido ''supporters''. Ido resembles Esperanto, and many Esperantists have learned Ido out of curiosity while still not using it, preferring to support the more well-known Esperanto movement instead. On one Esperanto bulletin board was written the following which sums this up well:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mi provis Idon antaŭ Esperanto, kaj alvenis konklude: la diferoj estas efike trivialaj, komparite al pli gravaj koncernaĵoj (kiujn mi ne detalos ĉi tie). Pro tio mi elektis subteni Esperanton, kaj ne subteni Idon, kvankam eble mi lernos Idon por hobio. Tamen via id-vortoj estas bone komprenebla al mi, kaj mi uzus Idon, se ne ekzistis tre pli subtenita lingvo&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;I tried Ido before Esperanto, and came to conclude that the differences are in fact trivial, compared to larger concerns (that I will not go into detail about here). For that &lt;i&gt;[the larger speaker community and volume of material]&lt;/i&gt; I chose to support Esperanto and not to support Ido, though I will be able to learn Ido as a hobby. However, your writing in Ido &lt;i&gt;[responding to an Ido speaker]&lt;/i&gt; is comprehensible to me, and I would use Ido, if there did not exist a much more supported language. [http://gxangalo.com/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=112&amp;viewmode=flat&amp;order=ASC&amp;start=19] &lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is possible to find trilingual discussions of this nature on the Internet in English, Esperanto and Ido, each understanding the other with little problem. 

A number of Esperantists viewed the schism of Ido as a mixed blessing, and a number of writings show that some were inversely glad to see those who were interested only in creating a perfect language by constantly reforming it leave the fold so that those remaining could work on using and promoting the language itself. However, these &quot;constant reformers&quot; eventually moved on to other reform projects, few of which survived much beyond the deaths of the authors themselves, and Ido has remained constant since then&amp;mdash;it is safe to say that were Ido a community of language reformers during its early days, that this is not the case anymore. {{ref|changes}}

A small sample of 24 Idists during late 2005 showed that 57% had begun their studies of the language during the past three years, 32% from the mid-1990s to 2002, and 8% had known the language from before.

:&amp;ndash;Ha !... Kad esas nulu sur Tero ?
:&amp;ndash;To esas la dezerto, e nulu esas sur la dezerti. Tero esas tre granda &amp;ndash;dicis la serpento.

:La princeto sideskis sur stono e levis lua okuli a la cielo.

:&amp;ndash;Me questionas a me &amp;ndash;lu dicis- ka la steli intence brilas por ke uladie singlu povez trovar sua stelo. Videz mea planeto, olu esas exakte super ni... ma tre fore !
:&amp;ndash;Olu esas bela planeto &amp;ndash;dicis la serpento-. Por quo vu venis adhike ?

:&amp;ndash;Yes, ma me esas plu potenta kam fingro di rejo &amp;ndash;dicis la serpento.

:La princeto ridetis.

:&amp;ndash;Me ne kredas ke vu esas tre potenta, mem vu ne havas pedi... nek vu povas voyajar...
:&amp;ndash;Me povas transportar vu plu fore kam navo -dicis la serpento.

:Ed olu spulis la maleolo di la princeto, same kam ora braceleto.

:&amp;ndash;Ta quan me tushas retroiras a la tero deube lu venis. Ma vu esas pura e vu venas de stelo...

:La princeto nulon respondis.

:&amp;ndash;Me kompatas vu, qua esas tante sola sur ta harda granita Tero. Me povas helpar vu se vu sentas nostalgio a vua planeto. Me povas...

:&amp;ndash;Ho ! &amp;ndash;dicis la princeto-. Me bone komprenis, ma pro quo vu sempre parolas enigmatoze ?

== Literature and publications ==
[[Image:Anne Frank in Ido.PNG|right|thumb|280px|Extract from [[The Diary of Anne Frank]] in Ido from the journal ''Adavane!'', published by the Spanish Ido Society.]]
Ido has a number of publications that can be subscribed to or downloaded for free in most cases. The majority of Ido publications are composed mostly of material on various subjects, with a few pages within on the status of the movement and news on upcoming gatherings. ''Kuriero Internaciona'' is a magazine produced in France every few months with a range of topics. ''Adavane!'' is a magazine produced by the Spanish Ido Society every two months that has a range of topics, as well as a few dozen pages of work translated from other languages. ''Progreso'' is the official organ of the Ido movement and has been around since the inception of the movement in 1908. Other sites can be found with various stories, fables or proverbs along with a few books of the Bible translated into Ido on a smaller scale. The site ''publikaji'' has a few podcasts in Ido along with various songs and other recorded material.

The online encyclopedia [[Wikipedia]] includes an [http://io.wikipedia.org Ido-language edition] (known in Ido as ''Wikipedio''); [[as of January 2006]], it has over 13,000 articles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Improvisational Theatre''' (also known as '''improv''' or '''impro''') is a form of [[theatre]] in which the [[actor]]s perform spontaneously, without a [[script (performing arts)|script]].  Modern improvisation began in the classroom with the theatre games of [[Viola Spolin]] and [[Keith Johnstone]] in the 1950s, then evolved quickly to become an independent artform worthy of presentation before a paying audience.

In all forms of improvisation, the actors invent/discover the [[dialogue]] and action as they perform.  The unpredictable nature of such a performance lends itself naturally to [[comedy]], which might go somewhat towards explaining why the overwhelming majority of improvisational theatre is comedic, not dramatic.  Dramatic improv is used by many companies and artists as a means of generating text and content for later performance. This is sometimes referred to as ''&quot;organic&quot;'' theatre, and is especially favored by creators of [[political theatre]], [[experimental theatre]], and practitioners of [[drama therapy]].  Improvisation is often found used in actor training as well.  Modern [[improvisational comedy]], as it is practiced in the West, falls generally into two categories: [[Shortform improvisation|shortform]] and [[longform improvisation|longform]].  

==Improv process==

Improvisational theatre allows an active relationship with the audience often absent from scripted theatre. Frequently improv groups will solicit suggestions from the audience as a source of inspiration, a way of getting the audience excited and involved, and as a means of proving that the performance is not scripted, a charge often aimed at the masters of the art, whose performances seem so effortless and detailed that those new to improv are convinced it must have been planned.  Much of this success can be attributed to the level of cooperation and ''agreement'' these improvisers bring to the stage.

In order for an improvised [[scene]] to be successful, the actors involved must work together responsively to define the parameters and action of the scene. With each spoken word or action in the scene, an actor makes an ''offer'', meaning that he or she defines some element of the reality of the scene. This might include giving another character a name, identifying a relationship, location, or using [[mime]] to define the physical environment. These activities are also known as ''endowment''. It is the responsibility of the other actors to accept the offers that their fellow performers make; to not do so is known as [[blocking (improv)|blocking]], which usually prevents the scene from developing. Some performers may deliberately block (or otherwise break out of character) for comedic effect -- this is known as ''gagging'' -- but this generally prevents the scene from advancing and is frowned upon by many improvisers. Accepting an offer is usually accompanied by adding a new offer, often building on the earlier one; this is a process improvisers refer to as ''&quot;Yes, And...&quot;'' and is considered the cornerstone of improvisational technique.  For example, an improv scene might begin with these lines.

'''Adam''': I'm proud of all the work you've done here on the farm, Junior.

'''Bill''': Yes, and I'm proud of you for giving up the moonshine, Pa.

The unscripted nature of improv also implies no predetermined knowledge about the [[prop]]s that might be useful in a scene.  Improv companies may have at their disposal some number of readily accessible props that can be called upon at a moment's notice, but many improvisers eschew props in favor of the infinite possibilities available through [[mime]].  As with all improv ''offers'', actors are encouraged to respect the validity and continuity of the imaginary environment defined by themselves and their fellow performers; this means, for example, taking care not to walk through the table or &quot;miraculously&quot; survive multiple bullet wounds from another improviser's gun.

Because improv actors may be required to play a variety of roles without preparation, they need to be able to construct characters quickly with physicality, [[gesture]]s, [[Accent (language)|accent]]s, [[human voice|voice]] changes, or other techniques as demanded by the situation.  The actor may be called upon to play a character of a different age or sex.  Character motivations are an important part of successful improv scenes, and improv actors must therefore attempt to act according to the objectives that they believe their character seeks.  

Many improvisational actors also work as scripted actors, and &quot;improv&quot; techniques are often taught in standard acting classes. The basic skills of listening, clarity, confidence, and performing without thinking are considered important skills for actors to develop.

==Improv troupes==

==Well-known improv actors==

Some key figures in the development of improvisational theatre are [[Viola Spolin]] and her son [[Paul Sills]], founder of Chicago's famed [[The Second City|Second City]] troupe and inventor of [[Story Theater]], and [[Del Close]], founder of [[ImprovOlympic]] (along with [[Charna Halpern]]) and creator of the [[longform]] improv known as [[The Harold]].

[[Keith Johnstone]] authored [[Impro]] and [[Impro for Storytellers]] and developed the international formats [[Theatresports]], Micetro Impro, Gorilla Theatre and the Life Game.

[[Dick Chudnow]] founded [[ComedySportz]] dealing specifically with competitive [[shortform]] improvisational theatre.

[[Jonathan Fox]] founded [[Playback Theatre]], a community based form with links to oral storytelling and [[psychodrama]].

[[David Shepherd]], with Paul Sills, founded the [[Compass Theatre]] in Chicago. Shepherd was intent on developing a true &quot;people's Theatre&quot;, and hoped to bring political drama to the stockyards. The Compass went on to play in numerous forms and companies, in a number of cities including NY and Hyannis, after the founding of The Second City. A number of Compass members were also founding members of [[The Second City]].  In the 1970's, Shepherd began experimenting with group-creatied  videos.  He is the author of &quot;That Movie In Your Head&quot;, about these efforts.

[[Robert Wells]] founded [[Chicken Lips]] Comedy Company and the [[World Humor Organization]] (WHO) which provides top class shortform improv. Based in Denver at the [[Avenue Theater]].

[[image:NASA-Krikalev-inside-ISS.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Cosmonaut [[Sergei Krikalev]] inside the Zvezda Service Module, November 2000]]

The '''International Space Station''' ('''ISS''') is a joint project of five space agencies: 
*[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] ([[United States]])
*[[Russian Federal Space Agency]] ([[Russia|Russian Federation]]) 
*[[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] ([[Japan]])
*[[Canadian Space Agency]] ([[Canada]])
*[[European Space Agency]] (15 of its member states are currently participating; [[Austria]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[Portugal]], and [[Finland]] chose not to participate; [[Greece]] and [[Luxembourg]] joined ESA later).

The [[Brazilian Space Agency]] ([[Brazil]]) participates through separate contract with [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]].The [[Italian Space Agency]] similary has separate contracts for various activities, that are not done in the framework of [[European Space Agency|ESA]] ISS works (where [[Italy]] also fully participates).

The [[space station]] is located in [[orbit]] around the [[Earth]] at an altitude of approximately [[1 E5 m|360]] [[kilometre|km]] (220 miles), a type of orbit usually termed [[low Earth orbit]] (The actual height varies over time by several kilometres due to [[atmospheric drag]] and reboosts {{ref|altitude}}). It orbits Earth in a [[Orbital period|period]] of about 92 minutes; by June [[2005]] it had completed more than 37,500 orbits since launch of the [[Zarya|Zarya module]] on [[November 20]], [[1998]].

In many ways the ISS represents a merger of previously planned independent space stations: [[Russian Federal Space Agency|Russia]]'s [[ISS Zvezda|Mir 2]], [[NASA|United States]]' [[Space Station Freedom]] and the planned [[ESA|European]] [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]] and [[JAXA|Japanese]] [[Japanese Experiment Module|Experiment Module]]. Today it represents a permanent human presence in space, as it has been manned with a crew of at least two since [[November 2]], [[2000]] (see [[#ISS Expeditions]]).

It is serviced primarily by the [[Space Shuttle]], [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]] and [[Progress spacecraft]] units. It is still being built, but is home to s Simple and compound tenses can be combined in various ways to express more complex tenses (e.g., ''Nos haberea morite'' 'We would have died').

Word order is essentially Subject–Verb–Object, except that pronouns often follow the Romance pattern Subject–Object–Verb (''Io les vide'' 'I see them'). Adjectives may precede or follow the nouns they modify. The position of adverbs is flexible, though constrained by common sense.

== Community ==
Estimates of the number of speakers of Interlingua range from as few as 100 to as many as 10,000. The majority of conservative estimates, however, place the number of active users of Interlingua at between 1,000 and 1,500. There are no known native speakers.

Interlingua has active supporters in [[North America|North]] and [[South America]], [[Europe]] (particularly [[Scandinavia]]), and [[Russia]]. There are Interlingua web pages (including editions of Wikipedia and Wikitionary) and several periodicals, including ''Panorama in Interlingua'' from the [[Union Mundial pro Interlingua]] (UMI) and the magazines of the national societies allied with it. There are several active mailing lists, and Interlingua is also in use in certain [[Usenet]] newsgroups, particularly in the europa hierarchy. In recent years, samples of Interlingua have also been seen in music and animé.

Every two years, the UMI organizes an international conference in a different European country; the most recent conference ([[2005]]), in [[Sweden]], was attended by slightly over 250 people.  In the year between, the Scandinavian Interlingua societies co-organize a conference in Sweden.

Interlingua may well be the most widely spoken [[international auxiliary language]] (IAL) after [[Esperanto]], although the estimated number of speakers overlaps with that of [[Ido]].  It is also claimed to be the most widely ''understood'' IAL by virtue of its naturalistic (as opposed to schematic) grammar and vocabulary, allowing those familiar with one of the primary control languages to read and understand it with little study.

== Criticisms and controversies ==

Like any project of such scope, Interlingua has generated some heated discussion, both among Interlingua users and among non-users (frequently proponents of other auxiliary languages). Some common criticisms (and their common responses) are noted below.

* Some say that Interlingua is too Romance in its grammar and vocabulary, and is not fair towards Germanic languages.  Its defenders note that the Romance languages, being based on Latin, have the advantage in the linguistic impact of the old [[Roman Empire]], which is still seen today in that a Romance language is spoken on five out of seven continents; the only Germanic languages with an international scope are [[English language|English]] (which is already a primary language) and [[German language|German]] (which is already a secondary language). However, [[Spanish_language|Spanish]], which has a very regular grammar and inflectional system compared to other Romance languages, and is quite easy for English-speakers to learn, has threatened to obviate the need for not only Interlingua but Esperanto and Ido, especially in the [[United States]], where Spanish is the most common second language studied. (In fact, there is debate in the Interlingua community as to expanding the language's sources to other languages; see [[:ia:Creation_de_nove_parolas_in_Interlingua|Creation de nove parolas in Interlingua]] (in Interlingua) for an overview of the debate.)

* Others note that Interlingua, being [[Europe]]an in nature, is primarily of use to Europeans.  Interlingua supporters point out that [[Esperanto]], despite being based on Slavic, Germanic, and Romance languages, has some of its strongest communities in [[China]] and [[Japan]], where the local languages are totally unrelated to the [[Indo-European languages]]. (See [[color argument]].)

* Finally, some argue that Esperantists outnumber Interlingua users to such a degree (estimates range from 50:1 to 1000:1) that anyone interested in promoting an auxiliary language should support [[Esperanto]] instead. Supporters counter that it is a lot easier to understand Interlingua without training than Esperanto, because Interlingua uses the most widespread words of the Romance languages, whereas Esperanto makes up many of its own words according to internal rules. For example, one can speak Interlingua with anyone who knows Italian or Spanish. One will even be understood by Portuguese speakers, but will have difficulty understanding them. Whereas if one tries to communicate in Esperanto to speakers of these other languages one will have very limited success.

The '''Isle of Wight''' is an [[England|English]] [[island]], south of [[Southampton, England|Southampton]] off the southern English coast. It is part of the [[United Kingdom]]. 

Popularized from [[Victorian Era|Victorian times]] as a holiday resort, it is known for its natural beauty and as home to the [[Royal Yacht Squadron]] at [[Cowes]], a town that hosts a world famous annual [[Cowes Week|regatta]].  Colloquially, it is known as &quot;The Island&quot; by its residents. It possesses a rich history including its own brief status as a [[vassal]] kingdom in the [[fifteenth century]], home to poet [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]] and [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria's]] much loved summer residence and final home [[Osborne House]].  Its maritime history encompasses boat building and sail making through to the manufacture of [[flying boat]]s and the world's first [[hovercraft]].  It is home to the [[Isle of Wight Festival]] which in [[1970]] was one of the largest [[rock music]] events ever held with estimates reaching 600,000 attendees, overtaking the record set at [[Woodstock]] a year earlier.  The island is also one of the richest [[fossil]] locations for [[dinosaur]]s in [[Europe]].  In [[686|686AD]], it became the last part of [[Great Britain]] to convert to [[Christianity]] - almost a century after the mainland. 

Until the revival of [[Rutland]] in [[1997]] it was the smallest [[county]] in England but it remains, with just one [[Member of Parliament]] and 132,731 permanent residents in the [[2001]] [[census]], the most populated [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in the United Kingdom|Parliamentary constituency]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

==Geography &amp; Wildlife==

The Isle of Wight is approximately diamond in shape and covers an area of [[1 E8 m²|147 square miles (381 square km)]]. Nearly half this area, mainly in the west of the Island, is designated as the [[Isle of Wight AONB|Isle of Wight Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]. The landscape of the Island is remarkably diverse, leading to its oft-quoted description of &quot;England in Miniature&quot;. The West Wight is predominantly rural, with dramatic coastlines dominated by the famous chalk [[downland]] ridge, running across the whole Island and ending in The Needles stacks - perhaps the most photographed aspect of the Isle of Wight. The highest point on the island is [[St Boniface Down]], at 241m/791ft, which is also a [[Marilyn (hill)|Marilyn]].
[[Image:Isle of Wight coastline.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The famous view at [[The Needles]] and [[Alum Bay]].]]

The rest of the Island landscape also has great diversity, with perhaps the most notable habitats being the soft cliffs and sea ledges, which are spectacular features as well as being very important for wildlife, and are internationally protected. The [[River Medina]] flows north into the [[Solent]], whilst the other main river, the [[Eastern Yar (river), Isle of Wight|River Yar]] flows roughly north-east, emerging at [[Bembridge]] Harbour on the eastern end of the Island. Confusingly, there is another entirely separate river at the western end also called the [[Western Yar (river), Isle of Wight|River Yar]] flowing the short distance from [[Freshwater, Isle of Wight|Freshwater]] Bay to a relatively large estuary at [[Yarmouth, Isle of Wight|Yarmouth]]. Where distinguishing the two becomes necessary, each may be referred to as the ''eastern'' or ''western'' Yar. The south coast of the island adjoins the [[English Channel]].

Island wildlife is remarkable, thought to be the only place in [[England]] where the [[red squirrel]] is flourishing, with a stable population. Unlike the rest of England, no [[grey squirrel]]s are to be found on the Island[http://www.iwight.com/living_here/environment/operation_squirrel.asp], nor are there any wild [[deer]], but instead rare and protected species such as the [[dormouse]], and many rare [[bat]]s can be found. The [[Glanville Fritillary]] butterfly, in the [[United Kingdom]] is largely restricted to the edges of the crumbling cliffs of the Isle of Wight.

[[Image:Wight.png|250px|right|thumb|'''Isle of Wight''' and the Solent]]

By far the main form of access is by [[boat]] from the mainland, regular [[ferry]] services being available from [[Lymington]] to [[Yarmouth, Isle of Wight|Yarmouth]], [[Southampton]] to East [[Cowes]], and [[Portsmouth]] to [[Fishbourne, Isle of Wight|Fishbourne]]. Foot passengers may also use the [[hovercraft]] service between [[Southsea]] and [[Ryde]] esplanade or two hi-speed [[catamaran]] services; from West Cowes to Southampton or Portsmouth Harbour Station to Ryde pier head. The latter provides a direct link between the rail systems of the Island and Mainland. The island is also served by airports for light [[aircraft]] at Bembridge and Sandown.

The island is the home of the smallest Train Operating Company in Britain's [[National Rail]] network, the [[Island Line, IOW | Island Line]], running some 8&amp;frac12; miles from [[Ryde]] Pier Head to [[Shanklin]] down the eastern side of the island. The island also has a steam operated heritage railway, the [[Isle of Wight Steam Railway]], which connects with the Island Line at Smallbrook Junction.

==History of the Isle of Wight==
''Main article: [[History of the Isle of Wight]].''

Much of the land now making up the Isle of Wight was deposited during the late [[Cretaceous]], at times part of a  large river [[valley]] complex which consisted of much of the current southern coast of [[England]]. The swamps and ponds of the region at that time made the island excellent for the preservation of fossils, and means that it is now one of the richest locations for finding [[dinosaur]]s in [[Europe]] (for more information see the [[dinosaurs of the Isle of Wight]] article).

The Isle of Wight became an island sometime after the end of the last [[Ice Age]] when [[post-glacial rebound]] caused the land level to sink, the [[Solent]] flooding and separating the island from the mainland. The island was part of [[Celt]]ic Britain and known to the Romans as ''Vectis'', captured by [[Vespasian]] in the [[Roman invasion of Britain|Roman invasion]]. After the Roman era the Isle of Wight was settled by the [[Jutes]], a [[Germanic tribe]], in the early stages of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] invasions.  The latter's corruption of ''Vectis'' into ''Wiht'' (the [[Latin]] ''v'' was pronounced [w]) is the root of the island's name.

[[Image:Charles I memorial.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Memorial to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]  at [[Carisbrooke Castle]]]]

The [[Norman Conquest]] created the position of [[Lord of the Isle of Wight]]. [[Carisbrooke Priory]] and the fort of [[Carisbrooke Castle]] were founded.  The island did not come under full control of the crown until it was sold by the dying last Norman Lord, Lady Isabella de Fortebus, to [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] in [[1293]].  The Lordship thereafter became a Royal appointment with a brief interruption when [[Henry de Beauchamp, 1st Duke of Warwick]] was crowned King of the Isle of Wight, [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]] assisting in person at the ceremony, placing the crown on his head. He died in [[1445]], aged 22. With no male heir, his regal title expired with him.

[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], who developed the [[Royal Navy]] and its permanent base at [[Portsmouth]], fortified the island at Yarmouth, East &amp; West Cowes and Sandown, sometimes re-using stone from dissolved monasteries as building material. Sir Richard Worsley, Captain of the Island at this time, successfully commanded the resistance to the last of the French attacks in [[1545]].  Much later on after the [[Spanish Armada]] in [[1588]] the threat of Spanish attacks remained, and the outer fortifications of Carisbrooke Castle were built between [[1597]] and [[1602]]. During the [[English Civil War]] [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] fled to the Isle of Wight believing he would receive sympathy from the governor Robert Hammond.  Hammond was appalled, and incarcerated the king in Carisbrooke Castle.

[[Image:Osborne-house1.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Osborne House]] and its magnificent grounds are now open to the public]]

[[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] made [[Osborne House]] on the Isle of Wight her summer home for many years, and as a result it become a major holiday resort for members of European royalty, whose many houses could later claim descent from her through the widely flung marriages of her offspring.  During her reign in [[1897]] the World's first [[radio]] station was set up by [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]] at the Needles battery at the western tip of the Island.

In [[1904]] a mysterious illness began to kill [[honeybee]] colonies on the island, and had nearly wiped out all hives by [[1907]] when the [[disease]] jumped to the mainland, and decimated [[beekeeping]] in the [[British Isles]]. Called the Isle of Wight Disease, the cause of the mystery ailment was not identified until [[1921]] when it was traced to the [[mite]] ''[[Acarapis woodi]]''.  The disease (now called [[Acarine Disease]]) frightened many other nations because of the importance of bees in [[pollination]] of many food plants. Laws against importation of honeybees were passed, but this merely delayed the eventual spread of the parasite to the rest of the world.  

The [[Isle of Wight Festival]] could describe several events, but usually the term refers to one very large [[Isle of Wight Festival|rock festival]] that took place near [[Afton Down]], West Wight in [[1970]], following two smaller concerts in [[1968]] and [[1969]]. The [[1970]] show was notable for being the last public performance by [[Jimi Hendrix]] before his death and the number of attendees reaching, by many estimates 600,000[http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie.aspx?m=32552] despite only 50,000 tickets being sold and overtaking the attendance at [[Woodstock]] in the previous year. The festival was revived in [[2002]] and is now an annual event - with other, smaller musical events of many different genres across the Island becoming associated with it.

==Politics==
''Main article: [[Politics of the Isle of Wight]]''

The Isle of Wight is a [[Ceremonial counties of England|Ceremonial]] and [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan county|Administrative]] county and as it has no district councils (only the county council) it is effectively a [[Unitary authority|Unitary]] county, though not officially. It is unique in England in this way - all other Unitary areas are single districts with no county council, while the Isle of Wight is the other way round. It also has a single [[Member of Parliament]], and is by far the most populous [[constituency]] in the UK (more than 50% above the average of English constituencies).

[[Image:iwclogo1.gif|thumb|100px|right|[[Isle of Wight Council]] logo]]

As a constituency of the [[House of Commons]] it is traditionally a battleground between the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. The current MP, [[Andrew Turner]] is a Conservative, and his predecessor Dr [[Peter Brand]] was a Liberal Democrat.

The [[Isle og each other. These areas are often refered to as the ''Fíor-Ghaeltacht'' (Fíor=True) and collectively have a population of just under 10,000, of which over 80% use the language daily{{fact}}. The highest proportions of daily Irish speakers in the community are found in [[Ros Muc, Connemara]] (over 91%){{fact}}, and around [[Bloody Foreland]] (''Cnoc na Fola'') in ''Tír Chonaill'' (88-89%){{fact}}.

==Dialects==
There are a number of distinct dialects of Irish. Roughly speaking, the three major dialect areas coincide with the provinces of [[Munster]] (''Cúige Mumhan''), [[Connacht]] (''Cúige Chonnacht'') and [[Ulster]] (''Cúige Uladh'').

===Munster dialects===
{{main|Munster Irish}}
Munster Irish is spoken in the Gaeltachtaí of Kerry (''Contae Chiarraí''), Muskerry (''Múscraí''), [[Cape Clear]] (''Oileán Cléire'') in the western part of [[County Cork]] (''Contae Chorcaí''), and the tiny pocket of Irish-speakers in An Rinn near [[Dungarvan]] (''Dún Garbháin'') in County Waterford (''Contae Phort Láirge''). The most important subdivision in Munster is that between Decies Irish (spoken in Waterford) and the rest of Munster Irish. 

Some typical features of Munster Irish are:

# The use of personal endings instead of pronouns with verbs, thus &quot;I must&quot; is in Munster ''caithfead'', while other dialects prefer ''caithfidh mé'' (''mé'' means &quot;I&quot;). &quot;I was and you were&quot; is ''Bhíos agus bhís'' in Munster but ''Bhí mé agus bhí tú'' in other dialects.
# In front of nasals and &quot;ll&quot; some short vowels are lengthened while other are diphthongised.
# A copula-construction involving ''is ea'' is frequently used.

===Connacht dialects===
{{main|Connacht Irish}}
The strongest dialect of Connacht Irish is to be found in [[Connemara]] and the [[Aran Islands]]. In some regards this dialect is quite different from general Connacht Irish but since most Connacht dialects have died out during the last century Connemara Irish is sometimes seen as Connacht Irish. Much closer to the traditional Connacht Irish is the very threatened dialect spoken in the region on the border between Galway (''Gaillimh'') and Mayo (''Maigh Eo''). The Irish of [[Tourmakeady]] (''Tuar Mhic Éadaigh'') in southern Mayo (''Maigh Eo Theas'') and Joyce Country (''Dúthaigh Sheoige'') are considered the living Irish dialects closest to Middle Irish. Also, the northern Mayo dialect of Erris (''Iorras'') and [[Achill]] (''Acaill'') is in grammar and word-building essentially a Connacht dialect; but shows an affinity in vocabulary with Ulster Irish, due to large-scale immigration of dispossessed people following the [[Plantation of Ulster]].

Connemara Irish is very popular with learners, thanks to Mícheál Ó Siadhail's self-teaching textbook ''Learning Irish''. However, there are features in Connemara Irish outside the official standard—notably the preference for verbal nouns ending in -achan, such as ''lagachan'' instead of ''lagú'', &quot;weakening&quot;. The non-standard pronunciation with lengthened vowels and heavily reduced endings give Connemara Irish its distinct sound.

The distinguishing features of this dialect include the prounouncing of 'bh' as 'w', rather than as 'v' in other parts of the country: for example 'Ni raibh' is pronounced &quot;Ni raow&quot; in Connacht as opposed to &quot;Ni rev&quot; elsewhere. In addition Connacht speakers tend to put the &quot;we&quot; pronoun at the end of the verb rather than with the verb itself: for example &quot;Bhi muid&quot; is used for 'we were' instead of &quot;Bhiomar&quot; elsewhere. This has become a common teaching practice in schools as it is a much easier construction of any verb in the 'we' form.

Connacht Irish tends to be more widespread than any other dialect, as most Irish teachers tend to come from there, although, obviously, there are many exceptions.

===Ulster dialects===
{{main|Ulster Irish}}
The most important of the [[Ulster]] dialects today is that of the Rosses (''na Rosa''), which has been used extensively in literature by such authors as the brothers [[Séamus Ó Grianna]] and [[Seosamh Mac Grianna]], locally known as Jimí Fheilimí and Joe Fheilimí. This dialect is essentially the same as that in Gweedore (''Gaoth Dobhair''= Inlet of Streaming Water), the same dialect used by native speaker [[Enya]] (''Eithne'') and her siblings in [[Clannad]] (''Clann as Dobhar'' = Family from the Water).

Ulster Irish sounds very different and shares several unusual features with [[Scottish Gaelic]], as well as having lots of characteristic words and shades of meanings. However, since the demise of those Irish dialects spoken natively in what is today [[Northern Ireland]], it is probably an exaggeration to see Ulster Irish as an intermediary form between Scottish Gaelic and the southern and western dialects of Irish. Indeed, Scottish Gaelic does have lots of non-Ulster features in common with Munster Irish, too.

One noticeable trait of Ulster Irish is the use of the negative participle ''cha(n)'', in place of the Munster and Connaught version ''ní''. Even in Ulster, ''cha(n)'', most typical of Scottish Gaelic, has ousted the more common ''ní'' only in easternmost dialects (including the now defunct ones once spoken in what is now Northern Ireland). The practice seems to be that ''cha(n)'' is most usually used when answering to a statement, either confirming a negative statement (''Níl aon mhaith ann'' - ''Chan fhuil, leoga'' = &quot;It is no good&quot; - &quot;Indeed it isn't&quot;) or contesting an affirmative one (''Tá sé go maith'' - ''Chan fhuil!'' = &quot;It is good&quot; - &quot;No, it isn't!&quot;), while ''ní'' is preferred in answering a question (''An bhfuil aon mhaith ann?'' - ''Níl'' = &quot;Is it any good?&quot; - &quot;No&quot;).

===Other regions===
The dialects of Irish native to [[Leinster]], the fourth province of Ireland, became extinct during the [[20th century]], but records of some of these were made by the [[Irish Folklore Commission]] among other bodies prior to this.

The present-day Irish of Meath (in Leinster) is a special case. It belongs to the Connemara dialect, as the Irish-speaking community in Meath is simply a group of mostly Connemara speakers who moved there in the [[1930s]], after a land reform campaign spearheaded by [[Máirtín Ó Cadhain]] (subsequently one of the greatest modernist writers in the language).

In areas outside the traditional Gaeltacht, where standard Irish was learnt in schools, this has become the &quot;dialect&quot; of learners of the language. What has been called &quot;Dublin Irish&quot; or &quot;Gaelscoil Irish&quot; has also arisen, that is Irish poorly learnt and heavily influenced by English. English idioms are translated directly, e.g. &quot;Tabhair suas&quot; for Give up when the verb &quot;Lig&quot; should be used. English grammar is sometimes used straight when not applicable to Irish. Often, when the speaker doesn't know a word, the English will be substituted, sometimes with &quot;áil&quot; affixed. &quot;áil&quot; is generally an ending for the verbal noun of a verb, but when added to an English word, this becomes the stem, e.g. vótáil. Many &quot;Béarlachas&quot;(false Irish based on English) words and phrases are used, e.g. pioc, sórt, saghas, féar plé etc. Also, typical interjection words often used in English and especially English influenced by America are used, e.g. like, man, so, etc. are used un-translated in Irish.

Students in the Eastern part of Ireland tend to pronounce the Irish words in an English way rather than in a Gaelic way. This is possibly due to teaching inconsistency. The average Irish student would have twelve or thirteen different Irish teachers, each with a varying dialect.

===Comparisons===
The differences between dialects are considerable, and have led to recurrent difficulties in defining standard Irish. Even everyday phrases can show startling dialectal variation: the standard example is &quot;How are you?&quot;:

* Ulster: ''cad é mar atá tú?'' (&quot;what is it as you are?&quot; Note: ''caidé'' or ''goidé'' and sometimes ''dé'' are alternative renderings of ''cad é'')
* Connacht: ''cén chaoi a bhfuil tú?'' (&quot;what way [is it] that you are?&quot;)
* Munster: ''conas taoí?'' (&quot;how are you?&quot;)
* &quot;standard Irish&quot;: Conas a tá tú (&quot;how are you?&quot;)

In recent times, however, contacts between speakers of different dialects have become more common, and mixed dialects have originated. Nevertheless, many dialect speakers (especially Ulster) are still jealously trying to guard their own variety against influences from other dialects. Among non-native speakers, this can be seen as a quest for authenticity. Regional accents are commonly taught to non-natives and imitated: an urban non-native speaker of Irish in [[Cork]] City (''Cathair Chorcaí'') is very probably trying to emulate Coolea or Kerry dialect; one from [[Belfast]] (''Béal Feirste'') tends to speak an Irish modelled on the Rosses dialect of Donegal; and Galwegian Irish-speakers, living next door to Connemara, will do their best to sound like a Connemara native.

==Shelta==
There also exists a [[Cant (language)|cant]] called [[Shelta]], based partly on [[English language|English]] and partly Irish, in use by the [[Irish Traveller]]s.

==Linguistic structure==
The features most unfamiliar to English speakers of the language are the [[orthography]], the [[initial consonant mutation]]s, the [[Verb Subject Object]] word order, and the use of two different forms for &quot;to be&quot;. However, initial mutations are found in other [[Celtic languages]] as well as in some [[Italian language|Italian]] and Sardinian dialects, as an independent development. They are also found in some West [[African languages]].

===Syntax===
''See main article [[Irish syntax]]''

One aspect of Irish syntax that is unfamiliar to speakers of other languages is the use of the [[copula]] (known in Irish as ''an chopail''). The copula is used to describe what or who someone is, as opposed to how and where. This has been likened to the difference between the verbs ''ser'' and ''estar'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], although this is only a rough approximation. The copula, which in the present tense is ''is'', is usually demonstrative:

:''Is fear é.'' &quot;It is a man.&quot;
:''Is Sasanaigh iad.'' &quot;They're English.&quot;

When saying &quot;this is&quot;, or &quot;that is&quot;, ''seo'' and ''sin'' are used:

:''Seo í mo mháthair.'' &quot;This is my mother.&quot;
:''Sin é an muinteoir.'' &quot;That's the teacher.&quot;

One can also add &quot;that is in him/her/it&quot;, especially when using an adjective, when it is desired to emphasise the quality: 

:''Is fear láidir atá '''ann'''.'' &quot;He's a strong man.&quot; 
:(Literally: &quot;It is a strong man that is in him.&quot;)  

:''Is cailín álainn atá '''inti'''.'' &quot;She's a beautiful girl.&quot;
:(Literally: &quot;It is a beautiful girl that is in her.&quot;)

This sometimes appears in [[Hiberno-English]], either translated literally as &quot;that is in it&quot;, or as &quot;so it is&quot;.

===Morphology===
''See main articles [[Irish morphology]], [[Irish nominals]], and [[Irish verbs]].''

Another feature of Irish grammar that is shared with other Celtic languages is the use of prepositional pronouns (''forainmneacha réamhfhoclacha''), which are essentially conjugated prepositions. For example, the word for &quot;at&quot; is ''ag'', which in the first person singular becomes '''agam''' &quot;at me&quot;. When used with the verb ''bí'' (&quot;to be&quot;) ''ag'' indicates possession; this is the equivalent of the English verb &quot;to have&quot;.

{|cellspacing=&quot;7&quot;
|''Tá leabhar '''agam'''''.||&quot;I have a book.&quot;||(Literally, &quot;is a book at me&quot;)
|-
|''Tá deoch '''agat'''''.||&quot;You have a drink.&quot;
|-
|''Tá ríomhaire '''aige'''''.||&quot;He has a computer.&quot;
|-
|''Tá páiste '''aici'''''.||&quot;She has a child.&quot;
|-
|''Tá carr '''againn'''''.||&quot;We have a car.&quot;
|-
|''Tá teach '''agaibh'''''.||&quot;You (plural) have a house.&quot;
|-
|''Tá airgead '''acu'''''.||&quot;They have money.&quot;
|}

Compare with [[Breton language|Breton]]:

{|cellspacing=&quot;7&quot;
|''Ul levr a zo '''ganin'''''.||&quot;I have a book.&quot;
|-
|''Ur banne a zo '''ganit'''''.||&quot;You have a drink.&quot;||('Banne' related to the Irish 'bainne' - milk - though semantically drifted)
|-
|''Un urzhiataer a zo '''gantañ'''''.||&quot;He has a computer.&quot;
|-
|''Ur bugel a zo '''ganti'''''.||&quot;She has a child.&quot;||('Bugel' related to Irish word &quot;buachail&quot; - boy - though semantically drifted)
|-
|''Ur c'harr a zo '''ganimp'''''.||&quot;We have a car.&quot;
|-
|''Un ti a zo '''ganeoc'h'''''.||&quot;You (plural) have a house.&quot;
|-
|''Arc'hant a zo '''ganto'''''.||&quot;They have money.&quot;
|}

===Orthography and pronunciation===
''See main articles [[Irish orthography]] and [[Irish phonology]].''

The written language looks rather daunting to those unfamiliar with it. Once understood, the orthography is relatively straightforward. The [[acute accent]], or ''síneadh fada'' (´), serves to lengthen the sound of the vowels and in some cases also changes their quality. For example, in Munster Irish (Kerry), ''a'' is {{IPA|/ʌ/}} or {{IPA|/ɑ/}} and ''á'' is {{IPA|/ɔ/}} in &quot;law&quot; but in Ulster Irish (Donegal), ''á'' tends to be {{IPA|/ɑː/}}. 

Around the time of [[World War II]], [[Séamas Daltún]], in charge of Rannóg an Aistriúcháin (the official translations department of the Irish government), issued his own guidelines about how to standardise Irish spelling and grammar. This de facto standard was subsequently approved of by the State and called the Official Standard or ''Caighdeán Oifigiúil''. It simplified and standardised the orthography. Many words had silent letters removed and vowel combination brought closer to the spoken language. Where multiple versions existed in different dialects for the same word, one or more were selected.

Examples:
* ''Gaedhealg / Gaedhilg(e) / Gaedhealaing / Gaeilic / Gaelainn / Gaoidhealg / Gaolainn'' =&gt;  ''Gaeilge'', &quot;Irish language&quot; (''Gaoluinn'' or ''Gaolainn'' is still used in books written in dialect by Munster authors, or as a facetious name for the Munster dialect)
* ''Lughbhaidh''  =&gt;  ''Lú'', &quot;Louth&quot;
* ''biadh''  =&gt;  ''bia'', &quot;food&quot; (The orthography ''biadh'' is still used by the speakers of those dialects that show a meaningful and audible difference between ''biadh'' - nominative case - and ''bídh'' - genitive case: &quot;of food, food's&quot;. For example, in Munster Irish the latter ends in an audible -g sound, because final ''-idh, -igh'' regularly delenites to ''-ig'' in Munster pronunciation.)

Modern Irish has only one [[diacritic]] sign, the acute (á é í ó ú), known in Irish as the ''síneadh fada'' 'long mark', plural ''sínte fada''. In English, this is frequently referred to as simply the ''fada'', where the adjective is used as a noun. The dot-above diacritic, called a ''ponc séimhithe'' or ''sí buailte'' (often shortened to ''buailte''), derives from the ''punctum delens'', which was used in medieval manuscripts to indicate deletion, similar to crossing out unwanted words in handwriting today. From this usage it was used to indicate the [[lenition]] of ''s'' (from /s/ to /h/) and ''f'' (from /f/ to zero) in [[Old Irish]] texts. Lenition of ''c'', ''p'', and ''t'' was indicated by placing the letter ''h'' after the affected consonant; lenition of other sounds was left unmarked. Later both methods were extended to be indicators of lenition of any sound except ''l'' and ''n'', and two competing systems were used: lenition could be marked by a ''buailte'' or by a postposed ''h''. Eventually, use of the ''buailte'' predominated when texts were writing using Gaelic letters, while the ''h'' predominated when writing using Roman letters. Today Gaelic letters and the ''buailte'' are rarely used except where a 'traditional' style is required, e.g. the motto on the [[University College Dublin]] [[coat-of-arms]]  or the symbol of the Irish Defence Forces, The [[Irish Defence Forces cap badge]] ''(Óglaiġ na h-Éireann)''. Letters with the ''buailte'' are available in [[Unicode]] and [[ISO 8859-14|Latin-8]] [[character set]]s (see Latin Extended Additional chart [http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1E00.pdf PDF]).

===Mutations===
''See main article [[Irish initial mutations]]''

In Irish, there are two classes of initial mutations:

* Lenition (in Irish, ''séimhiú'' &quot;softening&quot;) describes the change of stops into fricatives. Indicated in old orthography by a dot (called a sí buailte) written above the changed consonant, this is now shown by adding an extra -h-:
** ''caith!'' &quot;throw!&quot; - ''chaith mé'' &quot;I threw&quot; (this is an example of the lenition as a past-tense marker, which is caused by the use of ''do'', although this is now usually omitted)
** ''margadh'' &quot;market&quot;, &quot;market-place&quot;, &quot;bargain&quot; - ''Tadhg an mhargaidh'' &quot;the man of the street&quot; (word for word &quot;Timothy of the market-place&quot; (here we see the lenition marking the genitive case of a masculine noun)
** ''Seán'' &quot;Seán, John&quot; - ''a Sheáin!'' &quot;O John!&quot; (here we see lenition as part of what is called the vocative case - in fact, the vocative lenition is triggered by the ''a'' or vocative marker before ''Sheáin'')

* Nasalisation (in Irish, ''urú'' &quot;eclipsis&quot;) covers the voicing of voiceless stops, as well as the true nasalisation of voiced stops.
** ''athair'' &quot;father&quot; - ''ár nAthair'' &quot;our Father&quot;
** ''tús'' &quot;start&quot;, ''ar dtús'' &quot;at the start&quot;
** ''Gaillimh'' &quot;Galway&quot; - ''i nGaillimh'' &quot;in Galway&quot;

==History and politics==

===Stages of the Irish language===
The introduction of Irish to Ireland dates from some time after 1200 BC.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The earliest form of the language, [[Primitive Irish]], is found in [[ogham]] inscriptions up to about the [[4th century]]AD. After the conversion to [[Christianity]], [[Old Irish]] begins to appear as [[gloss]]es in the margins of [[Latin]] [[manuscripts]], beginning in the [[6th century]], until it gives way in the [[10th century]] to Middle Irish. Modern Irish dates from about the [[16th century]].

===Irish Language Movement===

The Irish language was the most widely spoken language on the island of Ireland until the 19th century. The first [[Bible]] in Irish was translated by William Bedell, [[Church of Ireland]] [[Bishop]] of [[Kilmore]], in the [[17th century]].Though its number of speakers has been in decline since the 19th century, it is an important part of [[Irish nationalist]] identity.

A combination of the introduction of a primary education system (the '[[National School]]s'), in which Irish was prohibited and only English taught by order of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British government]], and the [[Irish Potato Famine|Great Famine]] (''An Gorta Mór'') which hit a disportionately high number of Irish language speakers (who lived in the poorer areas heavily hit by famine deaths and emigration), hastened its rapid decline. Irish political leaders, such as [[Daniel O'Connell]] (Dónall Ó Conaill), too were critical of the language, seeing it as 'backward', with English the language of the future. Contemporary reports spoke of Irish-speaking parents actively discouraging their children from speaking the language, and encouraging the use of English instead. This practice continued long after independence, as the stigma of speaking Irish remained very strong. Despite the policy of successive Irish governments to promote the language the decline in the number of native speakers within the Gaeltacht has accelerated although the number of those elsewhere in the country able to speak it (as a second language) has increased albeit not to the extent that many hoped.

Some, however, thought differently. The initial moves to save the language were championed by Irish [[Protestants]], such as the linguist and clergyman [[William Neilson]], in the end of the eighteenth century; the major push occurred with the foundation by [[Douglas Hyde]], the son of a Church of Ireland rector, of the [[Gaelic League]] (known in Irish as ''Conradh na Gaeilge'') which started the [[Gaelic Revival]]. Leading supporters of Conradh included [[Patrick Pearse|Pádraig Mac Piarais]] and [[Eamon de Valera|Éamon de Valera]]. The revival of interest in the language coincided with other cultural revivals, such as the foundation of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] and the growth in the performance of plays about Ireland in English, by such luminaries as [[William Butler Yeats]], [[J.M. Synge]], [[Sean O'Casey]] and [[Lady Gregory]], with their launch of the [[Abbey Theatre]].  

Even though the Abbey Theatre playwrights wrote in English (and indeed some disliked Irish) the Irish language affected them, as it did all Irish English speakers. The version of English spoken in Ireland, known as [[Hiberno-English]] bears striking similarities in some grammatical idioms with Irish. Some have speculated that even after the vast majority of Irish people stopped speaking Irish, they perhaps subsconsciously used its grammatical flair in the manner in which they spoke English. This fluency is reflected in the writings of Yeats, [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Oscar Wilde]] and more recently in the writings of [[Seamus Heaney]], [[Paul Durcan]], [[Dermot Bolger]] and many others.  (It may also in part explain the appeal in Britain of Irish-born broadcasters like [[Terry Wogan]], [[Eamonn Andrews]], [[Graham Norton]], [[Desmond Lynam]], etc.)

This national cultural revival of the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century matched the growing Irish radicalism in Irish politics. Many of those, such as Pearse, de Valera, [[W.T. Cosgrave]] (Liam Mac Cosguir) and [[Ernest Blythe]] (Earnán de Blaghd), who fought to achieve Irish independence and came to govern the independent Irish state, first became politically aware through Conradh na Gaeilge, though Hyde himself resigned from its presidency in 1915 in protest at the movement's growing politicisation.

A Church of Ireland campaign to promote worship and religion in Irish was started in [[1914]] with the founding of ''Cumann Gaelach na hEaglaise'' (the Irish Guild of the Church). The [[Roman Catholic]] Church also replaced its liturgies in [[Latin]] with Irish and English for their liturgies following the [[Second Vatican Council]] in the [[1960s]].

===Independent Ireland and the language===
The independent Irish state was established in 1922  ([[The Irish Free State]] 1922-37; [[Éire|Ireland (Éire)]] from [[1937]], also known since [[1949]] as the [[Republic of Ireland]]). Although some [[Irish republicanism|Republican]] leaders had been committed language enthusiasts, the new state continued to use English as the language of administration, even in areas where over 80% of the population spoke Irish. The government refused to implement the 1926 recommendations of the Gaeltacht Commission, which included restoring Irish as the language of administration in such areas. As the role of the state grew, it therefore exerted tremendous pressure on Irish-speakers to speak English. This was only partly offset by measures which were supposed to support the Irish language. For instance, the state was by far the largest employer. A qualification in Irish was required to apply for state jobs. However, this did not require a high level of fluency, and few public employees were ever required to use Irish in the course of their work. On the other hand, state employees had to have perfect command of English and had to use it conss retain a large number of features present in proto-Inuit language and in Yup'ik, enough so that they might be classed as Yup'ik languages if they were viewed in isolation from the larger Inuit world.

==Geographic distribution and variants==
[[Image:Inuktitut dialect map.png|thumb|right|Distribution of Inuit language variants across the Arctic.]]The Inuit language is a fairly closely linked set of dialects which can be broken up using a number of different criteria.  Traditionally, Inuit describe dialect differences by means of place names to describe local idiosyncracies in language: The dialect of [[Iglulik]] versus the dialect of [[Iqaluit]], for example.  However, political and sociological divisions are increasingly the principal criteria for describing different variants of the Inuit language because of their links to different writing systems, literary traditions, schools, media sources and borrowed vocabulary.  This makes any partition of the Inuit language somewhat problematic.  This article will use labels that try to synthesise linguistic, sociolinguistic and political considerations in splitting up the Inuit dialect spectrum.  This scheme is not the only one used or necessarily one used by Inuit themselves, but its labels do try to reflect the usages most seen in popular and technical literature.

In addition to the territories listed below, some 7,000 Greenlandic speakers are reported to live in mainland [[Denmark]] [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=kal], and according to the 2001 census roughly 200 self-reported Inuktitut native speakers regularly live in parts of [[Canada]] which are outside of traditional Inuit lands.

===Alaska===
''See ''[[Inupiatun]]'' and ''[[Qawiaraq]]'' for more information.''

Of the roughly 13,000 Alaskan [[Inupiat]], as few as 3,000 may still be able to speak Inuit language variants, with most of them over the age of 40. [http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/langs/i.html]  Alaskan Inuit speak at least two fairly distinct dialects: 

*'''[[Qawiaraq]]''' is spoken on the southern side of the [[Seward Peninsula]] and the [[Norton Sound]] area. It was also in the past spoken in [[Chukotka]], particularly [[Diomede Islands|Big Diomede island]], but appears to have vanished in [[Russia]]n areas through assimilation into [[Yupik]], [[Chukchi]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] speaking communities.  It is radically different in phonology from other Inuit language variants.  Some people consider the '''[[Bering Strait]]''' dialect to be separate from Qawariaq. 
*'''[[Inupiatun]]''' is spoken in [[North Slope]] and the [[Kotzebue Sound]] area.  The variants of the [[Kotzebue Sound]] area and the northwest of Alaska are sometimes called '''Malimiutun''' or '''Malimiut Inupiatun'''.  However, despite significant differences in phonology, Malimiutun is readily comprehensible to other Alaskan [[Inupiat]]. [http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/langs/i.html]

===Canada===
''See ''[[Inuktitut]]'' for more information.''

The Inuit language is an official language in the [[Northwest Territories]], the official and dominant language of [[Nunavut]], enjoys a high level of official support in [[Nunavik]], a semi-autonomus portion of [[Quebec]], and is still spoken in some parts of [[Labrador]].  Generally, Canadians refer to all dialects spoken in Canada as ''[[Inuktitut]]'', but the terms ''[[Inuvialuktun]]'', ''[[Inuinnaqtun]]'' and ''[[Labradorimiutut]]'' have some currency in referring to the variants of specific areas.

===Greenland===
''See ''[[Kalaallisut]]'' for more information.''

[[Greenland]] counts approximately 50,000 speakers of Inuit language variants, of whom over 90% speak west Greenlandic dialects at home.
*'''[[Kalaallisut]]''', or in English '''Greenlandic''', is the name given to the standard dialect and official language of Greenland. This standard national language is now taught to all Greenlanders in school, regardless of their native dialect. It reflects almost exclusively the language of western Greenland and has borrowed a great deal of vocabulary from [[Danish language|Danish]], while Canadian and Alaskan Inuit language variants have tended to take vocabulary from [[English language|English]] or sometimes [[French language|French]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].  It is written using the Roman alphabet.  The dialect of the [[Upernavik]] area in northwest Greenland is somewhat different in phonology from the standard dialect. 
*'''Tunumiit oraasiat''', (or '''Tunumiisut''' in Kalaallisut, often '''[[East Greenlandic]]''' in other languages), is the dialect of eastern Greenland.  It differs sharply from other Inuit language variants and has roughly 3,000 speakers according to [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=kal Ethnologue].
*'''Avanersuaq''' is the dialect of the area around [[Qaanaaq]] in  northern Greenland.  It is sometimes called the '''Thule''' dialect or '''North Greenlandic'''.  This area is the northernmost settlement area of the Inuit and has a relatively small number of speakers.  It is reputed to be fairly close to the North Baffin dialect, since a group of migratory Inuit from [[Baffin Island]] settled in the area during the [[19th century|19th]] and early [[20th century|20th centuries]].  It counts under 1,000 speakers according to [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=kal Ethnologue].

==Phonology and Phonetics==
''See main article ''[[Inuit language phonology and phonetics]]''.''

Eastern Canadian Inuit language variants have fifteen [[consonant]]s and three [[vowel]]s (which can be long or short). 

Consonants are arranged with five [[place of articulation|places of articulation]]: [[bilabial]], [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]], [[palatal]], [[velar]] and [[uvular]]; and three [[manner of articulation|manners of articulation]]: voiceless [[Stop consonant|stop]]s, voiced [[continuant]]s and [[nasals]], as well as two additional sounds — voiceless [[Fricative consonant|fricative]]s.  The Alaskan dialects have an additional manner of articulation, the ''[[retroflex]]'', which was present in proto-Inuit language.  Retroflexes have disappeared in all the Canadian and Greenlandic dialects, except for the phoneme /{{IPA|[[Voiced palatal plosive|ɟ]]}}/ in Natsilingmiutut, which derives from a former retroflex.

Almost all Inuit language variants have only three basic vowels and make a phonological distinction between short and long forms of all vowels.  The only exceptions are at the extreme edges of the Inuit world - parts of Greenland, and in western Alaska.

==Morphology and syntax==
''See ''[[Inuit language morphology and syntax]]'' for a more detailed description specific to Nunavut Inuktitut.''

The Inuit language, like other [[Eskimo-Aleut]] languages, has a very rich morphological system, in which a succession of different [[morpheme]]s are added to root words (like verb endings in foreign European languages) to indicate things that, in languages like English, would require serveral words to express.  (See also: [[Agglutinative language]] and [[Polysynthetic language]])  All Inuit language words begin with a root morpheme to which other morphemes are suffixed.  The language has hundreds of distinct suffixes, in some dialects as many as 700.  Fortunately for the learners, the language has a highly regular morphology.  Although the rules are sometimes very complicated, they do not have exceptions in the sense that English and other [[Indo-European languages]] do.

This system makes words very long, and potentially unique.  For example in central [[Nunavut]] [[Inuktitut]]:

:'''tusaatsiarunnanngittualuujunga'''
:''I can't hear very well.''

This long word is composed of a root word '''tusaa-''' - ''to hear'' - followed by five suffixes:

:&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;-tsiaq-&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;well&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;-junnaq-&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;be able to&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;-nngit-&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;not&lt;td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;-tualuu-&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;very much&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;-junga&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;1st pers. singular present indicative non-specific&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

This sort of word construction is pervasive in Inuit language and makes it very unlike English,  In one large Canadian corpus - the ''[[Nunavut]] [[Hansard]]'' - 92% of all words appear only once, in contrast to a small percentage in most English corpora of similar size.  This makes the application of [[Zipf's law]] quite difficult in the Inuit language.  Furthermore, the notion of a [[part of speech]] can be somewhat complicated in the Inuit language.  Fully inflected verbs can be interpreted as nouns.  The word '''ilisaijuq''' can be interpreted as a fully inflected verb - &quot;he studies&quot; - but can also be interpreted as a noun: &quot;student&quot;.  That said, the meaning is probably obvious to a fluent speaker, when put in context.

The morphology and syntax of the Inuit language vary to some degree between dialects, and the article ''[[Inuit language morphology and syntax]]'' describes primarily central [[Nunavut]] dialects, but the basic principles will generally apply to all of them and to some degree to [[Yupik]] as well.

==Vocabulary==
===Toponymy and Names===
Exotic as traditional Inuit names sound, both the names of places and people tend to be highly prosaic when translated.  ''[[Iqaluit]]'', for example, is simply the plural of the noun ''iqaluk'' - &quot;fish&quot;.  ''[[Iglulik]]'' simply means ''place with houses'', a word that could be interpreted as simply ''town''; ''[[Inuvik]]'' is ''place of people''; ''[[Baffin Island]]'' - ''Qikiqtaaluk'' in Inuit language - approximately translates to &quot;big island&quot;.

Although practically all Inuit have legal names based on southern naming traditions, at home and among themselves they still use native naming traditions.  There too, names tend to consist of highly prosaic words.  The Inuit traditionally believed that by adopting the name of a dead person or a class of things, they could take some of their characteristics or powers, and enjoy a part of their identity.  (This is why they were always very willing to accept European names - they believed that this made them equal to the Europeans.) 

Common native names in Canada include &quot;Ujaraq&quot; (rock), &quot;Nuvuk&quot; (headland), &quot;Nasak&quot; (hat, or hood), &quot;Tupiq&quot; (tent), and &quot;Qajaq&quot; ([[kayak]]).  Inuit also use animal names, traditionally believing that by using those names, they took on some of the characteristics of that animal: &quot;Nanuq&quot; (polar-bear), &quot;Uqalik&quot; (Arctic hare), and &quot;Tiriaq&quot; (ermine) are favourites.  In other cases, Inuit are named after dead people or people in traditional tales, by naming them after anatomical traits those people are believed to have had.  Examples include &quot;Itigaituk&quot; (has no feet), &quot;Usuiituk&quot; (has no penis), and &quot;Tulimak&quot; (rib).  Inuit may have any number of names, given by parents and other community members.

===Words for snow===
''See a more thorough discussion at ''[[Eskimo words for snow]]''.''

A [[urban myth|popular belief]] exists that the Inuit have an unusually large number of words for [[snow]]. This is not accurate, and results from a misunderstanding of the nature of polysynthetic languages. In fact, The Inuit have only a few base roots for snow: 'qanniq-' ('qanik-' in some dialects), which is used most often like the verb ''to snow'', and 'aput', which means ''snow'' as a substance. Parts of speech work very differently in the Inuit language than in English, so these definitions are somewhat misleading.

The Inuit language can form very long words by adding more and more descriptive affixes to words.  Those affixes may modify the syntactic and semantic properties of the base word, or may add qualifiers to it in much the same way that [[English language|English]] uses adjectives or prepositional phrases to qualify nouns (eg. &quot;falling snow&quot;, &quot;blowing snow&quot;, &quot;snow on the ground&quot;, &quot;snow drift&quot;, etc.)

The &quot;fact&quot; that there are many Inuit words for snow has been put forward so often it is somewhat of a journalistic [[cliché]] (as evidenced by [http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~pullum/eskimo_quotes.html a collection of quotes from linguist Mark Liberman]).

==Writing==
Because the Inuit language is spread over such a large area, divided between different nations and political units and originally reached by Europeans of different origins at different times, there is no uniform way of writing the Inuit language.  Most Inuktitut in Nunavut and Nunavik is written using a scheme called [[Inuktitut syllabics]], based on [[Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics]].  The western part of Nunavut and the [[Northwest Territories]] use a Roman alphabet scheme usually identified as [[Inuinnaqtun]].  In [[Alaska]], another Roman scheme is used.  [[Nunatsiavut]] uses another variant devised by German-speaking [[Moravian]] missionaries, which included the letter [[Kra (letter)|''kra'']].  Greenland's Roman scheme was originally much like the one used in Nunatsiavut, but has been reformed and modified in recent years. &lt;!-- more to follow --&gt;

===The Canadian syllabary===
''See [[Inuktitut syllabics]] for more information.''

[[Image:Inuktitut.png|framed|right|The syllabary used to write Inuktitut (titirausiq nutaaq). The extra characters with the dots represent long vowels; in the Latin transcription, the vowel would be doubled.]]The Inuktitut syllabary used in Canada is based on the [[Cree]] syllabary devised by the missionary [[James Evans]]. The present form of the syllabary for Canadian Inuktitut was adopted by the [[Inuit Cultural Institute]] in Canada in the [[1970s]].  The Inuit in Alaska, the [[Inuvialuit]], Inuinnaqtun speakers, and Inuit in [[Greenland]] and [[Labrador]] use the Roman alphabet, although it has been adapted for their use in different ways.

Though conventionally called a [[syllabary]], the writing system has been classified by some observers as an [[abugida]], since syllables starting with the same consonant have related [[glyph]]s rather than unrelated ones.

All of the characters needed for the Inuktitut syllabary are available in the [[Unicode]] character repertoire. (See [[Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics character table]].)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:IbnBattuta.jpg|thumb|Ibn Battuta (1304&amp;ndash;1377).]]
'''Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Battuta''' ([[Arabic]]: '''أبو عبد الله محمد ابن بطوطة''') (born [[February 24]], [[1304]]; year of death uncertain, possibly [[1368]] or [[1377]]) was born in [[Tangier]], [[Morocco]] during the time of [[Merinid dynasty|Merinid Sultanate]] rule in the [[Islamic calendar]] year 703, into a [[Berber]] family. He was a [[Sunni Islam]]ic scholar and [[Jurisprudence|jurisprudent]] from the [[Maliki]] [[Madhhab]] (a school of [[Fiqh]], or Sunni Islamic law), and at times a [[Qadi]] or judge. However, he is best known as an extensive traveller or [[exploration|explorer]], whose account documents his travels and side-excursions over a period of almost thirty years, covering some 73,000 miles (117,000 km). This journeying covered almost the entirety of the known Islamic world, extending also to present-day [[India]], the [[Maldives]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[China]], a distance readily surpassing that of his prior, near-contemporary and traveller [[Marco Polo]].

At the instigation of the Sultan of Morocco, [[Abu Inan Faris]], several years after his return Ibn Battuta dictated an account of his journeys to a scholar named [[Ibn Juzayy]], whom he had met while in [[Granada]]. This account, recorded by Ibn Juzayy and interspersed with the latter's own comments is the primary source of information for his adventures. The title of this initial manuscript may be translated as ''A Gift to Those Who Contemplate the Wonders of Cities and the Marvels of Travelling'', but is often simply referred to as the ''Rihla'', or &quot;Journey&quot;. Whilst apparently fictional in places, the ''Rihla'' still gives as complete an account as exists of some parts of the world in the [[14th century]].

Almost all that is known about Ibn Battuta's life comes from one source &amp;ndash; Ibn Battuta himself (via Ibn Juzayy). In places the things he claims he saw or did are probably fanciful, but in many others there is no way to know whether he is reporting or story-telling. The following account assumes the latter where it is not obviously the former.

==The Hajj (with detours)==
Born in [[Tangier]], [[Morocco]] some time between [[1304]] and [[1307]], at the age of (approximately) twenty Ibn Battuta went on a ''[[hajj]]'' &amp;ndash; a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]. Once done, however, he continued travelling, eventually covering about 75,000 miles over the length and breadth of the Muslim world, and beyond (about 44 modern countries). Batutta started his journeys in [[1325]]. 

His journey to Mecca was by land, and followed the North African coast of the [[Maghreb]] region quite closely until he reached [[Cairo]]. At this point he was within [[Mameluk]] territory, which was relatively safe, and he embarked on the first of his detours. Three commonly used routes existed to Mecca, and Ibn Battuta chose the least-travelled: a journey up the Nile, then east by land to the Red Sea port of [[Aydhad|'Aydhad]]. However, upon approaching that city he was forced to turn back due to a local rebellion.

Returning to Cairo he took a second side trip, to [[Damascus]] (then also controlled by the Mameluks), having encountered a holy man during his first trip who prophesied that Ibn Battuta would only reach Mecca after a journey through [[Syria]]. An additional advantage to the side journey was that other holy places were along the route &amp;ndash; [[Hebron]], [[Jerusalem]], and [[Bethlehem]], for example &amp;ndash; and the Mameluke authorities put special effort into keeping the journey safe for pilgrims.

After spending [[Ramadan]] in Damascus, Ibn Battuta joined up with a caravan travelling the 800 miles from Damascus to [[Medina]], burial place of [[Muhammad]]. After four days, he then journeyed on to Mecca. There he completed the usual rituals of a Muslim pilgrim, and having graduated to the status of ''[[al-Hajji]]'' as a result, now faced his return home. Upon reflection, he decided to continue journeying instead. His next destination was the [[Il-Khanate]] in modern-day [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]].

==To Iran and the Silk Roads==
Once again hooking up with a caravan he crossed the border into [[Mesopotamia]] and visited [[al-Najaf]], the burial place of the fourth Caliph [[Ali ibn Abi Talib|Ali]]. From there he journeyed to [[Basra]], then [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], which was only a few decades away from being nearly destroyed by [[Timur]]. Next were [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]] and [[Baghdad]], the latter of which was in bad shape after [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|being sacked]] by [[Hulagu Khan]].

There he met [[Abu Said|Abu Sa'id]], the last ruler of the unified Il-Khanate. Ibn Battuta travelled with the royal caravan for a while, then turned north to [[Tabriz]] on the [[Silk Road]]. The first major city in the region to open its gates to the [[Mongols]], it had become an important trading centre after most of its nearby rivals were razed.

==Second Hajj and East Africa==
After this trip, Ibn Battuta returned to Mecca for a second ''[[hajj]]'', and lived there for a year before embarking on a second great trek, this time down the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Eastern African]] coast. His first major stop was [[Aden]], where his intention was to make his fortune as a trader of the goods that flowed into the Arabian Peninsula from around the [[Indian Ocean]]. Before doing so, however, he determined to have one last adventure, and signed on for a trip down the coast of [[Africa]].

Spending about a week in each of his destinations, he visited [[Ethiopia]], [[Mogadishu, Somalia|Mogadishu]], [[Mombasa]], [[Zanzibar]], and [[Kilwa]], among others. With the change of the monsoon, he and the ship he was aboard then returned to south Arabia. Having completed his final adventure before settling down, he then immediately decided to go visit [[Oman]] and the [[Straits of Hormuz]]. This done, he journeyed to Mecca again. 

==Turkey and India==
Spending another year there, he then resolved to seek employment with the Muslim [[Sultanate of Delhi|Sultan of]] [[Delhi]]. Needing a guide and translator if he was to travel there, he went to [[Anatolia]], then under the control of the [[Seljuk Turks]], to join up with one of the caravans that went from there to [[India]]. A sea voyage from Damascus on a Genoese ship landed him in [[Alanya]] on the southern coast of modern-day [[Turkey]]. From there he travelled by land to [[Konya]] and then [[Sinope]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast.

Crossing the Black Sea, Ibn Battuta landed in Caffa (now [[Theodosia]]), in the Crimea, and entered the lands of the [[Golden Horde]].  There he bought a wagon and fortuitously joined the caravan of [[Ozbeg]], the Golden Horde's Khan, on a journey as far as [[Astrakhan]] on the [[Volga River]].

Upon reaching Astrakhan, the Khan allowed one of his pregnant wives to go give birth back in her home city &amp;ndash; [[Constantinople]]. It is perhaps of no surprise to the reader that Ibn Battuta talked his way into this expedition, hisise informations and techniques.&quot; (1386)

The English word was apparently derived by adding the common &quot;noun of action&quot; ending &quot;''-ation''&quot; (descended through French from Latin &quot;''-tio''&quot;) to the earlier verb ''to inform'', in the sense of to give form to the mind, to discipline, instruct, teach: &quot;Men so wise should go and inform their kings.&quot; (1330)  ''Inform'' itself comes (via French) from the Latin verb ''informare'', to give form to, to form an idea of. Furthermore, Latin itself already even contained the word ''informatio'' meaning concept or idea, but the extent to which this may have influenced the development of the word ''information'' in English is unclear.

As a final note, the ancient Greek word for ''form'' was eidos, and this word was famously used in a technical philosophical sense by [[Plato]] (and later Aristotle) to denote the ideal identity or essence of something (see [[The Forms]]).

== Information is not data ==
The words, ''information'' and ''[[data]]'', are used interchangeably in many contexts.  This may lead to their confusion.  However, they are not synonyms. 

Often data is defined as raw facts while information is processed data (as is the case in most of the article below). Another distinction that is made is that information is the things that we know and data is the representation of the information. As an example, we may be thinking about a favorite niece's age, who is four. We would tend to represent that with Arabic numerals (4), but we could represent it using Roman numerals (IV), tick marks (||||), or any other way we agree on. The information has not changed in each case, although the data has. Note that we tend to think of information in terms of declarative [[knowledge]]. That is, the facts we know such as a temperature, an age, etc. Information can also be skills and things we know how to do, which is called procedural knowledge.

An important consequence of this distinction is that information has [[meaning]] (i.e.: can inform), while data does not. Computers work with data (representations) and not information (meanings). This is why a computer will calculate the average employee number even though it is meaningless.

Note that one person's information may be another's data depending on whether the recipient understand the data (or its context). Also, when someone (or some&lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt;, such as a [[computer system]]) is given a fact, it may only be data, but when they make sense of (or interpret) it, often by bringing it together with other facts, it may become information.

Information is usually thought of as, in a strict sense, a subset of data.  However, sometimes the reverse interpretation can be taken (such as describing data as &quot;raw information&quot;).  Data may also have a more specific sense in some fields (e.g.: referring to a certain type or set of &lt;em&gt;information&lt;/em&gt; used in that context).   When used pragmatically in everyday speech, it usually specifically refers to collections of numbers, or, in a wider sense, to any content not of relevance or interest to the speaker, or not (yet) understood by the speaker themselves in particular.

Data is unstructured, lacks context and may not be relevant to the recipient. When data is correctly organized, filtered and presented with context it can become information because it then has &quot;value&quot; to the recipient.&lt;!-- rm? --&gt;

Data which is not information (i.e.: has not yet informed or been given a context) is often called '''raw data'''.

'''Indigo''' is the color of [[light]] between 440 to 420 [[nanometre]]s in [[wavelength]], placing it between [[blue]] and [[violet (color)|violet]]. Like many other colors ([[Orange (colour)|orange]] and [[violet (color)|violet]] are the most well-known), it gets its name from an object in the natural world - the plant named ''[[indigo plant|indigo]]'' once used for dyeing cloth (see also [[Indigo dye]]). 

Indigo is neither an additive [[primary color]] nor a subtractive primary color. It was named and defined by [[Isaac Newton]] when he divided up the [[optical spectrum]] (which is a continuum of frequencies). He named [[seven]] colors specifically to link them with the (known) [[planet]]s, [[day]]s of the [[week]], and other lists that had seven items. 

The [[human]] [[eye]] is relatively insensitive to indigo's frequencies, and some otherwise well-sighted people cannot distinguish indigo from blue and violet. For this reason some commentators including [[Isaac Asimov]] have suggested that indigo should not be regarded as a color in its own right but merely as a shade of blue or violet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:'' '''IMF''' redirects here. For other meanings of IMF see [[IMF (disambiguation)]] ''

[[Image:imf_logo.png|thumb|180px|right|The logo of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)]]
The '''International Monetary Fund''' ('''IMF''') is the [[international organization]] entrusted with overseeing the [[global financial system]] by monitoring [[exchange rate]]s and [[balance of payments]], as well as offering technical and financial assistance when asked.

== Organization and purpose ==
The IMF describes itself as &quot;an organization of 184 countries, working to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty&quot;. With the exception of  [[North Korea]], [[Cuba]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Andorra]], [[Monaco]], [[Tuvalu]] and [[Nauru]], all UN member states either participate directly in the IMF or are represented by other member states.

In the 1930s, as economic activity in the major industrial countries dwindled, countries started adopting [[mercantilist]] practices, attempting to defend their economies by increasing restrictions on imports.  To conserve dwindling reserves of gold and foreign exchange, some countries curtailed foreign imports, some devalued their currencies, and some introduced complicated restrictions on foreign exchange accounts held by their citizens. These measures were arguably detrimental to the countries themselves as the [[David Ricardo|Ricardian]] [[comparative advantage]] states that everyone gains from trade without restrictions.  It is noteworthy to mention that, although the &quot;size of the pie&quot; is enhanced according to this theory of free trade, when distributional concerns are taken into account, there are always industries that benefit while others lose out.  World trade declined sharply, as did [[employment]] and [[living standards]] in many countries.

As [[World War II]] came to a close, the leading allied countries considered various plans to restore order to international monetary relations, and at the [[Bretton Woods]] conference the IMF emerged. The founding members drafted a charter (or Articles of Agreement) of an international institution to oversee the international monetary system and to promote both the elimination of exchange restrictions relating to trade in goods and services, and the stability of exchange rates.

The IMF came into existence in December 1945, when the first 29 countries signed its Articles of Agreement.  The statutory purposes of the IMF today are the same as when they were formulated in 1944 (see Box 2). From the end of World War II until the late-1970s, the capitalist world experienced unprecedented growth in [[real income]]s. (Since then, [[China]]'s integration into the capitalist system has added substantially to the growth of the system.) Within the capitalist system, the benefits of growth have not flowed equally to all (either within or among nations) but most capitalist countries have seen recent increases in prosperity that contrast starkly with the conditions within capitalist countries during the interwar period.  The lack of a recurring global depression is likely due to improvements in the conduct of international economic policies that have encouraged the growth of international trade and helped smooth the economic cycle of boom and bust.

In the decades since World War II, apart from rising prosperity, the world economy and monetary system have undergone other major changes that have increased the importance and relevance of the purposes served by the IMF, but that has also required the IMF to adapt and reform. Rapid advances in technology and communications have contributed to the increasing international integration of markets and to closer linkages among national economies. As a result, financial crises, when they erupt, now tend to spread more rapidly among countries.

The IMF's influence in the global economy steadily increased as it accumulated more members. The number of IMF member countries has more than quadrupled from the 44 states involved in its establishment, reflecting in particular the attainment of political independence by many developing countries and more recently the collapse of the Soviet bloc.  The expansion of the IMF's membership, together with the changes in the world economy, have required the IMF to adapt in a variety of ways to continue serving its purposes effectively.

== History == 
Agreement for the creation of the International Monetary Fund came at the [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference]]{{mn|footnote_1|1}} in [[Bretton Woods, New Hampshire]], [[United States]], on [[July 22]], [[1944]]. The principal architects of the IMF at the conference were British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] and the chief international economist at the [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Treasury Department]], [[Harry Dexter White]]. The [[Articles of Agreement]]{{mn|footnote_2|2}} came into force on [[December 27]], [[1945]], the organization came into existence on [[May 1]], [[1946]], as part of a post-[[World War II|WWII]] reconstruction plan, and it began financial operations on [[March 1]], [[1947]].

It is sometimes referred to as &quot;a Bretton Woods institution&quot;, along with the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (now part of the larger [[World Bank Group]]).

== Membership qualifications ==
A country may apply for membership of the IMF. The application will be considered, first, by the IMF's Executive Board. After its consideration, the Executive Board will submit a report to the Board of Governors of the IMF with recommendations in the form of a &quot;Membership Resolution.&quot; These recommendations cover the amount of [[quota]] in the IMF, the form of payment of the [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/aa/aa03.htm#1 subscription], and other customary terms and conditions of membership. After the Board of Governors has adopted the &quot;Membership Resolution,&quot; the applicant state needs to take the legal steps required under its own law to enable it to sign the IMF's Articles of Agreement and to fulfill the obligations of IMF membership. 

A member's quota in the IMF determines the amount of its subscription, its voting weight, its access to IMF financing, and its allocation of [[Special Drawing Rights|SDR]]s.

== Assistance and reforms ==
Part of its mission has become to provide assistance to countries that experience serious economic difficulties. Member states with [[balance of payments]] problems may request loans and/or organizational management of their national economies. In return, the countries are obliged to launch certain [[structural adjustment program|reforms]], an example of which is the &quot;[[Washington Consensus]]&quot;.

==Criticism ==   
The role of the two Bretton Woods institutions has been controversial to many since the late [[Cold War]] period. Critics claim that IMF policy makers deliberately supported capitalistic [[military dictatorship]]s friendly to American and European [[corporation]]s. Critics also claim that the IMF is generally [[apathetic]] or hostile to their views of [[democracy]], [[human rights]], and [[labor rights]].  These criticisms generated a controversy that helped spark the [[anti-globalization movement]]. Others claim the IMF has little power to democratize sovereign states, nor is that its stated objective: to advise and promote financial stability. Arguments in favor of the IMF say that economic stability is a precursor to democracy.

Two criticisms from economists have been that financial aid is always bound to so-called &quot;[[Conditionalities]]&quot;, including [[Structural Adjustment Program]]s. Conditionalities, it is claimed, retard social stability and hence inhibit the stated goals of the IMF.
   
Typically the IMF and its supporters advocate a [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] approach. As such, adherents of [[supply-side economics]] generally find themselves in open disagreement with the IMF. The IMF frequently advocates currency [[devaluation]], criticized by proponents of supply-side economics as [[inflation|inflationary]]. Secondly they link higher taxes under &quot;[[austerity]] programmes&quot; with [[economic contraction]].

Currency devaluation is recommended by the IMF to the governments of poor nations with struggling economies. Supply-side economists claim these Keynesian IMF policies are destructive to economic prosperity, although many other economists disagree.  

Complaints are also directed toward [[International Monetary Fund gold reserve]] being undervalued. At its inception in 1945, the IMF pegged gold at 35 dollars per [[troy weight|Troy ounce]] of gold. In 1973 the Nixon administration lifted the fixed asset value of gold in favour of a world market price.  Hence the fixed exchange rates of currencies tied to gold were switched to a [[floating rate]], also based on market price and exchange. This largely came about because ''[[Petrodollar]]s'' outside the United States were more than could be backed by the gold at [[Fort Knox]] under the fixed exchange rate system. The fixed rate system only served to limit the amount of assistance the organization could use to help debt-ridden countries.

That said, the IMF sometimes advocates &quot;austerity programmes,&quot; increasing [[tax|taxes]] even when the economy is weak, in order to generate government revenue and balance [[budget deficit]]s, which is the opposite of Keynesian policy. These policies were criticised by [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]], former chief economist at the World Bank, in his book [[Globalization and Its Discontents]]. He argued that by converting to a more Monetarist approach, the fund no longer had a valid purpose, as it was designed to provide funds for countries to carry out Keynesian reflations.

Most [[Alter-globalization|altermondialists]], like [[ATTAC]], believe that IMF interventions aggravate the [[poverty]] and [[debt]] of [[Third world|Third World]] and [[Developing nation|developing countries]]. According to the analysis by [[Yves Engler]], the IMF is considered to be responsible for worsening or actually creating [[famine]] in [[Malawi]] ([[2002]]), [[Ethiopia]] ([[2003]]) and [[Niger]] ([[2005]]). [http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=2&amp;ItemID=8494]
   
Opposition to the IMF is often fragmented. For instance, advocates of supply-side economics would generally regard the policies advocated by ATTAC to be little different in form to the ideas peddled by the IMF. In other words, they would see ATTAC ''tax-and-spend'' policies and the IMF's austerity policies as being fundamentally similar.   
   
[[Argentina]], which had been considered by the IMF to be a model country in its compliance to policy proposals by the Bretton Woods institutions, experienced a catastrophic economic crisis in [[2001]], generally believed to have been caused by IMF-induced budget restrictions &amp;mdash; which undercut the government's ability to sustain national infrastructure even in crucial areas such as health, education, and security &amp;mdash; and [[privatization]] of strategically vital national resources. The crisis added to widespread hatred of this institution in Argentina and other South American countries, with many blaming the IMF for the region's economic problems [http://www.serendipity.li/hr/imf_and_dollar_system.htm]. The current &amp;mdash; as of early 2006 &amp;mdash; trend towards moderate left-wing governments in the region and a growing concern with the development of a regional economic policy largely independent of big business pressures has been ascribed to this crisis. 

Another example of where IMF Structural Adjustment Programmes aggravated the problem was in [[Kenya]]. Before IMF got involved in the country, the Kenya central bank oversaw all currency movement in and out of the country. IMF mandated that Kenya central bank had to allow easier currency movement. However, the adjustment resulted in very little foreign investment, but allowed [[Kamlesh Manusuklal Damji Pattni]], with the help of corrupt government officials, to syphon out billions of Kenya shillings in what came to be known as the [[Goldenberg scandal]], leaving the country in a state worse than that which it was in before the IMF reforms were implemented.

That the IMF intervenes only in countries that experience years of dire economic conditions has certainly hurt its reputation.  The financial collapses it intervenes in are products of uneven capitalist development sometimes exacerbated by government mismanagement, but mismanagement is often cited by rich nations as the source of the financial crises.  These collapses tend to lead to years of economic difficulty that can be addressed in various ways, but IMF Stuctural Adjustment Policies consistently serve to open up or &quot;liberalize&quot; economies to foreign capital rather than provide for economic recovery through statist policies such as government financed projects to achieve full employment.  Thus, IMF policies further the notion that economic development in underdeveloped countries is dependent on attracting foreign investment rather than through a state-managed approach centered on full employment and progressive taxation.  It is also true that politicians have used the IMF as an easy target for blame when they themselves have erred, using nationalism to gain easy political points.

Overall the IMF success record is limited.  While it was created to help stabilize the global economy, since 1980 over 100 countries have experienced a banking collapse that reduced GDP by four percent or more --  far more than at any previous time in history.  The considerable delay in IMF response to a crisis, and the fact that it tends to only respond to rather than prevent them, has led many economists to argue for reform.

Whatever the feelings people in the Western world have for the IMF, research by the [[Pew Research Center]] shows that more than 60 percent of Asians and 70 percent of Africans feel that the IMF and the [[World Bank]] have a ''positive'' effect on their country [http://people-press.org/reports/pdf/185topline.pdf]. Such research has made proponents of IMF claim the IMF-critique misleading, as it would be difficult to speak of suffering if the sufferers dobe'' (used to form the [[passive voice]] and [[continuous aspect]]) both commonly appear in the infinitive: &quot;It's thought '''to have''' been a ceremonial site,&quot; or &quot;I want '''to be''' doing it already.&quot;

===Defective verbs===

The [[modal auxiliary verb]]s,  ''can'', ''may'', ''shall'', ''will'' and ''must'' are [[defective verb|defective]] in that they do not have infinitives; so, one cannot say, *''I want him to can do it'', but rather must say, ''I want him to be able to do it''. The circumlocutions ''to be able to'', ''to have to'' and ''to be going to'' are generally used in these cases.

== Germanic languages ==

The original Germanic suffix of the infinitive was ''-an'', with verbs derived from other words ending in ''-jan'' or ''-janan''. In [[German language|German]] it is ''-en'' (&quot;sagen&quot;), with ''-eln'' or ''-ern'' endings on a few words based on -l or -r roots (&quot;segeln&quot;, &quot;ändern&quot;); the use of ''zu'' with infinitives is less frequent than ''to'' in English. They can function as nouns, often expressing abstractions of the action, in which case they are of neuter gender: &quot;das Essen&quot; means the &quot;the eating&quot;, but also &quot;the food&quot;. In [[Dutch language|Dutch]] infinitives also end in ''-en'' (&quot;zeggen&quot; - to say), sometimes used with 'te' similar to English ''to'', e.g. &quot;Het is niet moeilijk te begrijpen&quot; -&gt; &quot;It is not difficult to understand&quot;. The few verbs with stems ending in -a have infinitives in -n (&quot;gaan&quot; - to go, &quot;slaan&quot; - to hit). In Scandinavian languages the ''n'' has dropped out and the infinitive suffix has been reduced to ''-e'' or ''-a''.

== Romance languages ==

Romance infinitives can be used in much the same way as the infinitive is used in English, and they can also sometimes function as masculine nouns. In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], infinitives mostly end in ''-ar'', ''-er'', or ''-ir''. A similar phenomenon also exists in [[French language|French]]: infinitives of verbs have the suffixes ''-er'', ''-ir'', ''-re'' or ''-oir''. [[Italian language|Italian]] follows a similar pattern, with its infinitives ending in ''-are'', ''-ere'', ''-ire'' or ''-urre''.

Formation of the infinitive in Romance languages reflects that of their ancestor, [[Latin]], in which a significant majority of verbs had an infinitive ending with ''-re'' (with a varying vowel, called the ''thematical'', preceding it).

Portuguese (and its sister language, [[Galician language|Galician]]) is the only [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] with a personal infinitive, which helps to make infinitive clauses very common. English finite sentences as ''so that you/she/we have/has/have...'' would be translated to ''para teres/ela ter/termos...'' (the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] is dropped very often). Portuguese personal infinitive has only two proper tenses (present and perfect), but other tenses are replaced by [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] structures. For instance, ''although you sing/sang/will sing'' could be translated to ''apesar de cantares/teres cantado/ires cantar''.

== Slavic languages ==

The infinitive in [[Russian language|Russian]] usually ends in ''-t&amp;#39;'' (&amp;#1090;&amp;#1100;) preceded by a [[thematic vowel]]; some verbs have a stem ending in a consonant and change the ''t'' to ''ch'', such as *&amp;#1084;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1075;&amp;#1090;&amp;#1100; &amp;rarr; &amp;#1084;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1095;&amp;#1100; &quot;can&quot;. Some other [[Slavic languages]] have the infinitive typically ending in -&amp;#263;. However, Bulgarian and Macedonian have lost the infinitive. Serbo-Croatian officially retains it but the infinitive is dying out in Serbia.

== Hebrew language ==

[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] has ''two'' infinitives, the infinitive absolute and the infinitive construct. The infinitive construct is used after prepositions and is inflected with pronominal endings to indicate its subject or object: ''bikht&amp;#333;bh hass&amp;#333;ph&amp;#275;r'' &quot;when the scribe wrote&quot;, ''ahare lekht&amp;#333;'' &quot;after his going&quot;. When the infinitive construct is preceded by &amp;#1500; (''l&amp;#601;-'', ''li-'', ''l&amp;#257;-'') &quot;to&quot;, it is identical in its meaning to the English ''to''-infinitive, and this is its most frequent use in Modern Hebrew. The infinitive absolute is used to add emphasis or certainty to the verb, as in &amp;#1502;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1514; &amp;#1497;&amp;#1502;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1514; ''m&amp;#333;th y&amp;#257;m&amp;#363;th'' (literally &quot;die he will die&quot;; figuratively, &quot;he shall indeed die&quot;). This construction is analogous to such English pleonasms as in &quot;he slept a sleep of peace.&quot; This usage is commonplace in the Bible, but in Modern Hebrew it is restricted to high-flown literary works.

Note, however, that the ''to''-infinitive of Hebrew is not the dictionary form; that is the third person singular past tense.

== Finnish language ==
To form the first infinitive, the strong form of the root (without [[consonant gradation]] or epenthetic 'e') is used, and these changes occur:
# the root is suffixed with ''-ta/-tä'' according to [[vowel harmony]]
# consonant elision takes place if applicable, e.g. ''juoks+ta'' &amp;rarr; ''juosta''
# assimilation of clusters violating sonority hierarchy if applicable, e.g. ''nuol+ta'' &amp;rarr; ''nuolla'', ''sur+ta'' &amp;rarr; ''surra''
# 't' weakens to 'd' after diphthongs, e.g. ''juo+ta'' &amp;rarr; ''juoda''
# 't' elides if intervocalic, e.g. ''kirjoitta+ta'' &amp;rarr; ''kirjoittaa''

As such, it is inconvenient for dictionary use, because the imperative would be closer to the root word. Nevertheless, dictionaries use the first infinitive.

There are four other infinitives, which create a noun-, or adverb-like word from the verb. For example, the third infinitive is ''-ma/-mä'', which creates an adjective-like word like &quot;written&quot; from &quot;write&quot;: ''kirjoita-'' becomes ''kirjoittama''.

==Translation to languages without an infinitive==

In languages without an infinitive, the infinitive is translated either as a ''that''-clause or as a [[verbal noun]]. For example, in Literary Arabic the phrase &quot;I want to write a book&quot; is translated as either ''ur&amp;#299;du an aktuba kit&amp;#257;ban'' (literally &quot;I want that I should write a book&quot;, with a verb in the [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]]) or ''ur&amp;#299;du kit&amp;#257;bata kit&amp;#257;bin'' (literally &quot;I want the writing of a book&quot;, with the ''masdar'' or verbal noun), and in Demotic Arabic ''biddi aktob ikt&amp;#257;b'' (subordinate clause with verb in subjunctive). Similarly, the modern Greek for &quot;I want to write&quot;, as opposed to the ancient Greek &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Palatino Linotype', Athena;&quot;&gt;&amp;#952;&amp;#8051;&amp;#955;&amp;#969; &amp;#947;&amp;#961;&amp;#945;&amp;#966;&amp;#949;&amp;#8150;&amp;#957;&lt;/span&gt; with the infinitive, is &amp;#952;&amp;#941;&amp;#955;&amp;#969; &amp;#957;&amp;#945; &amp;#947;&amp;#961;&amp;#940;&amp;#968;&amp;#969;, which is literally &quot;I want that I should write&quot;.

:''This article refers to the dogma of the immaculate conception of Mary, Mother of Jesus. For the doctrine of the virginal conception of Jesus Christ, see [[Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine)]].''

The '''Immaculate Conception''' is a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[dogma]] that asserts that [[Mary, the mother of Jesus]], was preserved by [[God]] from the stain of [[original sin]] at the time of her own conception. Specifically, the dogma says she was not afflicted by the lack of [[sanctifying grace]] that afflicts mankind, but was instead filled with grace by God, and furthermore lived a life completely free from [[sin]]. It is commonly confused with the doctrine of the [[Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine)|virgin birth]], though the two deal with separate subjects. Mary was conceived by normal biological means, but her soul was acted upon by God (kept &quot;immaculate&quot;) at the time of her conception.  

The Immaculate Conception was solemnly [[dogmatic definition|defined as a dogma]] by [[Pope Pius IX]] in his constitution ''Ineffabilis Deus'', published [[December 8]], [[1854]] (the [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]]).  

The Feast of the Immaculate Conception of Mary had been established in [[1483]] by Pope [[Sixtus IV]] who stopped short of defining the doctrine as a dogma of the Catholic Faith, thus giving Catholics freedom to believe in this or not; this freedom had been reiterated by the [[Council of Trent]]. The existence of the feast was a strong indication of the Church´s belief in the Immaculate Conception, even before its 19th century definition as a dogma.

The Catholic Church believes the dogma is supported by scripture (e.g. her being greeted by Angel Gabriel as &quot;full of Grace&quot;), and by the writings of many of the [[Church Fathers]], either directly or indirectly, and often calls Mary the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Blessed Virgin]] ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] [http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=001&amp;l=48 1:48]).  Catholic theology maintains that since Jesus became [[incarnation|incarnate]] of the Virgin Mary, she needed to be completely free of sin to bear the Son of God, and that Mary is &quot;redeemed 'by the grace of [[Christ]]' but in a more perfect manner than other human beings&quot; (Ott, ''Fund.'', Bk 3, Pt. 3, Ch. 2, §3.1.e).

In the Catholic Church, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on [[8 December]] is generally a [[Holy Day of Obligation]], and a public holiday in countries where Catholicism is predominant.  Prior to the spread of this doctrine, December 8 was celebrated as the Conception of Mary, since September 8 is the Feast of the Nativity of Mary.

==History of the doctrine==

Aside from the acceptability of the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, and its necessity or lack thereof, there is the history of its development within the Catholic Church.  The Conception of Mary was celebrated in [[England]] from the ninth century. [[Eadmer]] was influential in its spread. The [[Normans]] suppressed the celebration, but it lived on in the popular mind. It was rejected by St. [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], [[Alexander of Hales]], and St. [[Bonaventure]] (who, teaching at [[Paris, France|Paris]], called it &quot;this foreign doctrine&quot;, indicating its association with England).  St [[Thomas Aquinas]] expressed questions about the subject, but said that he would accept the determination of the Church.  These famous churchmen had problems with the doctrine due to their understanding of human conception.  They did not believe that the soul was placed in the body at the moment of implantation in the womb.  Aquinas and Bonaventure, for example, believed that Mary was completely free from sin, but that she was not given this grace at the instant of her conception.

The [[Oxford University|Oxford]] [[Franciscan]]s [[William of Ware]] and especially [[Beatification|Blessed]] [[John Duns Scotus]] defended the doctrine, despite the opposition of most scholarly opinion at the time. Scotus proposed a solution to the theological problems involved with reconciling the doctrine with that of universal redemption in Christ, by arguing that Mary's immaculate conception did not remove her from redemption by Christ, but rather was the result of a more perfect redemption given to her on account of her special role in history. Furthermore, Scotus said that Mary was redeemed ''in anticipation'' of Christ's death on the cross.  This was similar to the way that the Church explained the Last Supper (since Catholic theology teaches that the Mass is the sacrifice of Calvary made present on the altar, and Christ did not die before the Last Supper).  Scotus' defense of the immaculist thesis was summed up by one of his followers as ''potuit, decuit ergo fecit'' (God could do it, it was fitting that he did it, and so he did it). Following his defense of the thesis, students at Paris swore to defend the thesis, and the tradition grew of swearing to defend the doctrine with one's blood.

Popular opinion was firmly behind accepting this privilege for Mary, but such was the sensitivity of the issue and the authority of Aquinas, that it was not until 1854 that Pius IX, with the support of the overwhelming majority of Catholic [[Bishop]]s, pronounced the doctrine [[Papal infallibility|infallible]].

== Protestant and Eastern Orthodox opinion ==

The doctrine is generally not shared by either [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] or by [[Protestantism]].

Protestants generally reject the doctrine, because they do not consider the development of [[dogma]]tic [[theology]] to be authoritative apart from [[Biblical]] [[exegesis]], and the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception is not explicit in the [[Bible]]. It is accepted by some [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholics]], but is rejected by most in the [[Anglican Communion]]. In the [[Book of Common Prayer]], December 8 is a &quot;lesser commemoration&quot;, whose observance is optional. However, members of the [[Society of Mary (Anglican)|Society of Mary]] are required to attend mass that day.

Orthodox Christians do believe that Mary was without sin for her entire life, but they do not share the Catholic Church's views on original sin.  They note that [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] (d. [[430]]), whose works were not well known in Eastern Christianity until after the [[17th century]], has exerted considerable influence over the theology of sin that has generally taken root through the [[Holy See]], and since Eastern Orthodoxy does not share Rome's (or most Protestants') view of original sin, it considers unnecessary the doctrine that Mary would require purification prior to the Incarnation. Instead, Eastern Orthodox theologians suggest that the references among the Greek and Syrian Fathers to Mary's purity and sinlessness may refer not to an ''[[a priori]]'' state, but to her conduct after birth. Although this is not a [[dogma]] in the Orthodox Church, there is the universal belief that there was a pre-sanctification of Mary at the time of her conception, similar to the conception of Saint [[John the Baptist]]. However, there was no cleansing of original sin, since Orthodox Christians believe that that one cannot inherit original sin, or any sin for that matter; instead, 'original sin' in Orthodoxy refers to the general tendency towards sin and pain in the world, caused by the fall of Adam.

== Scriptural sources ==

In his Apostolic Constitution ''[http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P9INEFF.HTM Ineffabilis Deus]'' (December 8, 1854), which officially defined the Immaculate Conception as dogma for the Catholic Church, [[Pope Pius IX]] primarily appealed to the text of [[Genesis|Genesis]] [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P5.HTM 3:15], where the serpent was told by God, &quot;I will put enmity between you and the woman, between your seed and her seed.&quot; According to the Catholic understanding, this was a prophecy that foretold of a &quot;woman&quot; who would always be at enmity with the serpent — that is, a woman who would never be under the power of sin, nor in bondage to the serpent.

Some Catholic theologians have also found Scriptural evidence for the Immaculate Conception in the angel Gabriel's greeting to Mary at the Annunciation, recorded by Saint Luke in [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PWK.HTM 1:28].  The English translation, &quot;Hail, Full of Grace,&quot; or &quot;Hail, Favored One,&quot; is based on the Greek of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PWK.HTM 1:28], &amp;#935;&amp;#945;&amp;#953;&amp;#961;&amp;#949; &amp;#954;&amp;#949;&amp;#967;&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#953;&amp;#964;&amp;#969;&amp;#956;&amp;#949;&amp;#957;&amp;#951; ''Chaire kecharitomene''. The latter word has the verb &quot;to grace&quot; as its root, and the Greek syntax indicates that the action of the verb was passive, fully completed in the past, with results continuing into the future. Put another way, it means that the subject (Mary) was graced fully and completely at some time in the past, and continued in that fully graced state.

The [[Church Fathers]], almost from the beginning of Church History, found further Scriptural evidence by comparing the figure of Eve to the figure of Mary. St. [[Justin Martyr]] said that Mary was a kind of New Eve, &quot;in order that the disobedience which proceeded from the serpent might receive its destruction in the same manner in which it derived its origin.&quot; (''Dialogue with Trypho'', 100) Tertullian argued in the same manner, saying, &quot;As Eve had believed the serpent, so Mary believed the angel. The delinquency which the one occasioned by believing, the other by believing effaced.&quot; (''On the Flesh of Christ'', 17)  St. Irenaeus declared that Mary became &quot;the cause of salvation, both to herself and the whole human race,&quot; because &quot;what the virgin Eve had bound fast through unbelief, this did the virgin Mary set free through faith.&quot; (''Against Heresies'', Book III, cap. 22, 4) St. Jerome coined the phrase, &quot;Death came through Eve, but life has come through Mary.&quot; (''Letter XXII, To Eustochium'', 21)

== Parallelisms in other religions ==

In [[Islam]], the prophet [[Muhammed]] is considered the sinless bearer of the kalam of Allah (speech of God), just as in definitive Catholic formulation, Mary is the sinless bearer of Christ, the Word of God.

[[Anahita]] (or Nahid in Modern Persian), the mother of [[Mitra]], whose name means &quot;unstained&quot; or &quot;immaculate&quot;, was an ancient Persian deity. Her cult was strongest in Western Iran, and had parallels with that of the Semitic Near Eastern &quot;Queen of Heaven&quot;, deification of the planet Venus. The largest temple with a Mithraic connection is the Seleucid temple at Kangavar in western Iran (c. 200 BC), dedicated to &quot;Anahita, the Immaculate Virgin Mother of the Lord Mithras&quot;.

[[Isis]] was also sometimes described as immaculate. &quot;Immaculate is our Lady Isis,&quot; is the legend around an engraving of Serapis and Isis, described by C W King, in ''The Gnostics and their Remains''.

== Common misinterpretation ==

There is a widespread misunderstanding of the term ''immaculate conception''. Many people, even many Catholics, believe this refers to the conception of Jesus by Mary. Nearly every time this term is used in the mass media, it is in reference to the conception of Jesus by Mary. The conception of Jesus by Mary is more properly called the [[incarnation]] of Christ. The phrase &quot;Immaculate Conception,&quot; by Catholic interpretation, is not directly connected to the concept of the &quot;Virgin Birth.&quot; The Catholic Church celebrates the Immaculate Conception on [[8 December]], exactly nine months before the official birthday of Mary. The [[Annunciation|Incarnation of Christ]] is celebrated on [[25 March]], nine months before [[Christmas Day]].

The '''Isle of Skye''', usually known simply as '''Skye''' (''An t-Eilean Sgitheanach'' in [[Scottish Gaelic]]) is the largest and most northerly island in the [[Inner Hebrides]] of [[Scotland]]. [[Scots Gaelic]] &quot;sgiath&quot; means &quot;winged&quot;.

Its name came via [[Old Norse]] ''Skið'' = &quot;ski&quot; (and similar meanings), as an alteration of a [[Pictish]] original which is recorded in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sources as  ''Scitis'' ([[Ravenna Cosmography]]) and ''Scetis'' (on [[Ptolemy]]'s map). Some legends associate the isle with the mythic figure of [[Scáthach]].

==Geography==

At [[1 E9 m²|1700]] [[square kilometre|km²]] (656 [[square mile|mi²]]), Skye is the second largest island in [[Scotland]] after ''[[Lewis]] and [[Harris]]'' (which form a single island). The island has some of the most dramatic and challenging mountain terrain in Scotland, including the [[Cuillin]], as well as a rich heritage of ancient monuments, [[castle]]s, and [[memorial]]s.

The southwest side of Skye is a series of [[peninsula]]s, including
