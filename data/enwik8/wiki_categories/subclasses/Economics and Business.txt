{{Economy of Algeria table}}
In the '''economy of Algeria''' the [[hydrocarbons]] sector is the backbone, accounting for roughly 52% of budget revenues, 25% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], and over 95% of export earnings. [[Algeria]] has the fifth-largest reserves of [[natural gas]] in the world and is the second largest gas exporter; it ranks fourteenth for oil reserves. Algiers' efforts to reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the Arab world stalled in [[1992]] as the country became embroiled in political turmoil.

Burdened with a heavy foreign debt, Algiers concluded a one-year standby arrangement with the [[International Monetary Fund]] in April [[1994]] and the following year signed onto a three-year extended fund facility which ended [[30 April]], [[1998]]. Some progress on economic reform, [[Paris Club]] [[debt rescheduling]]s in [[1995]] and [[1996]], and oil and gas sector expansion contributed to a recovery in growth since 1995, reducing inflation to approximately 1% and narrowing the budget deficit. Algeria's economy has grown at about 4% annually since [[1999]]. The country's foreign debt has fallen from a high of $28 billion in [[1999]] to its current level of $24 billion. The spike in oil prices in [[1999]]-[[2000]] and the government's tight fiscal policy, as well as a large increase in the trade surplus and the near tripling of foreign exchange reserves has helped the country's finances. However, an ongoing drought, the after effects of the [[November 10]], [[2001]] floods and an uncertain oil market make prospects for [[2002]]-[[2003|03]] more problematic. The government pledges to continue its efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector. However, it has thus far had little success in reducing high unemployment, officially estimated at 30% and improving living standards.

[[President Bouteflika]] has announced sweeping economic reforms, which, if implemented, will significantly restructure the economy. Still, the economy remains heavily dependent on volatile oil and gas revenues. The government has continued efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector, but has had little success in reducing high unemployment and improving living standards.  Other priority areas include banking reform, improving the investment environment, and reducing government bureaucracy.

The government has announced plans to sell off state enterprises: sales of a national cement factory and steel plant have been completed and other industries are up for offer. In 2001, Algeria signed an Association Agreement with the [[European Union]]; it has started accession negotiations for entry into the [[World Trade Organization]]. 

===[[Agriculture]]===

Since Roman times Algeria has been noted for the fertility of its soil.  About a quarter of the inhabitants are engaged in agricultural pursuits.  More than 7,500,000 acres (30,000 km&amp;sup2;) are devoted to the cultivation of [[cereal grain]]s.  The Tell is the grain-growing land.  During the time of [[France|French]] rule its productivity was increased substantially by the sinking of [[Artesian aquifer|artesian well]]s in districts which only required water to make them fertile.  Of the crops raised, [[wheat]], [[barley]] and [[oat]]s are the principal cereals.  A great variety of [[vegetable]]s and of [[fruit]]s, especially [[citrus]] products, is exported.  

A considerable amount of [[cotton]] was grown at the time of the [[United States]]' [[American Civil War|Civil War]], but the industry declined afterwards.  In the early years of the 20th century efforts to extend the cultivation of the plant were renewed.  A small amount of [[cotton]] is also grown in the southern oases.  Large quantities of [[crin vegetal]] (vegetable horse-hair) an excellent fibre, are made from the leaves of the dwarf palm.  The [[olive]] (both for its fruit and [[Petroleum]]) and [[tobacco]] are cultivated with great success.

Algeria also exports [[fig]]s, [[date (fruit)|date]]s, [[esparto]] grass, and [[cork (material)|cork]].

====Wine Production====

Throughout Algeria the soil favours the growth of vines.  The country, in the words of an expert sent to report on the subject by the French government, 
:&quot;can produce an infinite variety of wines suitable to every constitution and to every caprice of taste.&quot; 

The growing of vines was undertaken early by the colonists, but it was not until vineyards in [[France]] were attacked by [[phylloxera]] that the export of [[wine]] from Algeria became significant.  In [[1883]], despite precautionary measures, Algerian [[vineyard]]s were also attacked but in the meantime the quality of their wines had been proved.  In 1850 less than 2000 acres (8 km&amp;sup2;) were devoted to the grape, but in 1878 this had increased to over 42,000 acres (170 km&amp;sup2;), which yielded 7,436,000 gallons (28,000 m&amp;sup3;) of wine.  Despite bad seasons and ravages of insects, cultivation extended, and in 1895 the vineyards covered 300,000 acres (1,200 km&amp;sup2;), the produce being 88,000,000 gallons (333,000 m&amp;sup3;).  The area of cultivation in 1905 exceeded 400,000 acres (1,600 km&amp;sup2;), and in that year the amount of wine produced was 157,000,000 gallons (594,000 m&amp;sup3;).  By that time the limits of profitable production had been reached in many parts of the country.  Practically the only foreign market for Algerian wine is France, which in 1905 imported about 110,000,000 gallons (416,000 m&amp;sup3;).

===Fishing===

Fishing is a flourishing but minor industry.  Fish caught are principally [[sardine]]s, [[bonito]], [[smelt]] and [[sprat]]s.  Fresh fish are exported to [[France]], dried and preserved fish to [[Spain]] and [[Italy]].  Coral [[fishery|fisheries]] are found along the coast from [[Bona]] to [[Tunis]].

===Minerals===

Algeria is rich in minerals; the country has many [[iron]], [[lead]] and [[zinc]], [[copper]], [[calamine]], [[antimony]] and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] mines.  The most productive are those of iron and zinc.  Lignite is found in Algiers; immense [[phosphate]] beds were discovered near [[Tebessa]] in 1891, yielding 313,500 tons in 1905.  Phosphate beds are also worked near [[Setif]], [[Guelma]] and [[Ain Beida]].  There are more than 300 quarries which produce, amongst other stones, [[onyx]] and beautiful white and red [[marble]]s.  Algerian onyx from Ain Tekbalet was used by the Romans, and many ancient quarries have been found near [[Kleber]], some being certainly those from which the long-lost Numidian marbles were taken.  [[Salt]] is collected on the margins of the chotts.

==Foreign trade==

Under French administration the commerce of Algeria developed greatly: the total imports and exports at the time of the French occupation (1830) did not exceed £ 175,000.  In 1850 the figures had reached £ 5,000,000; in 1868, £ 12,000,000; in 1880, £ 17,000,000; and in 1890, £ 20,000,000.  From this point progress was slower and the figures varied considerably year by year.  In 1905 the total value of the foreign trade was £ 24,500,000.  About five-sixths of the trade is with or via France, into which country several Algerian goods have been admitted duty-free since 1851, and all since 1867.  French goods, except [[sugar]], have been admitted into Algeria without payment of duty since 1835.  After the increase, in 1892, of the French minimum tariff, which applied to Algeria also, foreign trade greatly diminished. 

By far Algeria's most significant exports, financially, are [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]].  The reserves are mostly in the Eastern [[Sahara]]; the Algerian government curbed the exports in the 1980s to slow depletion; exports increased again somewhat in the [[1990|1990s]].  Other significant exports are [[domestic sheep|sheep]], [[ox]]en, and [[horse]]s; animal products, such as [[wool]] and skins; [[wine]], cereals ([[rye]], [[barley]], [[oat]]s), [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s (chiefly [[fig]]s and [[grape]]s for the table) and [[seed]]s, [[esparto]] grass, oils and vegetable extracts (chiefly [[olive oil]]), [[iron]] ore, [[zinc]], natural [[phosphate]]s, [[timber]], [[Cork (material)|cork]], [[crin vegetal]] and [[tobacco]].  The import of [[wool]] exceeds the export.  [[Sugar]], [[coffee]], machinery, metal work of all kinds, clothing and pottery are largely imported.  Of these by far the greater part comes from France.  The [[United Kingdom|British]] imports consist chiefly of [[coal]], cotton fabrics and machinery.

===Exports===

Algeria trades most extensively with France and [[Italy]], in terms of both imports and exports, but also trades with the United States and [[Spain]].

The '''People's Democratic Republic of Algeria''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''الجمهورية الجزائرية الديمقراطية الشعبية''') , or '''Algeria''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''الجزائر'''), is a presidential state in [[north Africa]], and the second largest country on the [[Africa]]n continent, [[Sudan]] being the largest.  It is bordered by [[Tunisia]] in the northeast, [[Libya]] in the east, [[Niger]] in the southeast, [[Mali]] and [[Mauritania]] in the southwest, and [[Morocco]] as well as a few kilometers of its annexed territory, [[Western Sahara]], in the west. [[Constitution of Algeria|Constitutionally]], it is defined as  an [[Islam]]ic, [[Arab]], and [[Amazigh]] (Berber) country.  The name Algeria is derived from the name of the city of [[Algiers]], from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''al-jazā’ir'', which translates as ''the islands'', referring to the four islands which lay off that city's coast until becoming part of the mainland in 1525.



==History==
{{main|History of Algeria}}

Algeria has been inhabited by [[Berber]]s (or Amazigh) since at least [[10,000 BC]].  From [[1000 BC]] on, the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] became an influence on them, establishing settlements along the coast. Berber kingdoms began to emerge, most notably [[Numidia]], and seized the opportunity offered by the Punic Wars to become independent of Carthage, only to be taken over soon after by the [[Roman Republic]] in 200 BC.  As the western [[Roman Empire]] collapsed, the Berbers became independent again in much of the area, while the [[Vandals]] took over parts until later expelled by the generals of the [[Byzantine Emperor]], [[Justinian I]].  The [[Byzantine Empire]] then retained a precarious grip on the east of the country until the coming of the [[Arab]]s in the [[8th century]].

[[Image:Roman Arch of Trajan at Thamugadi (Timgad), Algeria 04966r.jpg|thumb|left|Roman arch of Trajan at Thamugadi (Timgad), Algeria]]
After some decades of fierce resistance under leaders such as [[Kusayla]] and [[Kahina]], the Berbers adopted [[Islam]] ''en masse'', but almost immediately expelled the [[Caliphate]] from Algeria, establishing an [[Ibadi]] state under the [[Rustamid]]s.  Having converted the [[Kutama]] of [[Kabylie]] to its cause, the [[Shia]] [[Fatimid]]s overthrew the Rustamids, and conquered Egypt.  They left Algeria and Tunisia to their [[Zirid]] vassals; when the latter rebelled and adopted [[Sunni]]sm, they sent in a populous [[Arab]] tribe, the [[Banu Hilal]], to weaken them, thus incidentally initiating the [[Arabization]] of the countryside.  The [[Almoravid]]s and [[Almohad]]s, Berber dynasties from the west founded by religious reformers, brought a period of relative peace and development; however, with the Almohads' collapse, Algeria became a battleground for their three [[successor state]]s, the Algerian [[Zayyanid]]s, Tunisian [[Hafsid]]s, and Moroccan [[Merinid]]s.  In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, [[Spain]] started attacking and taking over many coastal cities, prompting some to seek help from the [[Ottoman Empire]].

Algeria was brought into the Ottoman Empire by [[Khair ad Din|Khair ad-Din]] and his  brother [[Aruj]], who established Algeria's modern boundaries in the north and made its coast a base for the [[Privateer|corsairs]]; their privateering peaked in Algiers in the 1600s. Piracy on American vessels in the Mediterranean resulted in the [[First Barbary War|First]] and [[Second Barbary War]] with the [[United States]]. On the pretext of a slight to their consul, the [[France|French]] invaded Algiers in 1830; however, intense resistance from such personalities as [[Emir Abdelkader]], [[Ahmed Bey]] and [[Lalla Fatma N'Soumer|Fatma N'Soumer]] made for a slow conquest of Algeria, not technically completed until the early 1900s when the last [[Tuareg]] were conquered.
[[Image:Constantine Algerien 002.jpg|thumb|left|Constantine, Algeria 1840]]

Meanwhile, however, the French suppressed slavery and made Algeria an integral part of France, a status that would end only with the collapse of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]. Tens of thousands of settlers from France, Italy, Spain, and Malta moved in to farm the Algerian coastal plain and occupy the most prized parts of Algeria's cities, benefiting from the French government's confiscation of communally held land. People of European descent in Algeria (the so-called ''[[pied-noir|pieds-noirs]]''), as well as the native Algerian Jews, were full French citizens starting from the end of the 19th century; by contrast, the vast majority of Muslim Algerians (even veterans of the French army) remained outside of French law, possessing neither French citizenship nor the right to vote. Algeria's social fabric was stretched to breaking point during this period: literacy dropped massively, while land confiscation uprooted much of the population.

In 1954, the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) launched the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] [[Algerian War of Independence]]; after nearly a decade of urban and rural warfare, they succeeded in pushing France out in 1962. Most of the 1,025,000 ''[[pied-noir|pieds-noirs]]'', as well as 91,000 ''[[harki]]s'' (pro-French Muslim Algerians serving in the French Army), together forming about 10% of the population of Algeria in 1962, fled Algeria for France in just a few months in the middle of that year.

[[Image:TheBattleofAlgiers.png|thumb|right|''[[The Battle of Algiers]]'' is a movie about the [[Algerian War of Independence]].]]
Algeria's first president, the FLN leader [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], was overthrown by his former ally and defense minister, [[Houari Boumédiènne]] in 1965. Under Ben Bella the government had already become increasingly socialist and dictatorial, and this trend continued throughout Boumedienne's government; however, Boumedienne relied much more heavily on the army, and reduced the sole legal party to a merely symbolic role.  Agriculture was collectivised, and a massive industrialization drive launched.  Oil extraction facilities were nationalized and this increased the state's wealth, especially after the 1973 oil crisis, but the Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil, bringing hardship when the price collapsed in the 1980s.  In foreign policy Algeria was a member and leader of the 'non-aligned' nations.  A dispute with Morocco over the [[Western Sahara]] nearly led to war.  Dissent was rarely tolerated, and the state's control over the media and the outlawing of political parties other than the FLN was cemented in the repressive constitution of 1976.  Boumédienne died in 1978, but the rule of his successor, [[Chadli Bendjedid]], was little more open.  The state took on a strongly bureaucratic character and corruption was widespread.

The modernization drive brought considerable demographic changes to Algeria.  Village traditions underwent significant change as urbanization increased, new industries emerged, agriculture was substantially reduced, and education, a rarity in colonial times, was extended nationwide, raising the literacy rate from less than 10% to over 60%.  Improvements in healthcare led to a dramatic increase in the birthrate (7-8 children per mother) which had two consequences: a very youthful population, and a housing crisis.  The new generation struggled to relate to the cultural obsession with the war years and two conflicting protest movements developed: left-wingers, including Berber identity movements, and Islamic 'intégristes'.  Both protested against one-party rule but also clashed with each other in universities and on the streets during the 1980s.  Mass protests from both camps in autumn 1988 forced Benjedid to concede the end of one-party rule, and elections were announced for 1991.

In December 1991, the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] won the [[Algerian National Assembly elections, 1991|first round]] of the country's first multiparty elections. The military then canceled the second round, forced then-president Bendjedid to resign, and banned the Islamic Salvation Front. The ensuing conflict engulfed Algeria in the violent [[Algerian Civil War]].  More than 100,000 people were killed, often in unprovoked massacres of civilians.  The question of who was responsible for these massacres remains controversial among academic observers; many were claimed by the [[Armed Islamic Group]].  After 1998, the war waned, and by 2002 the main guerrilla groups had either been destroyed or surrendered, taking advantage of an amnesty program, though sporadic fighting continued in some areas.  Elections resumed in 1995, and in 1999, after a series of short-term leaders representing the military, [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], the current president, was elected. The issue of Berber language and identity increased in significance, particularly after the extensive [[Kabyle]] protests of 2001 and the near-total boycott of local elections in [[Kabylie]]; the government responded with concessions including naming of [[Tamazight]] (Berber) as a national language and teaching it in schools.

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Algeria}}

The head of state is the [[President of Algeria|President of the republic]], who is elected to a 5-year term, renewable once. Algeria has [[universal suffrage]]. The President is the head of the Council of Ministers and of the High Security Council. He appoints the [[Prime Minister of Algeria|Prime Minister]] who is also the head of government. The Prime Minister appoints the Council of Ministers.

The Algerian [[parliament]] is bicameral, consisting of a lower chamber, the National People's Assembly (APN), with 380 members and an upper chamber, the Council of Nation, with 144 members. The APN is elected every 5 years.

Throughout the 1960's, Algeria supported many independence movements in sub-S* 1996 - 1997: [[Gil Amelio]]

==User culture==
:''See Also: [[Cult of Mac]]''

Some Apple customers are devoted to their brand. Some refuse to buy from competitors and stridently uphold their belief in the perceived superiority of Apple products; according to surveys by [[J. D. Power]], Apple has the highest brand and repurchase loyalty of any computer manufacturer. While this brand loyalty is considered unusual for any product, Apple appears not to have gone out of its way to create it. At one time, [[Apple evangelist]]s were actively engaged by the company, but this was after the phenomenon was already firmly established. As [[Guy Kawasaki]] has said, &quot;[the brand fanaticism was] something that was stumbled upon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creatingcustomerevangelists.com/resources/evangelists/guy_kawasaki.asp The father of evangelism marketing] by Ben McConnell and Jackie Huba&lt;/ref&gt;

Macintosh users meet at the [[Apple Expo]] and [[MacWorld Expo]] trade shows where Apple introduces new products each year to the industry and public. Many users show their loyalty and devotion by wearing Apple [[t-shirt]]s. Another example of Apple's user culture is the [[Apple_Store_%28retail%29|Apple Store]] openings where many wait and sleep outside of stores for days prior to their openings.

[[John Sculley]], former Apple CEO, told the Guardian newspaper in 1997: &quot;''People talk about technology, but Apple was a marketing company, It was the marketing company of the decade.''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/news/culture/mac/0,56677-0.html Wired News: Apple: It's All About the Brand]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable litigation==
{{main|Notable litigation of Apple Computer}}
Apple's earliest court action dates to 1978 when [[Apple Records|Apple Corps]], [[The Beatles]]-founded record label, filed suit against Apple Computer for trademark infringement. The suit settled in 1981 with an amount of $80,000 being paid to Apple Corps. As a condition of the settlement, Apple Computer agreed to stay out of the music business. The case arose in 1989 again when Apple Corps sued, claiming violation of the 1981 settlement agreement. In 1991 another settlement of around $26.5 million was reached. &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.com.com/Apple+vs.+Apple+Perfect+harmony/2100-1027_3-5378401.html news.com: Apple vs. Apple: Perfect harmony?]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2003 Apple Computer was sued by Apple Corps again, this time for introducing [[iTunes]] and the [[Apple iPod | iPod]] which Apple Corps believed was a violation of the previous agreement by Apple not to distribute music. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalzoom.com/articles/article_content/article11325.html legalzoom.com: Apple v Apple: What is at the core of The Beatles’ Apple Records vs. Apple Ipod…]&lt;/ref&gt; The date for this trial has been set for [[March 27]], [[2006]] in the UK. At the present time [[the Beatles]]' songs are not available for download from any legal music download sites, including the [[iTunes Music Store]].

In 1982 Apple filed a lawsuit against [[Franklin Computer Corp.]], alleging that Franklin's ACE 100 personal computer used illegal copies of Apple's [[operating system]] and [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. [[Apple v. Franklin]] established the fundamental basis of copyright of computer software. As a result, Apple began embedding an encrypted image in ROM. This icon displays &quot;Stolen from Apple Computer&quot;.

In 1988 Apple sued Microsoft and [[Hewlett-Packard]] on the grounds that they infringed Apple's copyright on a GUI. The [[Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.]] trial lasted for four years. The ruling was decided against Apple, and the concept of a GUI was no longer the domain of Apple alone.

In July 1998 [[Abdul Traya]] registered the domain name ''appleimac.com'', two months after Apple announced the [[iMac]], in an attempt to draw attention to a web-hosting business. &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.com.com/2100-1023-221921.html news.com: Teen in dispute with Apple over domain]&lt;/ref&gt; After a legal dispute that lasted until April 1999, Traya and Apple settled out of court with Apple paying legal fees and giving Traya a &quot;''token payment''&quot; in exchange for the domain name. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macobserver.com/news/99/april/990427/applevsteen.html macobserver.com:  Battle For Domain Name Between Apple And Teen Resolved]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 Apple was sued by the astronomer and science popularizer [[Carl Sagan]] for using his name as the internal code-name for the [[Power Macintosh 7100]]. Sagan lost the suit twice. See the Carl Sagan [[Carl Sagan#Personality|article]] for details.

In November 2000, [[Benjamin Cohen]] of [http://www.cyberbritain.co.uk CyberBritain] registered the domain name &quot;itunes.co.uk&quot; for an MP3 search engine. Apple was granted a UK restricted (non music) trademark for ITUNES on [[March 23]], [[2001]], and launched its popular iTunes music store service in the UK in 2004. In 2005, Apple took the matter to the Dispute Resolution Service operated by [[.uk]] [[domain|domain name]] [[registry]] [[Nominet UK]], stating that they had rights in the name &quot;iTunes&quot;. An expert decided in Apple's favor in the dispute. Cohen launched a media offensive stating that the DRS was biased towards large businesses and made frequent threats of lawsuits against Nominet.

In November 2004, two popular [[weblog]] sites that feature [[Mac rumors community|Apple rumors]] publicly revealed information about an unreleased Apple product code-named &quot;Asteroid&quot;, also known as &quot;Project Q97&quot;. The sites, &quot;AppleInsider&quot; and &quot;PowerPage&quot;, were subpoenaed for information about their sources in the [[Apple v. Does]] case. In February 2005 it was decided by a court official in California that the bloggers do not have the same [[shield law]] protection as do journalists. In a related case, the websites went on to fight the journalistic status decision. In a separate matter, Apple filed a lawsuit against website [[Think Secret]] in January 2005, claiming that the site's reports about forthcoming Apple products violated trade secret law.

In May 2005 Apple entered into a [[class action]] settlement &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appleipodsettlement.com http://www.appleipodsettlement.com]&lt;/ref&gt;, upheld on December 20, 2005 following an appeal, regarding the battery life of [[Apple iPod | iPod]] music players sold prior to May 2004.  Eligible members of the class are entitled to extended warranties, store credit, cash compensation, or battery replacement.

'''Aberdeenshire''' (''Siorrachd Obar Dheathain'' in [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]) is one of the 32 [[unitary authority|unitary]] [[council areas]] in [[Scotland]].

Present day Aberdeenshire does not include the [[City of Aberdeen]] which is a unitary authority in its own right. However Aberdeenshire council has its headquarters at Woodhill House, Westburn Road, in  [[Aberdeen]] - The only Scottish council whose headquarters are based outside of the council area. It also borders [[Angus]], [[Perth and Kinross]], [[Highland]], and [[Moray]]. 

==History==
The present council area is named after the historic [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|county of Aberdeenshire]] which had different boundaries and was abolished in [[1975]]. Between 1975 and 1996 the area became part of the [[Regions of Scotland|region]] of [[Grampian]]. When the Scottish regions were abolished, a new unitary council area of Aberdeenshire was created, which revived the name of the former county but with different boundaries.

==Aberdeenshire council==
Aberdeenshire Council was established in April [[1996]], replacing three [[District council]]s ([[Banff and Buchan]], [[Gordon, Scotland|Gordon]] and [[Kincardine and Deeside]]) and part of the area of [[Grampian Region]]al Council.

There are 68 [[councillor]]s; in 2004 they were 28 [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]], 15 [[Scottish National Party|SNP]], 14 Independent and 11 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]].

The Council's net expenditure is £399.1m a year (2003/04).

Education takes the largest share of expenditure (55%), followed by Social Work and Housing (19%), Transportation and Infrastructure (11%), and Joint Services such as Fire and Police (10%). 22% of revenue is raised locally through the Council Tax. Average Band D [[Council Tax]] is the eighth lowest in mainland Scotland at £966 (2003/04).

The council area has a population of 226,871, representing 4.5% of Scotland's total, and a 20% increase since 1981, 50% since 1971. Major towns are Peterhead (17,947), Fraserburgh (12,454), Inverurie (10,882), Stonehaven (9,577), Westhill (9,498) and Ellon (8,754). The population has a higher proportion of younger age groups than the rest of Scotland, reflecting employment-driven in-migration in recent decades.

The council has devolved power to six [[area committee]]s:
*[[Banff &amp; Buchan]],
*[[Buchan]],
*[[Formartine]],
*[[Garioch]],
*[[Marr]],
*[[Kincardine &amp; Mearns]]

;'''Banff &amp; Buchan'''
Population 35,742 (2001 Census)

Fishing and agriculture are important industries, together with associated processing and service activity.

The area is relatively self-contained, and in recent years has seen a small decline in population. It does, however, have tourism assets in its coastline, coastal villages and [[visitor attraction]]s. Economic dependency, peripherality, and the future of the Common Fisheries/Agricultural Policies, are key issues. The Buchan Local Action Plan will address some of these concerns. The Area qualifies for [[European Union Objective 2]] structural funding.

;'''Buchan'''
Population 39,160 (2001 Census)

[[Peterhead]] is the largest town in Aberdeenshire; the principal white fish landing port in Europe; and a major oil industry service centre. Equally important, is the nearby gas terminal at [[St Fergus]].

Attempts are being made to counter the negative effects of several recent key company closures and economic threats. Inland, the area is dependent upon agriculture, and many villages have seen a decline in population and services. Issues affecting Banff and Buchan also apply here, as does the future of the oil and gas industry. Part of Buchan benefits from EU aid coverage. Opportunities exist through the Buchan Local Action Plan to safeguard and enhance the economic future of Peterhead and Buchan.

;'''Formartine'''
Population 36,478 (2001 Census)

Formartine has experienced rapid population growth, particularly around [[Ellon]] and [[Oldmeldrum]], and in the south east where development has spread outwith the city of Aberdeen. By contrast, the area around [[Turriff]] retains strong dependency on the traditional agricultural economy. The area's coastline and rural environment offer recreation potential.

;'''Garioch'''
Population 42,947 (2001 Census)

Centred on [[Inverurie]], a traditional rural market town, Garioch has also experienced rapid growth due to its proximity to the city of Aberdeen. Significant growth in population, services and employment is anticipated in the [[A96 road|A96]] corridor and in [[Westhill]]. The area is largely agricultural, but is strongly affected by the City's economy and the oil and gas sector. Garioch holds growing potential for tourism, in its environment and archaeological heritage.

;'''Marr'''
Population 34,038 (2001 Census)

To the west, the mountain environment of the [[Cairngorms]] [[National Park]] sustains a well developed tourist industry based on heritage and outdoor pursuits. Forestry and livestock farming are key industries, particularly in remoter areas. Part of the area has qualified for EU financial assistance. To the east, Marr has experienced population growth due to its strong commuter links with the city of Aberdeen.

;'''Kincardine and Mearns'''
Population 38,506 (2001 Census)

Transport links with Aberdeen have encouraged very rapid population growth, especially to the north of the area. Existing settlements such as [[Portlethen]] and [[Stonehaven]] have greatly expanded, along with industrial activity. The southern part is more self-contained, with the fertile Mearns area sustaining a strong agricultural economy. Small scale tourism activity exists along its attractive coastline and former fishing villages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aztlan Underground''' is a fusion band from [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Since the early 1990s, Aztlan Underground has played [[Rapcore]]. Indigenous drums, flutes, and rattles are commonplace in its musical compositions.

This unique sound is the backdrop for the band's message of dignity for indigenous people, all of humanity, and Earth. Aztlan Underground has been cultivating a grass roots audience across the country, which has become a large and loyal underground following. Their music includes spoken word pieces and elements of punk, hip hop, rock, funk, jazz, and indigenous music, among others.

The artists are Chenek &quot;DJ Bean&quot; (turntables, samples and percussion), Yaotl (vocals, indigenous percussion), Joe &quot;Peps&quot; (bass, rattles), Zo Rock (Guitars), Ace (drums, indigenous percussion), and Bulldog (vocals, flute).

Aztlan Underground appeared on television on [[Culture Clash]] on Fox in [[1993]], was part of ''Breaking Out'', a concert on pay per view in [[1998]], and was featured in the independent films ''Algun Dia'' and ''Frontierlandia''.

The band has been mentioned or featured in various newspapers and magazines: the [[Vancouver Sun]], [[Northshore News]] (Vancouver, Canada newspaper), [[New Times]] (Los Angeles weekly entertainment newspaper), BLU Magazine (underground hip hop magazine), [[BAM Magazine]] (Southern California), [[La Banda Elastica Magazine]], and the [[Los Angeles Times]] Calendar section. It is also the subject of a chapter in ''It's Not About A Salary'', by Brian Cross.

It was nominated in the New Times 1998 &quot;Best Latin Influenced&quot; category, the BAM Magazine 1999 &quot;Best Rock en Español&quot; category, and the [[LA Weekly]] 1999 &quot;Best Hip Hop&quot; category.

[[Image:1anschluss.gif|thumb|right|250px|German troops march into [[Austria]] on [[12 March]] [[1938]].]]
The '''Anschluss'''{{ref|spelling}} ([[German language|German]]: ''connection'', or ''political union''), also known as the '''Anschluss Österreichs''', was the 1938 inclusion of [[Austria]] into &quot;[[Großdeutschland|Greater Germany]]&quot; by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]].

The events of [[March 12]], [[1938]], were the first major steps in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s long-desired expansion of [[Germany]]. The Anschluss followed the return to Germany of the [[Saarland#History|Saar]] region, which had been under the control of the [[League of Nations]] for 15 years by the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. It was followed by the inclusion of the [[Sudetenland]] later in 1938, the invasion of the remainder of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1939, and the [[Polish September Campaign|invasion of Poland]].

The Anschluss was preceded by a period of growing political pressure on [[Austria]], exerted by Germany, demanding recognition of the outlawed Austrian National-Socialist party and later, their share of Government.  In 1938 Austrian chancellor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]], in a last bid to retain Austrian independence, announced a referendum to determine independence or union with Germany. Germany then pressured Schuschnigg into handing over power to the Nazi party. This well-planned [[Coup d'état|internal overthrow]] by the [[Austrian National Socialism|Austrian Nazi Party]] of Austria's state institutions in [[Vienna]] on [[March 11]] meant that when [[Wehrmacht]] troops entered into Austria to enforce the Anschluss, no fighting ever took place. The international response to the Anschluss was mild: The [[World War I]] [[Allies]] only lodged diplomatic protests, and no concrete action was taken to reverse giving some individual (in some cases chosen by lot from those affected) the right to pursue the case and collect the resulting fine, thus fitting it into an essentially private system.&quot;&lt;ref name=Friedman-79/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gettysburg.edu/academics/english/vikingstudies/jackson/researchdocument.html&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some disagree with this assessment, arguing that Medieval Iceland was a communal rather than individualist society - ''[p]eople of a communitarian nature... have reason to be attracted [to Medieval Iceland]... The economy barely knew the existence of markets. Social relations preceded economic relations. '' &lt;ref&gt;William Ian Miller, &quot;Bloodtaking and Peacemaking: Feud, Law and Society in Saga Iceland&quot;, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; and that when a free market finally did arise, that it was the cause of the end of the republic - ''&quot;During the 12th century, wealth and power began to accumulate in the hands of a few chiefs, and by 1220, six prominent families ruled the entire country. It was the internecine power struggle among these families, shrewdly exploited by King Haakon IV of Norway, that finally brought the old republic to an end.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Hallberg Hallmundsson, an article on Iceland in the &quot;Encyclopaedia Americana&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Somalia===
[[Image:Somalia_marketplace_2_DoD.JPG|300px|left|thumb|A marketplace in [[Somalia]], 1992, one year after the collapse of the government.  Somalia is cited by some anarcho-capitalists as an example how stateless capitalism is possible.]]
More recently, [[Somalia]] is cited by some as a real-world example of how a stateless capitalist economy and a legal system can develop organically. Since 1991, Somalia as a whole has had no functioning central government, and therefore no regulations or licensing requirements for businesses, and no taxes on businesses or individuals. One World Bank study reports that &quot;it may be easier than is commonly thought for basic systems of finance and some infrastructure services to function where government is extremely weak or absent.&quot;&lt;ref name=WorldBank-2004&gt;Nenova, Tatiana and Harford, Tim (2004) [http://rru.worldbank.org/Documents/PapersLinks/280-nenova-harford.pdf Anarchy and Invention (PDF)] Public Policy Journal Note Number 280, Retrieved [[12 August]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Kevin Sites, after a recent trip to Somalia, reported: &quot;Somalia, though brutally poor, is a kind of libertarian's dream. Free enterprise flourishes, and vigorous commercial competition is the only form of regulation. Somalia has some of the best telecommunications in Africa, with a handful of companies ready to wire home or office and provide crystal-clear service, including international long distance, for about $10 a month.&quot;  One of the poorest countries in the world in 1991, Somalia remains a very poor country.  However, wealth distribution appears to be more uniform than in other African countries.  When extreme poverty was last measured in 1998 (percentage of individuals living on less than PPP$1 a day), it was faring better than wealthier West African and neighboring countries.&lt;ref name=WorldBank-2004/&gt;

In the absence of a state and business regulations the private sector has flourished. One business sector that is said to be doing well is telecommunications.  Abdullahi Mohammed Hussein of Telecom Somalia says &quot;The government post and telecoms company used to have a monopoly but after the regime was toppled, we were free to set up our own business&quot; ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4020259.stm according to a BBC report]). Also, in 1989, before the collapse of the government, the national airline had only one airplane. Now there are approximately 15 airlines, over 60 aircraft, 6 international destinations, and more domestic routes. Electricity is now furnished by entrepreneurs, who have purchased generators and divided cities into manageable sectors (''[http://www.somalianarchy.com/viewtopic.php?t=16 photo]''). With the collapse of the central government, the educations system is now private and includes universities such as [[Mogadishu University]]. A World Bank study reports &quot;modest gains in education.&quot; As last measured in 2001, primary school enrollment, which stood at 17%, was nearly at prewar levels, and secondary school enrollment had been increasing since 1998. However, &quot;adult literacy is estimated to have declined from the already low level of 24% in 1989 to 17.1% in 2001&quot; ([http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/03/25/000112742_20040325090551/Rendered/PDF/282760Somalia0Country0reengagement0note.pdf ''WB study'']). A more recent 2003 study reported that the literacy rate had risen to 19% ([http://rru.worldbank.org/Documents/PapersLinks/280-nenova-harford.pdf ''WB study'']).  A statistic from 2000 indicated that only 21% of the population had access to safe drinking water at that time. The impact of collapse of the government and ensuing civil war on human development in Somalia has been profound, resulting in the collapse of political institutions, the destruction of social and economic infrastructure, and massive internal and external migrations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;World Bank Advisory Committee for Somalia [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/03/25/000112742_20040325090551/Rendered/PDF/282760Somalia0Country0reengagement0note.pdf Country Re-Engagement Note (pdf)] (2003), retrived [[4 November]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;

An essential element of anarcho-capitalist theory is that private businesses should protect individual liberty and property rather than tax-funded institutions. As such, the Somali situation falls short of being anarcho-capitalism as it is it is severely lacking in such options. Though some urban areas such as Mogadishu have private police and are relatively safe&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netnomad.com/crigler.html ''Return to Somalia'']&lt;/ref&gt;, crime is rampant in other areas according to some [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/africa/2004/somalia/default.stm news reports]. Businessmen in Mogadishu have organized to fund private police that patrol the city streets for petty crime&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petermaass.com/core.cfm?p=1&amp;mag=51&amp;magtype=1 ''Ayn Rand Comes to Somalia'']&lt;/ref&gt;. There is a rudimentary legal system which has been called &quot;a free market for the supply, adjudication and enforcement of law.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;van Notten, Michael (2000) [http://www.liberalia.com/htm/mvn_stateless_somalis.htm From Nation-State To Stateless Nation: The Somali Experience], Retrieved [[12 August]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; It remains to be seen if private solutions develop to the point of providing high-quality security.

While most of what was Somalia is a stateless area, two internationally unrecognized democratic states exist in its north. These are [[Somaliland]] and [[Puntland]], which are ruled by governments. These regions lack the armed competition in the more anarchic south, and the destruction this causes. Their people are correspondingly more prosperous on average. This is seen by many as evidence that competition in security should not be allowed.

==Criticisms of anarcho-capitalism==
:''For critiques of libertarianism in general, see: [[Criticism of libertarianism]]''
:''For critiques of capitalism from an anarchist (libertarian socialist) perspective, see: [[Anarchism and capitalism]]''
:''For the spectrum of political ideologies in relation to capitalism see: [[Capitalism and related political ideologies]]''

Anarcho-capitalism is a radical development of liberalism.  Therefore, the same general arguments for and against [[liberalism]], [[laissez-faire capitalism]] and [[capitalism]] apply, excepting those points (such as the justice system) where anarcho-capitalism diverges from the classical liberal tradition.

===Practical questions=== 
Critics often assert that anarcho-capitalism will degenerate into [[plutocracy]] or [[feudalism]] in practice.  They argue that it is a rational economic decision for organizations with the ability to exert coercion (private police, security and military forces) to exploit groups with less power. In this kind of environment, [[piracy]], military [[imperialism]], and [[slavery]] can be very profitable.  Taken to its logical extreme, this argument assumes that allowing such &quot;security&quot; organizations to exert coercive power will inevitably lead to their becoming a ''de facto'' state.  

The anarcho-capitalist would respond that in the absence of what they call &quot;victim disarmament&quot; ([[gun control]]), such domination would be expensive even for the most powerful, who would instead prefer peaceful trade with all.  Skeptics often feel that anarcho-capitalists rely on &quot;market solutions&quot; to the point of ridiculousness.&lt;ref&gt;Chisari, Michael - &quot;Anarchy List&quot; [[5 October]] [[1999]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Battle strike 1934.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Violence on a picket line. Critics of anarcho-capitalism argue that private ownership of capital and the pursuit of profit are exploitative, leading to class divisions and conflict.]]

[[Minarchism|Minarchist]] and [[statism|statist]] critics often argue that the [[free rider problem]] makes anarcho-capitalism (and, by extension, any anti-statist political system) fundamentally unworkable in modern societies. They typically argue that there are some vital goods or services — such as civil or military defense, management of common environmental resources, or the provision of [[public good]]s such as roads or lighthouses — that cannot be effectively delivered without the backing of a government exercising effective territorial control, and so that abolishing the state as anarcho-capitalists demand will either lead to catastrophe or to the eventual re-establishment of monopoly governments as a necessary means to solving the [[coordination problem]]s that the abolition of the state created.  One counterargument by free market economists, such as [[Alex Tabarrok]], emphasizes the private use of [[assurance contracts|dominant assurance contracts]]. Some anarcho-capitalists also contend that the &quot;problem&quot; of &quot;public goods&quot; is illusory and its invocation merely misunderstands the potential individual production of such goods.  Others, such as David Friedman, point out that problems of market failure are the exception in private markets but the norm in the [http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/mps_iceland_talk/Iceland%20MP%20talk.htm political markets] that control state action.

[[Robert Nozick]] argued in ''Anarchy, State and Utopia'' that anarcho-capitalism would inevitably transform into a minarchist state, even without violating any of its own nonaggression principles, through the eventual emergence of a single locally dominant private defense and judicial agency that it is in everyone's interests to align with, because other agencies are unable to effectively compete against the advantages of the agency with majority coverage.  Therefore, he felt that, even to the extent that the anarcho-capitalist theory is correct, it results in an unstable system that would not endure in the real world.

===Moral questions===
Anarcho-capitalists consider a choice or action to be &quot;voluntary&quot;, in a moral sense, so long as that choice or action is not influenced by coercion or fraud perpetrated by another individual.  They also believe that maintaining private property claims is always defensive so long as that property was obtained in a way they believe to be legitimate.  Thus, so long as an employee and employer agree to terms, employment is regarded as voluntary regardless of the circumstances of property restriction surrounding it.  Some critics say this ignores constraints on action due to both human and nonhuman factors, such as the need for food and shelter, and active restriction of both used and unused resources by those enforcing property claims.  Thus, if a person requires employment in order to feed and house himself, it is said that the employer-employee relationship cannot be voluntary, because the employer restricts the use of resources from the employee in such a way that he cannot meet his needs.  This is essentially a semantic argument over the term &quot;voluntary&quot;.  Anarcho-capitalists simply do not use the term in that latter sense in their philosophy, believing that sense to be morally irrelevant. Other critics argue that employment is involuntary because the distributions of wealth that make it necessary for some individuals to serve others by way of contract are supported by the enforcement of coercive private property systems.  This is a deeper argument relating to [[distributive justice]].  Some of these critics appeal to an end-state theory of justice, while anarcho-capitalists (and [[propertarian]]s in general) appeal to an entitlement theory.  Other critics regard private property itself to either be an aggressive institution or a potentially aggressive one, rather than necessarily a defensive one, and thus reject claims that relationships based on unequal private property relations could be &quot;voluntary&quot;.

Critics also point out that anarcho-capitalist ethics do not entail any positive moral obligation to help others in need (see ''[[altruism]]'', the ethical doctrine).  Like other [[right libertarianism|right libertarians]], anarcho-capitalists may argue that no such moral obligation exists or argue that if a moral obligation to help others does exist that there is an overarching moral obligation to refrain from initiating coercion on individuals to enforce it. Anarcho-capitalists believe that helping others should be a matter of free personal choice, and do not recognize any form of social obligation arising from an individual's presence in a society.  They, like all right libertarians, believe in a distinction between negative and positive rights in which [[negative rights]] should be recognized as being legitimate, and [[positive rights]] rejected.  Critics often dismiss this stance as being unethical or selfish, or reject the legitimacy of the distinction between positive and negative rights. (Critics thereby redefine selfish to not include forcing other people to do what you want and disregarding the wishes of others.)

[[Property]] ownership rights and their extent are a source of contention among different philosophies.  Most see the rights as less absolute than anarcho-capitalists do.  The main issues are what kinds of things are valid property, and what constitutes abandonment of property.  The first is contentious even among anarcho-capitalists: there is disagreement over the validity of intellectual property&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Wendy (1995) [http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/libhe/libhe014.htm Intellectual Property:The Late Nineteenth Century Libertarian Debate] Libertarian Heritage No. 14 ISBN 1856372812 Retrieved [[24 June]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; — intangible goods that are not economically scarce.  Some supporters of private property but critics of anarcho-capitalism may question whether unused land is valid property ([[Agorism]], [[Georgism]], [[geolibertarianism]], [[individualist anarchism]]).  The second issue is a common objection among socialists who do not believe in absentee ownership.  Anarcho-capitalists have strong abandonment criteria — one maintains ownership (more or less) until one agrees to trade or gift it.  The critics of this view tend to have weaker abandonment criteria; for example, one loses ownership (more or less) when one stops personally using it.  Also, the idea of original appropriation is anathema to most types of [[socialism]], as well as any philosophy that takes common ownership of land and [[natural resources]] as a premise.  There are also philosophies that view any ownership claims on land and natural resources as immoral and illegitimate, thus rejecting anarcho-capitalism as a philosophy that takes private ownership of land as a premise.

[[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian]] critics simply argue that anarcho-capitalism does not maximize utility, contending that it would fall far short of that goal. This kind of criticism comes from a variety of different political views and ideologies, and different critics have different views on which other system does or would do a better job of bringing the greatest benefits to the greatest number of people.  Anarcho-capitalists consider the nonaggression axiom to be a &quot;side-constraint&quot; on civilized human action&lt;ref name=Nozick-1973/&gt;, or a necessary condition for human society to be beneficial ([[Herbert Spencer]], Murray Rothbard), and thus should not be used as a trade-off for vague utilitarian values.  Another response, implied by [[Austrian economics]], is to argue that personal utility is not an [[additive]] quantity, therefore concluding that all utilitarian arguments, which invariably rely on aggregation of personal utilities, are logically and mathematically invalid.

Finally there are a host of questions about uncertainty raised by Mises and other Austrians, who argue for a different means of [[risk assessment]].

An area that is often overlooked is the influence that Austrian school ideas have had on Keynesian [[macroeconomics]]. The source of this influence is the period of time where the [[London School of Economics]] brought in Hayek and other &quot;continental&quot; economists. While their students &quot;flew the coop&quot;, refusing to join the Austrian school, many of the concepts, particularly relating time to the value of capital and its importance, would find their way into the work of Keynesians such as [[John Hicks]].  [[Alan Greenspan]], speaking of the originators of the School, said in 2000, &quot;the Austrian school have reached far into the future from when most of them practiced and have had a profound and, in my judgment, probably an irreversible effect on how most mainstream economists think in this country.&quot; The long-time U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman said he attended a seminar hosted by Ludwig von Mises. [http://www.usagold.com/gildedopinion/greenspan-gold.html]

== Analytical framework ==
Austrian economists reject observation as a tool applicable to economics, saying that while it is appropriate in the natural sciences where factors can be isolated in laboratory conditions, acting human beings are too complex for this treatment. Instead one should isolate the logical processes of human action - a discipline named &quot;[[praxeology]]&quot; by [[Ludwig von Mises]].

Austrians view [[entrepreneurship]] as the driving force in [[economic development]], see [[private property]] as essential to the efficient use of resources, and often see government interference in market processes as counterproductive.

As with neoclassical economists, Austrians reject [[classical economics|classical]] cost of production theories, most famously the [[labor theory of value]]. Instead they explain value by reference to the subjective preferences of individuals. This psychological aspect to Menger's economics has been attributed to the school's birth in turn of the century [[Vienna]]. [[Supply and demand]] are explained by aggregating over the decisions of individuals, following the precepts of [[methodological individualism]], which asserts that only individuals and not collectives make decisions, and [[marginalist]] arguments, which compare the costs and benefits for incremental changes.

Contemporary neo-Austrian economists claim to adopt [[economic subjectivism]] more consistently than any other school of economics and reject many neoclassical formalisms. For example, while neoclassical economics formalizes the economy as an [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] system with supply and demand in balance, Austrian economists emphasize its dynamic, perpetually dis-equilibrated nature.

The core of the Austrian framework can be summarized as taking a subjectivist approach to marginal economics, and a focus on the idea that theory should absolutely overrule observation. Austrians focus completely on the [[opportunity cost]] of goods, as opposed to balancing downside or disutility costs. It is an Austrian assertion that everyone is ''better'' off in a mutually voluntary exchange, or they would not have carried it out. A fuller explanation of this in more exact terms is [http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/margrev/oppcost.htm available at the New School's economic pages].

This focus on opportunity cost alone means that their interpretation of the [[time value]] of a good has a strict relationship: since goods will be as restricted by scarcity at a later point in time as they are now, the strict relationship between investment and time must also hold. A factory making goods next year is worth as much less as the goods it is making next year are worth. This means that the business cycle is driven by miscoordination between sectors of the same economy, caused by money not carrying incentive information correct about present choices, rather than within a single economy where money causes people to make bad decisions about how to spend their time. This means, in the Austrian context, the correct way to prevent imbalances in the economy is to make people want to buy the correct goods, rather than controlling when people buy goods.

== Contributions ==
Some contributions of Austrian economists:

* A theory of distribution in which factor [[price]]s result from the [[imputation (economics)|imputation]] of prices of consumer goods to goods of &quot;higher order&quot;, that is goods used in the production of consumer goods (goods of the first order).
* An emphasis on [[opportunity cost]] and reservation demand in defining [[marginal theory of value|value]], and a refusal to consider supply as an otherwise independent cause of value. (The British economist [[Philip Wicksteed]] adopted this perspective.)
* An emphasis on the forward-looking nature of choice, seeing time as the root of uncertainty within economics (see also [[time preference]]).
* A fundamental rejection of mathematical methods in economics seeing the function of economics as investigating the essences rather than the specific quantities of economic phenomena. This was seen as an evolutionary, or &quot;genetic-causal&quot;, approach against the stresses of [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] and [[perfect competition]] found in mainstream Neoclassical economics (see also [[praxeology]]).
* [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]]'s critique of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] centered around the untenability of the [[labor theory of value]] in the light of the [[transformation problem]]. There was also the connected argument that capitalists do not exploit workers; they accommodate workers by providing them with income well in advance of the revenue from the output they helped to produce.
* [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]]'s capital theory, which equates [[capital intensity]] with the degree of [[roundaboutness]] of production processes.
* The Mises-Hayek [[business cycle]] theory, which explains depression as a reaction to an intertemporal production structure fostered by [[monetary policy]] setting [[interest rate]]s inconsistent with individual time preferences.
* Hayek's concept of [[intertemporal equilibrium]]. ([[John Hicks]] took over this theory in his discussion of temporary equilibrium in ''Value and Capital,'' a book very influential on the development of neoclassical economics after World War II.)
* Mises and Hayek's view of prices as permitting agents to make use of [[dispersed knowledge|dispersed tacit knowledge]].
* The [[time preference theory of interest]], which explains interest rates through [[intertemporal choice]] - the different time preferences of the borrower or lender - rather than as a price paid for a [[factor of production]].
* Stressing uncertainty in the making of economic decisions, rather than relying on &quot;[[Homo economicus]]&quot; or the rational man who was fully informed of all circumstances impinging on his decisions. The fact that perfect knowledge never exists, means that all economic activity implies risk.
* Seeing the entrepreneurs' role as collecting and evaluating information and acting on risks.
* The [[economic calculation debate]] between Austrian and [[Marxist]] economists, with the Austrians claiming that Marxism is flawed because prices could not be set to recognize opportunity costs of factors of production, and so [[socialism]] could not calculate best uses in the same way [[capitalism]] does.

An '''abscess''' is a collection of [[pus]] collected in a cavity formed by the tissue on the basis of an [[infection|infectious]] process (usually caused by [[bacterium|bacteria]] or [[parasite]]s) or other foreign materials (e.g. splinters or bullet wounds). It is a [[immune system|defensive reaction]] of the tissue to prevent the spread of infectious materials to other parts of the body.

The organisms or foreign materials that gain access to a part of tissue kill the local [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, release toxins and trigger an [[inflammation|inflammatory response]] by drawing huge amounts of [[white blood cell]]s to the area and increasing the regional [[blood]] flow. So, pus is a collection of local dead tissue cells, white blood cells, infecting organisms or foreign material and toxins released by both organisms and blood cells. The final structure of the abscess is an abscess wall that is formed by the adjacent healthy cells in an attempt to build a barrier around the pus that limits the infected material from neighbouring structures. 

==Manifestations==
The cardinal symptoms and signs of any kind of inflammatory process are redness, heat, swelling and pain. Abscesses may occur in any kind of solid tissue but most frequently on skin surface (where they may be superficial pustules ([[boil]]s) or deep skin abscesses), in the lungs, [[brain abscess|brain]], kidneys and tonsils.  Major complications are spreading of the abscess material to adjacent or remote tissues and extensive regional tissue death ([[gangrene]]).  Abscesses in most parts of the body rarely heal themselves, so prompt medical attention is indicated at the first suspicion of an abscess.

==Treatment==
The abscess should be inspected to identify if foreign objects are a cause, requiring surgical removal.  [[Surgery|Surgical]] drainage of the abscess (e.g. [[Lancing (Surgical Procedure)|lancing]]) is usually indicated once the abscess has developed from a harder serous inflammation to a softer [[pus]] stage.  As ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' [[bacteria]] is a common cause, an anti-Staphylococcus antibiotic such as [[Flucloxacillin]] or [[dicloxacillin]] is used .  It is important to note that [[antibiotic]] therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective.  In critical areas where surgery presents a high risk (such as the [[brain]]), surgery may be delayed or used as a last resort.  The drainage of the lung abscess may be performed by positioning the patient in a way that enables the contents to be discharged via the [[respiratory tract]].  Warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for skin abscess.

==Perianal abscess==
Perianal abscesses can be seen in patients with for example [[inflammatory bowel disease]] (such as [[Crohn's disease]]) or [[diabetes]].  Often the abscess will start as an internal wound caused by ulceration or hard stool.  This wound typically becomes infected as a result of the normal presence of feces in the rectal area, and then develops into an abscess.  This often presents itself as a lump of tissue near the [[anus]] which grows larger and more painful with the passage of time.  

Like other abscesses, perianal abscesses may require prompt medical treatment, such as an incision and debridement or [[Lancing (surgical procedure)|lancing]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''''Abwehr''''' was a [[Germany|German]] [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] organization from [[1921]] to [[1944]]. The verb ''abwehren'' means &quot;to ward off&quot;, implying [[counterespionage]]; this term was used as a concession to [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] demands that Germany's post-[[World War I]] intelligence activities be for &quot;defensive&quot; purposes only. After [[February 4]], [[1938]], its name in full was '''''Amt Ausland/Abwehr im Oberkommando der Wehrmacht''''' (Foreign Bureau/Defence of the Armed Forces High Command).

Despite its name, the purpose of the Abwehr was to obtain military intelligence concerning nations of interest to the German government. Its headquarters were located at 76/78 Tirpitzufer in [[Berlin]], adjacent to the offices of the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]] (OKW).

==The Abwehr before Canaris==
The Abwehr was created in 1921 as part of the [[Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Ministry of Defence]] when Germany was allowed to form the [[Reichswehr]], the [[Armed Forces|military organization]] of the [[Weimar Republic]]. The first head was Major Friedrich Gempp, a former deputy to [[Walther Nicolai|Col. Walther Nicolai]], the head of German inteligence during World War I. At that time it was composed of only three officers and seven former officers plus a clerical staff. By the [[1920s]] it was organized into three sections:

*I. [[Reconnaissance]]
*II. [[Cipher]] and Radio Monitoring
*III. Counterespionage

The [[German Navy|German Navy's]] intelligence staff merged with the Abwehr in [[1928]].

In the [[1930s]], with the rise of the [[Nazi]] movement, the Ministry of Defence was reorganized; surprisingly, on [[June 7]], [[1932]], a naval officer, Capt. Konrad Patzig, was named chief of the Abwehr, despite the fact that it was staffed largely by Army officers. But perhaps not surprisingly, due to the small size of the organization and its limited importance at that time, it was unsuitable for a more ambitious Army officer. Another possible factor was that naval officers had more foreign experience than their Army counterparts and understood more of foreign affairs. However, all three services eventually developed their own intelligence staff.

Because of Abwehr-sponsored reconnaissance flights across the border with [[Poland]], Patzig soon had confrontations with [[Heinrich Himmler]], head of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. Army leaders feared that the flights would endanger the secret plans for an attack on Poland. Patzig was fired in January [[1935]] as a result, and was sent to command the new [[pocket battleship]] ''[[Admiral Graf Spee]]''; he later became Chief of Naval Personnel. His replacement was another Reichsmarine captain, [[Wilhelm Canaris]].

==The Abwehr under Canaris==
===Before the War===
[[Image:Wilhelmcanaris.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Wilhelm Canaris]]

Before he took over the Abwehr on [[January 1]], the soon-to-be Admiral Canaris was warned by Patzig of attempts by Himmler and [[Reinhard Heydrich]] to take over all German intelligence organs. Canaris, a master of backroom dealings which were so much a part of life, thought he knew how to deal with them. But even while he tried to maintain an at-least cordial relationship with them, the antagonism between the Abwehr and the SS did not stop with Canaris at the helm.

It came to a head in [[1937]] when [[Adolf Hitler]] decided to help [[Josef Stalin]] in the latter's purge against the [[Red Army|Soviet military]]. Hitler ordered that the German Army staff should be kept in the dark about Stalin's intentions, for fear that they would warn their Soviet counterparts.  Accordingly, special SS teams, accompanied by burglary experts from the criminal police, broke into the secret files of the General Staff and the Abwehr and removed documents related to German-Soviet collaboration. To conceal the thefts, fires were started at the break-ins, which included Abwehr headquarters.

When Hitler replaced the [[Ministry of War]] with the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW), the Abwehr became its intelligence agency, although with some degree of independence therefrom. Canaris reorganized the agency in [[1938]], establishing the following major departments, which existed until its dissolution:

* I. [[Espionage]]
** '''G'''      false documents
** '''H West''' army west (Anglo-American intelligence)
** '''H Ost'''  army east (Soviet intelligence)
** '''Ht'''     army technical
** '''i'''      communications
** '''L'''      airforce
** '''M'''      naval
** '''T/Lw'''   technical air force
** '''W'''      economics
* II. [[Sabotage]] and special tasks
* III. Counterespionage

Both Army and Navy officers headed these sections.

In this reorganizaton, Canaris took care to surround himself with a hand-picked staff, notably his second-in-command, [[Hans Oster]] and [[Erwin Lahousen|Erwin von Lahousen]], Section II Chief. All but one were not members of the Nazi party. The exception was Rudolf Bamler, who was appointed as chief of Section III to cement Himmler's trust in him, but Canaris made sure to keep a tight leash on him and gave him limited access to operational information.

===The Abwehr During World War II===
Under Canaris the Abwehr expanded and proved relatively efficient during the early years of the war. Its most notable success was [[Operation Nordpol]], which was an operation against the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] underground network, which at the time was supported by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Special Operations Executive]]. In March [[1941]], the Germans forced a captured SOE radio operator to transmit messages to Britain in a code that the Germans had obtained. Even though the operator gave every indication that he was compromised, the receiver in Britain did not notice this. Thus the Germans had been able to penetrate the Dutch operation and maintained this state of affairs for two years, capturing agents that were sent and sending false intelligence and [[sabotage]] reports until the British caught on.

But it was ineffective overall for several reasons. Much of its intelligence was deemed politically unacceptable to the German leadership. Moreover, it was in direct competition/conflict with SS intelligence activities under Reinhard Heydrich and [[Walter Schellenberg]]. The animosity between the SS and Abwehr did not stop there. Many of the Abwehr's operatives — including Canaris himself — were in fact anti-Nazi and were involved in many assassination attempts against Hitler, including the most serious one oin serious damage to tourist [[infrastructure]] and periods of sharp reductions in visitor numbers. In 1999 the budding offshore financial sector was seriously hurt by financial sanctions imposed by the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] as a result of the loosening of its money-laundering controls. The government has made efforts to comply with international demands in order to get the sanctions lifted. The dual island nation's agricultural production is mainly directed to the domestic market; the sector is constrained by the limited water supply and labor shortages that reflect the pull of higher wages in tourism and construction. Manufacturing comprises enclave-type assembly for export with major products being bedding, handicrafts, and electronic components. Prospects for economic growth in the medium term will continue to depend on income growth in the industrialized world, especially in the US, which accounts for about one-third of all tourist arrivals. Estimated overall economic growth for 2000 was 2.5%. Inflation has trended down going from above 2 percent in the 1995-99 period and estimated at 0 percent in 2000.

To lessen its vulnerability to natural disasters, Antigua has been diversifying its economy. Transportation, communications and financial services are becoming important.

Antigua is a member of the [[Eastern Caribbean Currency Union]] (ECCU). The [[Eastern Caribbean Central Bank]] (ECCB) issues a common currency (the [[East Caribbean Dollar]]) for all members of the ECCU. The ECCB also manages monetary policy, and regulates and supervises commercial banking activities in its member countries.

Antigua and Barbuda is a beneficiary of the U.S. [[Caribbean Basin Initiative]]. Its 1998 exports to the U.S. were valued at aboutUS $3 million and its U.S. imports totaled about US $84 million. It also belongs to the predominantly English-speaking [[Caribbean_Community|Caribbean Community (CARICOM]]).

[[Antigua and Barbuda]] maintains diplomatic relations with the [[United States]], [[Canada]] the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[People's Republic of China]], as well as with many Latin American countries and neighboring Eastern Caribbean states. It is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Organization of American States]], the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]], and the Eastern Caribbean's [[Regional Security System]] (RSS).

As a member of [[CARICOM]], Antigua and Barbuda supported efforts by the United States to implement UN Security Council Resolution 940, designed to facilitate the departure of Haiti's de facto authorities from power. The country agreed to contribute personnel to the multinational force which restored the democratically elected government of Haiti in October 1994.

In May 1997, Prime Minister Bird joined 14 other Caribbean leaders and President Clinton for the first-ever U.S.-regional summit in Bridgetown, Barbados. The summit strengthened the basis for regional cooperation on justice and counter-narcotics issues, finance and development, and trade.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!-- NOTE. Please first read the section [[#Etymology and usage]] below if you intend to insert corrections --&gt;{{dablink|This article describes the development and history of traditional anti-Semitism.  A separate article exists on the more recent concept of the [[New anti-Semitism]].}}
[[Image:Der ewige jude.jpg|thumb|''[[Der ewige Jude|The Eternal Jew]]'': 1937 German poster. In his hands are &quot;Zuckerbrot und Peitsche&quot;, or &quot;cookies and knout&quot;, an allusion to a saying similar to that of &quot;carrot and stick&quot;.]]
'''Anti-Semitism''' (alternatively spelled '''antisemitism''') is hostility toward or [[prejudice]] against [[Jew]]s as a religious, ethnic, or racial group, which can range from individual [[hatred]] to institutionalized, violent [[persecution]]. The highly explicit [[Nuremberg laws|ideology]] of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazism]] was the most extreme example of this phenomenon, leading to a [[genocide]] of the European Jewry. Anti-Semitism has historically taken different forms:
*[[Religion|Religious]] anti-Semitism, or [[anti-Judaism]]. Before the 19th century, most anti-Semitism was primarily religious in nature, based on [[Christian]] or [[Islam]]ic interactions with and interpretations of [[Judaism]]. Since Judaism was generally the largest [[minority]] religion in Christian [[Europe]] and much of the Islamic world, Jews were often the primary targets of religiously-motivated violence and persecution from Christian, and to a lesser degree, Islamic rulers. Unlike anti-Semitism in general, this form of prejudice is directed at the religion itself, and so generally does not affect those of Jewish [[kinship and descent|ancestry]] who have [[religious conversion|converted]] to another religion, although the case of [[Converso]]s in [[Spain]] was a notable exception. Laws banning Jewish religious practices may be rooted in religious anti-Semitism, as were the [[expulsion]]s of the Jews that happened throughout the [[Middle Ages]].
*[[Racism|Racial]] anti-Semitism. With its origins in the [[cultural anthropology|anthropological]] ideas of [[race]] that started during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], racial anti-Semitism became the dominant form of anti-Semitism from the late 19th century through today.  Racial anti-Semitism replaced the hatred of Judaism as a religion with the idea that the Jews themselves were a racially distinct group, regardless of their religious practice, and that they were inferior or worthy of animosity. With the rise of racial anti-Semitism, [[conspiracy theories]] about Jewish plots in which Jews were somehow acting in concert to dominate the world became a popular form of anti-Semitic expression. 

Some analysts and Jewish groups believe that there is a distinctly new form of late 20th century anti-Semitism, often called [[new anti-Semitism]], which borrows language and concepts from [[anti-Zionism]], but which attacks Jews as a group, rather than [[Zionism]] as a movement. A second group of observers [[Anti-Zionism#Anti-Zionism dictionary definitions|controversially]] identify anti-Zionism itself with anti-Semitism, arguing that anti-Zionism, &quot;advocates denial of the right to self-determination of the Jewish people&quot; (Matas 2005, p. 31).

== Etymology and usage ==
[[Image:Bookcover-1880-Marr-German uber Juden.jpg|left|thumb|120px|Cover page of Marr's ''The Way to Victory of Germanicism over Judaism'', 1880 edition]]
The word ''antisemitic'' (''{{lang|de|antisemitisch}}'' in German) was probably first used in 1860 by the Jewish [[scholar]] [[Moritz Steinschneider]] in the [[phrase]] &quot;antisemitic prejudices&quot; ({{lang-de|&quot;antisemitische Vorurteile&quot;}}). Steinschneider used this phrase to characterize [[Ernest Renan]]'s ideas about how &quot;[[Semitic]] races&quot; were inferior to &quot;[[Aryan]] races.&quot; These pseudo-scientific theories had become quite widespread in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, especially as [[Prussia]]n nationalistic historian [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] did much to promote this form of racism. In Treitschke's writings ''Semitic'' was practically [[synonym|synonymous]] with ''Jewish''. 
German political agitator [[Wilhelm Marr]] coined the related [[German language|German]] word ''Antisemitismus'' in his book ''&quot;The Way to Victory of Germanicism over Judaism&quot;'' in 1879.  Marr used the phrase to mean ''Jew-hatred'' or ''Judenhass,'' and he used the new word ''antisemitism'' to make hatred of the Jews seem rational and sanctioned by scientific knowledge. Marr's book became very popular, and in the same year he founded the ''&quot;League of Anti-Semites&quot;'' (&quot;Antisemiten-Liga&quot;), the first [[Germany|German]] organization committed specifically to combatting the alleged threat to Germany posed by the Jews, and advocating their [[population transfer|forced removal]] from the country. 

So far as can be ascertained, the word was first widely printed in 1881, when Marr published ''&quot;Zwanglose Antisemitische Hefte,&quot;'' and [[Wilhelm Scherer]] used the term &quot;Antisemiten&quot; in the ''&quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot;'' of January. The related word ''[[semitism]]'' was coined around 1885. See also the coinage of the term &quot;[[Definitions of Palestine and Palestinian#Referring to Jews in a national rather than religious sense|Palestinian]]&quot; by Germans to refer to the nation or people known as [[Jew]]s, as distinct from the religion of [[Judaism]]. 

Despite the use of the prefix &quot;anti,&quot; the terms ''Semitic'' and ''Anti-Semitic'' are not [[antonym]]s. To avoid the confusion of the [[misnomer]], many scholars on the subject (such as [[Emil Fackenheim]] of the [[Hebrew University]]) now favor the unhyphenated term ''antisemitism''. [[Yehuda Bauer]] articulated this view in his writings and lectures: (the term) &quot;Antisemitism, especially in its [[hyphen]]ated spelling, is inane nonsense, because there is no [[Semitism]] that you can be [[anti]] to.&quot; [http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf], also in his ''A History of the Holocaust'', p.52) 

The term ''anti-Semitism'' has historically referred to prejudice towards [[Jew]]s alone, and this was the only use of this word for more than a century. It does not traditionally refer to prejudice toward other people who speak [[Semitic language]]s (e.g. [[Arab]]s or [[Syriacs]]). [[Bernard Lewis]], Professor of Near Eastern Studies Emeritus at Princeton University, says that &quot;Anti-Semitism has never anywhere been concerned with anyone but Jews.&quot;[http://middleeastinfo.org/library/lewis_antisemitism.html] 

In recent decades some groups have argued that the term should be extended to include prejudice against Arabs, [[Anti-Arabism]], in the context of accusations of Arab anti-Semitism; further, some, including the [[Islamic Association of Palestine]], have argued that this implies that Arabs can not, ''by definition'', be anti-Semitic, despite the acknowledged high level of [[Arab anti-Semitism]]. The argument for such extension comes out of the claim that since the [[Semitic]] [[language family]] includes Arabic, Hebrew and Aramaic languages, and the historical term &quot;Semite&quot; refers to all those who consider themselves descendants of the Biblical [[Shem]], anti-Semitism should be likewise inclusive. This usage is not generally accepted.

=== Definitions of the term  ===
[[Image:Antisemiticroths.jpg|thumb|left|Anti-semitic caricature (France, 1898)]]

Though the general definition of anti-Semitism is hostility or prejudice towards [[Jew]]s, a number of authorities have developed more formal definitions. [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] scholar and [[City University of New York]] professor Helen Fein's definition has been particularly influential. She defines anti-Semitism as &quot;a persisting latent structure of hostile beliefs towards Jews as a collective manifested in individuals as attitudes, and in culture as myth, ideology, folklore and imagery, and in actions – social or legal discrimination, political mobilisation against the Jews, and collective or state violence – which results in and/or is designed to distance, displace, or destroy Jews as Jews.&quot;

Professor Dietz Bering of the [[University of Cologne]] further expanded on Professor Fein's definition by describing the structure of anti-Semitic beliefs. To anti-Semites: &quot;Jews are not only partially but totally bad by nature, that is, their bad traits are incorrigible. Because of this bad nature: (1) Jews have to be seen not as individuals but as a collective. (2) Jews remain essentially alien in the surrounding societies. (3) Jews bring disaster on their 'host societies' or on the whole world, they are doing it secretly, therefore the anti-Semites feel obliged to unmask the conspiratorial, bad Jewish character.&quot;

There have been a number of efforts by international and governmental bodies to formally define anti-Semitism.  The United States Department of State defines anti-Semitism in its 2005 Report on Global Anti-Semitism as &quot;hatred toward Jews—individually and as a group—that can be attributed to the Jewish religion and/or ethnicity.&quot;

In 2005, the [[European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia]] (EUMC), a body of the [[European Union]], developed a more detailed working definition: &quot;Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities. In addition, such manifestations could also target the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. Antisemitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for 'why things go wrong'.&quot; 

The EUMC then listed &quot;contemporary examples of anti-Semitism in public life, the media, schools, the workplace, and in the religious sphere.&quot;  These included: Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews; accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group; denying the Holocaust; and accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations. The EUMC also discussed ways in which attacking Israel could be anti-Semitic, depending on the context (see [[#Anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism|anti-Zionism]] below). [http://eumc.eu.int/eumc/material/pub/AS/AS-WorkingDefinition-draft.pdf]

==Earliest Antisemitism==
The earliest occurrence of antisemitism has been the subject of debate among scholars.  Professor Peter Schafer of the Freie University of Berlin has argued that antisemitism was first spread by &quot;the Greek retelling of ancient Egyptian prejudices&quot;.  In view of the anti-Jewish writings of the Egyptian priest Manetho, Schafer suggests that anti-Semitism may have emerged &quot;in Egypt alone&quot;.  The hostility commonly faced by Jews in the Diaspora has been extensively described by John M. G. Barclay of the University of Durham.  The ancient Jewish philosopher [[Philo of Alexandria]] described an attack on Jews in Alexandria in 38 CE in ''Flaccus'', in which thousands of Jews died.  In the analysis of Pieter W. Van Der Horst, the cause of the violence in Alexandria was that Jews had been portrayed as misanthropes.  Gideon Bohak has argued that early animosity against Jews was not anti-Judaism unless it arose from attitudes held against Jews alone.  Using this stricter definition, Bohak says that many Greeks had animosity toward any group they regarded as barbarians.  The 150 BCE suppression of Jewish religious practice by use of deadly force against civilians, as recounted in [[1 Maccabees]], then qualifies as anti-Judaism in a broader sense of the term than is used by Bohak.  There are other examples of [[History of anti-Semitism#Ancient animosity towards Jews|ancient animosity towards Jews]] that are not considered by all to fall within the definition of anti-semitism.

===Anti-Judaism in the New Testament===
The New Testament is a collection of 'books' written by various authors.  Most of this collection was written by the end of the first century.  The majority of the New Testament was written by Jews who became followers of Jesus, and all but two books (Luke and Acts) are traditionally attributed to such Jewish followers.  Nevertheless, there are a number of passages in the New Testament that some see as anti-Semitic, or have been used for anti-Semitic purposes, most notably:

:Jesus speaking to a group of [[Pharisees]]: &quot;''I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. I speak of what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have heard from your father.  They answered him, &quot;Abraham is our father.&quot; Jesus said to them, &quot;If you were Abraham's children, you would do what Abraham did. ... You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies. But, because I tell the truth, you do not believe me. Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me? He who is of God hears the words of God; the reason why you do not hear them is you are not of God.''&quot; ([[Book of John|John]] 8:37-39, 44-47, [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]]) 

:[[Saint Stephen|Stephen]] speaking before a synagogue council just before his execution: &quot;''You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so do you. Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered, you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it.''&quot; ([[Book of Acts|Acts]] 7:51-53, RSV)

:&quot;''Behold, I will make those of the synagoguee appointed by the [[US Secretary of the Interior]])

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Economy - overview:'''
This is a traditional [[Polynesia]]n economy in which more than 90% of the land is communally owned. Economic activity is strongly linked to the [[United States|US]], with which American Samoa conducts the great bulk of its foreign trade. [[Tuna]] [[fishing]] and tuna processing plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna the primary export. Transfers from the [[US Government]] add substantially to American Samoa's economic well-being. Attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote location, its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. Tourism, a developing sector, may be held back by the current financial difficulties in East Asia.

The '''[[politics]] of [[Australia]]''' take place within the framework of [[democracy|parliamentary democracy]]. The government of Australia is a [[federation]], and Australians elect state and territory legislatures as well as a [[bicameral]] [[Parliament of Australia]] based on the [[Westminster System]]. 

At the national level, elections are held at least once every three years. The [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] can advise the Governor-General to call an election for the House of Representatives at any time, but Senate elections can only be held within certain periods prescribed in the [[Australian Constitution|Constitution]]. The last general election was in [[October]] [[2004]]. The [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia]] consists of two [[bicameralism|chambers]]:
* The [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] has 150 members, elected for a three year term in single-seat [[constituency|constituencies]] with a system of alternative vote known as [[instant-runoff voting | preferential voting]]. 
* The [[Australian Senate|Senate]] has 76 members, elected through a preferential system in 12-seat state [[constituency|constituencies]] and two-seat territorial [[constituency|constituencies]] with a system of single non-transferable vote. Electors choose territorial senators for a three-year term. The state senators serve for a six-year term, with half of the seats renewed every three years. 

==Political parties and elections==
{{elect|List of political parties in Australia|Elections in Australia}}
{{Australian legislative election, 2004}}
More info: [[Australian legislative election, 2004]]''

Three political parties dominate Australian politics. Of these, two govern together in a [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]]:
*The [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] is a party of the centre-right which broadly represents business, the suburban middle classes and many rural people.
*Its junior coalition partner is the [[National Party of Australia]], formerly the Country Party and now known for electoral purposes as &quot;The Nationals&quot;, a [[conservative]] party which represents rural interests.
*The [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) is a [[Social democracy|social democratic]] party founded by the [[trade union]] movement and broadly represents the urban working class, although it increasingly has a base of middle class support. 

Minor parties include:
*The [[Australian Democrats]], a party of middle-class [[liberals]]
*The [[Australian Greens]], a [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] and [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] party
*The [[Country Liberal Party]], a party which only represents the Northern Territory. It is part of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]/[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]]
*The [[Family First Party]], a party appealing to conservative [[Christianity|Christian]]s.

The proportional representation system allows these parties to win seats in the [[Australian Senate]] and in the state upper houses, but they have usually been unable to win seats in the House of Representatives (the Greens won a House seat at a [[2002]] [[by-election]], but lost it in the [[Australian legislative election, 2004|2004 general election]]).

The Liberal/National coalition came to power in the March [[1996]] election, ending 13 years of Labor government and making [[John Howard]] Prime Minister. He was subsequently re-elected in October [[1998]], November [[2001]] and October [[2004]]. The coalition now holds a comfortable majority in the House of Representatives. In the Senate, the Liberal/National coalition was in a minority until the [[Australian legislative election, 2004|2004 election]], but from July [[2005]] it has a working majority there. Until [[2004]], lacking a majority in the Senate, the Liberal/National coalition relied on negotiations with the smaller parties and independents to secure the passage of legislation. 

Since its election, Howard's conservative coalition has moved to reduce the government's fiscal deficit and the influence of [[Australian labour movement|organised labour]], placing more emphasis on [[Enterprise Bargaining Agreement|workplace-based collective bargaining]] for wages. The Howard government also accelerated the pace of privatisation of government-owned enterprises that began with the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]] Labor government. During its first two terms, the government's most sweeping change was  the introduction of a [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|goods and services tax]]. With the re-election of the Howard government in 2004, several significant and controversial bills have been passed, due to the government's newly-acquired Senate majority. These major changes have included a [[Australian industrial relations legislation, 2005|radical revamp of industrial relations laws]], an introduction of [[voluntary student unionism]], and the full privatisation of telecommunications company [[Telstra]]. These changes have sparked major debate within Australia, forcing many critics to question whether the Howard government has lived up to its promise to use its Senate majority wisely.

The Howard government has reversed the foreign policy of its predecessor, placing renewed emphasis on relations with Australia's traditional allies, the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and downgrading support for the [[United Nations]] in favour of bilateralism. Both major parties support maintaining good relations with regional powers such as [[China]], [[Japan]] and [[Indonesia]], although issues such as the independence of [[East Timor]] have sometimes made this difficult. Australia has become increasingly involved in the internal difficulties of its smaller neighbours, such as [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Fiji]] and [[Nauru]].

The [[list of political parties in Australia]] comprises the names and federal leaders of significant political parties as well as the names of other parties, including formerly significant parties.

==Administrative divisions==
In the [[States and territories of Australia|states and territories]], elections are held at least once every four years (except in [[Queensland]], which has three-year terms). In [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]], election dates are fixed by legislation. However, the other [[Premiers of the Australian states|state premiers]] and territory Chief Ministers have the same discretion in calling elections as the Prime Minister at the national level. (See ''Main articles: [[Australian electoral system]], [[Electoral systems of the Australian states and territories]]'').  

Regional or local government within each state is handled by [[Local Government Area]]s and unlike other equivalent forms of local government such as those of the [[United States]], have relatively little power compared to the state governments (See ''Main article: [[Local government in Australia]]'').

They contain car manufacturing plants for [[Holden|General Motors Holden]] and [[Mitsubishi Motors Corporation|Mitsubishi]], and plants for medical equipment and [[electronic component]] production. Almost half of all cars produced in Australia are made in Adelaide.{{ref|carmanufacture}} The global media conglomerate [[News Corporation]] was founded in and until 2004 incorporated in Adelaide and is still considered its 'spiritual' home by [[Rupert Murdoch]]. Australia's largest oil company, [[Santos Limited|Santos]] (South Australia Northern Territory Oil Search) and the prominent South Australian brewery, [[Coopers Brewery|Coopers]] calls Adelaide their home. The collapse of the [[State Bank of South Australia|State Bank]] in 1992 resulted in large levels of state [[Public debt|debt]] (as much as A$4 billion). The collapse had meant that successive governments had enacted lean budgets, cutting [[Public finance|spending]], which had been a setback to the further [[Economic development|development]] of the city and state. The debt has recently been reduced with the State Government once again receiving a AAA+ Credit Rating.{{ref|creditrating}} The South Australian economy (very closely tied to Adelaide's) still enjoys a trade surplus and has higher per capita growth than Australia as a whole. {{ref|growth}}

Adelaide is home to a large proportion of Australia's defence industries which contribute over AUD$1 billion to South Australia's Gross State Product. 70% of Australian defence companies are located in Adelaide. The principal government military research institution, the [[Defence Science and Technology Organisation]], and other defence technology organisations such as [[Tenix Defence Systems|Tenix]] are located in [[Salisbury, South Australia|Salisbury]] near [[RAAF Base Edinburgh]] and others near [[Technology Park, Adelaide|Technology Park]]. The [[Australian Submarine Corporation]], based in the industrial suburb of [[Osborne, South Australia|Osborne]] was charged with constructing Australia's [[Collins class submarine|Collins Class]] [[Submarines]] and recently won a AUD$6 billion contract to construct the [[Royal Australian Navy|Royal Australian Navy's]] new air-warfare destroyers. {{ref|defencestate}}

There are 466 829 employed people in Adelaide, with 62.3% employed full-time and 35.1% employed part-time. In recent years there has been a growing trend towards part-time (which includes casual) employment, increasing from only 11.6% of the workplace in 1991, to over a third today. 15% of workers are employed in manufacturing, 5% in construction, 15% in retail trade, 11% in business services, 7% in education and 12% in health and community services.

==Education==

[[Image:Art Gallery of South Australia.JPG|280px|right|thumb|Art Gallery of South Australia]]
Adelaide is home to campuses of all three of South Australia's universities. The [[University of Adelaide]] is a member of the [[Group of Eight (Australian universities)|Group of Eight]] and was founded in 1874, making it the third oldest university in Australia. It has five campuses in the Adelaide area; one being its primary campus on [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]] and another being the [[National Wine Centre of Australia|National Wine Centre]]. The [[University of South Australia]] was formed in 1991 from a merger between the South Australian Institute of Technology and the South Australian Colleges of Advanced Education. Four of its six campuses are located in Adelaide, with two in the CBD itself. [[Flinders University]], located in [[Bedford Park, South Australia|Bedford Park]] is named after British navigator and explorer [[Matthew Flinders]] and was founded in 1966. It is a mid-sized institution with a medical school at the adjacent [[Flinders Medical Centre]]. Leading US private university, [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon]], is to establish two Adelaide campuses offering both Australian and US [[Academic degree|degrees]] in 2006. The Heinz School will specialise in [[Information technology|IT]] and government management and be based in [[Victoria Square, Adelaide|Victoria Square]], while another campus at [[Light Square, Adelaide|Light Square]] will specialise in new media and entertainment . These institutions attract students from across Australia and around the world, earning Adelaide’s international recognition as a [http://www.adelaide.sa.gov.au/council/publications/Brochures/IAEC_Adelaide_brochure_web.pdf &amp;#8216;City of Education&amp;#8217;].

School education in Adelaide is provided by a variety of public and private schools, which are the responsibility of the State Government. These schools operate under the [[South Australian Certificate of Education]] (SACE), with [[International Baccalaureate]]s (IB) offered at many as well. The [[Tertiary education|Tertiary Education]] system in Adelaide is extensive, with five out of eight centres of [[TAFE South Australia]] in the city itself, including the Douglas Mawson institute of Technology. They specialise in non-university higher education offering a viable alternative.

==Culture==
[[Image:Adel Convention Centre.jpg|280px|right|thumb|Adelaide Convention Centre, situated next to the [[River Torrens]].]]
[[Image:St Peters Cathedral.JPG|280px|right|thumb|St. Peters Cathedral, Adelaide]]

Adelaide is sometimes referred to as the 'City of Churches', although this is a reflection more on Adelaide's past than its present. Rumour has it that for every church that was built in Adelaide, a [[public house|pub]] was also built to serve the less pious. From its earliest, Adelaide attracted [[immigrant|immigrants]] from many countries, particularly German migrants escaping religious persecution. They brought with them the [[vine]] cuttings that founded the acclaimed wineries of the [[Barossa Valley]]. After the [[World War II|Second World War]] Italians, Greeks, Dutch, Polish, and possibly every other European nationality came to make a new start. An influx of Asian immigrants following the Vietnam War added to the mix. These new arrivals have blended to form a rich and diverse cuisine and vibrant restaurant culture.

Adelaide's [[The Arts|arts]] scene flourished in the 1970's under the leadership of premier [[Don Dunstan]], removing some of the more [[puritan|puritanical]] restrictions on cultural activities then prevalent around Australia.  Now the city is home to events such as the Barossa Music Festival, the [[Adelaide Festival of Arts]], [[Adelaide Film Festival]], [[Adelaide Festival of Ideas]], [[Come Out]] youth arts festival, the [[Adelaide Fringe Festival|Fringe Festival]], among others. [[WOMADelaide]], Australia's premier [[world music]] event, is now annually held in the scenic surrounds of [[Adelaide Botanic Gardens|Botanic Park]], emphasising Adelaide's dedication to the arts which has prevailed since the days of Don Dunstan.

The annual [[Royal Adelaide Show]], first held in 1840, began as a simple event for the state's farmers to show off their produce. Over time, it grew into a more general commercial [[fair]] held in early September in the inner suburb of [[Wayville, South Australia|Wayville]], with [[amusement ride|carnival ride]]s, food and entertainment surrounding the more traditional agricultural exhibitions and competitions.

The [[music of Adelaide]] has produced various musicians who have achieved both national and worldwide fame. Notably the [[Adelaide Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Adelaide Youth Orchestra]], [[The Mark of Cain]], [[The Superjesus]], [[Testeagles]], [[Cold Chisel]] and [[Eric Bogle]]. American artist [[Ben Folds]] considers Adelaide his second home, epitomised in his song &quot;Adelaide&quot; and resides here with his Adelaide-born wife for a number of months each year. The first [[Australian Idol]] winner, [[Guy Sebastian]] hails from the Adelaide suburb of [[Golden Grove, South Australia|Golden Grove]] and the popular Australian hip-hop outfit [[Hilltop Hoods]] reside in [[O'Halloran Hill, South Australia|O'Halloran Hill]].

===Media===
Newspapers in Adelaide are dominated by [[News Corp]] tabloid publications. The only South Australian daily newspaper is ''[[The Advertiser (Australia)|The Advertiser]]'', published by News six days per week, while the Sunday paper is the ''[[Sunday Mail (Adelaide)|Sunday Mail]]''. There are eleven suburban community newspapers published weekly, known collectively as the ''[[Messenger Newspapers]]'', also published by a subsidiary of News Corp. A recent addition to the print medium in the city is &quot;[[The Independent Weekly]]&quot;, providing one alternative view. Two national daily newspapers are circulated in the city - ''[[The Australian]]'' (Monday&amp;ndash;Friday) and its weekend publication, ''The Weekend Australian'' (Saturday), also published by News Corp., and ''[[The Australian Financial Review]]'' published by [[John Fairfax Holdings|Fairfax]]. ''[[The Adelaide Review]]''  is a free paper published fortnightly and other independent magazine-style papers are published, but are not as widely available.

All of the five Australian national networks broadcast both [[Analog television|analogue]] [[PAL]] and [[widescreen]] [[Digital television|digital]] services in Adelaide. They share three transmission towers on the ridge near the summit of [[Mount Lofty]]. The two government-funded stations are ''[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'' and ''[[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]''. The ''[[Seven Network]]'' and ''[[Network Ten]]'' both own their Adelaide stations ([[SAS-7]] and [[ADS-10]] respectively). Adelaide's [[NWS-9]] is affiliated with the ''[[Nine Network]]'' but is actually owned by [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]]. Adelaide also has a [[community television]] station, [[Channel 31]]. The [[Foxtel]] [[pay TV]] service is available as [[cable television]] in a few areas, as is [[satellite television]] to the entire metropolitan area. It is resold by a number of other brands, mostly telephone companies.

===Sport===
[[Image:Clipsal 500.jpg|280px|right|thumb|The annual Adelaide [[Clipsal 500]] race.]]
Adelaide hosted the [[Formula 1]] [[Australian Grand Prix]] from 1985 to 1995 on a [[Adelaide Street Circuit|street circuit]] in the city's eastern parklands. The Grand Prix became a source of pride and losing the Grand Prix to Melbourne in a surprise announcement left a void that has since been filled with the highly successful [[Adelaide 500|Clipsal 500]] [[V8 Supercar]] race event, held on a modified version of the same street circuit. 

Adelaide is the home of two [[Australian Football League]] teams: the [[Adelaide Crows]] and the [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide Football Club]]. A local [[Australian Rules Football]] league, the [[South Australian National Football League|SANFL]], is made up of nine teams from around Adelaide. Adelaide's professional [[football (soccer)|soccer]] team [[Adelaide United]] play in the [[A-League]], at [[Hindmarsh Stadium]], one of the few purpose built football stadiums in Australia. The [[Adelaide 36ers]] and the [[Adelaide_Fellas | Adelaide Fellas]] play in national basketball competitions, with home games at the Distinctive Homes Dome and the [[Adelaide Thunderbirds]] play in the national netball competition, with home games at [[ETSA Park]]. Most large sporting events take place at either [[AAMI Stadium]] (formerly Football Park) or the historic [[Adelaide Oval]], home of the [[Southern Redbacks]] Cricket Team. Adelaide hosts an international cricket test every summer, along with a number of [[one day international]] cricket matches. 

Adelaide has hosted the annual [[Tour Down Under]] bicycle race since 1999, an event which has gradually built an international reputation with each successive year it has been held. It is also host to the popular [[Bay to Birdwood]] run, featuring vintage and veteran cars from around the world.

==Infrastructure==
===Health===
Adelaide's first hospital was the [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]] (RAH), founded in [[1840]], it is one of the major hospitals in Adelaide and is a [[teaching hospital]] of the [[University of Adelaide]]. It has a capacity of 500 beds. Two other RAH campuses specialising in specific patient services located in the suburbs of Adelaide - the Hampstead Rehabilitation Centre in [[Northfield, South Australia|Northfield]], and the [[Glenside, South Australia|Glenside]] Campus Mental Health Service. The other two largest hospitals in the Adelaide area are the [[Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide|The Women's and Children's Hospital]] (305 beds), which is located on King William Road in [[North Adelaide]] and the Flinders Medical Centre (500 beds), which is located in [[Bedford Park, South Australia|Bedford Park]], [[South Australia]]. These hospitals are also associated with medical schools - the Women and Children's with the [[University of South Australia]]'s Adelaide Campus and the Flinders Medical Centre with [[Flinders University]].

===Transport===
{{Main|Transport in Adelaide}}
[[Image:Mountosmondinterechange_sefreeway.JPG|right|280px|thumb|The [[Mount Osmond, South Australia|Mount Osmond]] Interchange on the [[South Eastern Freeway]].]]
Being centrally located on the Australian mainland, Adelaide forms something of a strategic transport hub for east-west and north-south routes. The city itself has a limited [[public transport]] system, which is managed by and known as the [[Adelaide Metro]]. The Adelaide Metro consists of a contracted bus system including the [[Adelaide O-Bahn]] (a [[guided busway]]), metropolitan railways, and the historic Adelaide-[[Glenelg Tram]]. Road transport in Adelaide has historically been comparatively easier than many of the other Australian cities, with a well-defined city layout and wide multiple-lane roads from the beginning of its development. Historically, Adelaide was known as a &quot;twenty-minute city&quot;, with commuters having being able to travel from metropolitan outskirts to the city proper in roughly twenty minutes. However, these roads are now inadequate to cope with Adelaide's growing road traffic. {{ref|20mincity}}

The [[Adelaide International Airport]], located at [[West Beach, South Australia|West Beach]], is Australia's newest and most advanced airport terminal and is designed to serve in excess of 5.4 million passengers annually. The new dual international/domestic terminal was to replace the old and ageing terminals known locally as the 'tin sheds', and incorporates new state-of-the-art features, such as glass aerobridges and the ability to cater for the new Airbus A380. The airport is designed to handle 27 aircraft simultaneously and it is capable of processing 3,000 passengers per hour.

===Utilities===
Adelaide has three major energy companies, which provide gas and electricity to the population. ETSA Utilities is the former government-owned company (sold off by the [[John Olsen|Olsen]] Government in the 1990s) and the major player in the Adelaide electicity market. There are other smaller providers, [[AGL]], [[Energy Australia]] and [[Origin Energy]] who provide services in electricity and natural gas. There has been substantial criticism in recent years of the suburban electricity network due to its inability to cope with high-usage periods. Adelaide derives its electricity from a coal-fired plant at [[Torrens Island, South Australia|Torrens Island]] and connections to the national grid. Adelaide's water supply is gained from its reservoirs: [[Mount Bold Reservoir|Mount Bold]], [[Happy Valley Reservoir|Happy Valley]], Myponga, Millbrook, Hope Valley, Little Para and South Para. Further water demands result in the pumping of water from the [[River Murray]]. The provider of water services is by the government-owned [[SA Water]].

| '''Average Match oes not appear to have made any headway, however, and alpaca fiber was condemned as an unworkable material.  In [[1830]] Benjamin Outram, of Greetland, near Halifax, appears to have reattempted the spinning of this fibre, and, for the second time, alpaca was condemned.  These two attempts to use alpaca were failures owing to the style of fabric into which the yarn was woven &amp;mdash; a species of [[camlet]].  It was not until the introduction of cotton warps into the [[Bradford, England|Bradford]] trade about [[1836]] that the true qualities of alpaca could be developed in the fabric.  Where the [[cotton warp]] and [[mohair]] or alpaca weft plain-cloth came from is not known, but it was this simple yet ingenious structure which enabled [[Titus Salt]], then a young Bradford manufacturer, to use alpaca successfully.  Bradford is still the great spinning and manufacturing centre for alpaca, large quantities of yarns and cloths being exported annually to the continent and to the [[United States]], although the quantities naturally vary in accordance with the fashions in vogue, the typical &quot;alpaca-fabric&quot; being a very characteristic &quot;[[dress-fabric]].&quot; 

[[Image:Alpaca_MidSomerset_210805.jpg|thumb|200px|right| Alpacas on show in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]]]

Owing to the success in the manufacture of the various styles of alpaca cloths attained by Sir Titus Salt and other Bradford manufacturers, a great demand for alpaca wool arose, and this demand could not be met by the native product, for there seems to never have been any appreciable increase in the number of alpacas available.  Unsuccessful attempts were made to acclimatize the alpaca in England, on the European continent and in Australia, and even to cross certain English breeds of [[domestic sheep|sheep]] with the alpaca.  There is, however, a cross between the alpaca and the llama &amp;mdash; a true [[hybrid]] in every sense &amp;mdash; producing a material placed upon the Liverpool market under the name &quot;Huarizo&quot;. Crosses between the alpaca and vicuña have not proved satisfactory.  Current attempts to cross these two breeds are underway at farms in the United States. According to the Alpaca Owners and Breeders Association, alpacas are now being bred in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, UK, and numerous other places.

The preparing, combing, spinning, weaving and finishing process of alpaca and mohair are similar to that of [[wool]].

Farmers commonly quote the alpaca with the phrase 'love is in the fleece', which describes their love for the animal.

=== Prices ===
The price for alpacas can range from $200 to $360,000, depending on breeding history, sex, and color. One can raise up to 10 alpacas on one [[acre]] (4,047 m&amp;sup2;) as they have a designated area for waste products and keep their eating area away from their waste area to avoid diseases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Army''' (from [[French language|French]] ''armée'') can, in some countries, refer to any [[armed force]]. More commonly, however, it is only used specifically to refer to a land force of the [[military]].

Within a national army, an '''army''' can also refer to a large [[formation (military)|formation]], usually comprising one or more [[corps]].

'''Army''' is also often used in the description or title of military or [[paramilitary]] organisations which are not part of a country's official armed forces (and may well be illegal), such as the [[Irish Republican Army]], and also in some non-military organisations organised on a quasi-military basis, such as the [[Salvation Army]] and the [[Church Army]].

==Field Army==

A Field Army is composed of a headquarters, army troops, a variable number of corps, and a variable number of divisions. A battle is influenced at the Field Army level by transferring divisions and reinforcements from one corps to another to increase the pressure on the enemy at a critical point.

== National land forces ==

A national army is usually the arm of the military service which conducts land-based warfare (for example, the [[United States Army]], or the [[France|French]] [[Armée de Terre]]). 

Most armed forces make considerable distinction between the army or land forces, the [[navy]], and the [[air force]], often maintaining three independent organizations.  Many air forces were formerly part of an army; historically, the [[United States Air Force]] originated as part of the [[United States Army]], for example.

Modern armies comprise several branches (also called ''services'', or ''[[administrative corps]]'').  These may include the [[combat]] branches: [[infantry]], [[armoured]], [[artillery]], and [[combat engineers]], as well as the [[support]] branches: [[Military communications |communications]], [[Military intelligence |intelligence]], [[Combat medic |medics]], [[Military logistics |supply]], and [[army aviation]] (as opposed to a national air force).

== Formations ==

An '''army''' can also be a large [[military organization]] ([[formation (military) |formation]]) comprising one or more [[corps]]. A particular army is named or numbered to distinguish it from military land forces in general&amp;mdash;for example, the [[U.S. First Army]] and the [[Army of Northern Virginia]].  In the [[British Army]] it is normal to spell out the ordinal number of an army (e.g. First Army), whereas lower formations use figures (e.g. 1st Division). 

Armies (as well as [[army group]]s and [[Theater (military)|theater]]s) are large formations which vary significantly between armed forces in size, composition, and scope of responsibility.

In the [[Soviet Union |Soviet]] [[Red Army]], &quot;armies&quot; were actually [[corps]]-sized formations, subordinate to an army-sized &quot;[[Front (Soviet Army)|front]]&quot; in wartime.  In peacetime, a [[Army (Soviet Army)|Soviet army]] was usually subordinate to a [[military district]].

For the hierarchy of land force organizations, see [[military organization]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Applied mathematics''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] that concerns itself with the application of mathematical knowledge to other domains. Such applications include [[numerical analysis]], [[mathematical physics]], mathematics of [[engineering]], [[linear programming]], [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] and [[operations research]], [[continuous modelling]], [[control theory]], [[mathematical biology]] and [[bioinformatics]], [[information theory]], [[game theory]], [[probability]] and [[statistics]], [[mathematical economics]], [[financial mathematics]], [[actuarial science]], [[cryptography]] and hence [[combinatorics]] and even [[finite geometry]] to some extent, [[graph theory]] as applied to [[network theory|network analysis]], and a great deal of what is called [[computer science]]. 

The question of what is applied mathematics does not answer to logical classification so much as to the sociology of professionals who use mathematics. The mathematical methods are usually applied to the specific problem field by means of a [[mathematical model]] of the system.

Engineering mathematics describes physical processes, and so is often indistinguishable from [[theoretical physics]]. Important subdivisions include: [[fluid dynamics]], [[acoustic theory]], [[Maxwell's equations]] that govern [[electromagnetism]], [[mechanics]], [[numerical relativity]], etc.

Fundamental applied mathematics is taught at second-level in some countries, such as [[Ireland]], where it is a minority option at [[Leaving Certificate]].

'''Alligators''' and '''caimans''' are [[reptile]]s closely related to the [[crocodile]]s and forming the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Alligatoridae''' (sometimes regarded instead as the [[subfamily]] '''Alligatorinae'''). Together with the [[Gharial]] (family Gavialidae) they make up the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Crocodilia]].

[[Alligator]]s differ from crocodiles principally in having wider and shorter heads, with more obtuse snouts; in having the fourth, enlarged tooth of the under jaw received, not into an external notch, but into a pit formed for it within the upper one; in lacking a jagged fringe which appears on the hind legs and feet of the crocodile; and in having the toes of the hind feet webbed not more than half way to the tips. In general, the more dangerous crocodilians to human beings tend to be [crocodiles rather than alligators.

[[Image:Florida Alligator.jpg|left|200px|Alligator]]

Alligators proper occur in the fluvial deposits of the age of the [[Cretaceous|Upper Chalk]] in Europe, where they did not die out until the [[Pliocene]] age.

The true alligators are now restricted to two species, ''[[American Alligator|A. mississippiensis]]'' in the [[Southern United States]], which grows up to 4 m (12 ft) in length, and the small ''[[Chinese Alligator|A. sinensis]]'' in the [[Yangtze River]], [[People's Republic of China]].  Their name derives from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''el lagarto'', &quot;the lizard&quot;).

In [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] alligators are represented by five species of the [[genus]] ''[[Caiman]]'', which differs from the alligator by the absence of a bony septum between the nostrils, and the ventral armour is composed of overlapping bony scutes, each of which is formed of two parts united by a suture. Some authorities further divide this genus into three, splitting off the smooth-fronted caimans into a genus ''Paleosuchus'' and the Black Caiman into ''Melanosuchus''.     

''C. crocodilus'', the Spectacled Caiman, has the widest distribution, from southern Mexico to the northern half of Argentina, and grows to a modest size of about 7 feet. The largest, attaining an enormous bulk and a length of 20 ft., is the near-extinct ''Melanosuchus niger'', the Jacare-assu, Large, or Black Caiman of the Amazon. The [[Black Caiman]] is the only member of the alligator family posing the same danger to humans as the larger species of the [[crocodile]] family.  

Although the Caiman has not been studied in-depth, it has been discovered that their mating cycles (previously thought to be spontaneous or year-round) are linked to the rainfall cycles and the river levels in order to increase their offspring's chances of survival.

Some crocodiles can be found in salty water, but most alligators stay in fresh water.

==Cultural aspects==

In [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[African American]] [[folklore]], the alligator is revered, especially the teeth, which can be worn as a charm against [[witchcraft]] and [[poison]].

Often, it is the butt of practical jokes by [[trickster]]s like [[Brer Rabbit]].

An [[urban legend]] states that people buy baby alligators after visiting [[Florida]] or other places where they are native and flush them down the toilet once they get big.  The story goes that full grown alligators exist in the sewers of cities like [[New York City]].  This is impossible, however, because without UV rays from sunlight, alligators cannot properly metabolize calcium, resulting in metabolic bone disease and eventually death. Small released alligators and caimans, though, are occasionally found in northern lakes.  

Alligator skin was once a highly prized [[leather]], and was farmed in some areas, as pictured in the panoramic image below.  Alligator is sometimes eaten as an exotic meat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:Aleutians_aerial.jpg|thumb|250px|Looking down the Aleutians from an airplane.]]
The '''Aleutian Islands''' (possibly from [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]] ''aliat'', &quot;[[island]]&quot;) are a chain of more than 300 small volcanic islands forming an [[island arc]] situated in the Northern [[Pacific Ocean]], occupying an area of 6,821 sq mi (17,666 sq km) and extending about 1,200 mi (1,900 km) westward from the [[Alaska Peninsula]] toward the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]]. Crossing longitude 180°, they are the westernmost part of the [[United States]] (and technically also the easternmost; ''see [[Extreme points of the United States]]''). Nearly all of the [[archipelago]] is part of [[Alaska]] and usually considered as being in the &quot;[[Alaskan Bush]]&quot;, but the extreme western end is in [[Russia]]. The islands with their 57 volcanoes are located in the northern part of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]].

==Geography==
[[Image:Aleutians-space.jpg|thumb|250px|Aleutians seen from space]]
The islands, known before 1867 as the Catherine Archipelago, comprise four groups&amp;mdash; the [[Fox Islands|Fox]], [[Andreanof Islands|Andreanof]], [[Rat Islands|Rat]] and [[Near Islands]]. They are all located between 52 degrees and 55 degrees North latitude and 172 degrees East and 163 degrees West longitude.

The axis of the archipelago near the mainland of Alaska has a southwest trend, but near the 129th meridian its direction changes to the northwest. This change of direction corresponds to a curve in the line of [[volcanic]] fissures which have contributed their products to the building of the islands. Such curved chains are repeated about the Pacific Ocean in the [[Kuril Islands]], the [[Japan|Japanese]] chain and in the [[Philippines]]. All these island arcs are at the edge of the [[Pacific Plate]] and experience lots of [[seismic]] activity, but are still habitable; the Aleutians lie between the Pacific and North American [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]. The general elevation is greatest in the eastern islands and least in the western. The island chain is really a western continuation of the [[Aleutian Range]] on the mainland. 

[[Image:North-Pacific-air-routes.png|thumb|250px|left|Active Aleutian volcanoes]]
The great majority of the islands bear evident marks of volcanic origin, and there are numerous volcanic cones on the north side of the chain, some of them active; many of the islands, however, are not wholly volcanic, but contain  crystalline or sedimentary rocks, and also amber and beds of [[lignite]]. The coasts are rocky and surf-worn, and the approaches are exceedingly dangerous, the land rising immediately from the coasts to steep, bold mountains.

The volcano [[Makushin]] (5691 ft/1,735 m) is visible from [[Unalaska, Alaska|Unalaska]], and the volcanic [[islet]]s [[Bogoslof]] and [[Grewingk]], which rose from the sea in 1796 and 1883 respectively, lie about 30 miles (48 km) west of the bay.

&lt;br clear=both&gt;

==Climate==
[[Image:AleutianIslands.jpg|thumb|310px|Aleutian Islands]]
The climate of the islands is oceanic, with moderate and fairly uniform temperatures and heavy rainfall. Fogs are almost constant. The summers are much cooler than on the mainland at [[Sitka]], but the winter temperature of the islands and of the [[Alaska Panhandle]] is very nearly the same. The mean annual temperature for [[Unalaska]], the most populated island of the group, is about 38 degrees Fahrenheit (3.4 degrees Celsius), being about 30 °F (&amp;minus;1.1 °C) for January and about 52 °F (11.1 °C) for August. The highest and lowest temperatures recorded on the islands are 78 °F (26 °C) and 5 °F (&amp;minus;15 °C), respectively. The average annual amount of rainfall is about 80 in (2,030 mm), and Unalaska, with about 250 rainy days per year, is said to be the rainiest place within the territory of the [[United States]].

==Economy==
The growing season lasts about 135 days, from early in May till late in September, but agriculture is limited to the raising of a few vegetables. With the exception of some stunted [[willow]]s, the islands are practically destitute of trees, but are covered with a luxuriant growth of herbage, including [[Poaceae|grass]]es, [[sedge]]s and many flowering plants. On the less mountainous islands, the raising of [[domestic sheep|sheep]] and [[reindeer]] was believed to be practicable.  

People living in the Aleutian Islands developed fine skills in hunting and basketry. Hunters made their weapons and watercraft. The baskets are noted for being finely woven with carefully shredded stalks of [[beach rye]].

==Demographics==
The people refer to themselves as Unangan, and have been calces where the AOL user has chosen an alphanumeric alias, eg: &quot;'''jwds75@aol.com'''&quot; rather than &quot;'''John Smith'''&quot;, the identity of the user is less clear to the recipient. Also in the past, users of the AOL client software were unable to click on hyperlinks in the text.  Many experienced Internet users remain unaware that these inherent limitations of the AOL software are not due to any possible lack of computer skills by AOL users.

In a different vein, AOL users also have a reputation in some online communities for disruptive activities. AOL makes use of aggressive [[web cache|web caching]] [[proxy server]]s that effectively makes it impossible for a website, such as a [[wiki]], to block an abusive user without excluding large segments of the entire AOL community. Combined with the fact that their free service offers make it all too easy to join, many [[Internet troll]]s take advantage of this and choose AOL as a preferred means of hiding their true identity, in a manner that is almost as effective as using an [[anonymous proxy]].  This has only served to further harm the reputation of AOL users as a whole and is a large part of why some places implement a policy of banning all AOL users.

==Controversies==
===Community Leaders===
Prior to the middle of 2005, AOL used volunteers called [[America Online Community Leaders Program|Community Leaders]], or CLs, to monitor chatrooms, message boards, and libraries. Some community leaders were recruited for content design and maintenance using a proprietary language and interface called [[RAINMAN]], although most content maintenance was performed by partner and internal employees. 

In 1999, Kelly Hallissey and Brian Williams, former Community Leaders and founders of an anti-AOL website  filed a [[class action lawsuit]] against AOL citing violations of U.S. labor laws in its usage of CLs. The [[Department of Labor]] investigated but came to no conclusions, closing their investigation in 2001.  In light of these events, AOL drastically began reducing the responsibilities and privileges of its volunteers in 2000.  The program was eventually ended on [[June 8]] [[2005]].  Current Community Leaders at the time were offered 12 months of credit on their accounts. Also for a time AOL had a bot named CATWATCH which would pop into user created private rooms where TOS violations MAY be occuring, and everyone in the room would be disconnected from AOL and get a TOS strike against their account.

===Billing disputes===
AOL has faced a number of lawsuits over claims that it has been slow to stop billing people after their accounts have been cancelled, either by the company or the user. In addition, AOL changed its method of calculating used minutes in response to a class action lawsuit. Previously, AOL would add fifteen seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute (thus, a person who used the service for 11 minutes and 46 seconds would be charged for 13 minutes). AOL claimed this was to account for sign on/sign off time, but because this practice was not made known to its customers, the lawsuit won (some also pointed out that signing on and off did not always take 15 seconds, especially when connecting via another ISP). AOL disclosed its connection time calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours. In addition, the AOL software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged for.

===Account cancellation===
In response to approximately 300 consumer complaints, New York Attorney General [[Eliot Spitzer]]’s office began an inquiry of AOL’s customer service policies. The investigation revealed that the company had an elaborate system for rewarding employees who purported to retain or &quot;save&quot; subscribers who had called to cancel their Internet service. In many instances, such retention was done against subscribers’ wishes, or without their consent.

Under the system, consumer service personnel received bonuses worth tens of thousands of dollars if they could successfully dissuade or &quot;save&quot; half of the people who called to cancel service. For several years, AOL had instituted minimum retention or &quot;save&quot; percentages, which consumer representatives were expected to meet. These bonuses, and the minimum &quot;save&quot; rates accompanying them, had the effect of employees not honoring cancellations, or otherwise making cancellation unduly difficult for consumers.

Many consumers complained that AOL personnel ignored their demands to cancel service and stop billing.

On August 24, 2005, America Online agreed to pay $1.25 million to the state of New York and reformed its 
customer service procedures.  Under the agreement, AOL will no longer require its customer 
service representatives to meet a minimum quota for customer retention in order to receive a bonus.

===Software===
In 2000, AOL was served with an $8 billion lawsuit alleging that its (now dated) AOL 5.0 software caused significant difficulties for users attempting to use third-party Internet service providers. The lawsuit sought damages of up to $1000 for each user that had downloaded the software cited at the time of the lawsuit. AOL later agreed to a settlement of $15 million, without admission of wrongdoing. 

=== Usenet newsgroups ===
When AOL gave clients access to [[Usenet]] in 1994, they hid at least one newsgroup in standard list view: ''alt.aol-sucks''.  AOL did list the newsgroup in the alternative description view, but changed the description to &quot;Flames and complaints about America Online&quot;.

=== Terms of Service (TOS) ===
There have been many complaints over rules that govern AOL's members conduct, call the Terms Of Service, which apply/applied to everyone who used AOL, regardless of age, or where an AOL member is on the internet. Claims are that these rules are too strict to follow, do not allow swearing, or a very flexible rule called room disruption.

== Company purchases ==
As it grew, AOL purchased many other software companies, including: 

*[[BookLink]] bought in December 1994.  
*[[NaviSoft]]'s [[NaviServer]] (later to become [[AOLserver]]) in 1994.

:''This article is about the branch of mathematics. For other uses of the term see [[algebra (disambiguation)]].''

'''Algebra''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: الجبر, ''al-jabr'') is a branch of [[mathematics]] which studies [[structure]] and [[quantity]]. [[Elementary algebra]] is often taught in high school and gives an introduction into the basic ideas of algebra: studying what happens when one adds and multiplies numbers and how one can make [[polynomial]]s and find their roots. 

Algebra is much broader than [[arithmetic]] and can be generalized. Rather than working on numbers, one can work over [[symbols]] or [[element (mathematics)|elements]]. Addition and multiplication are viewed as general [[operator|operations]], and their precise definitions lead to structures called [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]]. 

Together with [[geometry]] and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], algebra is one of the three main branches of mathematics. 

==Classification==
Algebra may be roughly divided into the following categories:
* '''[[elementary algebra]]''', in which the properties of operations on the [[real number|real number system]] are recorded using symbols as &quot;place holders&quot; to denote [[mathematical constant|constants]] and [[variable]]s, and the rules governing [[mathematical expression]]s and [[equation]]s involving these symbols are studied (note that this usually includes the subject matter of courses called ''intermediate algebra'' and ''college algebra'');
* '''[[abstract algebra]]''', sometimes also called ''modern algebra'', in which [[algebraic structure]]s such as [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|field]]s are [[axiomatization|axiomatically]] defined and investigated;
* '''[[linear algebra]]''', in which the specific properties of [[vector space]]s are studied (including [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]);
* '''[[universal algebra]]''', in which properties common to all algebraic structures are studied.

In advanced studies, axiomatic algebraic systems like groups, rings, fields, and algebras over a field are investigated in the presence of a natural [[geometry|geometric]] structure (a [[topology]]) which is compatible with the algebraic structure. The list includes: 

* [[Normed linear space]]s
* [[Banach space]]s 
* [[Hilbert space]]s
* [[Banach algebra]]s
* [[Normed algebra]]s
* [[Topological algebra]]s
* [[Topological group]]s

==Elementary algebra==

'''Elementary algebra''' is the most basic form of [[algebra]] taught to students who are presumed to have no knowledge of [[mathematics]] beyond the basic principles of [[arithmetic]]. While in arithmetic only [[number]]s and their arithmetical operations (such as +, &amp;minus;, &amp;times;, ÷) occur, in algebra one also uses symbols (such as ''a'', ''x'', ''y'') to denote numbers. This is useful because:
* It allows the general formulation of arithmetical laws (such as &lt;math&gt;a + b = b + a&lt;/math&gt; for all ''a'' and ''b''), and thus is the first step to a systematic exploration of the properties of the [[real number|real number system]].
* It allows the reference to &quot;unknown&quot; numbers, the formulation of [[equation]]s and the study of how to solve these (for instance &quot;find a number ''x'' such that &lt;math&gt;3x + 1 = 10&lt;/math&gt;).
* It allows the formulation of [[function (mathematics)|function]]al relationships (such as &quot;if you sell ''x'' tickets, then your profit will be &lt;math&gt;3x - 10&lt;/math&gt; dollars&quot;).

==Abstract algebra==
:''Main article: [[Abstract algebra]]; see also [[algebraic structures]]''.
'''Abstract algebra''' extends the familiar concepts found in elementary algebra and [[arithmetic]] of [[numbers]] to more general concepts.

'''[[Set]]s''': Rather than just considering the different types of [[number]]s, abstract algebra deals with the more general concept of ''sets'': a collection of objects called [[elements]]. All the familiar types of numbers are sets. Other examples of sets include the set of all two by two [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], the set of all second degree [[polynomials]] (''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''bx''+''c''), the set of all two dimensional [[vectors]] in the plane, and the various [[finite groups]] such as the [[cyclic group]]s which are the group of integers modulo ''n''. [[Set theory]] is a branch of [[logic]] and not technically a branch of algebra.

'''[[Binary operation]]s''': The notion of [[addition]] (+) is abstracted to give a ''binary operation'', * say. For two elements ''a'' and ''b'' in a set ''S'' ''a''*''b'' gives another element in the set, (technically this condition is called [[Closure (mathematics)|closure]]). [[Addition]] (+), [[subtraction]] (-), [[multiplication]] (&amp;times;), and [[division]] (&amp;divide;) are all binary operations as in addition and multiplication of matrices, vectors, and polynomials.

'''[[Identity element]]s''': Zero and one are abstracted to give the notion of an ''identity element''. Zero is the identity element for addition and one is the identity element for multiplication. For a general binary operator * the identity element ''e'' must satisfy ''a''*''e''=''a'' and ''e''*''a''=''a''. This holds for addition as ''a''+0=''a'', and 0+''a''=''a'' and multiplication ''a''&amp;times;''1''=''a'', 1&amp;times;''a''=''a''. However, if we take the positive natural numbers and addition, there is no identity element.

'''[[Inverse elements]]''': The negative numbers gives rise to the concept of an ''inverse elements''. For addition the inverse of ''a'' is ''-a'', and for multiplication the inverse is &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;. A general inverse element ''a''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; must satisfy the property that ''a''*''a''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;=''e'' and ''a''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;*''a''=''e''.

'''[[Associativity]]''': The integers with addition have a property called associativity: (2+3)+4=2+(3+4). In general this becomes (''a''+''b'')+''c''=''a''+(''b''+''c''). This property is shared by most binary operations, but not subtraction or division.

'''[[Commutative operation|Commutativity]]''': The integers with addition also have a property called commutativity: 2+3=3+2. In general this becomes ''a''+''b''=''b''+''a''. Only some binary operations have this property, it holds for the integers with addition and multiplication, but it does not hold for [[matrix multiplication]].

===Groups===
:''Main article: [[group (mathematics)|group]]; see also [[group theory]], [[examples of groups]]''
Combining the above concepts gives one of the most important structures in mathematics: a '''[[group (mathematics)|group]]'''. A group consists of:
*a set ''S'' of elements,
*a(closed) binary operation (*)
*an identity element exists,
*every element has an inverse,
*the operation is associative.

If commutativity is included as well then we obtain an [[Abelian group]].

For example, the set of integers under the operation of addition is a group.  In this group, the identity element is 0 and the inverse of any element ''a'' is its negation, -''a''.  The associativity requirement is met since for any integers ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', &lt;math&gt;(a+b)+c = a+(b+c)&lt;/math&gt;.

The non-zero [[rational number]]s form a group under multiplication.  Here, the identity element is 1, since &lt;math&gt;1 \cdot a = a \cdot 1 = a&lt;/math&gt; for any any rational number ''a''.  The inverse of ''a'' is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{a}&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;a \cdot {1 \over a}=1&lt;/math&gt;.

The integers under the multiplication operation, however, do not form a group.  This is because, in general, the multiplicative inverse of an integer is not an integer.  For example, 4 is an integer, but its multiplicative inverse is &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which is not an integer.

The theory of groups is studied in [[group theory]]. A major result in this theory is the [[Classification of finite simple groups]] a vast body of work which classified all the is a vast body of work, mostly published between around [[1955]] and [[1983]], which is thought to classify all of the [[finite set|finite]] [[simple group]]s.

Many other types of algebraic structures exist.  Among the most common are [[Ring_(mathematics)|rings]], [[Field_(mathematics)|fields]], and [[Monoid|monoids]].  These different structures can be used to model different types of mathematical objects.  Different algebraic structures are often related.  For example, a group is a specific kind of monoid, and rings and fields are similar to groups, but with more operations.

== Algebras ==
The word '''''algebra''''' is also used for various [[algebraic structures]]:
* [[algebra over a field]]
* [[algebra over a set]]
* [[Boolean algebra]]
* [[sigma-algebra]]
* [[F-algebra]] and [[F-coalgebra]] in [[category theory]]

==History==
[[Image:Euklid2.jpg|thumb|175px|Hellenistic mathematician [[Euclid]] details [[geometric]]al algebra in ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''.]]

The origins of algebra can be traced to the ancient [[Egyptian mathematics|Egyptians]] and [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonians]], who used an early type of algebra to solve [[linear equation|linear]], [[quadratic equation|quadratic]], and [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]] equations more than 3,000 years ago. By contrast, most [[Indian mathematics|Indian]] and [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] mathematicians in the [[1st millennium BC]] usually solved such equations by [[geometry|geometric]] methods.

*Circa [[100 BC]]: [[Algebraic equations]] are treated in the [[Chinese mathematics]] book ''[[Jiuzhang suanshu]]'' (''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'').
*Circa [[100 BC]]: The ''[[Indian mathematics#Bakhshali Manuscript .28200_BC - 400 CE.29|Bakhshali Manuscript]]'' in [[ancient India]] contains algebraic solutions of [[linear equations]] with upto five unknowns, the general algebraic formula for the quadratic equation, quadratic indeterminate equations, and [[simultaneous equations]].
*Circa [[150|150 AD]]: [[Hellenized]] [[Egyptian]] mathematician [[Hero of Alexandria]], treats algebraic equations in three volumes of mathematics.
*Circa [[200]]: Hellenized [[Babylonian]] mathematician [[Diophantus]], who lived in Egypt and is often considered as the &quot;father of algebra&quot;, writes his famous ''[[Arithmetica]]'', a work featuring solutions of algebraic equations and on the theory of numbers.
*[[499]]: Indian mathematician [[Aryabhata]], obtains whole number solutions to linear equations by a method equivalent to the modern one.
*[[628]]: Indian mathematician [[Brahmagupta]], invents the method of solving indeterminate equations of the second degree, gives rules for solving linear and quadratic equations, and discovers negative solutions for the [[quadratic equation]]. [[Indian mathematicians]] at the time recognized that [[quadratic equation]]s have two [[root]]s, and included [[Negative and non-negative numbers|negative]] as well as [[irrational number|irrational]] roots.
*[[820]]: The word ''algebra'' is derived from operations described in the treatise first written by [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Islamic mathematics|mathematician]] [[Al-Khwarizmi]] titled: ''[[Al-Jabr wa-al-Muqabilah]]'' meaning ''The book of summary concerning calculating by transposition and reduction''. The word ''al-jabr'' means  ''&quot;reunion&quot;''. Al-Khwarizmi is often considered as the &quot;father of modern algebra&quot;, much of whose works on reduction was included in the book and added to many methods we have in algebra now.
*Circa [[1000]]: [[Abu Bakr al-Karaji]], in his treatise ''al-Fakhri'', extends Al-Khwarizmi's methodology to incorporate integral powers and integral roots of unknown quantities.
*[[1114]]: Indian mathematician [[Bhaskara II]], who wrote the text ''Bijaganita'' (''Algebra''), recognizes that a positive number has two [[square root]]s, and also solves quadratic indeterminate equations and quadratic equations with more than one unknown.
*[[1202]]: Algebra is introduced to [[Europe]] largely through the work of [[Leonardo Fibonacci]] of [[Pisa]] in his work ''[[Liber Abaci]]'' .

*Ziauddin Sardar, Jerry Ravetz,|air transport services]] to [[passenger|passengers]] and/or for [[freight]]; although some airlines do provide [[Charter airline|chartered]] [[aviation|flight]] services as well. Airlines [[lease|lease]] or own their [[airliner|aircraft]] with which to supply these services and may form [[partnerships]] or [[alliances]] with other airlines for reasons of mutual benefit. 

==Industry overview==
The scale and scope of airline companies are from those with a single airplane carrying mail or cargo, through full-service international airlines operating many hundreds of airplanes in various types. Airline services can be categorized as being intercontinental, intracontinental, [[regional airline|regional]] or domestic and may be operated as scheduled services or charters.

These variations in the types of airline companies, their operating scope, and the routes they serve makes analysis of the airline industry somewhat complex. Nevertheless, some patterns have emerged in the last 50 years of experience:

[[Image:Air-India-building.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The headquarters of [[Air India]] in [[Mumbai]].]]
* The general pattern of ownership has gone from government owned or supported to independent, for-profit public companies. This occurs as regulators permit greater freedom, in steps that are usually decades apart. This pattern has not been completed for all airlines in all regions.

* The demand for air travel services is derived demand. That is, it depends on other things: business needs for cargo shipments, business passenger demand, leisure passenger demand, all influenced by macroeconomic activity in the markets under study. These patterns are highly seasonal, and often day-of-week, time-of-day, and even directionally variable.

* Notwithstanding these demand patterns, the overall trend of demand has been consistently increasing. In the [[1950s|1950's]] and [[1960s|1960's]], annual growth rates of 15% or more were common. Annual growth of 5-6% persisted through the [[1980s|1980's]] and [[1990s|1990's]]. Growth rates are not consistent in all regions, but certainly areas where deregulation provided more competition and greater pricing freedom resulted in lower fares and sometimes dramatic spurts in traffic growth. The [[United States|U.S.]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]], [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], and other markets exhibited this trend.

* The industry is cyclical. Four or five years of poor performance are followed by five or six years of gradually improving good performance. But profitability in the good years is generally low, in the range of 2-3% net profit after interest and tax. It is in this time that airlines begin paying for new generations of airplanes and other service upgrades they ordered to respond to the increased demand. Since 1980, the industry as a whole has not even earned back the cost of capital during the best of times. Conversely, in bad times losses can be dramatically worse.

* As in many mature industries, consolidation is a trend, as airlines form new business combinations, ranging from loose, limited bilateral partnerships to long-term, multi-faceted alliances of groups of companies, to equity arrangements between companies, to actual [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers]] or [[Takeover|takeovers]]. Since governments often restrict ownership and merger between companies in different countries, we see most consolidation taking place within a country. In the U.S., over 200 airlines have been merged, taken over, or simply gone out of business since deregulation began in [[1978]]. Many international airline managers are actively lobbying their governments to permit greater consolidation, in order to achieve higher economies of scale and greater efficiencies.

===Early development of airlines in the U.S.===
Following [[World War I]], the United States found itself swamped with aviators. Many decided to take their war-surplus aircraft on barnstorming campaigns, performing acrobatic maneuvers to woo crowds. In [[1918]], the [[United States Postal Service]] won the financial backing of [[Congress]] to begin experimenting with [[air mail]] service, initially using [[Curtiss Jenny]] aircraft that had been procured by the [[United States Army]] for reconnaissance missions on the Western Front. The Army was the first to fly these missions, but quickly lost the contract when they proved to be too unreliable. By the mid-[[1920s]], the [[United States Postal Service|Postal Service]] had developed its own air mail network, based on a transcontinental backbone between [[New York, New York|New York]] and [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. To supplant this service, they offered twelve contracts for spur routes to independent bidders: the carriers that won these routes would, through time and mergers, evolve into [[Braniff Airlines]], [[American Airlines]], [[United Airlines]] (originally a division of [[Boeing]]), [[Trans World Airlines]], [[Northwest Airlines]], and [[Eastern Airlines]], to name a few.

Passenger service during the early 1920s was sporadic at best: most airlines at the time were focused on carrying bags of mail. In 1925, however, [[Ford Motor Company]] bought out the Stout Aircraft Company and began construction of the all-metal [[Ford Trimotor]], the first successful American airliner. With a 12-passenger capacity, it made passenger service potentially profitable. Air service was seen as a supplement to [[rail transport|rail]] service in the American transportation network.

At the same time, [[Juan Trippe]] began a crusade to create an air network that would link America to the world, and he achieved this goal through his airline, [[Pan American World Airways]], with a fleet of flying boats that linked [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] to [[Shanghai]] and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] to [[London]]. Pan Am was the only U.S. airline to go international before the 1940s, and quickly became a symbol of the potential of the American airline industry.

With the introduction of the [[Boeing 247]] and [[Douglas DC-3]] in the 1930s, the U.S. airline industry was generally profitable, even during the [[Great Depression]]. This trend continued until the beginning of [[World War II]].

===Early development of airlines in Europe===
[[Image:National Audit Office - Victoria - London - 020504.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Imperial Airways Empire Terminal, Victoria, [[London]]. Trains ran from here to [[flying boats]] in [[Southampton]], and to [[Croydon Airport]].]]
The first countries in Europe to embrace air transport were [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]].  

In [[1919]] [[KLM]] was founded, still the oldest carrier operating under its original name. The first flight transported two English passengers to [[Schiphol]], [[Amsterdam]] from [[London]] in [[1920]]. Like other major European airlines of the time (see France and the UK below), KLM's early growth depended heavily on the needs to service links with far-flung colonial possessions ([[Dutch Indies]]). It is only after the loss of the [[Dutch Empire]] that [[KLM]] found itself based at a small country with few potential passengers, depending heavily on transfer traffic, and was one of the first to introduce the hub-system to facilitate easy connections.

France began an air mail service to [[Morocco]] in [[1919]] that was bought out in [[1927]], renamed [[Aéropostale (aviation)|Aéropostale]], and injected with capital to become a major international carrier. In [[1933]], Aéropostale went [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]], was nationalized and merged with several other airlines into what became [[Air France]].

The German airline industry began with [[Lufthansa]] in [[1926]], which, unlike most other airlines at the time, became a major investor in airlines outside of Europe, founding [[Varig]] and [[Avianca]]. German airliners built by [[Junkers]], [[Dornier GmbH|Dornier]], and [[Fokker]] were the most advanced in the world at the time. The peak of German air travel came in the mid-[[1930s]], when [[Nazi]] propaganda ministers approved the start of commercial [[zeppelin]] service: the big [[airship]]s were a symbol of industrial might, but the fact that they used flammable hydrogen gas raised safety concerns that culminated with the [[Hindenburg]] disaster of [[1937]].

[[United Kingdom]]'s flag carrier during this period was [[Imperial Airways]], which became [[BOAC]] (British Overseas Airlines Co.) in [[1939]]. Imperial Airways used huge [[Handley-Page]] [[biplane]]s for routes between [[London]], the [[Middle East]], and [[India]]: images of Imperial aircraft in the middle of the [[Rub'al Khali]], being maintained by [[Bedouin]]s, are among the most famous pictures from the heyday of the [[British Empire]].

===Development of airlines post-1945===
As governments met to set the standards and scope for an emergent civil air industry toward the end of the war, it was no surprise that the U.S. took a position of maximum operating freedom. After all, U.S. airline companies were not devastated by the war, as European companies and the few Asian companies had been. This preference for &quot;open skies&quot; operating regimes continues, within limitations, to this day.

World War II, like World War I, brought new life to the airline industry. Many airlines in the Allied countries were flush from lease contracts to the military, and foresaw a future explosive demand for civil air transport, for both passengers and cargo. They were eager to invest in the newly emerging flagships of air travel such as the [[Boeing Stratocruiser]], [[Lockheed Constellation]], and [[Douglas DC-6]]. Most of these new aircraft were based on American bombers such as the [[B-29]], which had spearheaded research into new technologies such as [[pressurization]]. Most offered increased efficiency from both added speed and greater payload.

In the 1950s, the [[De Havilland Comet]], [[Boeing 707]], [[Douglas DC-8]], and [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] became the first flagships of the Jet Age in the West, while the [[Soviet Union]] bloc countered with the [[Tupolev Tu-104]] and [[Tupolev Tu-124]] in the fleets of state-owned carriers such as [[Aeroflot]] and [[Interflug]]. The [[Vickers Viscount]] and [[Lockheed L-188 Electra]] inaugurated turboprop transport.

The next big boost for the airlines would come in the 1970s, when the [[Boeing 747]], [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], and [[Lockheed L-1011]] inaugurated widebody (&quot;jumbo jet&quot;) service, which is still the standard in international travel. The [[Tupolev Tu-144]] and its Western counterpart, [[Concorde]], made supersonic travel a reality. In 1972, [[Airbus]] began producing Europe's most commercially successful line of airliners to date. The added efficiencies for these aircraft were often not in speed, but in passenger capacity, payload, and range. 

With deregulation in the U.S. beginning in 1978, barriers to entry were lowered for new entrants. Typically, a new wave of start-ups would enter during downturns in the normal 8-10 year business cycle. At that time, they find aircraft, financing, hangar and maintenance services, training all relatively inexpensive, and laid off staff from other companies eager and willing to take a job with the new company.

Alas, as the business cycle returned to normalcy, major airlines were able to dominate their routes through aggressive pricing and additional capacity offerings, often swamping the new startup. Only [[America West Airlines]] (now known as USAirways) has remained as a significant survivor from this new entrant era, as dozens, even hundreds, have gone under.

In many ways, the biggest winner in the deregulated environment was the air passenger. Indeed, the U.S. witnessed an explosive growth in demand for air travel, as many millions who had never or rarely flown before became regular fliers, even joining [[frequent flyer]] loyalty programs and receiving free flights and other benefits from their flying. New services and higher frequencies meant that business fliers could fly to another city, do business, and return the same day, for almost any points in the country. Air travel's advantages put intercity bus lines under pressure, and most have withered away. 

By the 1980's, almost half of the total flying in the world took place in the U.S., and today the domestic industry operates over 10,000 daily departures nationwide.

Toward the end of the century, a new style of [[low-cost carrier|low cost airline]] was seen, offering a consistent, often high-quality product, using new aircraft models, at a price that was well-received. [[JetBlue]], [[AirTran Airways]], and other companies represented a serious challenge to legacy carriers, as their counterparts in Europe, Canada, and Asia did to legacy carriers in those regions. Their commercial viability also represented a serious cost threat to employees at legacy airlines, as they set the standard for wage rates in the industry that were a fraction of the prevailing wage. 

Thus the last 50 years of the airline industry have varied from reasonably profitable, to devastatingly depressed. As the first major market to deregulate the industry in 1978, U.S. airlines have experienced more turbulence than almost any other country or region. Today, airlines representing approximately one-half of total U.S. seat capacity are operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy provisions.

==Regulatory considerations==
===Government regulation===
[[image:airindia.longshot.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Air India]] [[Boeing 747-400]]]]

Many countries have [[national airline]]s that are owned and operated by the government. Even fully privatized airlines are subject to a great deal of government regulation for economic, political, and safety concerns. Airline labor actions, for instance, are often halted by government intervention in order to protect the free flow of people, communications, and goods between different regions without compromising safety.

The United States, Australia, and to a lesser extent Brazil, Mexico, the European Union, and Japan have &quot;deregulated&quot; their airlines. In the past, these governments dictated airfares, route networks, and other operational requirements for each airline. Since deregulation, airlines have been largely free to negotiate their own operating arrangements with different airports, enter and exit routes easily, and to levy airfares and supply flights according to market demand. 

The entry barriers for new airlines are lower in a deregulated market, and so the U.S. has seen hundreds of airlines start up (sometimes for only a brief operating period). This has produced far greater competition than before deregulation in most markets, and average fares tend to drop 20% or more, spurring new sources of demand. The added competition, together with pricing freedom, means that new entrants often take market share with highly reduced rates that, to a limited degree, full service airlines must match. This is a major constraint on profitability for established carriers, which tend to have a higher cost base. 

As a result, profitability in a deregulated market is uneven for most airlines. These forces have caused some major airlines to go out of business, in addition to most of the poorly established new entrants.

===International regulation===
[[image:singapore.b747.london.750pix.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Singapore Airlines]] [[Boeing 747]].]]

Groups such as the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] establish worldwide standards for safety and other vital concerns. Most international air traffic is regulated by bilateral agreements between countries, which designate specific carriers to operate on specific routes. The model of such an agreement was the [[Bermuda Agreement]] between the US and UK following World War II, which designated airports to be used for transatlantic flights and gave each government the authority to nominate carriers to operate routes.

Bilateral agreements are based on the &quot;[[freedoms of the air]],&quot; a group of generalized traffic rights ranging from the freedom to overfly a country to the freedom to provide domestic flights within a country (a very rarely granted right known as [[cabotage]]). Most agreements permit airlines to fly from their home country to designated airports in the other country: some also extend the freedom to provide continuing service to a third country, or to another destination in the other country while carrying passengers from overseas.

In the 1990s, &quot;[[open skies]]&quot; agreements became more common, which take many of these regulatory powers from state governments and open up international routes to further competition. Open skies agreements have met some criticism, particularly within the [[European Union]], whose airlines would be at a comparative disadvantage with the United States' because of cabotage restrictions.

==Economic considerations==
Although many countries continue to operate state-owned or parastatal airlines, most large airlines today are privately-owned and are therefore governed by microeconomic principles in order to maximize shareholder profit.

===Financing===
Airline financing is quite complex, since airlines are highly leveraged operations. Not only must they purchase (or lease) new airline bodies and engines regularly, they must make major long-term fleet decisions with the goal of meeting the demands of their markets while producing a fleet that is relatively economical to operate and maintain. Compare [[Southwest Airlines]] and their reliance on a single airplane type (the [[Boeing]] 737 and derivatives), with the now bankrupt [[Eastern Airlines]] which operated 17 different aircraft types, each with varying pilot, engine, maintenance, and support needs.

A second financial issue is that of hedging [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[fuel]] purchases, usually second only to labor in its relative cost to the company but with the fuel price touching $70/barrel it has become biggest part of total airlines expenses.While [[hedging instruments]] can be expensive, they can easily pay for themselves many times over in periods of increasing fuel costs, such as in the 2000-2005 period.

===Operating costs===
In a mature industry with low fare new entrants and tiny operating margins, it is imperative that airline managers identify controllable costs.

Full-service airlines have a high level of fixed and operating costs in order to establish and maintain air services: labor, fuel, airplanes, engines, spares and parts, IT services and networks, airport equipment, airport handling services, sales distribution, catering, training, insurance, and other costs. Thus all but a few cents on the dollar in ticket sales is paid out to a wide variety of external providers or internal cost centers.

Moreover, the industry is structured so that airlines often act as tax collectors. Airline fuel is untaxed however due to a series of treaties existing between countries. Ticket prices include a number of fees, taxes, and surcharges they have little or no control over, and these are passed through to various providers. Airlines are also responsible for enforcing government regulations. If airlines carry passengers without proper documentation on an international flight, they are responsible for returning them back to the originating country.

Analysis of the 1992-1996 period shows that every player in the air transport chain is far more profitable than the airlines, who collect and pass through fees and revenues to them from ticket sales. While airlines as a whole earned 6% return on capital employed (2-3.5% less than the cost of capital), airports earned 10%, catering companies 10-13%, handling companies 11-14%, aircraft lessors 15%, aircraft manufacturers 16%, and global distribution companies more than 30%. (Source: Spinetta, 2000, quoted in Doganis, 2002)

In contrast, [[Southwest Airlines]] has been the most profitable of airline companies since 1970. Indeed, some sources have calculated Southwest to be the best performing stock over the period, outperforming [[Microsoft]] and many other high performing companies. The chief reasons for this are their product consistency and cost control.

The widespread entrance of a new breed of low cost airlines beginning at the turn of the century has accelerated the demand that full service carriers control costs. Many of these low cost companies emulate [[Southwest Airlines]] in various respects, and like Southwest, they are able to eke out a consistent profit throughout all phases of the business cycle. 

As a result, a shakeout of airlines is occurring in the U.S. and elsewhere. [[United Airlines]], [[US Airways]] (twice), [[Delta Air Lines]], and [[Northwest Airlines]] have all declared [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy, and [[American Airlines|American]] has barely avoided doing so. [[Alitalia]], [[Scandinavian Airlines System]], [[SABENA]], [[Japan Air System]], [[Air Canada]], [[Ansett Australia]], and others have flirted with or declared bankruptcy since 2000, as low cost entrants enter their home markets as well. Some argue that it would be far better for the industry as a whole if a wave of actual closures were to reduce the number of &quot;undead&quot; airlines competing with healthy airlines while being artificially protected from creditors via [[bankruptcy]] law.

===Ticket sales===
Airlines assign prices to their services in an attempt to maximize profitability. To do this well requires [[yield management]] technology and pricing flexibility. 

They use differentiated pricing, a form of [[price discrimination]], in order to sell air services at varying prices simultaneously to different segments. Factors influencing the price include the days remaining until departure, the current booked load factor, the forecast of total demand by price point, competitive pricing in force, and variations by day of week of departure and by time of day. 

A complicating factor is that of origin-destination control (&quot;O&amp;D control&quot;). Someone purchasing a ticket from say, Melbourne to Sydney for $A200 is competing with someone else who wants to fly Melbourne to Los Angeles through Sydney on the same airplane, and who is willing to pay $A1400. Should the airline prefer the $A1400 passenger, or the $A200 passenger + a possible Sydney-Los Angeles passenger willing to pay $A1300? Airlines have to make hundreds of thousands of similar pricing decisions daily in their markets.

In contrast, low fare carriers usually offer straightforward, preannounced, simple prices. They can do this by quoting prices for each leg of a trip; passengers simply add them together to construct a full journey. 

The advent of advanced computerized reservations systems in the late 1970s, most notably [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], allowed airlines to easily perform [[cost-benefit analysis|cost-benefit analyses]] on different pricing structures, leading to almost perfect price discrimination in some cases (that is, filling each seat on an aircraft at the highest price that can be charged without driving the consumer elsewhere). The intense nature of airfare pricing has led to the term &quot;[[fare war]]&quot; to describe efforts by airlines to undercut other airlines on competitive routes.

Computers also allow airlines to predict, with some accuracy, how many passengers will actually fly after making a reservation to fly. This allows airlines to overbook their flights enough to fill the aircraft while accounting for &quot;no-shows,&quot; but not enough (in most cases) to force paying passengers off the aircraft for lack of seats. Since an average of 1/3 of all seats are flown empty, stimulative pricing for low demand flights coupled with overbooking on high demand flights can help reduce this figure.

===Airport operations===
Where an airline has established an engineering base at an airport then there may be considerable economic advantages in using that same airport as a preferred focus (or &quot;hub&quot;) for its scheduled flights.   

In view of the congestion apparent at many international [[airport|airports]], the ownership of slots at certain airports (the right to take-off or land an aircraft at a particular time of day or night) has become a significant tradeable asset in the portfolios of many airlines. Clearly take-off slots at popular times of the day can be critical in attracting the more profitable business traveler to a given airline's flight and in establishing a competitive advantage against a competing airline. If a particular city has two or more airports, market forces will tend to attract the less profitable routes, or those on which competition is weakest, to the less congested airport, where slots are likely to be more available and therefore cheaper.  Other factors, such as surface transport facilities and onward connections, will also affect the relative appeal of different airports and some long distance flights may need to operate from the one with the longest runway. 

===Business-to-business relations===
[[Code sharing]] is the most common type of airline partnership; it involves one airline selling tickets for another airline's flights under its own airline code. An early example of this was [[Japan Airlines]]' code sharing partnership with [[Aeroflot]] in the 1960s on flights from [[Tokyo]] to [[Moscow]]: Aeroflot operated the flights using Aeroflot aircraft, but JAL sold tickets for the flights as if they were JAL flights. This practice allows airlines to expand their operations, at least on paper, into parts of the world where they cannot afford to establish bases or purchase aircraft. 

Since airline reservation requests are often made by city-pair (such as &quot;show me flights from Chicago to Dusseldorf&quot;), an airline who is able to code share with another airline for a variety of routes might be able to be listed as indeed offering a Chicago-Dusseldorf flight. The passenger is advised however, that Airline 1 operates the flight from say Chicago to Amsterdam, and Airline 2 operates the continuing flight (on a different airplane, sometimes from another terminal) to Dusseldorf. Thus the primary rationale for code sharing is to expand one's service offerings in city-pair terms so as to increase sales.

Virtually all international airlines practice code sharing.

A more recent development is the [[airline alliance]], which became prevalent in the 1990s. These alliances can act as virtual mergers to get around government restrictions. Groups of airlines such as the [[Star Alliance]], [[oneworld]], and [[SkyTeam]] coordinate their passenger service programs (such as lounges and frequent flyer programs), offer special interline tickets, and often engage in extensive codesharing (sometimes systemwide). These are increasingly integrated business combinations-- sometimes including cross-equity arrangements-- in which products, service standards, schedules, and airport facilities are standardized and combined for higher efficiency. One of the first airlines to start an alliance with another airline was [[KLM]], who partnered with [[Northwest Airlines]]. Both airlines later entered the [[SkyTeam]] alliance after the fusion of KLM and [[Air France]] in 2004.

Often the companies combine IT operations, buy fuel, or purchase airplanes as a bloc in order to achieve higher bargaining power. However, the alliances have been most successful at purchasing invisible supplies and services, such as fuel. Airlines usually prefer to purchase items visible to their passengers to differentiate themselves from local competitors. If an airline's main domestic competitor flies Boeing airliners, then the airline may prefer to use Airbus aircraft regardless of what the rest of the alliance chooses.

==Customs and conventions==
Each operator of a scheduled or charter flight uses a distinct [[airline call sign]] when communicating with airports or air traffic control centers. Most of these call-signs are derived from the airline's trade name, but for reasons of history, marketing, or the need to reduce ambiguity in spoken English (so that pilots do not mistakenly make navigational decisions based on instructions issued to a different aircraft), some airlines and air forces use call-signs less obviously connected with their trading name. For example, British Airways uses a ''Speedbird'' call-sign, named after the logo of its predecessor, [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]].

== Airline personnel ==
The various types of airline personnel include:
*[[Flight crew]]s, responsible for the operation of aircraft while airborne. Flight crew members include:
** [[Aviator|Pilot]]s ([[captain]] and [[first officer]]: some older aircraft also require [[flight engineer]]s and/or [[navigator]]s)
** [[Flight attendant]]s (led by a [[purser]] on larger aircraft)
** [[Sky marshal|In-flight security personnel]] on some airlines (most notably [[El Al]])
*[[Ground crew]]s, responsible for operations at airports. Ground crew members include:
**[[Airframe]] and [[powerplant]] technicians
**[[Avionics]] technicians
**[[Flight dispatcher]]s
**Baggage handlers
**Rampers
**Gate agents
**Ticket agents
**Passenger service agents (such as [[airline lounge]] employees)
*Reservations agents, usually (but not always) at facilities outside the airport

Most airlines follow a [[corporation|corporate]] structure where each broad area of operations (such as maintenance, flight operations, and passenger service) is supervised by a vice president. Larger airlines often appoint vice presidents to oversee each of the airline's hubs as well. Airlines also tend to employ considerable numbers of lawyers to deal with regulatory procedures and other administrative tasks.

The '''Australian Democrats''' (in regular parlance, just the '''Democrats'''), is an [[Australia|Australian]] social [[liberal parties|liberal party]] formed in 1977 from the earlier [[Australia Party]] by [[Don Chipp]], who left the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] to do so. His stated aim was to &quot;Keep the Bastards Honest&quot; (the &quot;bastards&quot; being politicians in general). Despite its name (and the name of the rival and [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservative]] [[Liberal Party of Australia]]), the Australian Democrats can be considered the counterpart of European [[liberal parties]]. After a poor performance at the [[Australian legislative election, 2004|2004 federal election]], the Australian Democrats' future as a political force is in question.

==Policy==
The party's original support base was disaffected middle-class traditional Liberal voters from the centre-right Liberal Party's socially liberal, &quot;wet&quot; wing. The party aimed to combine liberal social policies with centrist economics. However, the major parties, including the [[social democracy|social democratic]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]], have moved to the right on economics since the early 1980s, shifting the 'centre' of Australian politics well to the right. Thus the  Democrats have come to be seen as leaning to the left on economic as well as social issues. 

The Democrats' agenda includes [[economic interventionism|interventionist economic]] policies, commitment to [[environmentalism|environmental]] causes, support for [[reconciliation]] with Australia's [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous population]] through such mechanisms as formal treaties, [[pacifism|pacifist]] approaches to international relations, and [[left-wing]] approaches to social issues such as sexuality and drugs, and constitutional and treaty protections for [[human rights]]. Its core support base is overwhelmingly [[tertiary education|tertiary-educated]], and [[middle class|middle-class]]. They also explicitly target voters who seek a brake on the powers of the government of the day to change things, with their long-term hold on the Senate balance of power.

The party has a platform of participatory democracy, with policies supporting [[proportional representation]] and [[citizen initiated referendum|citizens' initated referenda]]. Many important internal issues (such as electoral preselection and leadership) are decided by direct postal ballot of the membership. Although policies are theoretically set in a similar fashion, Democrat parliamentarians have extensive freedom in interpreting them.

==Support==
Support for the Democrats historically tended to fluctuate between about 5 and 10 percent of the population and was geographically concentrated around the wealthy dense [[Central Business District|urban neighbourhoods]] (known in Australia as the [[Central business district|&quot;inner-suburbs and CBD&quot;]]) of the [[Australian capital cities|capital cities]] (especially [[Adelaide, Australia|Adelaide]]). Therefore, they never managed to win a [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] seat (despite coming close on a number of occasions). During the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s they typically held one or two of the Federal [[Australian Senate|Senate]] seats in each state, as well as a handful of representatives in state parliaments and local councils.

However, the rise of the Greens and internal bickering in the early 2000s changed this, and the Democrats are now in heavy decline - receiving 1.24% nationally, and less than 3% of the vote at all but a handful of booths, even in their Adelaide heartland. Their voters are turning to the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberals]] (to the right) and [[Australian Greens|Greens]] (to the left) in almost equal numbers.

==Leadership==
The Democrats are notable for their willingness to elect female and [[Indigenous Australian]] parliamentary leadership. Of the party's ten leaders, six have been women. Aboriginal Senator [[Aden Ridgeway]] was deputy leader under Natasha Stott Despoja.

The leaders of the Australian Democrats have been:

* [[Don Chipp]] (1977-1986)
* [[Janine Haines]] (1986-1990)
* [[Janet Powell]] (1990-91)
* [[John Coulter]] (1991-93)
* [[Cheryl Kernot]] (1993-97)
* [[Meg Lees]] (1997-2001)
* [[Natasha Stott Despoja]] ([[6 April]] [[2001]] to [[21 August]] [[2002]])
* [[Brian Greig]] (2002)
* [[Andrew Bartlett]] (2002-2004)
* [[Lyn Allison]] (2004-present)

[[Andrew Bartlett]] is currently deputy leader.

==A short history==
In terms of percentage votes, the Democrats' electoral peak was probably the 1990 federal election.  The failure of then-leader Janine Haines to win a [[Division of Kingston|House of Representatives seat]] led to a leadership change; her successor, Janet Powell, was too radical for many in the party and lacked electoral appeal.  After an affair with another Senator, she lost the support of much of the caucus. These internal divisions damaged the party in the early 1990s, although recovery occurred under Cheryl Kernot.

During the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]] and [[Paul Keating|Keating]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] Governments (1983-96), which pursued [[economic rationalism|economic rationalist]] [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] policies, the Democrats positioned themselves to the left of the ALP government and thus at the left end of mainstream Australian politics.  However, the party's progressive-liberal politics remained attractive to middle class [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] supporters who were disaffected by the Liberal party's social conservatism (&quot;wet&quot; Liberals).

After the election of the [[John Howard|Howard]] government in 1996, this philosophical division became apparent; there was no longer a single obvious location for the party on the political spectrum.  The left of the party was horrified by John Howard's policies, and wanted to undermine and block them whenever possible.  Others wanted to engage with the government, using the Senate balance of power to negotiate with it and moderate its legislation. The question was whether the Democrats should be a centrist party, at least on economics, (though socially liberal and environmentalist), ready in most cases to negotiate with the government of the day whether Liberal or Labor (the position suggested by the party's &quot;wet Liberal&quot; roots) or a left-wing party, to the left of both mainstream parties on economic as well as social policy, in strong and consistent opposition to the Liberals and willing to take an obstructionist approach in the Senate to the Howard government's legislative program (a position on the political spectrum more similar to the [[Australian Greens|Greens]]). 

This conflict manifested itself in tensions over Cheryl Kernot's policy on [[industrial relations]] (see the [[Workplace Relations Act]] of 1996). Under Kernot, after negotiations and some compromises from the government, the Democrats voted for the Howard Government's right-leaning industrial relations legislation which decreased union power and allowed a larger role for individual employer-employee contracts. Kernot, however, remained both ambitious and broadly opposed to the Liberal government. This, together with her personal ambition for a role in government, lead her to defect to the ALP in 1997. Initially both Labor and the Democrats benefitted from Kernot's move, with polls showing that the Democrats had attracted a significant &quot;sympathy vote&quot;. In the [[Australian legislative election, 1998|1998 federal election]], the Democrats came within 3% of taking Liberal Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]]'s seat of [[Division of Mayo|Mayo]] in the Adelaide Hills under Australia's [[Preferential voting|preferential voting]] system.

Internal conflict over the government's proposed [[Goods and Services Tax]] (GST), during the 1998 federal election and in Parliament in 1999 was extremely damaging to the Democrats. Meg Lees campaigned on a modified GST platform, opposing the GST on food and books. After negotiations with Prime Minister [[John Howard|Howard]], Meg Lees and Andrew Murray (both part of the centrist element within the Democrats) agreed to support the GST legislation with exemptions for most food and some medicines. Many left-wing Democrat voters and a large number of party members regarded this as a betrayal, and two senators on the party's left, [[Natasha Stott Despoja]] and [[Andrew Bartlett]], voted against the GST. 

After very poor state election results in 2001, Lees was replaced by the articulate young left-leaning senator, [[Natasha Stott Despoja]]. Stott Despoja worked hard to bring dissafected former Democrat voters back in the 2001 federal election, although she was not able to bring back enough voters to prevent the loss of a seat to Greens Senator [[Kerry Nettle]], indicating the loss of Democrat votes on the left. (The task was not made any easier by the [[Tampa affair]].) Ongoing tensions between Stott Despoja and Lees (who quit the party in 2002, but was supported by some of the Senators, nicknamed the [[Gang of Four (disambiguation)|Gang of Four]] by the media) forced a protracted leadership battle in 2002, which eventually led to the election of Senator Andrew Bartlett as leader. However, the tension led to [[Meg Lees]] leaving the party and becoming an independent, which deprived the Democrats of the balance of power in the Senate and greatly lessened their relevance and media exposure. 

Since the decision to support the GST in 1999, and especially after the very public infighting in 2002, the Democrats have suffered a severe decline in public support. Although the left-right division within the parliamentary party and between the parliamentary party and the grass roots membership has existed for many years, the recent leadership battles have created bitterness within the party, and exposed the disunity to public scrutiny. With the [[Australian Greens]] picking up many of their voters on the left, and some voters from the centre returning to the Liberals, the Democrats are facing their greatest crisis to date. 

At the height of the disunity in 2002, most political observers believed that the party would soon split or disappear as a serious force in Australian politics. Under Senator Bartlett's leadership the Democrats found a degree of stability and an end to public feuding, but they have made little progress toward recovering their traditional share of electoral support and are now largely ignored by the media. 

On [[6 December]] [[2003]], Andrew Bartlett stepped aside temporarily as leader of the party, after an incident in which he assaulted [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] Senator [[Jeannie Ferris]] on the floor of [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]] while intoxicated. The party issued a statement stating that Deputy Leader [[Lyn Allison]] would serve as the Acting Leader of the party.  Bartlett apologised to the Democrats, Jeannie Ferris and the Australian public for his behaviour and assured all concerned that it would never happen again. On [[January 29]] [[2004]], after seeking medical treatment, Bartlett returned to the Democrats leadership. Andrew Bartlett has not consumed any alcohol since that incident.

Almost totally ignored by the media during the election campaign, the Democrats suffered a massive loss of support at the [[Australian legislative election, 2004|2004 Federal election]], reducing them to 1.24% of the national vote. Nowhere was this more noticeable than in their key support base of suburban [[Adelaide]], where they received between 7 and 31% of the Lower House vote at polling booths in 2001, and between 1% and 4% in 2004. None of their Senators up for re-election survived the vote. Most electoral analysts concluded that, while most of the party's left-wing support had gone to the Greens (who now had an equal number of Senate seats with the Democrats and seemed to have taken their place as the leading minor party), many of the party's centrist middle-class voters from a 'wet Liberal' background had returned to the Liberal Party, helping the Howard Government to win a majority in the Senate, the first government to do so for a quarter of a century. With their Senate numbers almost halved, the Democrats face complete annihilation at the next election if the 2004 result is repeated. 

Following the loss, Bartlett stated that he would not stand down, but in the following month swapped positions with Allison, with Allison becoming the new leader and Bartlett the deputy. However, Allison, like Bartlett, has failed to gain any real media exposure or to increase the party's support in opinion polls.  

On [[1 July]] [[2005]] the Democrats lost most of their remaining parliamentary influence when the senators elected in 2004 were sworn in, giving the governing Coalition outright control of the Senate. On [[5 January]] [[2006]], the ABC reported that the State Electoral Commission of Tasmania had deregistered that branch of the party for failing to provide a list of members.

'''Adobe Systems''' ({{nasdaq|ADBE}}) ({{lse|ABS}}) is an [[United States|American]] [[computer]] [[Computer software|software]] company headquartered in [[San Jose, California]] that was founded in December 1982 by [[John Warnock]] and [[Charles Geschke]]. They founded Adobe after leaving [[Xerox PARC]] in order to further develop and commercialize the [[PostScript]] [[page description language]]. Adobe played a significant role in sparking the [[desktop publishing]] revolution when [[Apple Computer]] licensed PostScript for use in the [[LaserWriter]] [[computer printer|printer]] product line in 1985. The company name ''Adobe'' comes from the Adobe Creek, which ran behind the house of one of the company's founders.

In 2005, Adobe Systems had over 4,000 employees, at least half of whom were located in San Jose. Adobe also has major development operations in [[Seattle, Washington]]; [[Noida]], [[India]]; and [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]]. Minor Adobe development offices include a location near [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]] and in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]]. The 4,000 count was prior to the [[December 3]], [[2005]] merger with [[Macromedia]] of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]].

==History==
[[Image:Adobe HQ.JPG|300px|thumb|right|Adobe Systems headquarters in San Jose]]
Adobe's first products following PostScript were digital [[Typeface|font]]s. Adobe has continued to be a strong presence in the fonts market: in 1996, the company, in combination with [[Microsoft]], announced the [[OpenType]] font format, and in 2003 Adobe completed the conversion of its library of [[Type 1 font]]s to OpenType.

In the mid-[[1980s]], soon after introducing PostScript, Adobe entered the consumer [[Computer software|software]] market with [[Adobe Illustrator]], a [[vector graphics|vector]]-based drawing program for the [[Apple Macintosh]]. Illustrator was the logical outgrowth of commercializing their in-house font-development software. Additionally, it helped popularize the use of PostScript-enabled [[laser printer]]s. Unlike [[MacDraw]] (then the standard Macintosh vector drawing program), Illustrator described all shapes with more flexible [[Bézier curve]]s, providing a level of accuracy not seen in other programs. Font rendering in Illustrator, however, was left to the Macintosh's [[QuickDraw]] libraries and would not be superseded by a PostScript-like approach until Adobe's own [[Adobe Type Manager]] software was introduced, preceding Apple's eventual adoption of [[TrueType]].

Although Illustrator was an excellent product and continues to be highly valued by the [[prepress]] industry, Adobe introduced what was to become its [[flagship]] product, [[Adobe Photoshop]] for the Macintosh, in 1989. Although Photoshop 1.0 had competitors, it was extremely stable and well-featured&amp;mdash;and Adobe had the resources to market it. The combination enabled Photoshop to soon dominate its market.

Arguably, one of Adobe's few missteps on the Macintosh platform was their failure to develop their own [[desktop publishing]] (DTP) program. Instead, [[Aldus]] with [[Adobe PageMaker|PageMaker]] in 1985 and [[Quark, Inc.|Quark]] with [[QuarkXPress]] in 1987 gained early leads in the DTP market. Adobe was also slow to address the emerging [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] DTP market. In a classic failure to predict the direction of computing, Adobe released a complete version of Illustrator for [[Steve Jobs]]' ill-fated [[NeXT]] system, but a poorly produced version for Windows.

History has been kind to Adobe however, because the company always had licensing fees from the PostScript interpreter to fall back on, Adobe was able to simply outlast many of its rivals in the late 1980s and early [[1990s]], and, like [[Microsoft]], eventually acquired its main competitors or continued to improve its applications until they became industry standards. For reasons unknown, [[Corel]] never leveraged their [[CorelDraw]] product to do professional illustration&amp;mdash;users quietly derided it as something only office users would touch&amp;mdash;so when Illustrator was finally revamped for Windows, prepress users found it too good to ignore. Corel's interest in acquiring [[WordPerfect]] from [[Novell]] Corporation around this time may have proved to be a key distraction. In 1994, Adobe took over Aldus and acquired PageMaker and the [[TIFF]] file format; in 1995 they acquired the long-document DTP application [[FrameMaker]] from Frame Technologies.

Adobe's latest efforts are mainly centered on its [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF). Although sales of [[Adobe Acrobat]], which generates PDF files, were slow to start in the mid-1990s, Adobe continued to develop the product, perceiving its long-term potential for revenues. History has since shown this to be a wise investment. Adobe has also seen several ancillary benefits: PDF provides a common, high-quality data exchange infrastructure for its DTP applications.

Among open software advocates, some see Adobe as overly aggressive. This image was created with their decision to use an encrypted, proprietary format for their high-quality Type 1 fonts, thus allowing them to charge licensing fees for any other company that wanted to produce or use Type 1 fonts. The size of these fees was a factor in Apple's development of their own [[TrueType]] technology as well as Microsoft's decision to license TrueType from Apple. At the presentation at which TrueType was introduced, Adobe head Warnock followed TrueType talks from both Apple and Microsoft VPs, and was near tears as he said that they were being sold &quot;smoke.&quot; In fact, TrueType had definitive advantages: it provided not only full scalability, but also precise control of the pixel pattern created by the font's outlines. A few months later Adobe published the Type 1 specification, and soon released the &quot;Adobe Type Manager&quot; software, which allowed for [[WYSIWYG]] scaling of Type 1 fonts on screen, just like TrueType (though without the precise
pixel-level control). However, these moves were too late to stop the rise of TrueType, which quickly became the standard for business and the average Windows user, with Type 1 remaining the standard in the graphics/publishing market.

On [[2005-04-18]] Adobe Systems announced an agreement to acquire its former main rival [[Macromedia]] in a stock swap valued at about $3.4 billion on the last trading day before the announcement. The acquisition was consummated on [[2005-12-03]].

==Reputation==
In many circles Adobe is considered one of the most principled of the major software companies, and one that treats its large corporate customers and employees well, although customer service for smaller businesses and individuals has often received unfavorable press. Adobe has climbed [[Fortune magazine]]'s rankings as an outstanding place to work over the last several years (2001-03). Adobe was rated the fifth best American company to work for in 2003 and sixth best in 2004. Adobe was ineligible for Fortune's ranking in 2005 due to its major acquisition of Macromedia.

The '''Alexander Technique'''  teaches how to recognize and overcome habituated limitations within a person's manner of movement. The Alexander Technique is usually learned from an ''Alexander teacher'' in one-to-one sessions by an ''Alexander student,'' using specialized hand contact and verbal instructions. The name denotes both the educational methods taught by ''Alexander teachers'' and the individual method practiced by teachers and students of the technique.
It takes its name from [[F. Matthias Alexander]] ([[1869]]&amp;ndash;[[1955]]), a former Shakespearean recitalist, who first observed and formulated its principles during [[1890]] &amp;ndash; [[1900]]. Alexander regarded the empirical scientific method to be the foundation of his work. He used self-observation and reasoning to make effortless the physical acts of every-day movement: sitting, standing, breathing, working with the hands and speaking. He designed his methods to make experimentation and training deliberately repeatable, and to learn in a way that would allow continuing improvement from any starting point.

F.M. Alexander trained teachers of his technique from [[1931]] until [[1955]] in London, UK and from [[1941]] to [[1943]] in Massachusetts, USA, together with his brother, A.R. Alexander ([[1874]]&amp;ndash;[[1947]]), who continued with the training of teachers in the USA until [[1945]]. During his lifetime, F.M. Alexander gained considerable support for his work, including [[John Dewey]], [[Aldous Huxley]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], and scientists [[Raymond Dart]], [[George E. Coghill]], [[Charles Sherrington]], and [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]].

= History =
'''F.M. Alexander''' was a Shakespearean orator who developed problems with his voice. Careful observation with multiple mirrors revealed that he needlessly stiffened his whole body in a particular habitual pattern in preparation to recite or speak. It took ten years of self-observation to successfully apply his original discoveries to solve his voice problem. Eventually, he fashioned a &quot;Technique&quot; to teach others to pass on his experience. His work continues today, extending in a lineage that has expanded from many lifetime dedications.

=The Technique=
==Basic Premises==
The Alexander Technique educates the student's sense of [[kinesthesia]] or [[proprioception]]. This sense is used to internally calibrate one's own bodily location, weight and to judge the effort necessary for moving.

Alexander Technique teachers believe that humans have a built-in proprioceptive blind spot; people become habituated to whatever they repeat. Repetitious circumstances lead people to create habits as they adapt and learn. These habits are both deliberate and non-deliberate responses that include physical movement patterns, coping and learning strategies. The advantage of adapting is that behavior and learning becomes simplified; it becomes possible to meet a given stimulus or interpretation of circumstances with a ready-made reaction. As a person adds one habit onto another, the disadvantage is they may train themselves to also repeat unintentional side effects - the tension, over-compensation and cumulative stress that the Alexander Technique addresses.

Adapting has a further serious drawback: ''habits disappear sensation.'' Using the habit decreases the importance of paying attention to perceptual differences. Also, sensory systems can flood from accommodating too many contradicting habits and intentions. From disuse or flooding, perceptual sensitivity shuts down and eventually become dull and untrustworthy, just as skin becomes numb if the same spot is rubbed for too long. Loss of perceptual awareness encourages mistaken interpretations for the need to choose a particular response. In a panic, all opposing habits can fire off at once, pulling in all directions, sometimes without the person noticing it has happened.

Because habits are designed to become innate, people will commonly experience no sensation of ''doing'' a successfully automated habit. Forgetting what they have trained themselves to now do without thinking, this drawback encourages people to feel convinced that whatever effort or ways they now use to move to respond is customary and necessary, even when it is far from normal. 

How our kinesthetic sense becomes untrustworthy from adapting to needless overcompensating is built into many innocent situations. For instance, if a person often carries a bag on their forearm, he will later find himself holding up his arm when the bag is not on it.  Misunderstanding a teacher's directions, a student may repeat what the teacher knows is unnecessary, but the teacher forgivingly allows the mistake to go by when he should not. A self-taught student may unknowingly adopt useless and later problematic mannerisms. If someone is afraid while learning, adapting can mean he will most likely continue doing the skill fearfully. If someone has healed from a temporary injury, a subtle wincing in anticipation of pain can be automatically continued indefinitely, even though pain has healed. Also due to rapid growth, teenagers often move their own bodies based on inaccurate assumptions of their size and structure.

According to Alexander teachers, few adults in Western culture retain their ability to move freely without needless self-imposed interference. Teachers find that most people assume that they &quot;must&quot; move in the only way they assume is possible. Given an unceasing cumulative demand that unnecessarily stresses the body’s structural design, the price as adults grow older can range from feelings of stress and resignation to very real physical problems, due to movement limitations that could be changed. According to those who teach Alexander Technique, most of the time, giving up a certain activity isn't necessary if a learner is ready to free specific habits that work against the body's structural design.

==Benefits==
As a technique addressing the entirety of a person's activity, the Alexander Technique aims to benefit people of all sorts. Its proponents, including many well known actors, musicians and educators believe that its practice results in improved awareness, objectivity and the connection between body and mind, ease of movement, improved balance, stamina and less muscular tension. Additionally, those who practice it often report that it gives them an enhanced ability to clarify their thinking, observations and the ability to choose new responses.
Proponents further see the technique as a way to use less effort for movement and thus perform more efficiently, feel easier, look more graceful and free themselves from unintentional self-imposed limitations.

It is applied both remedially and in the areas of performing arts and sports. It is taught in performance schools of dance, acting, circus, music, voice and some Olympic sports. Since Alexander Technique is suitable for those at any fitness level, it is also used as remedial movement education to complete recovery and provide pain management. Alexander Technique is a first-hand experience of the reaot become malignant nor normally cause any lung impairment.

==Litigation==
{{main|Asbestos and the law}}
In the United States, asbestos was one of the first hazardous air [[pollutant]]s regulated under Section 112 of the [[Clean Air Act (USA) (1970)|Clean Air Act]] of [[1970]].  One estimate says that, in the 20th century, more than 100 million Americans were exposed to asbestos in the workplace.[http://www.actuary.org/pdf/casualty/mono_dec01asbestos.pdf]

Today, lawsuits claiming that asbestos caused plaintiffs' diseases form a gigantic part of the total amount of lawsuits pending in American courts, with a cost of tens of billions of dollars for expenses, settlements, and judgments to date. The original asbestos manufacturers were driven into [[Chapter 11]] [[bankruptcy]]; plaintiffs have moved to suing corporations who had more peripheral connections to asbestos; the original plaintiffs have gone from those who had mesothelioma and other serious asbestos-related health problems to include those who merely were exposed to asbestos and wished to recover for their fear of future injury.[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1032128856491]  Nearly every American industry has had asbestos defendants, and over 70 corporations have filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the face of heavy liability claims.[http://www.actuary.org/pdf/casualty/mono_dec01asbestos.pdf], [http://www.asbestossolution.org/bankruptcies.doc]  Since the late 1970s, approximately 6% of all filings in American courts each year were related to asbestos, leading to its perception as a sort of [[poster child]] of [[tort reform]] and the rampant lawsuit excesses of the United States.  A [[RAND]] [http://www.rand.org/publications/MG/MG162/ study] found that less than half the money spent on asbestos litigation went to injured parties, as opposed to attorneys' fees and administrative costs.  [[As of 2004]], asbestos cases result in about 600 to 700 appellate opinions per year (that is, including both federal and state courts); this number does not include other cases that were not appealed, or were settled or otherwise abandoned before trial.  Estimates of total American deaths attributable to asbestos range from 200,000 to 265,000 (according to the March 1991 Report of the Judicial Conference Ad Hoc Committee on Asbestos Litigation). The number of suits has increased, although the leading epidemiological study, cited by attorneys on both sides, suggests that deaths peaked in the 1990s. However, others contend that deaths from asbestosis and mesothelioma have not yet peaked.[http://www.ewg.org/reports/asbestos/facts/fact1.php]

&quot;Asbestos litigation today is, for the most part, a massively fraudulent enterprise that can rightfully take its place among the pantheon of such great American swindles as the [[Yazoo land scandal|Yazoo land frauds]], [[Credit Mobilier]] and [[Teapot Dome]],&quot; said [[Lester Brickman]], a professor at [[Cardozo Law School]], in a recent speech on the phenomenon.[http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/cjf_40.htm]  For example, [[Fred Baron|Baron &amp; Budd, P.C.]], a renowned [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] plaintiff's firm, is alleged to have coached clients how to provide winning testimony against asbestos defendants.[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/T?&amp;report=sr118&amp;dbname=cp108]  In recent years, there have been many scandals over asbestos litigation because of the number of cases involving [[plaintiff]]s who had suffered no injury other than asymptomatic pleural plaques.  An investigation into claims filed for alleged [[silicosis]] found that 65% of the plaintiffs claiming to be suffering from silicosis had previously recovered from asbestos defendants by alleging that they had [[asbestosis]].[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/09/business/09tort.html?pagewanted=all], [http://www.caller2.com/2005/pics/PTO29jurisdiction.pdf]  Many attorneys, including [[Peter Angelos]], have become rich because they established lucrative relationships with unions that steered potential asbestos plaintiffs to their law firms in exchange for questionable financial relationships with union executives.[http://www.pointoflaw.com/articles/26WMEL.pdf], [http://www.motherjones.com/news/special_reports/mojo_400/7_angelos.html] In the mass screenings that would take place, it is alleged that asbestos-related ailments were systematically overdiagnosed.[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=490682]

Because many companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in view of claims from plaintiffs (some of whom may have been uninjured), and because some of the earlier manufacturer bankruptcy proceedings underestimated future asbestos liability, many seriously injured workers received as little as ten cents on the dollar of the compensation due them.[http://www.shb.com/FileUploads/elephantinemass_725.pdf], [http://www.newamerica.net/index.cfm?pg=article&amp;DocID=278]

Asbestos-related cases were a rare sight on the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] [[docket]] prior to 1980, but since then, the Court has dealt with asbestos-injury cases in 1986, 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, and 2002.  The 1997 and 1999 cases both involved giant settlement [[class action]]s that were designed to stabilize the liability of the largest defendants. Both settlements were ultimately overturned by the Court because they resolved the rights of future claimants who, because they were currently unknown, could not be given the notice that [[due process]] requires. 

[[Texas]] passed a reform bill requiring neutral medical screening in asbestos claims. Georgia passed a reform bill that requires an out-of-state plaintiff to provide &quot;prima facie evidence of physical impairment&quot; that shows &quot;to a reasonable degree of certainty&quot; that exposure to asbestos was &quot;a substantial contributing factor&quot; to the plaintiff's injuries. Plaintiffs' attorneys in the state complain that this would foreclose &quot;98%&quot; of the pending claims, and that the law is unconstitutional.[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1127133334895] 

Congress is considering legislation, the [[Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2005]], that would establish a $140 billion trust fund to supplant litigation as a means to compensate victims of asbestos.  Trial lawyers protest that the trust fund would undercompensate injured workers, while some [[conservative]]s argue that the trust fund does not do enough to prevent fraud; would override state reforms in Texas, Ohio, and Georgia; and would be too &quot;leaky&quot; to prevent future litigation problems.

Asbestos liability is one of the largest issues facing the global insurance industry today, with the industry contending that many are suing because they have been exposed but have not as yet contracted asbestos-related lung diseases, which have latency periods of 10-40 years, and because lawyers spend millions each year advertising to promote such lawsuits.[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1032128833445], [http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1032128856491], [http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/nj/taylor2002-10-01.htm]

In [[Australia]], public attention was drawn in mid-2004 to [[James Hardie]]'s handling of its asbestos injury liabilities, following the revelations of a [[New South Wales]] government-sanctioned inquiry.

In [[Brazil]], prohibition of extraction and use of asbestos is currently under consideration.

In [[Japan]] too, recently there has been a spurt of lawsuits involving actual or potential damage due to the use of asbestos in schools and public places, following public outcry over asbestos-related deaths.

==Removal of asbestos==
[[Image:Asbestos-warning.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Structures containing asbestos are marked]]
Many buildings contain asbestos, which was used in spray-applied [[flame retardant]], thermal system insulation, and in a variety of other materials. Typically, asbestos was &quot;[[Flocking_(texture)|flocked]]&quot; above false ceilings, inside technical ducts, and in many other small spaces where firefighters would have difficulty gaining access. Structural components like asbestos panels were also used.  In residences, it was often a component of a type of flocked acoustic ceiling called &quot;popcorn ceiling&quot;, until its production was banned in the U.S. in 1978.  However, the ban allowed installers to use up remaining stocks, so houses built as late as 1986 could still have asbestos in their acoustic ceilings.  The only way to be sure is to remove a sample and have it tested by a competent laboratory.

Depending on how and where asbestos was applied, it might not pose any risk to most users of the building.  If the fibers cannot dislodge themselves, they cannot be inhaled, and thus the risk is absent. 

However, with certain ways of applying asbestos, particularly flocking, asbestos fibers may gradually drop off into the air. Furthermore, in all cases, asbestos poses special hazards to maintenance personnel who have to drill holes in walls for installation of cables or pipes. 

Also, even if the workers are protected, such maintenance operation may release fibers into the air, which may be inhaled by other users later. As a consequence, interventions in areas where asbestos is present often have to follow stringent procedures.

The removal of asbestos from a building is quite difficult because of the above constraints. If removal is to be performed when users are still present in the building, it is usually necessary to relocate some of them temporarily.  Typically, the part of the building from which asbestos is being removed has to be sealed off in order to prevent contamination of the other areas. 

Even if the building is closed to normal users, it is necessary to seal it off from outside atmosphere so that no accessible air is contaminated. Accordingly, asbestos removal projects are long and costly. Examples of long asbestos removal enterprises include the [[Jussieu Campus]] (begun circa 1996 and still going on [[as of 2005]]) and the ''[[Tour Montparnasse]]'' (in 2005, projected duration was 3 years if the tower was emptied of its users, and 10 years if it was not).

An asbestos-containing building that is to be torn down may have to be sealed, and to have its asbestos safely removed first before ordinary demolition can be performed.  The asbestos removal may take longer and cost more than the actual tearing-down of the building.

== Controversy == 

As with some other environmental prohibitions like [[DDT]] and [[CFC]]s, the movement to ban asbestos has many critics, some of whom claim either that the substance in question is not harmful, or that the ban does more harm than good [http://spiderjohnson.com/asbestos.html]. 

Among the arguments around asbestos prohibition are:

* The view that the [[shuttle Challenger]] exploded because the maker of O-ring putty was pressured by the EPA into ceasing production of its more temperature-resistant, asbestos-laden putty, prompting replacement with an inferior putty, which had continual problems of a sort which could have caused the O-ring leak and subsequent explosion.

* The &quot;Amphibole Hypothesis&quot; states that Chrysotile asbestos is not as harmful as asbestos from the amphibole group.  Several studies have been conducted which support this conclusion.  Criticisms have been raised about the methodology used in these studies.  Several other studies have been conducted which contradict the &quot;Amphibole Hypothesis&quot; [http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pdfs/97-162-d.pdf].

* Some countries, notably Canada, still use Chrysotile asbestos [http://www.chrysotile.com/en/chrysotile/regulation/qc-gov.aspx].  Canada has a significant economic interest in the mining of Chrysotile.

* The question of why asbestos is also banned in circumstances where inhalation is nearly impossible, such as when it's being included in sealed areas already dangerous to human beings, instead of simply when it might be used as insulation in a ventilated area, or other similar cases which actually expose it to people against their will.

* Critics argue that where asbestos has been banned, its roles were taken by products which are often either inferior, or far more expensive. They argue that this has a negative impact on society as a whole, which (especially if the previous arguments are true in whole or part) may be greater than the benefit of its removal.

'''Absorption''' may refer to:

*In physics:
**[[absorption (chemistry)]] - absorption of particles of gas or liquid in liquid or solid material as studied in [[physical chemistry]]
**[[absorption (optics)]] - absorption of [[photon]]s by a material
**[[Absorption (acoustics)]] - absorption of [[sound]] waves by a material
*[[Absorption (economics)]] refers to the total demand of an economy for goods and services both from within and without the economy
*In mathematics, the [[absorption law]] (&lt;math&gt;a\vee (a\wedge b)=a\wedge (a\vee b)=a&lt;/math&gt;) defines a [[lattice (order)|lattice]], where the binary operations &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt; are called [[meet]] and [[join]], respectively.

*In Psychology, absorption is a measure of one's capacity to become totally focussed. Total absorption is often termed '[[Flow (psychology)]]'. The Tellegen Absorption Scale is a reliable questionnaire measure of absorption.

*In Medicine/Biology, adsorption may refer to uptake of substances by the [[GI tract]], see [[Digestion]]. Also see [[Osmosis]].

Absorption should not be confused with ''[[adsorption]]'', the formation of a liquid or gas film on a solid surface.

The '''actinophryids''' are a small, familiar group of [[heliozoa]]n protists.  They are the most common heliozoa in fresh water, and are especially frequent in lakes and rivers, but a few are found in marine and soil habitats as well.  Each is unicellular and roughly spherical in shape, without any shell or test, and with many pseudopodia suported by axopods radiating outward from the cell body, which adhere to passing prey and allows it to roll or float about.  The outer portion of the cell, or ectoplasm, is distinct and is filled with many tiny [[vacuole]]s, which assist in flotation.  A few contractile vacuoles around the periphery of the cell expel excess water, and are visible as clear bulges when full.

There are two genera included here.  ''Actinophrys'' have a single, central nucleus.  Most are around [[1 E-5 m|40-50]] &amp;mu;m in diameter, with axopods up to 100 &amp;mu;m in length, though this varies.  ''Actinosphaerium'' are several times larger, from [[1 E-4 m|200-1000]] &amp;mu;m in diameter, with many nuclei, and are found exclusively in fresh water.  Two other genera, ''Echinosphaerium'' and ''Camptonema'', have been described but appear to be synonyms.

Reproduction takes place by fission, with open [[mitosis]].  Under unfavourable conditions, the organism will form a cyst, which is multi-walled and covered in spikes.  While encysted it may undergo a peculiar process of [[autogamy]] or self-fertilization, where it goes through [[meiosis]] and divides to form two gametes, which then fuse together again.  This is the only form of [[sexual reproduction]]  that occurs within the group, though it is really more genetic reorganization than reproduction.

The axopods are supported by [[microtubule]]s arranged in a unique and characteristic double-coil pattern.  In ''Actinophrys'', these arise from the nuclear membrane, while in ''Actinosphaerium'' some do and others don't.  Other heliozoa where the microtubules arise from the nucleus have been considered possible relatives, and it now appears that the actinophryids developed from [[axodine]]s such as ''Pedinella''.  These are specialized [[heterokont]] algae, related to [[golden alga]]e, [[diatom]]s, [[brown alga]]e, and the like, which have microtubule-supported tentacles.
[[Category:Heterokonts]][[Category:Amoeboids]]

As far as the diet of the Actinophyrys goes, the protist feeds on small flagellates, diminutive cilates, microscopic algae, etc.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AbelTasman.jpeg|thumb|250px|Portrait of Tasman]]
'''Abel Janszoon Tasman''' ([[1603]] - [[October 10]], [[1659]]), was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[sea explorer|seafarer]] and [[exploration|explorer]], born in [[Lutjegast]], a village in the province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], best known for his voyages of [[1642]] and [[1644]], in the service of the VOC ([[Dutch East India Company]]). His was the first European [[expedition]] to reach the islands of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (now [[Tasmania]]) and [[New Zealand]] and the first to sight the [[Fiji]] islands, in 1643. He also mapped substantial portions of [[Australia]].

His task was to investigate the country then known as ''[[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]'', now known as ''Australia'', of which the Dutch had already discovered the west coast, and to determine whether it was part of [[Terra Australis]]. It was hoped by the VOC that he would thus locate a new unexploited continent for [[trade]]. To do so, on his first voyage (1642 to [[1643]]) he sailed from [[Jakarta]] (then known as [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]]) with two small ships, the ''Heemskerck'' and the ''Zeehaen'', first to [[Mauritius]], and from there sailed east at a higher latitude than the Dutch had done before. This way, he completely missed mainland Australia, but did finally find land at the island of Tasmania on [[November 24]]. He named it ''Van Diemen's Land'', but later [[United Kingdom|British]] [[colonist]]s would rename it after Tasman. After some investigation, he sailed further east, and discovered [[New Zealand]], which he named ''Staten Landt'' on the theory that it was connected to a piece of [[Staten Island, Argentina|land]] south of the tip of [[South America]]. He sailed north along its west coast. At the northern end of the [[South Island]] he anchored the ships in a [[Golden Bay|bay]], where five of his sailors were killed in his first and only encounter with the [[Māori]]. (Schools in New Zealand during the early 1950s taught that Abel Tasman mistook the Maori challenges blown on conch shells as a welcome and instructed his bugler to return the challenges, note for note. Hence the attack that night.) Tasman named it ''Murderers' Bay'' (now known as [[Golden Bay]]) and sailed north, but mistook [[Cook Strait]] for a bight (naming it ''Zeehaen's Bight''), believing ''Staten Landt'' to be a single land, and part of [[Terra Australis]]. En route back to Batavia, he came across the [[Tonga]] archipelago on [[January 21]], [[1643]].  Two names that he bestowed on New Zealand landmarks still endure: [[Cape Maria Van Diemen]] and [[Three Kings Islands]].

[[Image:Tasmanroutes.PNG|thumb|350px|Tasman's routes]]
On his second voyage, in [[1644]], he followed the south coast of [[New Guinea]] eastward. He missed the [[Torres Strait]] between New Guinea and Australia, and continued his voyage along the Australian coast. He mapped the north coast of Australia.

From the point of view of the VOC, Tasman's explorations were a disappointment: He had neither found a promising am genealogy]] for a comparison of the genealogies of the Canterbury and Winchester manuscripts with the one given by [[Snorri Sturluson]] in his [[Edda]].

'''Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd.''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] luxury [[car]] manufacturer based in [[Newport Pagnell]], [[Buckinghamshire]]. The company name was derived from the ''Aston'' Clinton [[hillclimbing|Hillclimb]] course and founder Lionel ''Martin''. Up to the year 2003, approximately 20,200 cars had been built by Aston Martin.  Today, the company is part of the [[Premier Automotive Group]] division of [[Ford Motor Company]].

===Foundation===
Aston Martin was founded in [[1914]] by [[Lionel Martin]] and Robert Bamford. The two had joined forces as Bamford &amp; Martin the previous year to sell cars made by [[Singer (car)|Singer]] from premises in Callow Street, London. Martin raced specials at the [[Aston Hill]]  near [[Aston Clinton]], and the pair decided to make their own vehicles. They acquired premises at Henniker Place in [[Kensington]] and produced their first car in March [[1915]].  Production could not start because of World War 1 and Martin joined the Admiralty and Bamford the Royal Army Service Corps. All machinery was sold to the Sopwith Aircraft Company.

===Inter war years===
After the war hiatus, the company was refounded at Abingdon Road, Kensington and a new car designed which would carry the Aston-Martin name. Bamford left in 1920 and the company was revitalised with funding from [[Count Louis Zborowski]]. In [[1922]], Bamford &amp; Martin produced cars to compete in the [[French Grand Prix]], and the cars set world speed and endurance records at [[Brooklands]]. The company went bankrupt in 1924 and was bought by Lady Charnwood who put her son John Benson on the board. The company failed again in 1925 and the factory closed in 1926 with Lionel Martin leaving. 

Later that year, a number of rich investors, including Lady Charnwood, took control of the company and renamed it Aston Martin Motors, and moved the firm to the former [[Citroen]] plant in [[Feltham]]. John Benson brought in Augusto Benelli as designer. The [[1929]] Aston Martin International was another successful racer and was followed by the [[Le Mans]] and the [[Ulster]]. Financial problems reappeared in 1932 and the company was rescued by L Prideaux Brune who funded it for the following year before passing the company on to Sir Artur Sutherland.  In [[1936]], the company decided to concentrate on road cars. Car production had always been on a small scale and from the company's founding until the advent of [[World War II]] halted work only about 700 had been made. During the war years aircraft components were made.

===The David Brown era===
In [[1947]], [[David Brown Limited]] bought the company under the leadership of managing director Sir [[David Brown (entrepreneur)|David Brown]] &amp;mdash; its &quot;post-war saviour&quot;. David Brown also acquired [[Lagonda]] that year, and both companies shared resources and workshops. In [[1954]], David Brown bought the site at Tickford Street in [[Newport Pagnell]], and that was the beginning of the classic series of cars bearing the initials 'DB'. In [[1950]], the company announced the [[Aston Martin DB2|DB2]], followed by the racing [[Aston Martin DB3|DB3]] in [[1957]] and the Italian-styled 3.7&amp;nbsp;L [[Aston Martin DB4|DB4]] in [[1958]]. All the cars established a good racing pedigree for the firm, but the DB4 was the key to establishing the company's reputation&amp;mdash;which was cemented with the famous [[Aston Martin DB5|DB5]] in [[1963]]. The company continued developing the &quot;grand touring&quot; style with the [[Aston Martin DB6|DB6]] (1965&amp;ndash;70), the [[Aston Martin DBS|DBS]], and the [[Aston Martin V8|DBS V8]] (1967&amp;ndash;72).  The latter was subsequently renamed the [[Aston Martin Vantage|Vantage]].

===Changing ownership===
Despite the cars' appreciation in value, the company was often financially troubled. In [[1972]], it was sold to a [[Birmingham]]-based consortium, and resold in [[1975]] to the North American businessmen Peter Sprague and George Minden. The new American owners pushed the company into modernizing its line, producing the [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (1977)|V8 Vantage]] in [[1977]], the convertible [[Aston Martin V8|Volante]] in [[1978]], and the one-off William Towns-styled [[Aston Martin Bulldog|Bulldog]] in [[1980]]. Towns also styled the futuristic new [[Aston Martin Lagonda|Lagonda]] saloon, based on the existing V8 model. The Americans sold the company to CH Industrial, who themselves turned the company over in [[1983]] to Automotive Investments who, in turn, lasted barely a year before selling the company to Peter Livanos and company chairman Victor Gauntlett. At last, in [[1986]], the [[Ford Motor Company]] purchased 75 per cent of the company, later gaining complete control of the company.

In [[1988]], having produced some 5,000 cars in twenty years, the company finally retired the ancient V8 and introduced the [[Aston Martin Virage|Virage]] range. In [[1992]], the [[Aston Martin Virage#Vantage|Vantage]] version was announced, and the following year the company renewed the DB range by announcing the [[Aston Martin DB7|DB7]].

===The Ford era===
In [[1993]], Ford finally bought Victor Gauntlett's shares and took full control of the firm, placing it in the [[Premier Automotive Group|Ford Premier Automotive Group]]. Ford substantially invested in new manufacturing and quickly ramped-up production. In 1994, Ford opened a new factory at Banbury Road in [[Bloxham]]. In [[1995]], the company produced a record 700 vehicles, in [[1998]] the 2,000th DB7 was built, and in [[2002]] the 6,000th &amp;mdash; exceeding production of all previous DB models. The DB7 range was boosted by the addition of [[Aston Martin DB7|V12 Vantage]] models in [[1999]], and in [[2001]] the company introduced the V12-engine [[Aston Martin Vanquish|Vanquish]].

2003 was a significant year for Aston Martin. At the North American International Auto Show in [[Detroit, Michigan]], U.S.A., Aston Martin introduced the new [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (2005)|AMV8 Vantage]] concept car. Expected to have few changes before its introduction in 2005, the new AMV8 Vantage brings back the classic V8 engine and will allow the company to compete in a larger market. The year also saw the opening of the [[Gaydon]] factory, the first purpose-built factory in Aston Martin's history. Also introduced in 2003, was the new [[Aston Martin DB9|DB9]] coupé, which replaces the ten-year-old DB7. A convertible version of the DB9, known as the DB9 Volante, was introduced at the 2004 Detroit Auto Show.

In December 2003, Aston Martin announced they would return to motor racing in 2005. A new division was created, called [[Aston Martin Racing]], who will be responsible, together with [[Prodrive]], for the design, development, and management of the DBR9 program. The DBR9 will compete in the GT class in [[sports car racing|sports car races]] including the world-famous [[24 hours of Le Mans]].


== Models ==
Aston Martin's model naming can be confusing to the uninitiated.  In general, high performance models use the &quot;[[Aston Martin Vantage (disambiguation)|Vantage]]&quot; name, while convertibles are called ''Volante''.

== Astons on film ==

The very British glamour of Aston Martin cars meant they were a natural choice for the [[James Bond]] series of action films, notably the silver DB5 that appears in ''[[Goldfinger]]'' (1964) and ''[[Thunderball]]'' (1965) as James Bond's company car, and then in ''[[GoldenEye]]'' (1995) and ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' (1997) as his private car. In ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' (1969) there appears, for a short time, a charcoal grey DBS. After an interlude with [[Lotus (car)|Lotus]], Aston Martins were again used, a charcoal grey Volante in ''[[The Living Daylights]]'' (1987), and, after another hiatus, the Vanquish appeared in ''[[Die Another Day]]'' (2002). In early 2004, Henrik Fisker, Design Director at Aston Martin, revealed that James Bond will be driving the new DBS [http://www.classicdriver.com/uk/magazine/3300.asp?id=12807] in [[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]] to be released in 2006.

''[[The Italian Job]]'' (1969) features a silver DB4 Convertible, owned by crook Charlie Croker, played by [[Michael Caine]]. Later, this car is destroyed in a [[Mafia]] ambush, along with a pair of [[E-type Jaguar]]s. The cars were meant to serve as getaway vehicles in the subsequent robbery &quot;in case anything goes wrong.&quot; The gang decide to proceed despite this loss, and the question of what happens if anything goes wrong is pointedly ignored by Croker. Interestingly, the filming of the Aston going over the cliff was not considered dramatic enough by the director (due to the explosion looking too &quot;faked&quot;) and so rather than destroy another Aston, a [[Lancia]] mocked up to look like its British counterpart was pushed over the edge for the second take. In the 2003 remake with the same title, the character Handsome Rob, played by Jason Statham, ends up driving an Aston Martin, but not the Vanquish that he wanted. Instead, it is a DB7 Volante.

An Aston Martin also appeared in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds.


== Toy Models ==

Aston Martin has also had a presence in the toy industry; one of the most famous toy cars ever was the ''Corgi James Bond Aston Martin DB5'', pictured here. First released in 1965 and then re-released some years later, it has provided many generations of children with a taste of the Aston Martin legend.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Albert Pike''' (born [[December 29]], [[1809]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]; died [[April 2]], [[1891]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]) was an [[attorney-at-law|attorney]], soldier, writer, and [[freemasonry|Freemason]].  Albert Pike is the only [[Confederate States Army|Confederate military]] officer or figure to be honored with a statue in Washington D.C.  The statue sits in Judiciary Square.

[[Image:AlbertPikeYounger.jpeg|thumb|Photograph of Pike]]

==Biography==
Pike was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], son of Benjamin and Sarah (Andrews) Pike, and spent his childhood in [[Byfield, Massachusetts|Byfield]] and [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]]. He attended school in Newburyport and [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]] until he was 15, at which point, having passed the [[Harvard University|Harvard]] entrance exam but unable to afford tuition, he began a program of self-education, later becoming a schoolteacher in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]], [[Fairhaven, Massachusetts|Fairhaven]] and Newburyport.

In 1831 Pike left Massachusetts to travel west, first stopping in [[Saint Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and later moving on to [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], [[Missouri]].  In Independence, he joined an expedition to [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]], [[New Mexico]], hunting and trading.  During the excursion his horse broke and ran, forcing Pike to walk the remaining 500 miles to Taos. After this he joined a trapping expedition to the [[Llano Estacado]] in New Mexico and [[Texas]].  Trapping was minimal, and after traveling about 1300 miles (650 on foot), he finally arrived at [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]], [[Arkansas]].

Settling in Arkansas in 1833, he taught school and wrote a series of articles for [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] ''Arkansas Advocate'' under the [[pen name]] of &quot;Casca.&quot;  The articles were popular enough that he was asked to join the staff of the newspaper.  Later, after marrying Mary Ann Hamilton, he purchased part of the newspaper with the dowry. By 1835 he was the ''Advocate''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s sole owner. Under Pike's administration the ''Advocate'' promoted the viewpoint of the [[United States Whig Party|Whig party]] in a politically volatile and divided Arkansas. 

He then began to study law, and was admitted to the bar in 1837, selling the ''Advocate'' the same year.  He was the first reporter for the Arkansas supreme court, and also wrote a book (published anonymously), titled ''The Arkansas Form Book'', which was a guidebook for lawyers.

===Military career===
When the [[Mexican-American War]] started, Pike joined the cavalry and was commissioned as a troop commander, serving in the [[Battle of Buena Vista]].  He and his commander, [[John Selden Roane]], had several differences of opinion.  This situation led finally to a [[duel]] between Pike and Roane.  Although several shots were fired in the duel, nobody was injured, and the two were persuaded by their seconds to discontinue it.

After the war, Pike returned to the practice of law, moving to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] for a time beginning in 1853.   He wrote another book, ''Maxims of the Roman Law and some of the Ancient French Law, as Expounded and Applied in Doctrine and Jurisprudence''. Although unpublished, this book increased his reputation among his associates in law. He returned to Arkansas in 1857, gaining some amount of prominence in the legal field and becoming an advocate of [[slavery]], although retaining his affiliation with the Whig party.  When that party dissolved, he became a member of the [[United States Know-Nothing Party|Know-Nothing]] party.  Before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] he was firmly against secession, but when the war started he nevertheless took the side of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].

He also made several contacts among the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes in the area, at one point negotiating an $800,000 settlement between the [[Creek (people)|Creek]]s and other tribes and the federal government.  This relationship was to influence the course of his Civil War service. At the beginning of the war, Pike was appointed as Confederate envoy to the Native Americans.  In this capacity he negotiated several treaties, one of the most important being with [[Cherokee]] chief [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], which was concluded in 1861.  

Pike was commissioned as a [[brigadier general]] on [[November 22]], [[1861]], and given a command in the [[Indian Territory]].  With Gen. [[Benjamin McCulloch|Ben McCullough]], Pike trained three Confederate regiments of [[Indian cavalry]], most of whom belonged to the &quot;[[Five Civilized Tribes|civilized tribes]],&quot; whose loyalty to the Confederacy was variable.  Although victorious at the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] (Elkhorn Tavern) in March, Pike's unit was defeated later in a counterattack, after falling into disarray.  Also, as in the previous war, Pike came into conflict with his superior officers, at one point drafting a letter to [[Jefferson Davis]] complaining about his direct superior.

After Pea Ridge, Pike was faced with charges that his troops had scalped soldiers in the field.  Maj. Gen. [[Thomas C. Hindman]] also charged Pike with mishandling of money and materiel, ordering his arrest.  Both these charges were later found to be considerably lacking in evidence; nevertheless Pike, facing arrest, escaped into the hills of Arkansas, sending his resignation from the Confederate Army on July 12. He was at length arrested on November 3 under charges of [[insubordination]] and [[treason]], and held briefly in [[Warren, Texas]], but his resignation was accepted on November 11 and he was allowed to return to Arkansas.

===After the war===
Pike faced the postwar years unable to earn the trust either of his former comrades or of the Union victors, and subsequently relocated to [[New York]] and later to [[Canada]].  He was however at length given a formal pardon by [[Andrew Johnson]] on August 30, 1865, and therefore enabled to continue his career in public life, becoming an associate justice of the Arkansas supreme court, later practicing law in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] from 1867-8 (where he also served as editor of the Memphis ''Appeal''), and finally moving his law office to [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1870, becoming editor of the ''Patriot'' newspaper.

[[Image:AlbertPikeOlder.jpeg|thumb|Pike in Masonic regalia]]

===In Freemasonry===
He had in the interim joined a Masonic lodge and become extremely active in the affairs of the organization, being elected Sovereign Grand Commander of the [[Scottish Rite]]'s Southern Jurisdiction in 1859, also that year having received an honorary Ph.D. from Harvard.  He remained Sovereign Grand Commander for the remainder of his life (a total of 32 years), devoting a large amount of his time to perfection of the rituals of the order.  Notably, he published a book called ''[[Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry]]'' in 1872, of which there were several subsequent editions.

Additionally, Pike wrote on several legal subjects, and continued producing poetry, a hobby he had begun in his youth in Massachusetts.  His poems were highly regarded in his day, but are now mostly forgotten.  Several volumes of his works were self-published posthumously by his daughter.

Pike died in Washington, D.C. and was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery (against his wishes&amp;mdash;he had left instructions his body be cremated).
In [[1944]] his remains were moved to the [[House of the Temple]], headquarters of the Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite.

===Albert Pike and the Ku Klux Klan===

Albert Pike has been accused of being a founder and high ranking member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]; however, There is no evidence of this and the claim appears to be based on the unsubstantiated writings of Klan appologist Walter Fleming and revivalist Susan Davis.

One of the Klan foundersers transported, and the second-largest airline in the world (behind [[Air France-KLM]]) in terms of total operating revenues. A subsidiary of the [[AMR Corporation]], the airline is headquartered in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], adjacent to the [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]]. American operates scheduled flights throughout the [[United States]], as well as flights to [[Canada]], [[Latin America]], the [[Caribbean]], [[Western Europe]], [[Japan]] and [[India]]. The [[chairman]] and [[CEO]] of AA is [[Gerard Arpey]]. In 2005 the airline netted over 98 million [[Revenue passenger mile|RPMs]].

As of February 2006, American serves 171 cities with a fleet of 707  aircraft. American carries more passengers between the US and Latin America (12.1 million in 2004) than any other airline, and is also strong in the transcontinental market.

American has seven hubs: [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]], [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago O'Hare]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[Lambert-Saint Louis International Airport|St. Louis]], [[Logan International Airport|Boston]], [[LaGuardia Airport|LaGuardia]], and [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York JFK]]. [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]] is the airline's largest hub, with AA operating over 84 percent of flights at the airport and traveling to more destinations than from any of its other hubs. [[Los Angeles International Airport]] and [[Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport|San Juan]] serve as a focus cities and international gateways.  American operates maintenance bases at [[Tulsa International Airport|Tulsa]], [[Kansas City International Airport|Kansas City]], and [[Fort Worth Alliance Airport|Fort Worth Alliance]].

[[American Eagle Airlines]] is an airline based in Fort Worth, Texas, USA. It is a regional airline partner of American Airlines (both are wholly owned by AMR Corporation).

American is a founding member of the [[Oneworld (airlines)|oneworld]] [[airline alliance]].

== History ==
===Formation===
American Airlines developed from a conglomeration of about 82 small airlines through a series of corporate acquisitions and reorganizations: initially, the name '''American Airways''' was used as a common brand by a number of independent air carriers. These included Southern Air Transport in Texas, Southern Air Fast Express (SAFE) in the western US, Universal Aviation in the Midwest (which operated a transcontinental air/rail route in 1929), and Colonial Air Transport in the Northeast.

On [[January 25]], [[1930]], American Airways was incorporated as a single company, with routes from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[New York City|New York]] and [[Chicago, Illinois]] to [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], and a transcontinental route from Dallas to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. The airline operated its routes with all-metal [[Fokker Trimotor]]s and [[Ford Trimotor]]s. In 1934 American began flying [[Curtiss Condor]] biplanes fitted with sleeping berths.

===American Airlines before World War II===
In 1934, American Airways Company, in financial straits, was acquired by [[E.L. Cord]], who renamed the company &quot;American Airlines&quot;. Cord hired Texas businessman [[C. R. Smith|C.R. (Cyrus Rowlett) Smith]] to run the company. Early in its history, the company was headquartered at [[Midway Airport]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. American's innovations during this period included the introduction of [[flight attendant]]s.
[[Image:American DC-3.jpg|thumb|left|250px|American played a major role in the development of the [[Douglas DC-3]], dubbed &quot;Flagship&quot; in the American fleet]]
Smith worked closely with [[Donald Douglas]] to develop the [[Douglas DC-3|DC-3]], which American Airlines started flying in 1936. With the DC-3, American began to brand itself using nautical terms, calling its aircraft &quot;Flagships&quot; and establishing the &quot;Admirals Club,&quot; an honorary club for valued passengers. The DC-3s had a four-star &quot;admiral's pennant&quot; which would fly outside the cockpit window while the aircraft was parked, one of the most well-known images of the airline at the time.

American was the first airline to cooperate with [[Fiorello LaGuardia]]'s plans to build an airport in [[New York City]], and partly as a result became the owner of the world's first [[Airport lounge|airline lounge]] at the new [[LaGuardia Airport]], which became known as the &quot;[[Admirals Club]].&quot; Membership was initially by invitation only, but a discrimination suit decades later changed the club into a paid membership club, creating the model for other airline lounges.

===Postwar developments===
After [[World War II]], American launched an international subsidiary, [[American Overseas Airways]] to serve [[Europe]]; however, AOA was sold to rival [[Pan Am]] in 1948. AA launched another subsidiary around the same time, American Airlines de Mexico S.A., to operate flights to [[Mexico]], and built several airports in northern Mexico to serve as diversion points for aircraft bound for [[Mexico City]].

American Airlines introduced the first transcontinental jet service on [[25 January]] [[1959]]. With the introduction of [[Boeing 707|707]] &quot;Astrojet&quot; service in the 1960s, American's focus shifted to nonstop coast-to-coast flights, although it maintained feeder connections to other cities along its old route using smaller [[Convair 990]]s and [[Lockheed L-188 Electra|Lockheed Electras]]. The company also launched the first electronic booking system, named [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], together with [[IBM]].

During the 1970s, American acquired its first [[Boeing 747]]s; depressed passenger numbers at the time led American to fit many of its 747s with [[Wurlitzer]] [[piano]]s in the main cabin. Following the [[Transpacific Route Case]], AA began 747 flights to [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], although it traded these routes to [[Pan Am]] in 1975 in exchange for routes to the Caribbean. The 747s were soon moved to cargo service, and replaced in passenger service with [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]]s.

Following a financial slump in the 1970s under the leadership of former [[General Counsel|general counsel]] [[George Spater]], American hired seasoned manager [[Albert Casey]]. Casey decided to move American's corporate headquarters from [[New York City]] to [[Fort Worth, Texas]] in 1979. American opened a new corporate campus on the site of the closed [[Greater Southwest International Airport]], just south of the new [[Dallas Fort Worth International Airport]].

On C.R. Smith's advice, American also hired a young finance executive, [[Robert Crandall]], who had previously worked for [[Bloomingdale's]] and [[TWA]]. Crandall introduced, among other innovations, the world's first frequent flyer miles (AAdvantage) and corporate travel card (AAirpass). After discovering several thousand unused [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] terminals in a Tulsa hangar, Crandall ordered them refurbished and provided to [[travel agent]]s, creating the first airline-owned agent-accessible [[computer reservations system]].  Crandall was named American's President in 1980, and succeeded [[Albert Casey]] as CEO and Chairman in 1985.

===Expansion in 1980s and 1990s===
[[image:americanairlines.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|250px|In the 1990s, American switched to an all-twinjet fleet. [[Boeing 767]] aircraft replaced older [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10]]s on many transatlantic routes]]
American changed its routing to a [[spoke-hub distribution paradigm|hub-and-spoke system]] starting in 1981, opening its first hubs at DFW and Chicago O'Hare. American began flights to [[Europe]] and [[Japan]] from these hubs in the mid-1980s.

In the late 1980s, American opened three new hubs for north-south traffic. [[Norman Y. Mineta San José International Airport|San Jose International Airport]] was added as a hub after American purchased [[Air California]]. American also built a new terminal and runway at [[Raleigh-Durham International Airport]] to take advantage of the rapidly-growing [[Research Triangle Park]] nearby, as well as compete with USAir's hub in [[Charlotte Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]]. [[Nashville International Airport|Nashville]] was also chosen as a hub. 

Lower fuel prices in the era and a favorable management climate at the time led to higher than average airline industry profits that were not necessarily shared by non-stockholding employees.  The industry's expansion was not lost on the American Airline's existing employees who on [[February 17]], [[1997]] struck for higher wages.  President [[Bill Clinton]] invoked the Taft-Hartley Amendment to the [[Wagner Act]] citing economic impact to the United States a few minutes later quashing the strike.[http://www.iht.com/articles/1997/02/17/fly.t_1.php]  Pilots settled for substantially lower wage increases than their demands as a result. 

The three new hubs were all abandoned in the 1990s: San Jose was sold to [[Reno Air]], and RDU to [[Midway Airlines]]. Midway went out of business in 2001. American purchased Reno Air in February 1999 and fully integrated its operations on [[31 August]] [[1999]], but did not resume hub operations in San Jose.

[[Miami International Airport|Miami]] also became a hub after American bought Central and South American routes from [[Eastern Airlines]] in 1990. Through the 1990s, American expanded its route network in Latin America to become the dominant U.S. carrier in the region.

On [[15 October]] [[1998]] American Airlines became the first airline to offer electronic ticketing in all 44 countries it serves.

===TWA merger, 9/11, and aftermath===
[[image:american.b777-200er.n780an.arp.jpg|thumb|250px|American Airlines Boeing 777-200ER landing]]
Crandall left the company in 1998 and was replaced by [[Donald J. Carty]], who negotiated the purchase of [[Trans World Airlines]] and its hub in St. Louis in April 2001.

The merger of the different labor unions was a contentious issue. The TWA pilots belonged to the [[Air Line Pilots Association]] ([[ALPA]]) and the American Airlines pilots belonged to the [[Allied Pilots Association (APA)]]. The pilots of the APA took a position that the TWA pilots could not get something for nothing. Namely, job security and retirement benefits without giving up something -- seniority. The ALPA pilots felt they deserved a more fair distribution within the APA seniority list.

As a result, 60 percent of all former TWA pilots were moved to the bottom of the seniority list at American Airlines. For example, the senior-most former TWA captain, hired in 1963 was integrated at the same seniority level as a 1985-hire American captain. To keep some relative seniority, the TWA pilots were given &quot;super-seniority&quot; and a specified ratio of captain's jobs (relative to other domiciles) if they stayed within the St. Louis pilot domicile. If they decided to leave the St. Louis pilot domicile, they would have to compete for jobs on the basis of their integrated seniority number. The result was that most former TWA pilots stayed in the St. Louis domicile and roughly maintained their same relative seniority; albeit stuck within the St. Louis domicile. A few former TWA pilots flew in the co-pilot seat next to AA pilots with significantly less seniority and experience when they decided to transfer to one of the other American Airlines pilot domiciles.

Of the appoximately 2300 TWA pilots who were integrated, approximately 400 were slated for mandatory retirement before the integration actually took place.

As of [[July 2]], [[2003]], 100% of all former TWA flight attendants were furloughed by American Airlines (approximately 4,200 employees). This was due to the American Airlines flight attendant union putting all the former TWA flight attendants at the bottom of their seniority list.

In the wake of the TWA merger and the roughly concurrent [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] (which claimed two of AA's aircraft), American began losing money. Carty negotiated new wage and benefit agreements with the airline's labor unions, but was forced to resign after union leaders discovered that Carty was planning to award handsome executive compensation packages at the same time.  St. Louis' hub was also downsized afterwards.
[[image:AA bird logo.svg|thumb|right|100px|Logo as pictured on their tail fin and when referring to the website aa.com]]
In Carty's wake, American has undergone additional cost-cutting measures, including rolling back its &quot;More Room in Coach&quot; program (which eliminated several seats on certain aircraft types), ending three-class service on many international flights, and standardizing its fleet at each hub (see below). However, the airline has rebounded and expanded its service into new markets, including [[Ireland]], western [[Japan]], and [[India]].  American Airlines is also expanding to [[China]] in [[2006]].

On [[July 20]], [[2005]], for the first time in 17 quarters, American announced a quarterly profit; the airline earned $58 million in Q2 2005. American is reliant upon its dominant position at Dallas/Fort Worth for its continuing financial solvency, and is lobbying for the preservation of the [[Wright Amendment]], which regulates [[Southwest Airlines]]' operations at [[Love Field]] in Dallas.

==Codesharing agreements==
American currently has [[Code sharing|codesharing]] agreements with [[Aer Lingus]], [[Air Pacific]], [[Air Sahara]], [[Alaska Airlines]], [[British Airways]], [[Cathay Pacific Airways]], [[China Eastern Airlines]], [[Deutsche Bahn]] ([[AiRail Service]]), [[EVA Air]], [[Finnair]], [[TACA (airline)|Grupo TACA]], [[Gulf Air]], [[Hawaiian Airlines]], [[Iberia Airlines|Iberia]], [[Japan Airlines]], [[LAN (airline)|LAN Airlines]], [[Mexicana]], [[Qantas Airways]], [[SN Brussels Airlines]], [[SNCF]], [[Swiss International Air Lines]], [[TAM Linhas Aéreas|TAM Airlines]], [[Turkish Airlines]] and [[Vietnam Airlines]]. [[AmericanConnection]], which feeds American's hub at [[Lambert Saint Louis International Airport]], is also a codesharing operation with three regional carriers.

===New services/Future destinations===
American Airlines has begun to expand its network internationally, especially [[Asia]]. Major hubs such as [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]] and [[Chicago O'Hare International Airport]] are constantly introduced to new destinations.

Nonstop services from [[Chicago O'Hare International Airport|Chicago O'Hare]] to
*[[Shanghai]] ([[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]]), [[China]] (starting [[April 3]], [[2006]])

==Incidents and Accidents ==

The flight was en route from [[Charles De Gaulle International Airport|Paris Charles De Gaulle]] to [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], and was diverted to Boston's [[Logan International Airport|Logan Airport]].
*A passenger on [[American Airlines Flight 924]] who officials said claimed to have a bomb in a carry-on bag was shot and killed by a team of federal [[Federal Air Marshal Service|air marshals]] on a jetway as the plane boarded at [[Miami International Airport]] for a flight to [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]] on [[December 7]], [[2005]].

== Fleet ==
American operates a relatively young fleet, with an average age of 10.5 years [http://www.airsafe.com/events/airlines/fleetage.htm]. Almost half of its fleet is comprised of [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9#MD-80 series|MD-82]] and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9#MD-80 series|MD-83]] series twinjets, referred to by AA as &quot;Super 80,&quot; denoting the type's original name, &quot;DC-9 Super 80.&quot;  Much of the Super 80 fleet dates back to the early 1980s, although they own some newer examples acquired from TWA. Regardless of age, most of AA's aircraft have been refitted with new interiors in the last few years, with the exception of many [[Boeing 757]]s. AA has also introduced  new aircraft to its fleet: the newest are the [[Boeing Commercial Airplanes|Boeing]] [[Boeing 777|777-200ER]]s, which replaced [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11|MD-11]]s on key transoceanic routes in the late 1990s such as Tokyo Narita, and [[Boeing 737|737-800]]s, which replaced [[Boeing 727|727]]s and the [[BAC-111]]s on some domestic and Caribbean routes.

American has discontinued three-class service on most aircraft, but continues to offer business class on 777 and 767-200 aircraft. First class passengers on 777 routes to London and Frankfurt enjoy the &quot;American Flagship Suite,&quot; a first class seat that can swivel inwards toward a personal work area and also recline 90 degrees to become a bed. 767-200 flights between [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK]], [[San Francisco International Airport|SFO]], and [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]] offer three-class &quot;American Flagship Service&quot; which replicates the passenger service offered on long international flights.

[[Image:IMG 1265r.jpg|thumb|250px|An American Airbus A300 inbound to JFK.]]

On all American aircraft (except ex-TWA 757s), passengers in all cabins have a cigarette port DC power port at select seats. All classes of service on the 777-223ER have personal video screens, although they lack Audio/Video On Demand (AVOD) systems. These personal video screens offer GateConnect, a feature which allows passengers to view maps of the destination airports (gates, security checkpoints, baggage claims, etc) and find out information on connecting flights from that same airport such as gate, aircraft, etc.

Most recently, American has taken the unique step of redesigning its schedules so that each hub city receives certain aircraft types more often than others, which is intended to simplify maintenance and last-minute fleet substitutions. Currently, Chicago, DFW and St. Louis get most Boeing MD-80(S80), 757-2Q8, and 757-231 service, Miami gets most 757-223 and 737 service, and JFK gets most A300 and 767-200 service.  [[Boeing 777|777-223ER]]'s and [[Boeing 767|767-323ER]]'s are usually reserved for high density domestic markets and international flights.

American Airlines was one of three carriers ([[Continental Airlines]] and [[Delta Air Lines]] being the other two) to sign an exclusivity agreement with Boeing in the late 1990s. When Boeing acquired [[McDonnell Douglas]], the [[European Union]] forced Boeing to void the contracts. However, both parties have been adhering to and intend to adhere to the terms under a [[gentlemen's agreement]].

== Livery ==
American's early [[livery|liveries]] varied widely, but a common livery was adopted in the 1930s that featured a large [[eagle]] painted on the fuselage of each aircraft. The eagle became a widely-recognized symbol of the company and inspired the name of [[American Eagle Airlines]]. Propeller aircraft featured an [[international orange]] lightning bolt running down the length of the fuselage, which was replaced by a simpler orange stripe with the introduction of jets.

In the late 1960s, American commissioned an industrial designer to develop a new livery. The original design called for a red, white, and blue stripe on te services of an accountant practising in the city of [[London]] were made use of in the course of an investigation into the transactions of a director of the [[South Sea Bubble|South Sea Company]], who had been dealing in the company's stock. During this investigation the accountant appears to have examined the books of at least two firms of merchants. His report is described Observations made upon examining the books of Sawbridge and Company, by Charles Snell, Writing Master and Accountant in Foster Lane, London. The United States owes the concept of the Certified Public Accountant designation to England which had coined the Chartered Accountant designation in the 19th century.

==Accountancy qualifications and regulation==
The requirements for entry in the profession of accounting vary from country to country.

=== Commonwealth of Nations ===
In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and several other [[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries, the equivalents of Certified Public Accountant (CPA) include [[Chartered Accountant]] (CA - in UK, Commonwealth and former British states), Chartered Certified Accountant (ACCA - United Kingdom), International Accountant (AIA - United Kingdom), Certified Public Accountant (CPA - Ireland and CPA - Hong Kong), Certified General Accountant (CGA - Canada), and Certified Practising Accountant (CPA - Australia). 

Please refer to the latest statutory auditing rights of above accounting bodies in individual jurisdictions and distinction from non-audit bodies for various consumers. In UK, only 3 chartered accountants (England &amp; Wales, Scottish and Irish)and their equivalents (AIA and ACCA) are &quot;Registered Auditors&quot; under Companies Act.

ACA is the best known and most respected qualification in the UK, equivalent of a CA but handled by a different board ICAEW.

====Canada====
In Canada, there are three recognized accounting bodies: the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CA) and the provincial and territorial CA Institutes, the Certified General Accountants Association of Canada (CGA)]], and the Society of Management Accountants of Canada (CMA). CA and CGA were created by Acts of Parliament in 1902 and 1913 respectively and CMA was established in 1920.

The CA program focuses on public accounting and candidates must obtain auditing experience from public accounting firms; the CGA program takes a general approach allowing candidates to focus in their own financial career choices; the CMA program focuses in management accounting.  Both the CA and the CMA programs require a candidate to obtain a degree as a program entry requirement. The CGA program only requires a degree as an exit requirement prior to certification.

Auditing and Public Accounting are regulated by the provinces. Historically, only CAs can perform audits in [[Ontario]]. In 2004, the provincial government of [[Ontario]] passed a new Public Accounting Act that would allow qualified CGAs and CMAs to perform audits, conditional on their organizations being able to demonstrate that their qualification and regulatory programs are equivalent in rigour to that of the CA program. As of March 2006, this process of evaluation had not yet begun.  In [[Quebec]] as well, CAs still have exclusive public company audit rights by statute. In [[British Columbia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]], CAs and CGAs have equal status regarding public accounting and auditing; In the rest of [[Canada]], CAs, CGAs, and CMAs are considered equivalents pursuant to provincial and territorial legislation.

===United States of America===
In the [[United States]], practicing accountants include [[Certified Public Accountant]]s (CPAs), [[Certified Internal Auditor]]s (CIAs), [[Certified Management Accountant]]s (CMAs) and [[Accredited Business Accountant]]s (ABAs).  The difference between these certifications is primarily the types of services provided, although individuals may earn more than one certification.  Additionally, much accounting work is performed by uncertified individuals, who may be working under the supervision of a certified accountant.

A CPA is licensed by the state of his/her residence to provide auditing services to the public, although most CPA firms also offer accounting, tax, litigation support, and other financial advisory services.  The requirements for receiving the CPA license varies from state to state, although the passage of the Uniform Certified Public Accountant examination is required by all states. This examination is designed and graded by the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]].

A CIA is granted a certificate from the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), provided that the candidate passed a rigorous examination of four parts. A CIA mostly provides his/her services directly to his/her employer rather than the public.

A CMA is granted a certificate from the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA), provided that the candidate passed a rigorous examination of four parts and meet the practical experience requirement from the IMA.  A CMA mostly provides his/her services directly to his/her employers rather than the public.  A CMA can also provide his services to the public, but to an extent much lesser than that of a CPA.

An ABA is granted accreditation from the Accreditation Council for Accountancy and Taxation (ACAT), provided that the candidate passed the eight-hour Comprehensive Examination for Accreditation in Accounting which tests proficiency in financial accounting, reporting, statement preparation, taxation, business consulting services, business law, and ethics. An ABA specializes in the needs of small-to-mid-size businesses and in financial services to individuals and families. In states where use of the word &quot;accountant” is not permitted, the practitioner may use Accredited Business Advisor.

The [[United States Department of Labor]]'s [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] estimates that there are about one million persons [http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes132011.htm] employed as accountants and auditors in the U.S.

U.S. [[tax law]] grants accountants a limited form of [[accountant-client privilege]].

==Accounting scholarship==
Refer [[Accounting scholarship]] for professorship.

==The &quot;Big Four&quot; accountancy firms==
The &quot;[[Big 4 accountancy firm|Big Four auditor]]s&quot; are the largest [[multinational]] accountancy firms.  
*[[PricewaterhouseCoopers]]
*[[Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu]]
*[[Ernst &amp; Young]]
*[[KPMG]] 

The Big 4 accountancy firms can all trace their history back to firms in Europe, from which they have descended through a long line of mergers.  Many of the originating firms were from the [[United Kingdom]].   As British trade interests expanded, correspondent firms were established throughout the world by the organisations.  These firms are associations of the  partnerships in each country rather than having the classical structure of holding company and subsidiaries, but each has an international 'umbrella' organisation for co-ordination.  However, due to the dominant size of the [[Economy of the United States|United States' economy]], the offices of the Big 4 accountancy firms based in the United States have always generated more revenue than the rest of the Big 4 accountancy firms' offices in the world combined. 

Before the Enron and other [[accounting scandals]], there were five large firms and were called the Big Five. Since [[Arthur Andersen]]'s [[Assurance services|assurance]] practice split, with a plurality joining KPMG in the US and Deloitte &amp; Touche outside of the US, Arthur Andersen left from the group.  Previous to this there were also groupings referred to as the &quot;Big Six&quot; and the &quot;Big Eight&quot;.

Enron turned out to be only the first of a series of accounting scandals that enveloped the accounting industry in 2002.

This is likely to have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. accounting industry. Application of [[International Accounting Standards]] originating in [[International Accounting Standards Board]] headquartered in [[London]] and bearing more resemblance to UK than current [[US GAAP|US practices]] is often advocated by those who note the relative stability of the U.K. accounting system (which reformed itself after scandals in the late 1980s and early 1990s). [[Accounting reform]] of a far more comprehensive sort is advocated by those who see issues with [[capitalism]] or [[economics]], and seek ecological or social accountability.

'''Ants''' are one of the most successful groups of [[insect]]s in the [[animal kingdom]] and are of particular interest because they are a [[Eusociality|social insect]] and form highly organized [[ant colony|colonies]] or nests, sometimes consisting of millions of individuals. Colonies of invasive ant species will sometimes work together and form supercolonies, spanning a very wide area of land. Ant colonies are sometimes described as [[superorganism]]s because they appear to operate as a single entity. 

Ants have colonized almost every landmass on [[Earth]] and can constitute up to 15% of the total animal [[biomass]] of a [[tropical rainforest]]. [[As of 2006]], there are 11,844 known ant species, most of which reside in hot climates.

==Ancestry==
Ants are classified as a family, [[Formicidae]], belonging to the order [[Hymenoptera]] which also includes [[sawflies]], [[bees]] and [[wasp]]s. Ants are a lineage derived from within the [[Vespoidea|vespoid]] [[wasp]]s.  Estimates of the age of the ants derived from genetic data indicate that ants evolved from other groups of wasps in the [[Cretaceous]] period about 120 to 140 million years ago. Several fossils from the Cretaceous are intermediate in form between wasps and ants, further confirming the wasp ancestry of ants. Like other Hymenoptera, the genetic system employed by ants is [[Haplodiploidy]].

== Morphology ==
Ants are distinguished from other insects by the combination of elbowed [[antenna (biology)|antennae]], a strongly constricted second [[abdominal]] segment forming a distinct node-like [[petiole]], a wingless worker caste, and the presence of a [[metapleural gland]].

They can sense with [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s located on the antennae, which can detect [[pheromones]] (single compounds) and hydrocarbons on the outer layer of the body (a set of different compounds). The latter is highly important for the recognition of nestmates from non-nestmates. Also, they communicate with sound in the form of vibrations moving through the ground

Most [[Queen (insect)|queens]] and male ants have [[wing]]s, which they eat after [[nuptial flight]]; however wingless queens (ergatoids) and males can occur.

==Development==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Ants evacuating larvae.jpg|thumb|left|Ants recovering larvae after a disturbance of the nest]] --&gt;

Ants are [[Holometabolism|holometabolous]], and develop by complete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]], passing through [[larva|larval]] and [[pupa|pupal]] stages before they become adults.  The larval stage is particularly helpless - for instance it lacks legs entirely - because it does not need to care for itself.  The difference between queens and workers, and between different castes of workers when they exist, is determined by feeding in the larval stage. Food is given to the larvae by a process called [[trophallaxis]] in which an ant [[Regurgitation|regurgitates]] food previously held in its crop for communal storage.  This is also how adults distribute food amongst themselves. Larvae and pupae need to be kept at fairly constant temperatures to ensure proper development, and so are often moved around various brood chambers within the colony.

A new worker spends the first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young.  After that it graduates to digging and other nest work, and then to foraging and defense of the nest. These changes are fairly abrupt and define what are called temporal [[caste]]s. One theory of why this occurs is because foraging has a high death rate, so ants only participate in it when they are older and closer to death anyway.  In a few ants there are also physical castes - workers come in a spectrum of sizes, called minor, median, and major workers, the latter beginning foraging sooner.  Often the larger ants will have disproportionately larger heads, and so stronger [[mandible]]s.  Such individuals are sometimes called &quot;soldier&quot; ants because their stronger mandibles make them more effective in fighting other creatures, although they are still in fact worker ants and their &quot;duties&quot; typically do not vary greatly from the minor or median workers. In a few species the median workers have disappeared, creating a sharp divide and clear physical difference between the minors and majors.

Most of the common ant species breed in the same way. All ants in the colonies are females to begin with, but only the Queen and breeding females have the ability to mate. Contrary to popular belief, some ant nests have multiple queens.  The male ants, called drones, along with the breeding females are born with wings, and do nothing throughout their life except eat, at least until the time for mating comes. At this time, all the breeding ants in the colony are carried outside (save for the queen) where other colonies of similar species are doing the same. Then, all the winged breeding ants take flight. Mating occurs in flight and the males die shortly afterward. The females that survive land and seek a suitable place to begin a colony. There, they break off their own wings and begin to lay eggs, which they care for. Sperm obtained during their nuptial flight is stored and used to fertilise all future eggs produced. The first workers to hatch are weak and smaller than later workers, but they begin to serve the colony immediately. They enlarge the nest, forage for food and care for the other eggs. This is how a new colony starts.

==Communication and behavior==
[[Image:Acrobat.ant1web..jpg|thumb|left|200px|Acrobat ant (''Crematogaster'' - Myrmecidinae)]]
[[Image:Ant mound.jpg|thumb|250px|Ant mound hole - preventing water coming into nest during rain]]
Ant communication is primarily through chemicals called [[pheromone]]s. Because most ants spend their time in direct contact with the ground, these chemical messages are more developed than in other [[Hymenopterans]]. So, for instance, when a forager finds food on its way home (found typically through remembered landmarks and the position of the [[sun]]), it will leave a trail along the ground, which in a short time other ants will follow. When they return home they will reinforce the trail, bringing other ants, until the food is exhausted, after which the trail is not reinforced and so slowly dissipates. A crushed ant will emit an alarm pheromone, that in high concentration sends other ants nearby into an attack frenzy, and in lower concentration attracts them, while a few ants use what are called propaganda pheromones to confuse their enemies.

Ant trails have no intrinsic [[polarity]]; that is to say, an ant walking on a straight non-branching trail cannot tell whether it is walking to or from the nest.  Trails always divide as a &quot;Y&quot;, with the two secondary trails at a 60 degree angle to each other, and it is the geometry at trail junctions that give ant trails polarity. (Jackson &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;, 2004)

Like other insects, ants smell with their antennae, which are long and thin. These are fairly mobile, having a distinct elbow joint after an elongated first segment, and since they come in pairs they provide information about direction as well as intensity. Pheromones are also exchanged as compounds mixed in with the food interchanged in [[trophallaxis]], giving the ants information about one another's health and nutrition. Ants can also detect what task group (e.g. foraging or nest maintenance) other ants belong to. Of special note, the queen produces a special pheromone without which the workers will begin raising new queens.

Ants attack and defend themselves by biting, and in many species, stinging, in both cases sometimes injecting chemicals into the target. Of special note here is [[formic acid]].

While many types of animals can [[learning|learn]] behaviors by [[imitation|imitating]] other animals, ants may be the only group of animals besides [[human|humans]] in which interactive [[teacher|teaching]] behavior has been observed.  Knowledgeable forager ants of the species ''Temnothorax albipennis'' directly lead naive nestmates to newly discovered food sources by an excruciatingly slow (and time-costly), process of 'tandem running'. The follower thereby obtains knowledge that it would not have, had it not been tutored, and this is at the expense of its nestmate teacher. Both leader and follower are acutely sensitive to the progress of their partner. For example, the leader slows down when the follower lags too far behind, and speeds up when the follower gets too close, whereas te the shipowner is unable or unwilling to forward the goods to their destination, and the owner of the goods, therefore, has no option but to take delivery where offered. 

When the ship is disabled and cannot proceed, or she is prevented by some obstacle from proceeding to the place of delivery named in the bill of lading, and the shipowner is unwilling or unable to forward the goods by another ship, even though he may be excused for his failure to carry the goods to their destination, he is not entitled to be paid any part of the freight; and the consignee is entitled to have the goods delivered to him either at the place where the vessel has taken refuge in her disabled condition, or, if the obstacle arises without disablement of the vessel, at the place which is nearest and most reasonably convenient at the time and in the circumstances when the further prosecution of the voyage has to be abandoned.  On the other hand, after the goods have been shipped, so long as the shipowner is ready and willing to carry the goods to their destination, or, if the ship is disabled, to forward them to their destination by some other ship without unreasonable delay, the owner of the goods cannot require the goods to be delivered to him at any place short of their destination without payment of the full freight.  Sometimes the freight, either wholly or in part, is made payable in advance. If freight payable in advance has become due, even though the ship is lost before it is paid, it must, in the absence of some special provision to the contrary, still be paid, and freight already paid in advance does not become repayable because the goods do not reach their destination.  If, however, goods upon which freight has been paid in advance are lost, and the shipowner is liable for their loss, the amount of freight paid in advance must be taken into account in assessing the damage recoverable from the shipowner. 

(8) There is no part of the bill of lading which is of greater practical importance or which demands more careful consideration by shipowner and shipper alike than that which sets forth the excepted perils: those perils, or in other words causes of loss, for which the shipowner is to be exempt from liability.  By the common law, as we have seen, the exemption of the carrier, apart from express contract, extended only to loss by the act of God or the king's enemies.  The expression ''act of God'' requires a word of explanation.  It will be sufficient to say that it is not synonymous with force majeure; but it includes every loss by force majeure in which human agency, by act or negligence, has had no part.  The list of excepted perils varies much in different forms of bills of lading.  In the older forms it usually included perils of the seas, robbers and pirates, restraint of princes and rulers, fire and barratry (that is, wilful wrongdoing) of the master and crew.  The list, however, has grown in modern times, and is still growing; the tendency being to exempt the shipowner from liability for all loss which does not arise from his own personal default, or from the negligence of his managers or agents in failing to provide a vessel seaworthy and fit for the voyage at its commencement.  It is important to point out in this connection that there are two duties which the shipowner is always presumed to undertake, and which are assumed to be unaffected and unqualified by the exceptions, unless a contrary intention is very clearly expressed by the terms of the contract.  In the first place, he undertakes absolutely that the ship in which the goods are shipped is fit at the commencement of the voyage for the service to be performed.  If during the voyage loss arises even from dangers of the seas or other excepted peril which would not have occurred if the vessel had been seaworthy and fit for the voyage at its commencement, the shipowner is not protected by the exceptions, and is liable for the loss.  In the second place, there is an implied undertaking by the shipowner that all reasonable care will be taken by himself, his servants and agents, safely to carry and deliver at their destination the goods received by him for carriage.  Should loss or damage occur during the voyage, though the direct cause of such loss or damage be perils of the seas or other excepted peril, still the shipowner cannot claim exemption under the exceptions, if the shipper can prove that the loss or damage would not have occurred but for the negligence of the master or crew, or other servants of the shipowner.  The shipowner, in other words, is bound, with his servants, to use all reasonable care to prevent loss by excepted perils and by any other cause. 

=== Express stipulations. ===

*It must not be supposed that even these primary obligations, which are introduced into every contract of affreightment not by express terms of the contract.
*It has now become common form to stipulate that the shipowner shall not be liable for any loss arising from the negligence of his servants, or that he shall not be liable for loss by the excepted perils even when brought about by the negligence of his servants.
*And with regard to seaworthiness, it is not uncommon for the shipowner to stipulate that he shall not be responsible for loss arising even from the unseaworthiness of the ship on sailing, provided that due care has Been taken by the owner and his agents and servants to make the ship seaworthy at the commencement of the voyage.
*There is indeed no rule of English law which prevents a shipowner from exempting himself by the terms of the bill of lading from liability for damage and loss of every kind, whether arising from unseaworthiness or any other cause whatsoever.
*In such a case the goods are carried at their owner's risk, and if he desires protection he must obtain it by insurance.
*In this respect the law of England permits greater freedom of contract than is allowed by the law of some other states.
*The owners, agents and masters of vessels loading in the [[United States|United States of America]] are forbidden by an act of Congress, commonly called the Harter Act, passed in the year [[1893]], to insert in their contracts of affreightment any clause exempting the shipowner from liability for the negligence of his servants; but it is at the rame time enacted that, provided all reasonable skill and care has been exercised by the shipowner to make the vessel seaworthy and fit for the voyage at its commencement, the shipowner shall not be liable for any loss caused by the negligence of the master or crew in the navigation of the vessel, or by perils of the sea or certain other causes set forth in the act.
*It is now very usual to insert in the bills of lading of [[United Kingdom|British]] vessels loading in the United States a reference to the Harter Act, incorporating its provisions so as to make them terms and conditions of the bill of lading. 

The difficulty of construing the terms of bills of lading with regard to the excepted perils, often expressed in obscure and inexact language, has given rise to much litigation, the results of which are recorded in the law reports.  Where such difficulties arise the question must be, What is the true and natural meaning of the language used by the parties? This question is not governed by the general rules which we have endeavouted to explain: but the words of the contract must always be considered with reference to these rules, which are founded upon the well-established customs of merchants recognized and formulated by the courts of law. 

(9) The bill of lading sometimes contains a clause as to the shipowner's lien. Without any express provision for it the shipowner has by the common law a lien for freight.  If it is desired to give the shipowner a lien for demurrage (see below) or other charges, it must be expressly provided for.  The lien is the right of the shipowner to retain the goods carried until payment has been made of the freight or the demurrage, or other charge for which a lien has been given.  The lien may be waived, and is lost by delivery of the goods, or by any dealing with the consignee which is inconsistent with a right of the shipowner to retain possession of the goods until payment has been made.  The shipowner may preserve his lien by landing the goods and retaining them in his own warehouse, or by storing them in a public warehouse, subject to the conditions required by the Merchant Shipping Act [[1894]]. 

=== Charter-parties. ===

Charter-parties are, as we have already explained, either for a voyage or for a period of time. (1) A charter-party for a voyage is a formal agreement made between the owner of the vessel and the charterers by which it is agreed that the vessel ''being tight, staunch and strong, and every way fitted for the voyage,'' shall load at a certain named place a full cargo either of goods of a specified description or of general merchandise, and being so loaded shall proceed with all possible despatch either to a specified place or to a place to be named at a specified port of call, and there deliver the cargo to the charterers or their assigns.  There are clauses which provide for the amount of freight to be paid and the manner and time of payment; for the time, usually described as lay days, to be allowed for loading and discharging, and for the demurrage to be paid if the vessel is detained beyond the lay days; usually also a clause requiring ''the cargo to be brought to and taken from alongside at merchant's risk and expense''; a clause that the master shall sign bills of lading for the cargo shipped either at the same rate of freight as is payable under the charter-party or very commonly at any rate of freight (but in this case with a stipulation that, if the total bill of lading freight is less than the total freight payable under the charter-party, the difference is to be paid by the charterers to the master before the sailing of the vessel); and there is usually vhat is called the cesser clause, by which the charterer's liability under the charter-party is to cease on shipment of the cargo, the shipowner taking a lien on the cargo for freight, dead freight and demurrage.  The charter-party is made subject to exceptions similar to those which are found in bills of lading.  There are also usually clauses providing for the commissions to be paid to the brokers on signing the charter-party, the ''address'' commission to be paid to the agents for the Vessel at the port of discharge, and other matters of detail.  The clauses in charter-parties vary, of course, indefinitely, but the above is probably a sufficient outline of the ordinary form of a charter-party for a voyage. 

What has been said with regard to bills of lading as to the voyage, the place of delivery, the exceptions and excepted perils, and the liability of the shioowner and his lien applies equally to charter-parties. lt may be desirable to add a few words on demurrage, dead Freight, and on the cesser clause. 

Demurrage is, properly speaking, a fixed sum per day or per hour agreed to be paid by the charterer for any time during which the vessel is detained in loading or discharging over and above the time allowed, which is, as we have said, usually described as the lay days. Sometimes the number of days during which the vessel may be kept on demurrage at the agreed rate is fixed by the charter-party.  If no demurrage is provided for by the charter-party, and the vessel is not loading or discharging beyond the lay days, the shipowner is entitled to claim damages in respect of the loss which he has suffered by the detention of his ship; or, if the vessel is detained beyond the fixed number of demurrage days, damages for detention will be recoverable.  Sometimes there is no time fixed by the charter-party for loading or discharging.  The obligation in such cases is to load or discharge with all despatch that is possible and reasonable in the circumstances; and if the loading or discharging is not done with such reasonable despatch, the shipowner will be entitled to claim damages for detention of his ship.  The rate of demurrage (if any) will generally be accepted as the measure of the damages for detention, but is not necessarily the true measure.  When the claim is for detention and not demurrage the actual loss is recoverable, which may be more or may be less than the agreed rate of demurrage.  The contract usually provides that Sundays and holidays shall be excepted in counting the lay days, but unless expressly stipulated this exception does not apply to the computation of the period of detention after the lay days have expired. 

Dead freight is the name gaven to the amount of freight lost, and therefore recoverable by the shipowner from the charterer as damages if a full and complete cargo is not loaded in accordance with the terms of the charter-party. 

The cesser clause has come into common use because very frequently the charterers are not personally interested in the cargo shipped.  They may be agents merely, or they may have chartered the vessel as a speculation to make a profit upon the bill of lading freight.  The effect of the clause is that when the charterers have shipped a full cargo they have fulfilled all their obligations, the shipowner discharging them from all further liability and taking instead a lien on the cargo for payment of all freight, demurrage or dead freight that may be payable to him.  It has become an established rule for the construction of the cesser clause that, if the language used will permit it, the cesser of liability is assumed to be co-extensive only with the lien given to the shipowner; or, in other words, the charterers are released from those liabilities only for which a lien is given to the shipowner.  The shipowner is further secured by the stipulation already referred to, that if the total freight payable under the bills of lading is less than the full chartered freight the difference shall be paid to the shipowner before the vessel sails.  A difficulty which sometimes arises, notwithstanding these precautions, is that although an ample lien is given by the charter-party, the terms of the bills of lading may be insufficient to preserve the same extensive lien as against the holder of the bills of lading.  The shippers under the bills of lading, if they are not the charterers, are not liable for the chartered freight, but only for the bill of lading freight; and unless the bill of lading expressly reserves it, they are not subject to a lien for the chartered freight.  The master may guard against this difficulty by refusing to sign bills of lading which do not preserve the shipowner's lien for his full chartered freight.  But he is often put into a difficulty by a somewhat improvident clause in the charter-party requiring him to sign bills of lading as presented. See Kruger v. Moel Tryvan, [[1907]] A. C. 272. 

(2) A time charter-party is a contract between the shipowner and charterers, by which the shipowner agrees to let and the charterers to hire the vessel for a specified term for employment, either generally in any lawful trade or upon voyages within certain limits.  A place is usually named at which the vessel is to be re-delivered to the owners at the end of the term, and the freight is payable until such re-delivery; the owner almost always pays the wages of the master and crew, and the charterers provide coals and pay port charges; the freight is usually fixed at a certain rate per gross register ton per month, and made payable monthly in advance, and provision is made for suspension of hire in certain cases if the vessel is disabled; the master, though he usually is and remains the servant of the owner, is required to obey the orders of the charterers as regards the employment of the vessel, they agreeing to indemnify the owners from all liability to which they may be exposed by the master signing bills of lading or otherwise complying with the orders of the charterers; and the contract is made subject to exceptions similar to those in bills of lading and voyage charter-parties.  This is the general outline of the ordinary form of a time charter-party, but the forms and their clauses vary, of course, very much, according to the circumstances of each case. 

It is apparent that under a time charter-party the shipowner to a large extent parts with the control of his ship, which is employed within certain limits according to the wish and directions, and for the purposes and profit of, the charterers.  But, as we have already explained at the beginning of this article, the shipowner continues in possession of his vessel by his servant the master, who remains responsible to his owner for the safety and proper navigation of the ship.  The result of this, as has been already pointed out, is that the holder of a bill of lading signed by the master, if he has taken the bill of lading without knowledge of the terms of the time charter-party, may hold the owner responsible for the due performance of the contract signed by the master in the ordinary course of his duties, and within his ostensible authority as servant of the shipowner, although in fact in signing the bill of lading the master was acting as agent for and at the direction of the time charterer, and not the shipowner.  In the language of the ordinary time charter-party the ship is let to the charterers; but there is no true demise, because, as we have pointed out, the vessel remains in the possession of the shipowner, the charterer enjoying the advantages and control of its employment.  Where the possession of a ship is given up to a hirer, who appoints his own master and crew, different considerations apply; but though the instrument by which the ship is let may be called a charter-party, it is not truly a contract of affreightment. 

=== Customary rights. ===

There are certain rights and obligations arising out of the relationship of shipowner and cargo-owner in circumstances of extraordinary peril or urgency in the course of a voyage, which, though not strictly contractual, are well established by the customs of merchants and recognized by the law.  It is obvious that, when a ship carrying a cargo is in the course of a voyage, the master to some extent represents the owners of both ship and cargo.  In cases of emergency it may be necessary that the master should, without waiting for authority or instructions, incur expense or make sacrifices as agent not only of his employer, the shipowner, but also of the cargo-owner.  Ship and cargo may be in peril, and it may be necessary for the safety of both to put into a port of refuge.  There it may be necessary to repair the ship, and to land and warehouse, and afterwards re-ship the cargo.  For these purposes the master will be obliged to incur expense, of which some part, such as the cost of repairing the ship, will be for the benefit of the shipowner; part, such as the warehousing expenses, will be for the benefit of the cargo-owner; and part, such as the port charges incurred in order to enter the port of refuge, are for the common benefit and safety of ship and cargo.  Again, in a storm at sea, it may be necessary for the safety of ship and cargo to cut away a mast or to jettison, that is to say, throw overboard part of the cargo.  In such a case the master, acting for the shipowner or cargo-owner, as the case may be, makes a sacrifice of part of the ship or part of the cargo, in either case for the purpose of saving ship and cargo from a danger common to both.  Voluntary sacrifices so made and extraordinary expenses incurred for the common safety are called general average (see [[Average]]) sacrifices and expenses, and are made good to the person who has made the sacrifice or incurred the expense by a general average contribution, which is recoverable from the owners of the property saved in proportion to its value, or, in other words, each contributes rateably according to the benefit received.  The law regulating the rights of the parties with regard to such contribution is called the law of General Average.  It must, however, be remembered that the owner of the cargo is entitled under the contract of affreightment to the ordinary service of the ship and crew for the safe carriage of the cargo to its destination, and the shipowner is bound to pay all ordinary expenses incurred for the purpose of the voyage.  He must also bear all losses arising from damage to the ship by accidents.  But when extraordinary expense has been incurred by the shipowner for the safety of the cargo, he can recover such expense from the owner of the cargo as a special charge on cargo; or when an extraordinary expense has been incurred or a voluntary sacrifice made by the shipowner to save the ship and cargo from a peril common to both, he may require the owner of cargo to contribute in general average to make good the loss.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Afghan Turkestan''' is the northern part of [[Afghanistan]], on the border with the former [[Soviet republic]]s of [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Tajikistan]].

Afghan Turkestan is also the name of a former province in this area, which was centred on [[Mazar-e Sharif]] and included territory in the modern provinces of [[Kunduz province|Kunduz]], [[Balkh province|Balkh]], [[Jowzjan province|Jowzjan]] and [[Sar-e Pol province|Sar-e Pol]]. The whole territory, from the junction of the [[Kokcha]] river with the [[Amu Darya]] on the north-east to the province of [[Herat province|Herat]] on the south-west, was some 500 miles in length, with an average width from the Russian frontier to the Hindu Kush of 114 miles (183 km). It thus comprised about 57,000 square miles (148,000 km&amp;sup2;) or roughly two-ninths of the former kingdom of Afghanistan.

==Geography==

The area is agriculturally poor except in the river valleys, being rough and mountainous towards the south, but subsiding into undulating wastes and pasture-lands towards the [[Turkman Desert]].

==Population==

Ethnically and historically Afghan Turkestan is more connected with [[Bukhara]] than with [[Kabul]], of which government it has been a dependency only since the time of [[Dost Mahommed Khan|Dost Mahommed]].  The bulk of the people of the cities are of [[Persians|Persian]] ([[Tajiks]]) and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] ([[Uzbek]]) stock, but interspersed with them are Mongol [[Hazara]]s and [[Hinduism|Hindus]] with [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] tribes in the Amu Darya plains.

==History==

Ancient Balkh or Bactriana was a province of the Achaemenian empire, and probably was occupied in great measure by a race of [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] blood.  About [[250 BC]] [[Diodotus of Bactria|Diodotus (Theodotus)]], governor of [[Bactria]] under the [[Seleucid dynasty|Seleucidae]], declared his independence, and commenced the history of the Greco-Bactrian dynasties, which succumbed to [[Parthia]]n and nomadic movements about [[126 BC]]. After this came a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] era which has left its traces in the gigantic sculptures at Bamian and the rock-cut topes of Haibak.  The district was devastated by [[Genghis Khan]], and has never since fully recovered its prosperity. For about a century it belonged to the [[Delhi]] empire, and then fell into Uzbeg hands.  In the [[18th he same show in the same moment of time is generating only 2.5 trps (being the target: women 25-45). This would mean that while the show has a large universe of viewers it is not necessarily reaching a large universe of women in the ages of 25 to 45 making it a less desirable location to place an ad for an advertiser looking for this particular demographic.

==Impact==
{{sect-stub}}

The impact of advertising has been a matter of considerable debate and many different claims have been made in different contexts.  During debates about the banning of cigarette adervertising, a common claim from cigarette manufacturers was that cigarette advertising does not encourage people to smoke who would not otherwise{{ref|uk-parl-BAT}}.  The (eventually successful) opponents of advertising, on the other hand, claim that advertising does in fact increase consumption{{ref|ash}}.  

According to many media sources, the past experience and state of mind of the person subjected to advertising may determine the impact that advertising has.  Children under the age of four may be unable to distinguish advertising from other television programs, whilst the ability to determine the truthfullness of the message may not be developed until the age of eight{{note|lawrence}}.



==Public service advertising==
The same advertising techniques used to promote commercial goods and services can be used to inform, educate and motivate the public about non-commercial issues, such as [[AIDS]], political ideology, energy conservation, religious recruitment, and deforestation.

Advertising, in its non-commercial guise, is a powerful educational tool capable of reaching and motivating large audiences. &quot;Advertising justifies its existence when used in the public interest - it is much too powerful a tool to use solely for commercial purposes.&quot; - Attributed to Howard Gossage by [[David Ogilvy]]

[[Public service advertising]], [[non-commercial advertising]], public interest advertising, cause  marketing, and social marketing are different terms for (or aspects of) the use of sophisticated advertising and marketing communications techniques (generally associated with commercial enterprise) on behalf of non-commercial, public interest issues and initiatives.

In the [[United States]], the granting of television and radio licenses by the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] is contingent upon the station broadcasting a certain amount of public service advertising.

Public service advertising reached its height during World Wars I and II under the direction of several U.S. government agencies.

==Social impact==
=== Regulation ===
{{main|Advertising regulation}}

There have been increasing efforts to protect the public interest by regulating the content and the reach of advertising. Some examples are the ban on television [[tobacco advertising]] imposed in many countries, and the total ban on advertising to children under twelve imposed by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] government in 1991. Though that regulation continues in effect for broadcasts originating within the country, it has been weakened by the [[European Court of Justice]], which has found that Sweden was obliged to accept whatever programming was targeted at it from neighbouring countries or via satellite. 

In Europe and elsewhere there is a vigorous debate on whether and how much advertising to children should be regulated. This debate was exacerbated by a report released by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation in February 2004 which suggested that food advertising targeting children was an important factor in the epidemic of childhood [[obesity]] raging across the United States.

In many countries - namely New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, and many European contries- the advertising industry operates a system of self-regulation. Advertisers, advertising agencies and the media agree on a code of advertising standards that they attempt to uphold. The general aim of such codes is to ensure that any advertising is 'legal, decent, honest and truthful'. Some self-regulatory organisations are funded by the industry, but remain independent, with the intent of upholding the standards or codes (like the [[Advertising Standards Authority|ASA]] in the UK).

===Critiques of the medium===
As advertising and marketing efforts become increasingly ubiquitous in modern Western societies, the industry has come under criticism of groups such as [[AdBusters]] via [[culture jamming]] which criticizes the media and [[consumerism]] using advertising's own techniques. The industry is accused of being one of the engines powering a convoluted [[economic]] [[mass production]] system which promotes [[consumption]]. Some advertising campaigns have also been criticized as inadvertently or even intentionally promoting [[sexism]], [[racism]], and [[ageism]]. Such criticisms have raised questions about whether this medium is creating or reflecting cultural trends. At very least, advertising often reinforces [[stereotype]]s by drawing on recognizable &quot;types&quot; in order to tell stories in a single image or 30 second time frame. Recognizing the social impact of advertising, [[MediaWatch]], a non-profit women's organization, works to educate consumers about how they can register their concerns with advertisers and regulators. It has developed educational materials for use in schools. The award-winning book, Made You Look - How Advertising Works and Why You Should Know , by former MediaWatch president Shari Graydon, provides context for these issues for young readers. 

[[public interest|Public]] [[interest group]]s and free thinkers are increasingly suggesting that access to the mental space targeted by advertisers should be taxed, in that at the present moment that space is being [[externality|freely taken advantage of]] by advertisers with no compensation paid to the members of the public who are thus being intruded upon. This kind of tax would be a [[Pigovian tax]] in that it would act to reduce what is now increasingly seen as a public [[nuisance]]. Efforts to that end are gathering momentum, with [[Arkansas]] and [[Maine]] considering bills to implement such taxation. [[Florida]] enacted such a tax in [[1987]] but was forced to repeal it after six months, as a result of a concerted effort by national commercial interests, which withdrew planned conventions, causing major losses to the tourism industry, and cancelled advertising, causing a loss of 12 million dollars to the broadcast industry alone.

===Public perception of the medium===
Over the years, the public perception of advertising has become very negative. It is seen as a medium that inherently promotes a lie, based on the purpose of the advertisement - to encourage the target audience to submit to a cause or a belief, and act on it to the advertising party's benefit and consequently the target's disadvantage. They are either perceived as directly lying (stating opinions or untruths directly as facts), lying by omission (usually terms or conditions unfavorable to the customer), portraying a product or service in a light that does not reflect reality or even making up realities where their product has a new rol. It is this increased awareness of the intention of advertising, as well as advertising regulations that have increased the challenges that marketers face.

===Effects on communication media===
Another effect of advertising is to modify the nature of the communication media where it is shown. The most clear example is television. Channels that get most of their revenues from publicity try to make their medium a good place for communicating ads. That means trying to make the public stay for long times and in a mental state that will make spectators not to switch the channel through the ads. Programs that are low in mental stimulus and require light concentration and are varied are best for long sitting times and make for easier emotional jumps to ads, that can become more entretaining than regular shows.
A simple way to understand the objectives in [[television programming]] is to compare contents from channels paid and chosen by the viewer or channels that get their income mainly from advertisements.

==Future==
With the dawn of the Internet have come many new advertising opportunities.  Popup, Flash, banner, and email advertisements (the last often being a form of spam) abound.  Recently, the advertising community has attempted to make the adverts themselves desirable to the public. In one example, [[Cadillac]] chose to advertise in the movie '[[The Matrix Reloaded]]', which as a result contained many scenes in which Cadillac cars were used.

Each year, greater sums are paid to obtain a commercial spot during the [[Super Bowl]].  Companies attempt to make these commercials sufficiently entertaining that members of the public will actually want to watch them.  

Particularly since the rise of &quot;entertaining&quot; advertising, some people may like an advert enough that they wish to watch it later or show a friend.  In general, the advertising community has not yet made this easy, although some  have used the Internet to widely distribute their adverts to anyone wishing to see or hear them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''AI-complete''' is, by analogy to [[NP-complete]]ness in complexity theory, a term first coined by Fanya S. Montalvo to indicate that the difficulty of a computational problem is equivalent to solving the central [[Artificial Intelligence]] problem, in other words, making computers as intelligent as people. Note that unlike NP-completeness, this term is typically used informally.

To call a problem AI-complete reflects an attitude that it won't be solved by a simple algorithm, such as those used in [[ELIZA]].  Such problems are hypothesised to include:

*[[Computer vision]]
*[[Natural language understanding]]
*Passing the [[Turing Test]]

These problems are easy for humans to do (in fact, some are described directly in terms of imitating humans), and all, at their core, are about representing complex relationships between a large number of human concepts.  Some systems can solve very simple restricted versions of these problems, but none can solve them in their full generality.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Archaeoastronomy''' (also spelled '''Archeoastronomy''') is the study of ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context, utilizing archaeological and anthropological evidence. Archaeoastronomy examines archaeological sites for evidence of astronomy in remote cultures, and anthropological and ethnohistorical evidence for evidence of astronomical practices in living cultures. The study of the astronomies of living traditional cultures is sometimes called Ethnoastronomy. Archaeoastronomy also focuses on modern astronomy, employing historical records of early astronomical observations to study past astronomical events, and employing astronomical data to clarify the historical record.

In the study of solar, lunar, and stellar alignments of monuments, numerous claims have been made that the [[Megalith|megalithic monuments]], such as [[Nabta Playa]], [[Stonehenge]] and [[New Grange]], represent &quot;ancient observatories,&quot; but the extent and nature of their use in that regard needs careful definition. Certainly, they are aligned with particular significance to the solstitial points. 

The early development of this aspect of archaeoastronomy was influenced by [[Alexander Thom|Alexander Thom's]] studies of megalithic monuments of Britain, published in ''[[Megalithic sites in Britain]]'' (Oxford, 1967). Thom employed detailed surveys and statistical methods to investigate the calendric and astronomical functions of numerous Neolithic monuments. He claimed that these monuments incorporate alignments to points on the horizon where the sun and moon rise and set at seasonal extremes like midsummer, midwinter and the equinoxes. In addition to his work on Neolithic astronomy, he also proposed the [[megalithic yard]] as a standardized unit of measure.  Although his work greatly influenced the development of archaeoastronomy, many of his conclusions (especially those implying highly precise observations) have been widely questioned.

Anthropological and ethnohistorical methods have been used to study astronomies in a wide range of cultures.  Typical studies have examined the astronomical and calendric practices of the [[Hopi]] and [[Zuni]] of the Southwestern United States; the astronomy and cosmology of the Andean villagers of Misminay; the calendrical and divinatory practices of modern [[Maya]] priests, and the ambiguous [[lunar calendar]] of the [[Mursi]] of southwestern Ethiopia.

Archaeoastronomy has also considered the extensive records of ancient China for references to &quot;guest stars&quot;. &quot;Guest stars,&quot; or star-like objects which appeared in the [[night sky]], were of great interest to the observers of ancient China and were often dutifully recorded. These events have been associated with many transitory phenomena, such as [[comet]]s and, particularly, [[supernova|supernovae]]. Besides the insights such records provide into the significance of celestial phenomena in ancient cultures, they have also been found useful by modern astronomers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Sapkowski.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Andrzej Sapkowski]]
'''Andrzej Sapkowski''', born [[June 21]], [[1948]] in [[Łódź]], is a [[Poland|Polish]] [[Fantasy|fantasy]] writer. Sapkowski studied economics and worked as a businessman before  becoming well known as a writer. His first [[short story]], ''[[The Hexer]] ''(''Wiedźmin''), was published in ''[[Fantastyka]]'', Poland's leading fantasy literary magazine, in 1986 and garnered enormous critical success. Sapkowski has created a cycle of tales based on the world of ''The Hexer'', comprising three collections of short stories and five [[novel]]s. This cycle and his many other books have made him one of the most well-known fantasy authors in Poland [[1990s]].

The main character of ''[[The Hexer]]'' (alternative translation: ''[[The Witcher]]'') is Geralt, a mutant assassin who has been trained from childhood to hunt down and destroy monsters and other vermin. Geralt moves in an ambiguous moral universe, yet manages to maintain his own coherent code of ethics. At once cynical and noble, Geralt has been compared to [[Raymond Chandler]]'s signature character [[Philip Marlowe]]. The world in which these adventures take place owes much to [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], while also heavily influenced by Polish history and Slavic mythology.

Sapkowski has won five [[Zajdel Award]]s, including three for the short stories &quot;Mniejsze zło&quot; (''Smaller Evil'') ([[1990]]), &quot;Miecz przeznaczenia&quot; (''Sword of destiny'') ([[1992]]) and &quot;W leju po bombie&quot; (''In a bomb hole'') ([[1993]]), and two for the novels &quot;Krew elfów&quot; (''Elven blood'') ([[1994]]) and &quot;Narrenturm&quot; ([[2002]]). 

In 1997, Sapkowski won the prestigious Polityka Passport award, which the Polish newsweekly Polityka granrojects to provide security. Skilled, intensive [[garden|gardening]] can support an adult from as little as 15 square meters of land.  Some proven intensive, low-effort food-production systems include [[hydroponics]], and [[forest gardening]].

=== Communication ===

[[Public switched telephone network|Telephone]] and [[Telecommunications network|network]] service will probably be purchased.

A increasing number of activists provide free or very inexpensive [[World Wide Web|web]] and [[email]] services using cooperative computer networks that run wireless [[ad hoc network]]s. Network service is provided by a cooperative of neighbors, each operating a router as a household appliance.  These minimize wired infrastructure, and its costs and vulnerabilities.

[[Satellite]] internet service also can provide high speed connectivity to remote locations, but as of early [[as of 2002|2002]], most of these services are limited in which types of network hardware and operating systems they support. They are also not yet on par with the costs of [[cable modem]] or [[Digital Subscriber Line|DSL]] service providers.

==Financing==

If considering a system for the economics, run the numbers with real utility prices.  Most utilities have prices 5-10% below the amortized price of the mass-produced rural systems they replace (e.g., electricity will be just below the fuel costs and amortization of a generator powered from natural gas).  However, many people pay for utilities from after-tax income, so even the simplest home-based utilities can be 15-45% more efficient by creating untaxed value.  Clever purchasing (e.g. in internet co-ops) can cut capital costs.

Unless the area has local nuclear or hydroelectric power, new construction can often afford to make its own heat and light.

In the coldest areas of the U.S. passive solar heat in new construction costs only 15% more than normal construction.  In milder areas, it costs ''nothing'' and is therefore a great bargain.  A passive-solar house usually commands a 15-20% price premium.

In Southern California, new solar roofs already provide cheaper electricity than utilities, because they keep the rain out, and the amortized cost of such electricity is cheaper than the power prices.  In most great plains areas, a 10-meter wind turbine on a hundred-foot (30 m) tower will run an all-electric house, for 10% or less of a new house's cost.

Sewage and water are more marginal.  Local health regulations can be problematic, and bulk water and sewage services are usually cheap.  Water and sewage systems also have unattractive costs, lifestyle and mechanical reliability issues.  Groundwater poisoning, deep green beliefs and high utility prices can motivate installations.

In all rural and most suburban areas buying land for swales instead of digging storm-drains creates a more valuable and more pleasant building.

{{Hiero|Anubis|&lt;hiero&gt;i-n:p-w-E16&lt;/hiero&gt;|align=right|era=egypt}}
'''Anubis''' is the [[Greek language|Greek]] name for the ancient [[god]] in [[Egyptian mythology]] whose [[hieroglyph]]ic is more accurately spelt '''Anpu''' (also '''Anup''', '''Anupu''', '''Wip''', '''Ienpw''', '''Inepu''', '''Yinepu''', or '''Inpw'''). He is also known as Sekhem Em Pet. Prayers to Anubis have been found carved on the most ancient tombs in Egypt; indeed, the [[Unas]] text (line 70) associates him with the [[Eye of Horus]].

==Lord of the dead==
[[Image:Anubis standing.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Anubis]]
Originally, in the [[Ogdoad]] system, he was god of the [[duat|underworld]], and his name is frequently thought to have reflected this, meaning something like ''[[putrefaction]]''. He was said to have a wife, '''Anput''' (who was really just his female aspect, her name being his with an additional feminine [[suffix]]: the ''t''), who was depicted exactly the same, though feminine. His father was originally said to be [[Ra]], as he was the creator god, and thus his mother was said to be [[Hesat]], Ra's wife, who later was identified as [[Hathor]] (who her identity was remarkably similar to). As lord of the underworld, Anubis was identified as the father of [[Kebechet]], the goddess of the purification of bodily organs due to be placed in [[canopic jar]]s during [[Mummy|mummification]]. 

[[Dog]]s and [[jackal]]s often loitered at the edges of the desert, especially near the cemeteries where the dead were buried; in fact, it is thought that the Egyptians began the practice of making elaborate graves and tombs in order to protect the dead from desecration by jackals. In consequence, Anubis was usually thought of as a jackal, an association reinforced by certain variations of his hieroglyph, which can be translated as ''young dog''. Thus, ancient Egyptian texts say that Anubis, like a jackal, silently walked through the shadows of life and death and lurked in dark places, watchful by day as well as by night.

In [[art]], he was usually depicted as a man with the head of a [[jackal]] and alert [[ear]]s, often wearing a [[ribbon]], and wielding a [[whip (implement)|whip]]. On very rare occasions, Anubis was shown fully human, or slightly more frequently as fully jackal. However, Anubis was also depicted as [[black]], rather than [[brown]], the colour of jackals, since black was the [[color|colour]] that the body turned as a result of [[Mummy|mummification]].

As ruler over the dead, he was given titles such as ''He who is set upon his mountain'', in reference to his sitting atop desert cliffs to guard multiple [[necropolis]], and '''Chontamenti''' (also spelt '''Khentimentiu''', and '''Khentamenti'''), meaning ''Lord of the Westerners'', in reference to Egyptian belief that the entrance to the underworld was towards the west, since that was the direction in which the sun set. As ruler, he was also said to have been victorious over the dark forces (described as ''[[nine bows]]''), which also, naturally, lurk in the underworld, gaining him the title ''Jackal ruler of the bows''.

As king of the underworld, he was also considered to be the one who weighed the [[Egyptian soul|heart of the dead]] against the feather of [[Maàt]] (the concept of truth), gaining him the title ''He who counts the hearts''. One of the reasons that the ancient Egyptians took such care to preserve their dead with sweet-smelling herbs was that it became believed Anubis would check each person with his keen canine nose.  Only if they smelled pure would he allow them to enter the Kingdom of the Dead.

==Embalmer==
[[Image:Anubis statuette 2.jpg|thumb|Statuette of Anubis]]

Following the merging of the [[Ennead]] and [[Ogdoad]] belief systems, as a result of the identification of [[Atum]] with [[Ra]], and their compatibility, Anubis became considered a lesser god in the underworld, giving way to the more popular [[Osiris]]. Indeed, when the [[Legend of Osiris and Isis]] emerged, it was said that when Osiris had died, Anubis stood down from his position out of respect for Osiris.

Since he had been more associated with beliefs about the weighing of the heart than had Osiris, Anubis retained this aspect, and became considered more the [[gatekeeper]] of the underworld, the ''Guardian of the veil'' (of ''death''). As such, he was said to protect souls as they journeyed there, and thus be the patron of [[lost soul]]s (and consequently [[orphan]]s). Rather than god of death, he had become god of dying, and consequently funeral arrangements. It was as the god of dying that his identity merged with that of [[Wepwawet]], a similar jackal-headed god, associated with funerary practice, who had been worshipped in [[Upper Egypt]], whereas Anubis' cult had centred in [[Lower Egypt]].

As one of the most important funerary rites in Egypt involved the process of [[embalming]], so it was that Anubis became the god of embalming, in the process gaining titles such as ''He who belongs to the mummy wrappings'', and ''He who is before the divine [embalming] [[booth]]''. High priests often wore the Anubis mask to perform the ceremonial deeds of embalming. It also became said, frequently in the [[Book of the dead]], that it had been Anubis who embalmed the dead body of Osiris, with the assistance of the other main funerary deities involved - Nepthys, and Isis. Having become god of embalming, Anubis became strongly associated with the (currently) mysterious and ancient [[imiut fetish]], present during funerary rites, and [[Bast (goddess)|Bast]], who by this time was goddess of ointment, initially became thought of as his mother.

However, as lesser of the two gods of the underworld, he gradually became considered the son of Osiris, but Osiris' wife, Isis, was not considered his mother, since she too inappropriately was associated with life. Instead, his mother became considered to be [[Nepthys]], who had become strongly associated with funerary practice, indeed had in some ways become the personification of [[mourning]], and was said to supply bandages to the deceased. Subsequently, this apparent infidelity of Osiris was explained in myth, in which it was said that a [[Sexual frustration|sexually frustrated]] Nepthys had disguised herself as Isis in order to appeal to her husband, Set, but he did not notice her as he was [[gay]] and [[infertility|infertile]], whereas Isis' husband Osiris did, mistaking her for his wife, which resulted in Anubis' birth. Some more [[homophobia|homophobic]] versions of the myth depict Set as the father.

In later times, during the [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] period, as their functions were similar, Anubis was identified as the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] god [[Hermes]], becoming [[Hermanubis]]. The centre of this [[cult]] was in ''uten-ha''/''Sa-ka''/[[Cynopolis]], a place whose Greek name simply means ''city of dogs''. In Book xi of ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' by [[Apuleius]], we find evidence that the worship of this god was maintained in Rome at least up to the 2nd century. Indeed, Hermanubis also appears in the [[alchemy|alchemical]] and [[Hermeticism|hermetical]] literature of the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]].

'''Arthur Jensen''' is a prominent [[UC Berkeley]] supergrade professor emeritus of [[educational psychology]], known for his work in [[psychometrics]] and [[differential psychology]], which is concerned with how and why individuals differ behaviorally from one another.  Jensen is a leading authority on [[IQ]], and his work on testing bias is canonical. He is a major proponent of the [[hereditarianism|hereditarian]] position in the [[nature versus nurture]] debate, the position that concludes [[genetics]] play a significant role in behavioral traits, such as [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] and personality traits.  He is the author of over 400 scientific papers published in refereed journals.[http://www.isteve.com/jensen.htm]

Jensen was born [[August 24]], [[1923]], and studied at [[University of California, Berkeley]] (B.A. 1945), [[San Diego State College]] (M.A., 1952) and [[Columbia University]] (Ph.D., 1956).

==IQ and academic achievement==
Jensen's most controversial work, published in February [[1969]] in the ''[[Harvard Educational Review]]'', was titled &quot;How Much Can We Boost I.Q. and Scholastic Achievement?&quot; It concluded, among other things, that &quot;head start&quot; programs designed to boost [[African-American]] [[IQ]] scores had failed, and that this was likely never to be remedied, largely because, in Jensen's estimation, over 70% of the within race IQ variability was due to genetic factors, and the  30% left over was due to non-shared environmental influences (e.g., prenatal drug exposure, placental nutrient competition  when there are multiple births).

When the work was initially published, students and faculty staged large, loud protests outside his [[University of California, Berkeley]] office, and he received multiple death threats. He was even denied reprints of his work by his publisher and was not permitted to reply in response to letters of critism -- both extremely unusual and exceptional policies for their day. Many colleagues at the time felt that even if Jensen's work contained no scientific merit, his treatment was itself against the spirit of science and the free exchange of ideas.

[[Image:Jensen1.jpg|right|thumb|Arthur Jensen winning the 2003 [[Kistler Prize]].]]
In a later article, Jensen argued that his claims had been misunderstood:

:...nowhere have I &quot;claimed&quot; an &quot;innate deficiency&quot; of intelligence in blacks. My position on this question is clearly spelled out in my most recent book: &quot;The plain fact is that at present there exists no scientifically satisfactory explanation for the differences between the IQ distributions in the black and white populations. The only genuine consensus among well-informed scientists on this topic is that the cause of the difference remains an open question&quot; (Jensen, 1981a, p. 213).

[[Thomas Sowell]] wrote:
:Professor Jensen pointed out back in 1969 that black children's IQ scores rose by 8 to 10 points after he met with them informally in a play room and then tested them again after they were more relaxed around him. He did this because &quot;I felt these children were really brighter than their IQ would indicate.&quot; What a shame that others seem to have less confidence in black children than Professor Jensen has had. [http://www.townhall.com/opinion/columns/thomassowell/2002/10/01/164398.html]

Nevertheless, eugenicists and others point to passages such as the following (from his book ''The ''g'' Factor: The Science of Mental Ability'') to support their claim that Jensen has proven that differences in IQ scores between races are mostly genetic:
:In Chapter 12: Population Differences in ''g'': Causal Hypotheses, Jensen writes: &quot;The relationship of the ''g'' factor to a number of biological variables and its relationship to the size of the white-black differences on various cognitive tests (i.e., [[Spearman's hypothesis]]) suggests that the average white-black difference in ''g'' has a biological component. Human races are viewed not as discrete, or Platonic, categories, but rather as breeding populations that, as a result of natural selection, have come to differ statistically in the relative frequencies of many polymorphic genes. The genetic distances between various populations form a continuous variable that can be measured in terms of differences in gene frequencies. Racial populations differ in many genetic characteristics, some of which, such as brain size, have behavioral and psychometric correlates, particularly ''g''.&quot;

== Gould's criticism ==
Paleontologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]], known for his popularizations of science in mass market books and magazines, attacked Jensen's work in his 1981 book ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]].''  

Gould makes three criticisms.  The first is the criticism commonly leveled against Jensen and other researchers dealing with [[race and intelligence]]:that Jensen misapplies the concept of &quot;heritability.&quot;  [[Heritability]] measures the percentage of variation of a trait due to inheritance, ''within'' a population. (Gould 1981: 127; 156-156). Jensen has used the concept of heritability to measure differences in inheritance ''between'' populations, and this is the basis of the criticism.

Secondly, Gould disagrees with Jensen's belief that IQ tests measure a real variable, ''g'', or &quot;the [[general factor]] common to a large number of cognitive abilities&quot; which can be measured along a unilinear scale. This is a claim most closely identified with [[Cyril Burt]] and [[Charles Spearman]]. According to Gould, Jensen misunderstood the research of [[L. L. Thurstone]] to ultimately support this claim; Gould however argues that Thurstone's [[factor analysis]] of intelligence revealed ''g'' to be an illusion (1981: 159; 13-314).

Third, Gould disagrees with Jensen's support of the attempts of others to calculate the IQ's of dead people (such as the famous astronomer and Prussian monetary theorist [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]) (1981: 153-154).

In a 1982 review of Gould's book Jensen gives point-by-point rebuttals to Gould's characterizations of his work, including Gould's treatment of heritability, the &quot;reification&quot; of ''g'' and the use of Thurstone's analysis. Gould's responses can be found in the latest edition of ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' (1996).

In Arthur Jensen's response to Gould's criticisms, in the paper titled ''The Debunking of Scientific Fossils arget of a [[takeover]] while shorting the stock of the acquiring company.

Usually the market price of the target company is less than the price offered by the acquiring company.
The spread between these two prices depends mainly on the probability and the timing of the takeover being completed.

The bet in a merger arbitrage is that such a spread will eventually be zero, if and when the takeover is completed.

=== Convertible bond arbitrage ===
A [[convertible bond]] is a [[bond (finance)|bond]] that an investor can return to the issuing company in exchange for a predetermined number of shares in the company.

A convertible bond can be thought of as a [[corporate bond]] with a stock [[call option]] attached to it.

The price of a convertible bond is sensitive to three major factors:

*''[[interest rate]]''. When rates move higher, the price of a bond tends to move lower.
*''stock price''. When the price of the stock the bond is convertible into moves higher, the price of the bond tends to rise.
*''[[credit spread]]''. If the creditworthiness of the issuer deteriorates (e.g. [[credit rating agency|rating]] downgrade) and its credit spread widens, the bond price tends to move lower.

Given the complexity of the calculations involved and the convoluted structure that a convertible bond can have, an arbitrageur often relies on sophisticated quantitative models in order to identify bonds that are trading cheap versus their theoretical value.

Convertible arbitrage consists of buying a convertible bond and hedging two of the three factors in order to gain exposure to the third factor at a very attractive price.

For instance an arbitrageur would first buy a convertible bond, then sell [[fixed income]] [[securities]] or [[interest rate future]]s (to hedge the interest rate exposure) and buy some [[credit default swap|credit protection]] (to hedge the risk of credit deterioration).
Eventually what he'd be left with is something similar to a call option on the underlying stock, acquired at a very low price.
He could then make money either selling some of the more expensive options that are openly traded in the market or [[delta hedging]] his exposure to the underlying shares.

=== Depositary receipts ===
A [[depositary receipt]] is a security that is offered as a &quot;tracking stock&quot; on another foreign market. For instance a [[China|Chinese]] company wishing to raise more money may issue a depository receipt on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], as the amount of capital on the local exchanges is limited. These securities, known as ADRs or GDRs depending on where they are issued, are typically considered &quot;foreign&quot; and therefore trade at a lower value when first released. However, they are exchangeable into the original security (known as [[fungible|fungibility]]) and actually have the same value. In this case there is a spread between the perceived value and real value, which can be extracted. Since the ADR is trading at a value lower than what it is worth, one can purchase the ADR and expect to make money as its value converges on the original. However there is a chance that the original stock will fall in value too, so by shorting it you can hedge that risk.

===Regulatory arbitrage===
Regulatory arbitrage is where a regulated institution takes advantage of the difference between its real (or economic) [[risk]] and the regulatory position. For example, if a bank, operating under the [[Basel I]] accord, has to hold 8% capital against [[default risk]], but the real risk of default is lower, it is profitable to [[Securitization|securitise]] the loan, removing the low risk loan from its portfolio. On the other hand, if the real risk is higher than the regulatory risk then it is profitable to make that loan and hold on to it, provided it is priced appropriately.

This process can increase the overall riskiness of institutions under a risk insensitive regulatory regime, as described by [[Alan Greenspan]] in his [[October]] [[1998]] speech on [http://www.ny.frb.org/research/epr/98v04n3/9810gree.pdf The Role of Capital in Optimal Banking Supervision and Regulation].

===Long-Term Capital Management===
{{main|Long-Term Capital Management}}

[[Long-Term Capital Management]] (LTCM) lost U.S. dollars 4.6 billion in [[fixed income arbitrage]] in September [[1998]]. LTCM had attempted to make money on the price difference between different [[bond]]s. For example, it would buy [[Treasury security|U.S. Treasury securities]] and sell Italian bond futures.  The concept was that because Italian bond futures had a less liquid market, in the short term Italian bond futures would have a higher return than U.S. bonds, but in the long term, the prices would converge.  Because the difference was small, a large amount of money had to be borrowed to make the buying and selling profitable.

The downfall in this system began on [[August 17]], [[1998]], when [[Russia]] defaulted on its [[ruble]] debt and domestic dollar debt.  Since the markets were already nervous due to the [[Asian financial crisis]], investors began selling non-U.S. treasury  debt and buying U.S. treasuries, which were considered a safe investment.  As a result the return on U.S. treasuries began decreasing because there were many buyers, and the return on other bonds began to increase because there were many sellers.  This caused the difference between the returns of U.S. treasuries and other bonds to increase, rather than to decrease as LTCM was expecting.  Eventually this caused LTCM to fold, and their creditors had to arrange a bail-out. More controversially, officials of the [[Federal Reserve]] assisted in the negotiations that led to this bail-out, on the grounds that so many companies and deals were intertwined with LTCM that if LTCM went down, they would as well, causing a collapse in confidence in the economic system.

      <comment>/* Conclusion from evolutionary arguments */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The argument from [[evolution]] is that [[intelligent design]] is not a verifiable scientific theory and is, in fact, [[pseudoscience]]{{ref|openA}}, with evolutionists noting that &quot;IDers&quot; have theological rather than scientific objectives. This argument is based upon the premises that:

# [[Science]], via evolution, provides sound explanations for the [[origin of life|origin]] and [[diversity of life]], and the [[Universe|origin of the Universe]].
# Evolution is commonly accepted by biologists because of extensive testing of its premises and predictions, whereas ID has not been and cannot be tested because of its theistic basis and reliance on a supernatural causer/[[prime mover]].  Thus, ID is neither provable nor falsifiable, two of the key requirements for any truly scientific theory.{{ref|openB}}
# Using the concept of [[Occam's Razor|parsimony]], scientists note that it is far more likely that the universe is a result of naturalistic processes rather than of creation.{{ref|openC}}
# ID lacks consistency except internally, i.e., it is only consistent and logical within the framework in which it operates. ID at its foundation relies upon an unsupported, unjustified assumption: That complexity and improbability must entail design, but the identity and characteristics of the designer is not identified or quantified, nor need they be.{{ref|openD}} 

A common misconception is that evolution is an argument against the existence of God, but evolution does not conflict with a belief in God, in fact, evolution does not deal in any way with the existence or non-existence of a god or gods.{{ref|open1}}  Two examples that illustrate this follow. Many people believe that evolution occurred as scientists theorize, while maintaining a belief in a deity. Evolutionary creationists accept the scientific theories of evolution, but see it as having been guided by a deity.{{ref|open2}}

== Overview ==
The theory of evolution states that due to [[natural selection]] and genetic variation, populations and species undergo genetic change over time.  According to intelligent design, life is too complex to have been a result of evolution, and must have been designed by an intelligent agent, who most supporters believe to be the God of [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic religions]].  In other words, intelligent design claims to be a [[scientific theory]],that stands on equal footing with, or is superior to, current scientific theories regarding the [[origin of life]]{{ref|ov_meyer}}, that can be used to explain the origins of life on Earth.  

The validity of the scientific claims regarding ID have been dismissed by an overwhelming majority of scientists{{ref|ov_over}}, as the theory was proposed by people with religious rather than scientific objectives. This opinion was clearly articulated in Judge [[John E. Jones III|John E. Jones III's]] decision in the ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' (2005).{{ref|ov_kitz}}

==Evolutionary Arguments Against Intelligent Design==
===Intelligent Design is Not Science===
The term ‘[[science]]’ refers to the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical world, especially by observing, measuring and experimenting. Being that intelligent design relies on [[supernatural]] phenomena, it does not fit under this category. A scientific theory must undergo what is known as the “[[scientific method]]” to be scientifically acceptable. The scientific method is the process by which scientists, collectively and over time, endeavor to construct an accurate representation of the world. It involves a number of important steps. These are, in proper order:

#observation and description
#formulation of a hypothesis 
#experimentation to test the hypothesis 
#acceptance or rejection of the hypothesis {{ref|idnot_SM1}}

Rather than following these steps, intelligent design has instead reversed them. Supporters of intelligent design began with a conclusion and are currently working to prove it. This presents a number of problems:  

* Beginning with a conclusion has a tendency to skew data and results in an effort to support the conclusion;
* Were students to be taught ID in school, their understanding of the necessity of using the scientific method might be compromised;
* Performing &quot;research&quot; in this manner has led mainstream scientists to refer to the IDers as &quot;[[apologetics|apologists]],&quot; thus the relegation of ID to a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] non-theory.{{ref|idnot_SM2}}{{ref|idnot_SM3}}

===The Definition of &quot;Theory&quot; and &quot;Evolution&quot;===

Intelligent design proponents, argue that evolution should not be the only &quot;theory&quot; taught in public schools. They propose an argument based on semantics, claiming that evolution is “only a theory,” and it should not be favored over other theories.  In addition, the [[Wedge strategy]] of the [[Discovery Institute]], has begun calling evolution a &quot;theory in crisis&quot; as part of its [[Teach the controversy]] campaign.{{ref|theory_wedge1}}

While it is correct to say that evolution is a theory and not indisputable fact (no ''scientific'' theory makes any claim to be fact), scientists take exception to DI's assertion that it is a theory in crisis, noting that with additional fossil finds, and [[DNA]] and [[Genome|genome-mapping]], evolution is far better supported today than it was even twenty years ago.

The second problem is that of the common definition of &quot;theory&quot;, rather than the scientific, is often used to imply that evolution is just an idea.  While &quot;theory&quot; in this sense refers to abstract reasoning and conjecture, the scientific definition of is much more rigorous. 

According to the scientific definition, a scientific theory must be repeatedly tested through the scientific method and accepted by the scientific community.{{ref|theory_def}} While evolution has passed repeated testing thus rendering it a true scientific theory, intelligent design has not. In fact it has not, and ''cannot'', be scientifically tested as its central argument, that life forms on Earth were created by an unknown intelligent agent, introduces supernatural phenomena that can be neither proven nor disproven.{{ref|theory_behe}}

However, the problem lies not just with the definition of theory, but also with that of evolution, which, like so many other words has more than one meaning. Its strict biological definition is &quot;a change in [[allele]] frequencies over time.&quot; By that definition, evolution is an indisputable fact. Most people seem to associate the word &quot;evolution&quot; mainly with [[Common descent|common descent]], the theory that all life arose from one common ancestor. Many people believe that there is enough evidence to call this a fact, too. However, common descent is still not the theory of evolution, but just a fraction of it (and a part of several quite different theories as well). The theory of evolution not only says that life evolved, it also includes mechanisms, like mutations, natural selection, and genetic drift, which go a long way towards explaining how life evolved.{{ref|theory_def2}}

==Common ID Arguments Disproved==
The following are some common arguments against evolution and why they are wrong

===Evolution has never been observed===

Biologists observe evolution occurring all the time, as they define evolution as a change in the gene pool of a population over time. One example is insects developing a resistance to pesticides over the period of a few years. Even most Creationists recognize that evolution at this level is a fact. What they don't appreciate is that this rate of evolution is all that is required to produce the diversity of all living things from a common ancestor.{{ref|no_1}}

Another example is the evolution of [[Salamander|Ensatina Salamanders]] in the Western United States.  One ancestral species in [[Oregon]] spread southward and populated the [[San Joaquin Valley]].  Once the salamanders had spread south and converged into one area, two non-interbreeding species had emerged.  In other words, adaptations to a changing environment as they spread south resulted in enough variation to prevent interbreeding and therefore creating, by definition, two separate [[species]].{{ref|no_2}}

Even without these direct observations, it would be wrong to say that evolution has not been observed. Evidence isn't limited to seeing something happen before your eyes. Evolution makes predictions about what we would expect to see in the fossil record, comparative anatomy, genetic sequences, geographical distribution of species, etc., and these predictions have been verified many times over. The number of observations supporting evolution is overwhelming. 

What has not been observed is one animal abruptly changing into a radically different one, such as a frog changing into a cow. This is not a problem for evolution because evolution doesn't propose occurrences even remotely like that. In fact, if we ever observed a frog turn into a cow, it would be very strong evidence against evolution.{{ref|no_3}}

Evolution has been observed at a microscopic level as many bacteria species have become immune to certain antibiotics that have worked on them in the past. At the same time bacteria of the same species with no immunity are killed by the antibiotics but the immune ones remain to reproduce. This is an example of both evolution and natural selection.

===Evolution violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics===

This statement of an alleged violation shows more a misconception about [[thermodynamics]] than about evolution. The second law of thermodynamics says, &quot;No process is possible in which the sole result is the transfer of energy from a cooler to a hotter body.&quot;{{ref|2LOTA}}  In and of itself, this statement does not appear to have aught to do with evolution. However, the confusion arises when the second law is phrased in another equivalent way, &quot;The entropy of a closed system cannot decrease.&quot; Entropy is an indication of unusable energy and often corresponds to intuitive notions of disorder or randomness. Creationists thus misinterpret the 2nd law to say that things invariably progress from order to disorder. 

However, they neglect the fact that life is not a closed system. The sun provides more than enough energy to drive things. If a mature tomato plant can have more usable energy than the seed it grew from, why should anyone expect that the next generation of tomatoes can't have more usable energy still? Creationists sometimes try to get around this by claiming that the information carried by living things lets them create order. However, not only is life irrelevant to the second law, but order from disorder is common in nonliving systems, too. 

Snowflakes, sand dunes, tornadoes, stalactites, graded river beds, and lightning are just a few examples of order coming from disorder in nature; none require an intelligent program to achieve that order. In any nontrivial system with lots of energy flowing through it, you are almost certain to find order arising somewhere in the system. If order from disorder is supposed to violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics, why is it ubiquitous in nature? 

The thermodynamics argument against evolution displays a misconception about evolution as well as about thermodynamics, since a clear understanding of how evolution works should reveal major flaws in the argument. Evolution says that organisms reproduce with only small changes between generations (after their own kind, so to speak). For example, animals might have appendages which are longer or shorter, thicker or flatter, lighter or darker than their parents. Occasionally, a change might be on the order of having four or six fingers instead of five. Once the differences appear, the theory of evolution calls for differential reproductive success. For example, maybe the animals with longer appendages survive to have more offspring than short-appendaged ones. All of these processes can be observed today. They obviously don't violate any physical laws.{{ref|2LOT}}

===There are no transitional fossils===

A [[Transitional fossil|transitional fossil]] is one that looks like it is from an organism intermediate between two lineages, meaning it has some characteristics of lineage A, some characteristics of lineage B, and probably some characteristics part way between the two. Transitional fossils can occur between groups of any [[Taxonomy|taxonomic level]], such as between species, between [[Order (biology)|orders]], etc. Ideally, the transitional fossil should be found stratigraphically between the first occurrence of the ancestral lineage and the first occurrence of the descendant lineage, but evolution also predicts the occurrence of some fossils with transitional morphology that occur after both lineages. There's nothing in the theory of evolution which says an intermediate form (or any organism, for that matter) can have only one line of descendants, or that the intermediate form itself has to go extinct when a line of descendants evolves. 

To say there are no transitional fossils is simply false. [[Paleontology]] has progressed a bit since [[Origin of Species|''The Origin of Species'']] was published, uncovering thousands of transitional fossils, by both the temporally restrictive and the less restrictive definitions. The fossil record is still spotty and always will be; erosion and the rarity of conditions favorable to fossilization make that inevitable. Also, transitions may occur in a small population, in a small area, and/or in a relatively short amount of time; when any of these conditions hold, the chances of finding the transitional fossils goes down. Still, there are still many instances where excellent sequences of transitional fossils exist. Some notable examples are the transitions from reptile to mammal, from land animal to early whale, and from early ape to human. 

The misconception about the lack of transitional fossils is perpetuated in part by a common way of thinking about categories. When people think about a category like &quot;dog&quot; or &quot;ant,&quot; they often subconsciously believe that there is a well-defined boundary around the category, or that there is some eternal ideal form (for philosophers, the [[Platonic realism|Platonic idea]]) which defines the category. This kind of thinking leads people to declare that Archaeopteryx is &quot;100% bird,&quot; when it is clearly a mix of bird and reptile features (with more reptile than bird features, in fact). In truth, categories are man-made and artificial. Nature is not constrained to follow them, and it doesn't. 

Some Creationists claim that the hypothesis of [[Punctuated equilibrium|punctuated equilibrium]] was proposed by [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]] to explain gaps in the fossil record.{{ref|tf2}} Actually, it was proposed to explain the relative rarity of transitional forms, not their total absence, and to explain why speciation appears to happen relatively quickly in some cases, gradually in others, and not at all during some periods for some species. In no way does it deny that transitional sequences exist.{{ref|tf1}} In fact, both Gould and Eldredge are outspoken opponents of Creationism, with Gould having stated, &quot;But paleontologists have discovered several superb examples of intermediary forms and sequences, more than enough to convince any fair-minded skeptic about the reality of life's physical genealogy.&quot;{{ref|tf3}}

===Random chance===

&quot;The theory of evolution says that life originated, and evolution proceeds, by random chance.&quot; 

There is probably no other statement which is a better indication that the arguer does not comprehend evolution. [[Chance]] certainly plays a large part in evolution, but this argument completely ignores the fundamental role of [[natural selection]], and selection is the very opposite of chance. Chance, in the form of mutations, provides genetic variation, which is the raw material that natural selection has to work with. From there, natural selection sorts out certain variations. Those variations which give greater reproductive success to their possessors (and chance ensures that such beneficial mutations will be inevitable) are retained, and less successful variations are weeded out. When the environment changes, or when organisms move to a different environment, different variations are selected, leading eventually to different species.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{merge|Price/wage spiral}}

In [[economics]], '''adaptive expectations''' means that people form their expectations about what will happen in the future based on what has happened in the past.  For example, if inflation has been high in the past, people would expect it to be high in the future.

In the theory of [[inflation]], [[demand pull inflation]] and [[cost push inflation]] are usually short-lived  shocks. However, a series of such shocks may lead people to assume that inflation is a permanent feature of the economy (especially if the shocks are large). In that case they will modify their economic behaviour accordingly, based on their heightened expectation of future inflation rates. For instance, they may begin demanding larger (nominal) pay raises. This in itself acts as a cost push, leading firms to push their prices higher, especially since the firms themselves have similar expectations of inflation. This encourages another round of pay-raises.
This merges with the &quot;[[price/wage spiral]]&quot; to build some inflation directly into the economy. The combination of the price/wage spiral and inflationary expectations reflecting the recent past's experience with inflation gives an economy [[built-in inflation]]. 

The theory of adaptive expectations was popular in the 1980s, as an explanation of some aspects of the economic crisis that the West went through after the 1970s oil shock. The fact that some countries, particularly the UK, took until the 1990s to achieve stable low inflation rates again suggests there may well be something in the idea.

The theory of adaptive expectations can be stated using the following equation, where '''p&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;''' is the next year's rate of inflation that is currently expected; '''p&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;''' is this year's rate of inflation that was expected last year; '''p''' is this year's actual rate of inflation, 

::'''p&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;''' = '''p&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;''' + '''&amp;lambda;'''*('''p''' &amp;ndash; '''p&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;''')

With '''&amp;lambda;''' is between 1 and 0, this says that current expectations of future inflation reflect past expectations and an &quot;error-adjustment&quot; term, in which current expectations are raised (or lowered) according to the gap between actual inflation and previous expectations.  This error-adjustment is also called &quot;''partial adjustment''.&quot; Rather than reflecting changing expectations of inflation, it may reflect the slow change in people's ability to ''act on'' changes in their expectations. 

Alternatively, the theory of adaptive expectations implies that current inflationary expectations equal: 

:: '''p&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;''' = (1 &amp;ndash; '''&amp;lambda;''')*&amp;Sigma; ('''&amp;lambda;&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;'''*'''p&lt;sub&gt;&amp;ndash;j&lt;/sub&gt;''')

where the summation (&amp;Sigma;) is over all '''j''' from 0 to infinity and '''p&lt;sub&gt;&amp;ndash;j&lt;/sub&gt;''' equals actual inflation '''j''' years in the past. Thus, current expected inflation reflects a weighted average all past inflation, where the weights get smaller and smaller as we move further in the past. 

An alternative theory of how expectations are formed is [[rational expectations]]. Though many macroeconomists saw the theory of rational expectations as a revolutionary improvement during the 1970s and 1980s, criticisms of that theory have encouraged a return to the adaptive expectations model.

The '''Mexican tetra''' (''Astyanax mexicanus'')  is a [[freshwater]] [[fish]]
of the [[characin]] [[family_(biology)|family]] (family [[Characidae]]) of
[[order_(biology)|order]] [[Characiformes]].  The [[type species]] of its [[genus]], it is native to the [[Nearctic]] [[ecozone]], originating in the lower [[Rio Grande]] and the [[Nueces River|Neueces]] and [[Pecos River]]s in [[Texas]] as well as the central and eastern parts of [[Mexico]].

Growing to a maximum overall length of 12&amp;nbsp;[[centimeter|cm]] (4.7&amp;nbsp;[[inch|in]]), the Mexican tetra is of typical characin shape, with unremarkable, drab coloration.  Its blind cave form, however, is notable for having no eyes and being [[albino]], that is, completely devoid of pigmentation; it has a pinkish-white color to its body.

This fish is reasonably popular among [[aquarium|aquarists]].  This is especially true of the blind cave form.

''A. mexicanus'' is a peaceful species that spends most of its time in the mid-level of the water above the rocky and sandy bottoms of pools and backwaters of creeks and rivers of its native environment.  Coming from a [[subtropical]] climate, it prefers water with 6.0&amp;ndash;7.8 [[pH]], a hardness of up to 30 [[dGH]], and a temperature range of 20 to 58 [[degree Celsius|&amp;deg;C]] (68 to 77 [[Fahrenheit|&amp;deg;F]]). In the winter it migrates to warmer waters.  Its natural diet consists of [[crustacean]]s, [[insect]]s, and [[annelid]]s, although in captivity it is [[omnivorous]].

The Mexican tetra is sometimes considered a subspecies of ''A. fasciatus,'' the [[banded tetra]].  The blind forms were once considered to constitute a separate genus, ''Anoptichthys.'' ''Anoptichthys jordani'' and ''Anoptichthys hubbsi'' are thus obsolete synonyms for ''Astyanax mexicanus.''

==Blind cave form==

''A. mexicanus'' is famous for its blind cave form, which is known by such names as '''blind cave tetra''', '''blind tetra''', and '''blind cavefish'''.  Some thirty distinct populations of Mexican tetras live in deep [[cave]]s and have lost the power of [[sight]] and even their [[eye]]s. These fish can still, however, find their way around by means of their [[lateral line]]s, which are highly sensitive to fluctuating [[water pressure]].

The eyed and eyeless forms of ''A. mexicanus,'' being members of the same species, are closely related and can interbreed.  A recent study (Dowling, Martasian, and Jeffery) suggests that there are at least two distinct genetic lineages among the blind populations, arguing that these represent a case of [[convergent evolution]].

In one experiment, scientists implanted into the eye of the blind ''A. mexicanus'' the eye lens from an eyed ''A. mexicanus''.  Within eight days the blind ''A. mexicanus'' started to develop an eye.  After two months it developed a working eye complete with an iris, cornea, and pupil.

The blind Mexican tetra is often held up as one of the proofs of the theory of [[evolution]].  However, opponents of evolutionary theory argue that the blind form is a ''loss of information'' (for sight), compatible with a deterioration of creation after the [[Fall of Man]], so cannot explain how the sight evolved in the first place.

The instrument now allows the three-dimensional reconstruction of up-to hundreds-of-millions of [[atom|atoms]] from a sharp tip (corresponding to specimen volumes of 10,000-1,000,000 [[nanometer|nm]]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

As in FIM, a sharp tip is made, placed in [[ultra high vacuum]] at cryogenic temperature (typically 20-100 K). Individual atoms at the surface of the tip are ionized, either by a positive pulsed voltage or a laser.  These ions are repelled from the tip electrostatically.  A fast timing circuit is used to measure the time taken between the pulse and the impact of the ion on a detector, thus allowing the mass-to-charge ratio of the ion to be calculated and, therefore, the element (or elements) of the ion. From the collection of many of these ions, a chemical profile of the sample can be made with relative position accuracy of less than one atomic spacing.

Atom-Probe Tomography (APT) uses a position-sensitive detector to deduce the lateral location of atoms.  It was invented in [[1988]] by [[Alfred Cerezo]], [[Terence Godfrey]], and [[George D. W. Smith]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:CaponeMugShot.jpg|200px|right|frame|FBI [[mugshot]] of Capone, 1931]]

'''Alphonse Gabriel Capone''' ([[January 17]], [[1899]] &amp;ndash; [[January 25]], [[1947]]), popularly known as '''Al &quot;Scarface&quot; Capone''', was an infamous [[United States|American]] [[gangster]] in the 1920s and 1930s, although his business card reportedly described him as a used [[furniture]] dealer. A [[Naples|Neapolitan]] born in [[New York]], Capone began his career in [[Brooklyn]] before moving to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] and becoming Chicago's most notorious [[crime]] figure. By the end of the 1920s, the [[FBI|Federal Bureau of Investigation]] had placed Capone on its &quot;[[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|Most Wanted]]&quot; list. Capone's downfall occurred in 1931 when he was indicted and convicted by the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] for [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|income tax evasion]] and sent to the notorious island prison [[Alcatraz Island|Alcatraz]].

==Birth and early life==
'''''Alphonse Capone''''' was born to Gabriele Capone (1865&amp;ndash;1920) and his wife Teresina &quot;T(h)eresa&quot; Raiola ([[December 28]], [[1867]]&amp;ndash;1952) in [[Brooklyn, New York]], at the turn of the [[20th century]].  Gabriele was a [[barber]] from [[Castellammare di Stabia]], a village about twenty-five kilometers south of [[Naples]], [[Italy]]. Teresina was a [[seamstress]] and the daughter of Angelo Raiola from [[Angri]], a town in the province of [[Salerno]]. The Capones emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1894, and settled in the [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] neighborhood in Brooklyn. 

The couple had seven sons and two daughters:

*Vincenzo Capone (1892&amp;ndash;[[October 1]], [[1952]]).  Called James Vincenzo Capone upon entering the United States. He left the family in 1908 to join a [[Circus (performing art) | circus]] operating in the [[Midwest]]. Served as a [[lieutenant]] in the [[U.S. Army]] during [[World War I]]. Apparently changed his name to Richard Joseph Hart shortly after his discharge. He had a career as a  [[law enforcement officer]], served in the [[Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs]]  and later became [[Marshal]] in [[Homer, Nebraska]].
*Raffaele Capone (1894&amp;ndash;[[November 22]], [[1974]]). Called Ralph upon entering the United States. Later joined his younger brother in Chicago.
*Salvatore Capone (1895&amp;ndash;[[April 1]], [[1924]]). Better known as Frank Capone, he was a representative of his brother in [[Cicero, Illinois]]. Killed by members of the local police reportedly for attempting to draw a gun while they approached him.
*Alphonse Gabriel Capone ([[January 17]], [[1899]]&amp;ndash;[[January 25]], [[1947]]).
*Erminio Capone (1901&amp;ndash;?). Called John or affectionately &quot;Mimi.&quot; Served prison terms for minor offenses such as [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]]. Changed his last name to &quot;Martin.&quot; Reportedly still alive in 1994.
* Umberto Capone (1906&amp;ndash;June, [[1980]]). Called Albert. Employee of the newspaper ''Cicero Tribune'' under the ownership of his brother Al. Changed his last name to Raiola in 1942.
*Amedeo Capone (1908&amp;ndash;[[January 31]], [[1967]]). Called Matthew. [[Tavern]] owner.
*Rose Capone.
*Mafalda Capone.

Alphonse's life of [[crime]] started early: as a teenager he joined two gangs, the Brooklyn Rippers and the Forty Thieves Juniors, and engaged in petty crime.

Capone quit high school at the age of 14 when he fought with a teacher and worked odd jobs around Brooklyn, including a [[candy]] store and a [[bowling alley]].  After his initial stint with small-time gangs, Capone joined the notorious [[Five Points Gang]] headed by [[Frankie Yale|Frankie Yale]].  It was at this time he began working as a [[bartender]] and [[Doorman|bouncer]] at Yale's establishment, the seedy Harvard Inn. It was here, at the Harvard Inn, that Capone would engage in a knife fight with a thug named Frank Gallucio after Capone had made a bold move on Gallucio's sister. Gallucio had deeply slashed Capone's right cheek with a switchblade, earning him the nickname that he would bear for the rest of his life: &quot;Scarface,&quot; a moniker he in fact detested. Capone had instead preferred the nickname &quot;Snorky&quot; which meant &quot;well-dressed&quot; in the slang of the 1920s.

In 1918 Capone married [[Mae Coughlin]], an [[Irish ethnicity|Irish]] girl, who gave him a son that year, [[Sonny Capone|Albert &quot;Sonny&quot; Francis Capone]]. The couple lived in [[Brooklyn]] for a year. In 1919 he lived in [[Amityville]], [[Long Island]], to be close to &quot;Rum Row.&quot; Capone was still working for Frankie Yale and is thought to have committed at least two homicides before he was sent to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] in 1919.  Yale sent his protégé to Chicago after Capone was involved in a fight with a rival gang. Yale's intention was for Capone to &quot;cool off&quot; there; the move primed one of the most notorious crime careers in modern American history.

==Capone in Chicago==
The Capone family moved to a small, unassuming house at 7244 South Prairie Avenue in a [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] suburb that would serve as Al Capone's first headquarters.  Initially, Capone took up grunt work with [[Johnny Torrio]]'s outfit, but the elder Torrio immediately recognized Capone's talents and by 1922 Capone was Torrio's second in command, responsible for much of the [[gambling]], [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], and [[prostitution]] [[Racket (crime) | racket]]s in the city of Chicago. 

Severely injured in an assassination attempt in 1925, the shaken Torrio returned to [[Italy]] and gave the reins of the business to Capone.  Capone was notorious during [[Prohibition]] for his control of the Chicago underworld and his bitter rivalries with gangsters such as [[Bugs Moran]] and [[Hymie Weiss]].  Raking in vast amounts of money from illegal gambling, prostitution, and alcohol (some estimates were that between 1925 and 1930 Capone was making $100 million a year), the Chicago [[kingpin]] was largely immune to prosecution due to [[witness intimidation]] and the bribing of city officials, such as Chicago mayor [[William Hale Thompson|William &quot;Big Bill&quot; Hale Thompson]].  Capone was reputed to have several other retreats and hideouts including [[French Lick, Indiana]], [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]], and [[Johnson City, Tennessee]].

In 1928, Capone bought a retreat on [[Palm Island, Florida|Palm Island]], [[Florida]].  It was shortly after this purchase that he orchestrated seven of the most notorious gangland killings of the century, the 1929 [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre]].  Although details of the massacre are still in dispute, and no person has ever been charged or prosecuted for the crime, the killings are generally linked to Capone and his henchmen, especially [[Jack McGurn|Jack &quot;Machine Gun&quot; McGurn]], who is thought to have led the operation.  By staging the massacre, Capone was trying to dispose of his arch-rival [[Bugs Moran]], who controlled gang operations on the North Side of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]].  Moran himself was late for the meeting and escaped otherwise certain death.

Throughout the 1920s, Capone himself was often the target of attempted murders.

==Fall of Capone== 
Although Capone always did his business through front men and had no accounting records linking him to his earnings, new laws enacted in 1927 allowed the federal government to pursue Capone on [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax evasion]], their best chance of finally convicting him. Pursuing Capone were Treasury agent [[Eliot Ness]] and his hand picked team of incorruptible [[U.S. T   <minor />

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ballroom dance''' is a style of [[partner dance]] which originated in the [[Western world]] and is now enjoyed both [[social dance|socially]] and [[competitive dance|competitively]] around the globe.  Its [[performance dance|performance]] and [[entertainment]] aspects are also widely enjoyed on [[Theater|stage]], in [[film]], and on [[television]].

The term &quot;ballroom dancing&quot; is derived from the word ''[[Ball (dance)|ball]]'', which in turn originates from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''ballare'' which means &quot;to dance&quot;.

The definition of ballroom dance also depends on the era. Balls have featured [[Minuet]], [[Quadrille]], [[Polonaise]], [[Pas de Gras]], [[Mazurka]], and other popular dances of the day, which are considered to be [[historical dance]]s.

In times past, ballroom dancing was &quot;[[Social dance|social dancing]]&quot; for the privileged, leaving &quot;[[folk dancing]]&quot; for the lower classes.  These boundaries have since become blurred, and it should be noted even in times long gone, many &quot;ballroom&quot; dances were really elevated folk dances. 

Ballroom dancing has been in continual use as a social art form since its inception with one exception in the 20th century. Dance historians usually mark the appearance of the ''Twist'' in the mid [[1960s]] as the end of social partner dancing, and they credit what was then called the ''Latin Hustle'' for bringing it back in the late [[1970s]].

[[Image:TangoLesson6.jpg|frame|right|1914 dance illustration]]

==Competitive dancing==

In spite of its historical image as a pastime for the privileged; formal competitions, sometimes referred to as [[DanceSport]], often allow participation by less advanced dancers at various proficiency levels.  

In the United States, amateur dance proficiency levels are defined by [[USA Dance]] (formerly United States Amateur Ballroom Dance Association [USABDA]) as Bronze-&gt;Silver-&gt;Gold for syllabus dancers, and Novice-&gt;Prechampionship-&gt;Championship for open competitors.  These levels roughly correspond to the &quot;E&quot; to &quot;S&quot;  levels in Europe and Australia.  Among professionals, levels classify into Rising Star and Open Professional. 

Eligibility and &quot;leveling up&quot; requirements will vary greatly between countries and sometimes within.  For instance, in addition to USA Dance competitions, amateur dancers in the United States often participate in competitions sanctioned by NDCA or YCN (Youth Collegiate Network), each with its own distinct culture in addition to differing definitions of level and eligibility requirements.

The [[International Olympic Committee]] now recognizes [[competitive dance|competitive]] ballroom dance.  However, it has yet to be included in an [[Olympic Games]] but is among the ones in serious consideration to be added for 2012.

Ballroom dancing competitions in the former USSR also included the [[Soviet Ballroom dances]], or ''Soviet Programme.''  Australian [[New Vogue (dance)|New Vogue]] is danced both competitively and socially. In competition there are 15 recognised New Vogue dances, which are performed by the competitors in sequence.  Internationally, the [[Blackpool Dance Festival]], hosted annually at [[Blackpool]], [[England]], is considered the most prestigious event a dancesport competitior can attend.


==Medal examinations==

[[medal examinations (dance)|Medal examinations]] enable dancers' abilities to be recognized according to conventional standards.  In medal exams, each dancer performs two or more dances in a certain genre (e.g., International Standard) in front of a judge.  In North America, examination levels include Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Each level (i.e. Bronze, Silver, Gold) may be further subdivided into either two or four separate sections.

== Other dances sometimes classified as &quot;ballroom&quot; ==

All dances that are danced competitively are also danced in social settings.  Some of the more popular social dances include [[Nightclub Dance]]s such as [[Lindy Hop]], [[West Coast Swing]], and [[Hustle (dance)|Hustle]].  A number are proudly called [[Street dance]]s.  Nightclub dances are danced differently in different places, and club/street styles differ from the styles taught in ballroom studios.

In Europe, [[Latin Swing]] dances include [[Tango Argentino]], [[Mambo]], Lindy Hop, [[Swing Boogie]] (sometimes also known as [[Nostalgic Boogie]]), and [[Disco Fox]].

[[Country and Western dance]]s are danced both competitively and socially at Country &amp; Western bars, clubs, and ballrooms.  There is also a [[Rock 'n' Roll]] dance variant accepted as a social dance.

A related category is regional social dances. One example is the subcategory of [[Cajun dance]]s that originated in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], with branches reaching both coasts of the [[United States]].

== Rogers and Astaire ==

The on-screen dance pairing of [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] greatly influenced ballroom dancing.  Although both [[actor]]s had independent projects and careers (Astaire had many other partners and Rogers won an [[Academy Award]] for a dramatic role), their filmed dance sequences have reached iconic status.  Much of their work portrayed social dance, although their performances were highly choreographed (often by Astaire or [[Hermes Pan (choreographer)|Hermes Pan]]), meticuously staged, and continually rehearsed.  Ballroom dance historians note their portrayal of early 20th-century dancers [[Vernon and Irene Castle]].

Their work has greatly influenced the American-style ballroom syllabus.  [[Ballroom glossary#American Smooth|American Smooth]]  style was influenced greatly by the work of franchises such as [[Arthur Murray]] and [[Fred Astaire Dance Studios]] where 'Fred &amp; Ginger' classes and workshops remain popular.

== Classic ballroom ==

Classic and [[vintage dance]] societies are dedicated to the performance and preservation of ballroom dances of the past.  These companies perform at special events attired in traditional dance [[costume]].  Some instructors specialize in the dances of one place or time, or in [[fad dance]]s:  short-lived, time-specific dances that may be associated with the music or style of an era (such as [[The Twist]]) or a particular song (such as [[YMCA (song)|YMCA]] or [[Macarena (song)|La Macarena]]).


== Elements of Competition ==

In competition ballroom dancers are judged by multifarious criteria such as connection, frame, posture, speed, proper body alignment, proper usage of weight/ankles/feet, and grooming.  Judging in a performance-oriented sport is inevitably subjective in nature, and controversy and complaints by competitors over judging placements are not uncommon.  The scorekeepers--called [[scrutineers]]--will tally the total number recalls accumulated by each couple through each round until the finals, when the [[Skating system]] is used to place each couple by ordinals, typically 1-6, though the number of couples in the final can vary.

'''''The Birth of a Nation''''' was the most popular film of the silent era. Its innovative techniques made it an important silent film. However, the film glorified slavery, provided historical justification for [[segregation]] and [[disfranchisement]] of [[African American]] people. The message embedded in the film was that [[Reconstruction]] was an unqualified disaster, that African Americans could never be integrated into white society as equals, and that the violent actions of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] were justified because they were necessary to reestablish legitimate and honest government. [http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/slaveryfilm.cfm]

The film is highly controversial but also an influential and innovative [[silent film]] directed by [[D.W. Griffith]], based on [[Thomas Dixon (minister)|Thomas Dixon]]'s novels ''[[The Clansman]]'' (also a play) and ''[[The Leopard's Spots]]''. It was released in [[1915]] and has been credited with securing the future of feature length films (any film over an hour in length) as well as solidifying the codes of film language. The film premiered on [[February 8]], [[1915]] in [[Los Angeles, California]] under the title ''The Clansman'', but was retitled at its world premiere in [[New York]] three months later.

The title was changed from ''The Clansman'' to ''The Birth of a Nation'' to reflect the filmmakers' belief that before the [[American Civil War]], the [[United States]] was a loose coalition of states antagonistic toward each other, and that the Northern victory over the breakaway states in the [[Southern United States|South]] finally bound the states under one national authority.{{ref|1}}  The film's controversy is in its premise that the [[Ku Klux Klan]] arose to restore order to the post-war South, as it was &quot;endangered&quot; by &quot;uncontrollable&quot; [[African American]] denizens and their allies, [[abolitionists]], [[mulatto]]s and [[Carpetbagger|carpetbagging]] [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] politicians from the North. ''The Birth of a Nation'' has been linked to the second emergence of the Ku Klux Klan, which was revived the year of the film's release after a period of virtual non-existence since the [[1870s]].
[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/slaveryfilm.cfm]
Though popular and lucrative, the film drew significant protest upon its release. Premieres of the film were widely protested by the newly founded [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]]. Griffith was surprised by the harsh criticism and tried to address the issues raised in his next major project, ''[[Intolerance (movie)|Intolerance]]''. He later produced the other epic film that glorifies slavery, ''Gone With the Wind.'' 

''Gone With the Wind'' &quot;presented, in the words of one critic, 'a reassuring portrayal of antebellum gentility, racial harmony, and black docility.' Although it did not use white actors in blackface, like ''Birth of a Nation'', its depiction of enslaved African Americans as loyal but scatter-brained house servants and cowering, clumsy field hands conformed to earlier stereotypes.'&quot; [http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/slaveryfilm.cfm]

Until ''[[The Big Parade]]'' surpassed it in [[1925]], ''The Birth of a Nation'' was the highest grossing film, taking in more than $10 million at the box office (what would be $180 million in 2006). It is still studied by film and cultural historians alike, and in 1992 the United States [[Library of Congress]] deemed it &quot;[[culturally significant]]&quot; and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].

==Production==
[[Image:Birth-of-a-nation-klan-and-black-man.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Hooded Klansmen, hiding their faces, catch Gus, a black man whom the filmmaker, in stereotypical fashion, described as &quot;a renegade, a product of the vicious doctrines spread by the carpetbaggers.&quot;]]

''The Birth of a Nation'' pioneered such techniques as [[deep focus]], [[jump-cut]], and facial [[close-up]], which are now considered integral to the industry. It also contains many new cinematic innovations, special effects, and artistic techniques, including a color sequence at the end. It shattered box office records at the time and was also the longest film to date. For these reasons, it was voted one of the &quot;Top 100 American Films&quot; (# 44) by the [[American Film Institute]] in [[1998]].

Griffith based the script on the novel ''[[The Clansman]]'' by [[Thomas Dixon]]. He agreed to pay $10,000 for the rights, but ran out of money and could only afford $2,500 of the original option. For the balance, he offered Dixon 25 percent interest in the picture. Dixon reluctantly agreed. At the time, Dixon's proceeds were the largest sum any author received for a motion-picture story - several million dollars.

Griffith filled the film with anti-black incidents; arrogant freedmen pushing whites off sidewalks, preaching marriage between the races, and killing blacks who remained loyal to their masters. The film's characters are stereotypes: loyal house servants; deluded and ignorant field hands; arrogant mulattoes lusting after Southern white women; and the Ku Klux Klan made up of gallant ex-Confederate officers. [[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/slaveryfilm.cfm ]]

''The Birth of a Nation'' helped to justify the denial of civil rights to African Americans. The turn of the century witnessed the nadir of race relations in the United States. [[Lynching]] was widespread. Race riots directed against African Americans took place in many cities. African Americans in the South were relegated to separate schools, hotels, and restaurants and were denied the right to vote.
[[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/slaveryfilm.cfm ]]

Although the film made use of some black actors, some were played in [[blackface]]. In particular, any actor who was to come in coities of [[rice]], [[tea]] and [[Mustard plant|mustard]]. Although two-thirds of Bangladeshis are farmers, nowadays more than three quarters of Bangadesh's export earnings come from the [[garment industry]] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4118969.stm],
which began attracting foreign investors in the 1980s due to cheap labor and low conversion cost. In 2002, the industry exported $5 billion worth of products. &lt;ref name=&quot;rahs&quot;&gt;Rahman, Shahidur (2004). ''Global Shift: Bangladesh Garment Industry in Perspective'', Asian Affairs, 26(1), pp 75-91.&lt;/ref&gt; The industry now employs more than 3 million workers, 90% of whom are women.&lt;ref name=&quot;begn&quot;&gt;Begum, N (2001). ''Enforcement of Safety Regulations in Garment sector in Bangladesh'', Growth of Garment Industry in Bangladesh: Economic and Social dimension. pp 208-226&lt;/ref&gt; A significant amount of foreign currency earnings also come from the remittances sent by expatriate Bangladeshis living in other countries.

Major impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and floods, inefficient state-owned enterprises, mismanaged [[port]] facilities, a growth in the labor force that has outpaced jobs, inefficient use of energy resources (such as [[natural gas]]), insufficient power supplies, slow implementation of economic reforms, political infighting and [[Political corruption|corruption]]. According to the World Bank's Country Brief updated July, 2005: &quot;Among Bangladesh’s most significant obstacles to growth are poor governance and weak public institutions.&quot; 
[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/BANGLADESHEXTN/0,,menuPK:295769~pagePK:141132~piPK:141107~theSitePK:295760,00.html]

In spite of the hurdles, since 1990 the country has achieved an average annual growth rate of 5% according to the World Bank. The [[middle class]] and the [[consumer]] industry have seen some growth. In December 2005, four years after its report on the emerging &quot;BRIC&quot; economies ([[Brazil]], [[Russia]], [[India]], and [[China]]), [[Goldman Sachs]] named Bangladesh one of the &quot;Next Eleven,&quot; along with [[Egypt]], [[Indonesia]], [[Iran]], [[South Korea]], [[Mexico]], [[Nigeria]], Pakistan, the [[Philippines]], [[Turkey]] and [[Vietnam]]. Bangladesh has seen a sharp increase in [[foreign direct investment]]. A number of multinational corporations, including [[Unocal]] and [[Tata]], have made significant investments, with the [[natural gas]] sector a priority. In December 2005, the Central Bank of Bangladesh projected GDP growth between 6.3% to 6.8%.

One significant contributor to the development of the economy has been the widespread propagation of [[Microcredit]] by [[Muhammad Yunus]] through the [[Grameen Bank]]. Already in late 1990's Grameen Bank had 2.3 million members, with a further 2.5 million members of other similar organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;schm&quot;&gt;Schreiner1, Mark (2003). ''A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh'', Development Policy Review, 21(3), pp 357-382&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Bangladesh}}

Bangladesh has a population of 144 million (July 2005 est.) making it the 7th most populous country in the world. Bangladesh is the one of the [[List of countries by population density|most densely populated countries in the world]] at about 1,000 persons per square kilometre (2,585/sq.&amp;nbsp;mi). In the mid-1980's, the government promoted [[birth control]], which helped to reduce the population growth rate to about 2%. However, Most of the people are relatively young, (the 0-25 age group represents 60 percent of the total population and only 3 percent being 65 or older). Life expectancy rate is 61 years.

Bangladesh is ethnically homogeneous, with Bengalis comprising 98% of the population. The remainder are mostly [[Bihari]] migrants and indegenous tribal groups.  There are 13 tribal groups located in the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]], the most populous of the tribes are the [[Chakma|Chakmas]]. The region has been a source for ethnic tension since the inception of Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=&quot;rashm&quot;&gt; Rashiduzzaman, M (1998). ''Bangladesh's Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord: Institutional Features and Strategic Concerns''. Asian Survey, 38(7), pp. 653-670.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest tribal groups outside the Hill Tracts are the [[Santal|Santhals]] and the [[Garo (tribe)|Garos (Achiks)]].

The main language, as in [[West Bengal]], is [[Bangla]] (Bengali), an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]] of [[Sanskrit]] origin (like [[Hindi]], [[Punjabi]], and [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and others). The language is written in its own [[Bengali script]]. Bangla is the official language of Bangladesh, but [[English language|English]] is widely spoken as a second language among the middle and upper classes, and is often used in official tasks and higher education.

The two major religions practiced in Bangladesh are [[Islam]] (83% [[CIA]] est. 1998, 88% US State Department est. 2005) and [[Hinduism]] (16% CIA est. 1998, 11% US State Dept. 2005). The ethnic Biharis are predominantly [[Shia]] Muslims. There are also some [[Buddhism in Bangladesh|Buddhists]], [[Christianity|Christians]], and [[animism|Animists]].

Health and education levels have improved steadily, poverty levels have gone down. Nevertheless, Bangladesh remains among the poorest nations in the world. Most Bangladeshis are rural and poor, living on subsistence farming. Nearly half of the population lives on less than 1 USD per day. Health problems abound, ranging from [[surface water]] contamination, to [[arsenic]] in the [[ground water]], and diseases including [[malaria]], [[leptospirosis]] and [[dengue]]. Literacy rates are 54% among men and 32% among women.

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Bangladesh}}
Bangladesh has a vibrant culture that encompasses traditions both old and new. The [[Bangla language]] boasts a rich literary heritage, mostly shared by Bangladesh and [[West Bengal]]. The first literary text in Bangla is the seventh century [[Charyapada]]. The medieval ages saw much activity in Bangla literature by poets like [[Alaol]] and [[Chandidas]]. Bangla literature matured in the nineteenth century. The greatest literary icons are [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]]. Rabindranath wrote what was later adopted as Bangladesh's national anthem [[Amar Shonar Bangla]], whereas a song of Nazrul was adopted as the Martial song. Contemporary Bangladesh keeps producing a substantial amount of litearture of all forms. Bangladesh also has a rich tradition in folk literature, evidenced by ''Môemonshingha gitika'', ''Ţhakurmar Jhuli'' or stories related to ''Gopal Bhar'' and ''[[Birbal]]''.

The musical tradition of Bangladesh is lyrics-based (''Baniprodhan''), with minimal instrumental accompaniment. The [[Baul]] tradition is a unique heritage of Bangla folk music, and [[Lalon Fakir]] perhaps the best-known of Bauls. Folk music of Bengal is often accopanied by the [[ektara|êktara]], a string instrument with only one string. Other instruments include the [[dotara]], [[dhol|đhol]], [[khanjan]], and [[tabla]], among others. Bangladesh also has an active heritage in [[Indian classical music|North Indian classical music]]. Perhaps the most famous classical musician from Bangladesh is [[Allauddin Khan|Ustad Allauddin Khan]]. Similarly, Bangladeshi dance forms also draw from folk traditons, specially those of the various tribal groups, as well as the broader Indian dance tradition.

Bangladesh produces about 60 films a year. However Bangladeshis are avid consumers of [[Bollywood]]-made cinema, as well as films from [[Kolkata]], in West Bengal, which has its own thriving Bengali-language movie industry.

==Sports==
{{main|Sports in Bangladesh}}

[[Cricket]] is perhaps the most popular sport in Bangladesh. The Bangladesh cricket team were granted [[test cricket]] status and joined the elite  league of national teams that play [[test cricket|test matches]] in 2000. Other popular sports include [[football]], [[field hockey]], [[tennis]], [[badminton]], [[handball]], [[kabadi]], [[volleyball]], [[chess]], and [[carrom]]. Kabadi (কাবাডি), a 7-on-7 team sport played without a ball or any other equipment, is the national game of Bangladesh. The Bangladesh Sports Control Board was established, and as of 2005 it regulates 29 different sporting federations.

On the international stage, Bangladesh has had its most noteworthy successes in cricket and chess. In 2005, Bangladesh won its first 5-day test match against Zimbabwe and defeated the best team and 2003 world champion Australia in a [[one-day international|one-day match]] in one of the biggest upsets in cricket history. In chess, Bangladesh has had two [[International Grandmaster|Grandmasters]]: [[Niaz Morshed]] and more recently [[Ziaur Rahman]]. Players from Bangladesh have won gold medals in shooting in the [[Commonwealth Games]].

==Education==
[[Image:BUET EME Building.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A view of the Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Building at BUET]]
{{main|Education in Bangladesh}}

The literacy rate in Bangladesh is approximately 41% [http://hdr.undp.org/statistics/data/countries.cfm?c=BGD]. Education in Bangladesh is highly subsidized by the Government, which operates many [[school]]s and colleges at the [[primary school|primary]], [[secondary school|secondary]] and higher secondary level as well as many public [[university|universities]]. To increase the literacy level, many innovative programs have been introduced in the country. Among the most sucessful ones are Food for education (FFE) program introduced in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;ahma&quot;&gt;Ahmed, A and del Nino, C (2002).''The food for education program in Bangladesh: An evaluation of its impact on educational attainment and food security'', FCND DP No. 138, International Food Policy Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt; The Government also greatly subsidises the salaries of teachers in non-government schools. To promote literacy among women, a stipend program for women till the higher secondary level was instituted in 1994. A government-funded program gives incentives like [[stipend]]s and food for continuing education in the secondary level. Administratively, the country is divided into seven education boards (Barishal, Chittagong, Comilla, Dhaka, Jessore, Rajshahi and Sylhet Education Boards) which oversee education from the primary to the higher secondary level, and conduct the primary and junior scholarship examinations, the [[SSC|Secondary School Certificate]] examination, and the [[HSC|Higher Secondary Certificate]] examination. 

[[Higher education]] is also subsidized by the government, and most of the students seeking college education are enrolled in a public instituition. [[Dhaka University]] is the largest and oldest of all the public universities in Bangladesh. The National University regulates all public colleges in the country, hence an undergraduate student at a public college receives a degree from the National University. [[Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology]] (BUET), located in Dhaka, is the foremost instituition for technology in the country. There are newer universities in Chittagong, Khulna, Gazipur, Rajshahi and Sylhet that also provide engineering education. Public education in medical sciences is provided by Medical Colleges, each regulated by a public university. Postgraduate education in medical sciences is provided by BSMM University in Dhaka. [[Bangladesh Agricultural University]] in [[Mymensingh]] is the premier institution for agricultural studies, though other institutes exists as well. There are also a number of polytechnic institutes providing diplomas in specific technologies. Bangladesh also has a [[leather]] institute, a textile institute and other specialized education centers. Since the 1990's, higher education has boomed with the introduction of private universities. There are many private universities providing general, engineering and medical education.

Notable reseach institutions include [[BRRI|Bangladesh Rice Research Institute]] and [http://www.icddrb.org/ International Center for Diarrhoeal Disease Research].

==Holidays==
{{further|[[Public holidays in Bangladesh]]}}

Bangladesh has eleven National Holidays, based on three separate calendars: [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]], [[Islamic calendar|Islamic]], and [[Bengali calendar|Bengali]] calendars.

{{Barbados infobox}}
'''Barbados''' is an [[island nation]] located towards the east of the [[Caribbean Sea]] and in the west of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], part of the eastern islands of the [[Lesser Antilles]], with the nations of [[Saint Lucia]] and [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] being its closest neighbours. The island is  430 [[square kilometre]]s, (166 [[square mile|sq.&amp;nbsp;mi]]), and is primarily low-lying, with some higher areas in the island's interior. It is located 13° north of the [[Equator]] and 59° west of the [[Prime Meridian]], about 434.5 [[kilometre]]s (270 [[mile|mi]]) northeast of [[Venezuela]].

Barbados is predominantly composed of [[coral]] and [[limestone]]. It is tropical with constant [[trade wind]]s and contains of some [[marsh]]es and [[mangrove]] [[swamp]]s. Some parts of the island's interior are also dotted with large sugarcane estates and wide [[pastures]] with many good views to the sea.

Barbados has one of the highest standards of living and literacy rates in the world and, according to the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), is currently the No. 1 developing country in the world. The island is a major tourist destination.

==History==
{{main|History of Barbados}}
The earliest inhabitants of Barbados were [[Amerindian]] nomads. Three waves of migrants moved north toward [[North America]]. The first wave was of the [[Saladoid]]-[[Barrancoid]] group, who were farmers, fishermen, and ceramists that arrived by [[canoe]] from [[South America]] ([[Venezuela]]'s [[Orinoco River|Orinoco Valley]]) around [[350|350 CE]]. The [[Arawak]] people were the second wave of migrants, arriving from South America around [[800|800 CE]]. Arawak settlements on the island include [[Stroud Point]], [[Chandler Bay]], [[Saint Luke's Gully]], and [[Mapp's Cave]]. According to accounts by descendants of the aboriginal Arawak tribes on other local islands, the original name for Barbados was '''Ichirouganaim'''. In the 13th century, the Caribs arrived from South America in the third wave, displacing both the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid. For the next few centuries, the Caribs&amp;mdash;like the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid&amp;mdash;lived in isolation on the island.

The name &quot;Barbados&quot; comes from a [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese explorer]] named Pedro Campos in [[1536]], who originally called the island '''Los Barbados''' (&quot;The Bearded Ones&quot;), upon seeing the appearance of the island's [[fig]] trees, whose long hanging aerial roots he thought resembled beards. Between Campos' sighting in 1536 and 1550, [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish]] [[conquistadors]] seized many Caribs on Barbados and used them as [[Slavery|slave labor]] on [[plantation]]s. Other Caribs fled the island, moving elsewhere.

British sailors who landed on Barbados in the 1620s at the site of present-day [[Holetown]] on the Caribbean coast found the island uninhabited. From the arrival of the first British settlers in [[1627]]&amp;ndash;[[1628]] until independence in [[1966]], Barbados was under uninterrupted British control. Nevertheless, Barbados always enjoyed a large measure of local autonomy. Its [[Barbados House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] began meeting in [[1639]]. Among the initial important British figures was Sir [[William Courten]].

Large numbers of [[Celts |Celtic]] people, mainly from [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]], went to Barbados as [[indentured servants]]. Over the next several centuries the Celtic population was used as a buffer between the [[Anglo-Saxon]] plantation owners and the larger [[African]] population, variously serving as members of the Colonial militia and playing a strong role as allies of the larger African slave population in a long string of colonial rebellions. The modern descendants of this original slave population are sometimes derisively referred to as [[Red Legs]] and are some of the poorest inhabitants of modern Barbados. There has also been large scale intermarriage between the African and Celtic populations on the islands. Because the Africans could withstand tropical diseases and the climate much better than the white slave population, and also because those poor whites who had or acquired the means to emigrate often did so, Barbados turned from mainly Celtic in the 17th century to overwhelmingly black by the 20th century.

As the [[sugar]] industry developed into the main commercial enterprise, Barbados was divided into large plantation estates that replaced the small holdings of the early British settlers. Some of the displaced farmers relocated to British colonies in North America, most notably [[South Carolina]]. To work the plantations, West Africans were transported and enslaved on Barbados and other Caribbean islands. The [[slave trade]] ceased in 1804. Thirty years later slavery was abolished in the British Empire in [[1834]]. In Barbados and the rest of the British West Indian colonies, full emancipation from slavery was preceded by an apprenticeship period that lasted six years.

Plantation owners and merchants of British descent dominated local politics. It was not until the 1930s that the descendants of emancipated stes]], [[Europe Asian Economic Community]] and [[Union of Russia and Belarus|Union with Russia]]. After 1990 with the introduction of free market structures the economics production was decreasing. The economics growths started again in 1996, so that by 2001 the industrial production and agricultural production came back to the level of 1990 and since then further rise.
The GDP (PPP) of the year 2005 is $77.77 billion (estimate), which results in approximately $7,600 dollar per head. In the year 2005 the [[GDP]] increase approximately to 8-9%, with inflation rate laying on the level of 10%. Besides Belarus has the highest standard of living under all CIS states according to [[United Nations|UN]], the average monthly income grew from 20 [[USD]] to 225 within last 10 years. 
The [[unemployment rate]], according to data of Belarusian government, was about 2 % in 2005. However, experts have said that the country may have a  higher rate than 2 %. The other sticking point in the Belarusian economy is the legal currency inside the country. Since leaving the Soviet Union, the [[Belarusian ruble]] (BYR) was used as the national currency. However, due to the Union of Russia and Belarus, there was an issue about using the [[Russian ruble]] (RUB) as the currency of both Russia and Belarus. According to Russian newspaper [[ITAR-TASS]], the Belarusian ruble will be discarded and the Russian ruble will become the official currency of Belarus starting on [[January 1]] [[2008]].

==Demographics==
[[Image:Belarus-demography.png|thumb|230px|Change in the population of Belarus (1992-2003)]]
{{main|Demographics of Belarus}}
The majority of the [[population]] of Belarus are native [[Belarusians]], who comprise 81.2 % of the total population of 10,300,483 people. [[Russians]] are the second largest group making up 11.4 % of the population. The [[Polish people|Poles]] and [[Ukrainians]] account for 3.9 and 2.4 % of the population, respectively. 

Languages commonly spoken in Belarus are [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], which are both official languages of Belarus. 

The population density is about 50 persons per [[square kilometer]] (127/sq.&amp;nbsp;mi) and 71.7 % of the total population lives in [[Urbanization|urban]] areas. Of the urban population, 24 % live in Minsk, the national capital and largest city.{{ref|demographics}} 

Most of the population, 69.5 %, are between the ages of 14 and 64. Sixteen percent of the population is under 14 years, while 14.6 % are age 65 or older. The median age of the population is 37. The average life expectancy for Belarusian citizens is 68.72 years; for males it is 63.03 years and for females it is 74.96 years. 

The literacy rate in Belarus, which is the number of people aged 15 and older who can read and write, is at 99 %, with men at 99.8%, and women at 99.3%. The male-to-female ratio in 2005 was estimated to be .88 males to every female. 

Most demographic indicators for Belarus resemble other European countries, notably with both the population growth rate and the natural growth rate in the negative. The population growth is currently at &amp;minus;0.09%{{inote|CIA Factbook}} in 2005, with a fertility rate of 1.39. The population is also growing older, and by the year 2050, the majority of the population will be over the age of 50.{{ref|census}}  The migration rate is +2.42 for every 1 000 people in Belarus.

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Belarus}}
[[Image:Brest Kirche.jpg|thumb|Russian Orthodox church in Brest, Belarus]]
Traditional Belarusian dress originates from the time of [[Kievan Rus]] and over time was under the influence of cultures of neighbors: Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Russians, and other European nations. Aside from its predominantly Ruthenian roots, [[Belarusian cuisine]] is very close to Lithuanian. It is sometimes considered as somewhat less rich and impressive than those of its imposing neighbors. In fact, however, this may result from the general lack of national identity which still continues to hold back the development of a nation and also led to the loss of many culinary traditions in the last 100 years. 

Certain aspects of the Belarusian culture have been lost over time because of the [[Russification]] period. President Lukashenko has introduced laws that force [[radio]] and [[television]] stations to showcase a percentage of Belarusian talent daily, but it does not state that the performance has to be in the Belarusian or Russian language. The said radio and television stations are state-owned, mostly controlled by the [[National State Teleradiocompany]] (TVR).

The Belarusian government sponsors many annual cultural festivals: &quot;Slavonic Bazaar in Vitebsk&quot;; &quot;Minsk Spring&quot;; &quot;Slavonic Theatrical Meetings&quot;; International Jazz Festival; National Harvesting Festival; &quot;Arts for Children and Youth&quot;; the Competition of Youth Variety Show Arts; &quot;Muses of Niesvizh&quot;; &quot;Mir Castle&quot;; and the National Festival of the Belarusian Song and Poetry. These events showcase talented Belarusian performers, whether it is in [[music]], [[art]], [[poetry]], [[dance]] or [[theater]]. At these festivals, various prizes named after Soviet and Belarusian heroes are awarded for excellence in music or art. Several state holidays, like [[Independence Day]] or [[Victory Day]] draw big crowds and include various displays such as [[fireworks]] and [[Military of Belarus|military]] parades. Most of the festivals take place in Vitebsk or Minsk.{{ref|festivals}}

Belarus has four [[World Heritage Sites]], two of them shared between Belarus and its neighbors. The four are: the [[Mir Castle Complex]]; the [[Niasvizh Castle]]; the [[Belovezhskaya Pushcha]] (shared with [[Poland]]); and the [[Struve Geodetic Arc]] (shared with [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Norway]], [[Moldova]], Russia, [[Sweden]] and Ukraine). {{ref|UNESCO}}

'''Belize''' is a small nation on the eastern coast of [[Central America]], on the [[Caribbean Sea]] bordered by [[Mexico]] to the northwest and [[Guatemala]] to the west and south. The country is a [[parliamentary democracy]] and [[constitutional monarchy]] which recognizes [[Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as Sovereign.  The nation of [[Honduras]] lies 75 [[kilometre|km]] away (47&amp;nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) across the [[Gulf of Honduras]] to the east. The name is derived from the [[Belize River]] which [[Belize City]], the former capital and largest city, is also named after. In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] it is usually called ''Belice''. Known as [[British Honduras]] until 1973, Belize was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[colonialism|colony]] for more than a century. It became an independent nation in 1981. Belize is a member of [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) and the [[Sistema de Integracion Centro Americana]] (SICA) and considers itself to be both [[Caribbean]], and [[Central American]]. 

== History ==
''Main article: [[History of Belize]]''
[[Image:Xunantunich1976.jpg|thumb|left|Xunantunich, Belize]]

The [[Maya civilization]] spread over Belize between [[1500 BC]] and [[Anno Domini|AD]] 300 and flourished until about AD 900. 

The first [[Europe]]ans arrived in the area in the early [[16th century]] and settlement began with British [[privateer]]s and [[shipwreck]]ed [[England|English]] seamen as early as 1638. 

The origin of the name '''Belize''' is not clear but one explanation is that it derives from the Spanish [[pronunciation]] of Wallace, the name of the pirate who created the first settlement in Belize in 1638.  Another possibility is that the name is from the Maya word belix, meaning &quot;muddy water&quot;, applied to the Belize River.

The early &quot;settlement of Belize in the Bay of Honduras&quot; grew from a few habitations located at Belize Town and St George's Caye, into a de-facto colony of the [[United Kingdom]] during the late [[18th century]].  In the early [[19th century]], the settlement was called the British Honduras, and in 1862 it became a Crown Colony.

[[Hurricane]] [[Hattie]] inflicted significant damage upon Belize in 1961.  The government decided that a coastal capital city lying below sea level was too [[risk]]y.  Over several years, the British colonial government designed a new capital [[Belmopan]] at the exact geographic centre of the country, and in 1970 began slowly moving the governing offices there.

British Honduras became a [[self-governing colony]] in January 1964 and was renamed ''Belize'' in June 1973; it was the United Kingdom's last colony on the American mainland.  [[George Cadle Price|George Price]] led the country to full independence on [[21 September]], [[1981]] after delays caused by territorial disputes with neighbouring [[Guatemala]], which did not formally recognise the country until 1992.

Throughout Belize's history, [[Guatemala]] has claimed ownership of all or part of the territory.  This claim is occasionally reflected in [[map]]s showing Belize as Guatemala's most eastern [[province]].  As of 2005, the border dispute with Guatemala remains unresolved and quite contentious, at various times the issue has involved mediation assistance from the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Caribbean Community|CARICOM]] heads of Government.  Since independence, a British garrison has been retained in Belize at the request of the Belizean Government. Notably, both Guatemala and Belize are participating in the confidence building measures, including the Guatemala-Belize Language Exchange Project (for more information see: www.guatemalabelize.com ).

Belize was recently the site of [[2005 Belize unrest|unrest]] directed at the country's ruling party concerning tax increases in the national budget.

== Politics ==
[[Image:Protest 0082.JPG|thumb|Belizian protests, 21st January 2005]]
''Main article: [[Politics of Belize]]''

Belize is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[democracy]] and a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The [[head of state]] is currently [[Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], represented in the country by a [[governor-general]], who must be a Belizean. 

The primary [[executive (government)|executive]] organ of government is the [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]], led by a [[Prime Minister of Belize|prime minister]] who is [[head of government]]. Cabinet ministers are members of the majority political party in parliament and usually hold elected seats within it concurrently with their cabinet positions.

The bicameral Belizean [[parliament]] is the National Assembly, which consists of a [[House of Representatives]] and a [[Senate]]. The 29 members of the House are popularly elected to a maximum 5-year term. Of the Senate's eight members, five are chosen by the prime minister, two by the leader of the opposition, and one by the governor general on the advice of the Belize Advisory Council. The Senate is headed by a president, who is a nonvoting member appointed by the governing party.

Belize is a full participating member of the [[Caribbean Community|Caribbean Community (CARICOM)]].

== Districts ==
[[Image:BelizeNumbered.png|125px|framed|]]
:''Main article: [[Districts of Belize]]''

Belize consists of six districts:
# [[Belize District]] 
# [[Cayo District]]
# [[Corozal District]]
# [[Orange Walk District]]
# [[Stann Creek District]]
# [[Toledo District]]

== Geography ==
[[Image:Belize_map.png|thumb|left|Map of Belize]]
''Main article: [[Geography of Belize]]''

Belize is located between the [[Hondo River|Hondo]] and [[Sarstoon River]]s, with the [[Belize River]] flowing down in the centre of the country.  The north of Belize consists mostly of flat, swampy coastal plains, in places heavily forested.  The south contains the low [[mountain range]] of the [[Maya Mountains]], whose [[Victoria Peak]] is the highest point in Belize at 1,160 [[metre]]s (3,806&amp;nbsp;[[foot (unit of length|ft]]).  The [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast is lined with a [[coral reef]] and islands known locally as ''cayes'', pronounced &quot;keys&quot;.  Belize is home to the longest barrier reef in the western hemisphere and the second longest in the world after the [[Great Barrier Reef]].

The [[climate]] is [[Tropics|tropical]] and generally very hot and humid.  The rainy season lasts from May to November and [[hurricane]]s and [[flood]]s are frequent natural hazards.

== Economy ==
''Main article: [[Economy of Belize]]''
[[Image:Belize farming gm.jpg|thumb|right|The majority of the Belizean economy is comprised of the tourism industry.  Agriculture is also key part of the economy.]]
The small, essentially private enterprise economy is based primarily on [[agriculture]], agro-based industry, and merchandising, with [[tourism]] (especially scuba diving) and construction assuming greater importance. [[Sugar]], the chief crop, accounts for nearly half of exports, while the [[banana]] industry is the country's largest employer. [[Citrus production]] has become a major industry along the [[Hummingbird Highway]].

The government's expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, initiated in September 1998, led to [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] growth of 6.4% in 1999 and 10.5% in 2000. Growth decelerated in 2001 to 3% due to the global slowdown and severe [[hurricane]] damage to agriculture, [[fishing]] and tourism. Major concerns continue to be the rapidly expanding [[trade deficit]] and foreign debt. A key short-term objective remains the reduction of [[poverty]] with the help of international donors.

== Demographics ==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Belize]]''

Though Belize's population is 283,000 (July 2005 est.), emigration is relatively high. Approximately 105,000 Belizeans currently live abroad (mostly in the United States). Most Belizeans are of multiracial and multiethnic descent. However, for census purposes as well as Belizean custom, people are usually recognized by their father's ethnicity. About 49% are of mixed Maya and European descent (Mestizo). The first mestizos to settle in [[Belize]] were Mexicans fleeing from the [[Caste War of Yucatán|Caste War]] of the [[Yucatan]] Peninsula in 1847-48. They founded the town of [[Corozal]] (1849) near the ancient ruins of Santa Rita and their descendants can be found living today. A second and larger mestizo migration took place during the 1980’s with the arrival of thousands of refugees from [[Guatemala]], and [[El Salvador]]. Until the early 1980’s, Belizean Creole constituted 70% of the population, but today they are about 25% of the population. This was due to refugees coming in from neighboring countries as well as emigration of thousands of Creoles. Creoles are descendants of African slaves brought primarily from Jamaica and Nicaragua’s Miskito Coast to cut down mahogany trees. Because of a lack of [[Europe]]an women, their [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] slave owners would take female slaves as child bearers and this union created The Creole people and culture. Though no longer the majority, Creole culture is still dominant in Belize (especially [[Belize City]]). The indigenous Mayas make up about 10% of the population. The [[Garifuna]] or (Garinagu) are descendants of Africans as well as Carib and Arawakan Amerindians and make up 6%. In the early 1600’s at least two thousand escaped their Spanish captives on the Island of San Vicente (what is now [[Saint Vincent]]) . They are said to have never been slaves and they have retained many of their cultures and customs that support this. When the British took control of the island, the “Red” Caribs were mostly killed off, and the “Black” Caribs were deported to Roatan Bay in Honduras. Many settled in [[Guatemala]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Belize]]. The rest of the population are Chinese, East Indian, and North American peoples.

The official language of Belize is [[English language|English]] and sole language of instruction in its school systems. Around 80% of the population is literate in English and as much as 90% of the population is able to speak some English. The most common language however is [[Belizean Kriol language|Kriol]] (Belizean Creole). Kriol is the [[lingua franca]] in much of the country and is spoken by nearly everyone in Belize as either a first- or second-language (95% o(SACU), comprising Botswana, [[Lesotho]], [[Swaziland]], and South Africa, dates from 1910, and is the world&amp;#8217;s oldest customs union. [[Namibia]] joined in 1990. Under this arrangement,  South Africa has collected [[levies]] from customs, sales, and excise duties for all five members, sharing out proceeds based on each country's portion of imports.  The exact formula for sharing revenues and the decision-making authority over duties &amp;mdash; held exclusively by the Government of South Africa &amp;mdash; became increasingly controversial, and the members renegotiated the arrangement in 2001.  The new structure has now been formally ratified and a SACU Secretariat has been established in [[Windhoek]], Namibia.  Following South Africa's accession to the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), Botswana also joined; many of the SACU duties are thus declining, making products from outside the area more competitive in Botswana. Currently the SACU countries and the U.S. are negotiating a free trade agreement. Botswana is currently also negotiating a free trade agreement with [[Mercosur]] and an Economic Partnership Agreement with the [[European Union]] as part of SADC.

Botswana's currency &amp;mdash; the [[Pula (currency)|Pula]] &amp;mdash; is fully convertible and is valued against a basket of currencies heavily weighted toward the South African [[Rand (currency)|Rand]].  Profits and direct investment can be repatriated without restriction from Botswana.  The Botswana Government eliminated all exchange controls in 1999.  The Central Bank devalued the Pula by 7.5% in February 2004 in a bid to maintain export competitiveness against the real appreciation of the Pula. There was a further 12% devalution in May 2005 and the policy of a &quot;crawling peg&quot; was adopted.

Most (70%) of Botswana's electricity is imported from South Africa's [[Eskom]]. 80% of domestic production is concentrated in one plant, [[Morupule Power Station]] near [[Palapye]].

[[Gaborone]] is host to the headquarters of the 14 nation [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), a successor to the [[Southern African Development Coordination Conference]](SADCC-launched in 1980), which focused its efforts on freeing regional economic development from dependence on apartheid South Africa.  SADC embraced the newly democratic South Africa as a member in 1994 and has a broad mandate to encourage growth, development, and economic integration in Southern Africa.  SADC's Trade Protocol, which was launched on September 1, 2000, calls for the elimination of all tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade by 2008 among the 11 signatory countries. If successful, it will give Botswana companies free access to the far larger regional market.  SADC's failure to distance itself from the [[Robert Mugabe|Mugabe]] government in [[Zimbabwe]] has diminished the number of opportunities for cooperation between the U.S. and SADC.

===Government Funding for Local Businesses===
In 1996, the government set up the FAP (Financial Assistance Policy), the purpose of which was to help citizens set up businesses, and thus encourage employment and diversification of industry. This has undergone several revisions due to the need for a a balance between an easy to understand policy, and the need for fraud prevention. The policy is currently known as CEDA(Citizens Entrepeneurial Development Association) *[http://www.mti.gov.bw/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=54&amp;lang=en ]

===Transport and communications ===
Despite being a sparsely populated, semi-arid country about the size of [[Texas]] or [[France]], Botswana has managed to incorporate much of its interior into the national economy. An &quot;inner circle&quot; highway connecting all major towns and district capitals is completely paved, and the all-weather [[Trans-Kalahari Highway]] connects the country (and, through it, South Africa's commercially dominant [[Gauteng Province]]) to [[Walvis Bay]] in Namibia. A [[fiber-optic]] telecommunications network has been completed in Botswana connecting all major population centers. In November, 2003 representatives of Botswana, Namibia and South Africa signed an MOU to simplify documentation to move cargoes to and from the Port of Walvis Bay in Namibia.

International flights usually arrive at [[Sir Seretse Khama International Airport]] just outside Gaborone.

In addition to the government-owned newspaper and national radio network, there is an active, independent press (seven weekly newspapers). Two privately owned radio stations began operations in 1999. In 2000, the government-owned Botswana Television (BTV) was launched, which is Botswana's first national television station. GBC is a commercially owned television station that broadcast programs to the Gaborone area only. Foreign publications are sold without restriction in Botswana, and there are 18 commercial Internet service providers. Two cellular phone providers cover most of the country.

In 2006, an electrified railway connecting Botswana and [[Lüderitz]], [[Namibia]] was proposed to carry coal and other minerals.

===Tourism===
Tourism plays a role in Botswana.  A number of national parks and game reserves, with their abundant wildlife, are a top draw for tourists.

==Labour==
Botswana is in the process or formulating an Action Programme on the Elimination of [[Child labour in Botswana|Child Labour]], which is expected to be adopted in the period 2006-2007.

==Defense==
At the time of independence Botswana had no armed forces. It was only after attacks from the Rhodesian army that Botswana formed a [[Botswana Defence Force]] (BDF) in self-defence in [[1977]]. The [[President of Botswana|president]] is commander in chief and a defence council is appointed by the president. The BDF  now has approximately 12,000 members.

The BDF is a capable and well-disciplined military force. Following positive political changes in [[South Africa]] and the region, the BDF's missions have increasingly focused on anti-poaching activities, disaster-preparedness, and foreign peacekeeping. The United States has been the largest single foreign contributor to the development of the BDF, and a large segment of its officer corps has received U.S. training. It is considered an apolitical and professional institution.

==Foreign relations==
Botswana puts a premium on economic and political integration in Southern Africa. It seeks to make SADC a working vehicle for economic development, and promotes efforts to make the region self-policing in terms of preventative diplomacy, conflict resolution, and good governance. It has welcomed post-apartheid South Africa as a partner in these efforts. Botswana joins the African [[consensus]] on most major international matters and is a member of international organisations such as the [[United Nations]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and the [[African Union]] (AU).

'''Bouvet Island''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''Bouvetøya'') is an uninhabited sub-[[antarctic]] volcanic [[island]] in the South [[Atlantic Ocean]], south-southwest of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] ([[South Africa]]). It is a dependent area of [[Norway]] and is ''not'' subject to the [[Antarctic Treaty]].

== Geography ==

Bouvet Island is located at {{coor dm|54|26|S|3|24|E|}}. It is 58.5&amp;nbsp;[[square kilometre|km²]] (22.6&amp;nbsp;[[square mile]]s) in area, 93% of which is covered by [[glacier]]s which block the south and east coasts. 
It has no ports or harbors, only offshore anchorages, and is difficult to approach. The glaciers form a thick ice layer falling in high cliffs into the sea or onto the black beaches of [[volcanic]] sand. The 29.6&amp;nbsp;[[Kilometer|km]] (18.4&amp;nbsp;[[mile]]s) of coastline are often surrounded by an ice pack. The highest point on the island is called ''Olavtoppen'', whose peak is 780&amp;nbsp;[[metre|m]] (2,600&amp;nbsp;[[foot (length)|ft]]) above sea level. A [[lava]] shelf on the island's west coast, which appeared between [[1955]] and [[1958]], provides a nesting site for birds.

Bouvet Island is a candidate for the most remote island in the world, along with other small isolated islands such as [[Tristan da Cunha]], [[Easter Island]] and the [[Pitcairn Island]]s. The nearest land is [[Queen Maud Land]], Antarctica, over 1,600 km (1,000 miles) away to the south, which is itself uninhabited.

== History ==

[[Bouvet Island]] was discovered on [[January 1]], [[1739]], by [[Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier]], who commanded the [[France|French]] ships ''Aigle'' and ''Marie''.  However, the island's position was not accurately fixed and Bouvet did not circumnavigate his discovery, so it remained unclear whether it was an island or part of a continent.

The island was not sighted again until [[1808]], when it was spotted by one Lindsay, the captain of the Enderby Company whaler ''Swan''.  Though he didn't land, he was the first to correctly fix the island's position.

The first successful landfall dates to December [[1822]], when Captain Benjamin Morrell of the sealer ''Wasp'' landed, hunting for [[seal (mammal)|seal]]s.  He was successful and took several seal skins. 

On December 10, [[1825]], one Captain Norris, master of the Enderby Company whalers ''Sprightly'' and ''Lively'', landed on the island, named it ''Liverpool Island'', and claimed it for the [[British Crown]].

In [[1898]], the [[Germany|German]] ''Valdivia'' expedition of [[Carl Chun]] visited the island but didn't land. 

The first extended stay on the island was in [[1927]], when the [[Norway|Norwegian]] &quot;Norvegia&quot; crew stayed for about a month; this is the basis for the territorial claim by [[Norway]], who have named the island Bouvetøya (Bouvet Island in Norwegian). The island was [[Annexation|annexed]] on [[December 1]] [[1927]], by a Royal Norwegian Decree of [[January 23]] [[1928]], Bouvetøya became a Norwegian Territory. The [[United Kingdom]] waived its claim in favor of Norway the following year. In [[1930]] a Norwegian act was passed that made the island a dependent area subject to the [[sovereignty]] of the Kingdom (but not a part of the Kingdom).

In [[1964]], an abandoned [[lifeboat]] was discovered on the island, along with various supplies; however, the lifeboat's passengers were never found.

In [[1971]], Bouvet Island and the adjacent territorial waters were designated a nature reserve.  The island remains uninhabited, although an automated [[weather station]] was set up there in [[1977]] by the Norwegians.

On [[September 22]], [[1979]], a [[satellite]] recorded a flash of light (which was later interpreted as having been caused by a [[nuclear bomb]] explosion or natural event such as a [[meteor]]) in a stretch of the southern [[Indian Ocean]] between Bouvet Island and [[Prince Edward Islands]].  This detonation, since dubbed the [[Vela Incident]], scattered radioactive debris over a wide area (it was detected by scientists in the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]]).  No country has ever admitted responsibility for the test, though suspects include [[South Africa]], [[Israel]] and [[Taiwan]].

Despite being uninhabited, Bouvet Island has the [[Internet]] [[country code]] [[top-level domain]] ([[ccTLD]]) [[.bv]], though it is [http://www.norid.no/domenenavnbaser/bv-sj.html not used].  A handful of [[amateur radio]] expeditions have gone to this remote location ([[call sign]]s used here begin with ''3Y'').  Bouvet Island falls within the UTC Z [[time zone]].  ''Atlantic/St_Helena'' is the zone used in the time zone database.

==Bouvet Island in fiction==
[[Image:Bouvet island 0.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Southeast coast of Bouvet Island, 1898]]

Bouvet, redundantly called &quot;Bouvetøya Island,&quot; was the setting of the [[2004]] movie ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]''.  It also figured prominently in the book, ''A Grue Of Ice'', by [[Geoffrey Jenkins]].

'''Negara Brunei Darussalam''', more commonly referred to as the '''Sultanate of Brunei''' or simply '''Brunei''', is a country located on the [[island]] of [[Borneo]], in [[southeast Asia]]. Apart from its coastline with the [[South China Sea]], it is completely surrounded by [[East Malaysia]]. The [[Petroleum ]] and [[natural gas|gas]]-rich Brunei is a member of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) and the (British) [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

== History ==
[[Image:Brunei3.jpg|thumb|250px|Location of Brunei on Borneo, shown &lt;font color=green&gt;in green&lt;/font&gt;.]]
{{main|History of Brunei}}

The [[Sultanate]] of Brunei was very powerful from the [[14th century|14th]] through the [[16th century]]. Its realm covered the southern [[Philippines]], [[Sarawak]] and [[Sabah]]. [[Europe]]an influence gradually brought an end to this [[regional power]]. Later, there was a brief war with [[Spain]] in which Brunei was victorious. The [[19th century]] however saw Brunei losing much of its territory to the [[White Rajahs]] of Sarawak.

There was a small [[rebellion]] against the [[monarchy]] during the [[1960s]], which was prevented by the [[United Kingdom]]. This event became known as the [[Brunei Revolt]] and was partly responsible for the failure to create the [[North Borneo Federation]]. The rebellion also affected Brunei's decision to opt out of the [[Malaysia|Malaysian Federation]]. Brunei was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[protectorate]] from [[1888]] to [[1984]].

[[Hassanal Bolkiah|Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah]] of Brunei, whose [[List of Sultans of Brunei|title has passed within the same dynasty]] since the [[15th century]], is the head of state and head of governs a beneficiary of the U.S.-[[Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act]] (CBTPA), Canada's [[CARIBCAN]] program, and the European Union's Lome IV Agreement. Although the Bahamas participates in the political aspects of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), it has not entered into joint economic initiatives with other Caribbean states.

The Bahamas has a few notable industrial firms: the Freeport pharmaceutical firm, PFC Bahamas (formerly Syntex), which recently streamlined its production and was purchased by the Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche; the BORCO oil facility, also in Freeport, which transships oil in the region; the Commonwealth Brewery in Nassau, which produces Heineken, Guinness, and Kalik beers; and Bacardi Corp., which distills rum in Nassau for shipment to the U.S. and European markets. Other industries include sun-dried sea salt in Great Inagua, a wet dock facility in Freeport for repair of cruise ships, and mining of aragonite--a type of limestone with several industrial uses-- from the sea floor at Ocean Cay.

The Hawksbill Creek Agreement established a duty-free zone in Freeport, The Bahamas' second-largest city, with a nearby industrial park to encourage foreign industrial investment. The [[Hong Kong]]-based firm, [[Hutchison Whampoa]], has opened a container port in Freeport. The Bahamian Parliament approved legislation in 1993 that extended most Freeport tax and duty exemptions through 2054.

The Bahamas is largely an [[import]], [[service economy]]. There are about 110 U.S.-affiliated businesses operating in The Bahamas, and most are associated with [[tourism]] and [[banking]]. With few domestic resources and little industry, The Bahamas imports nearly all its food and manufactured goods from the United States. American goods and services tend to be favored by Bahamians due to cultural similarities and heavy exposure to American advertising.

==Business Environment==
The Bahamas offers attractive features to the potential investor: a stable democratic environment, relief from personal and corporate income taxes, timely repatriation of corporate profits, proximity to the U.S. with extensive air and [[telecommunication]]s links, and a good pool of skilled professional workers. The Government of The Bahamas welcomes foreign [[investment]] in tourism and banking and has declared an interest in agricultural and industrial investments to generate local employment, particularly in white-collar or skilled jobs. Despite its interest in foreign investment to diversify the economy, the Bahamian Government responds to local concerns about foreign competition and tends to protect Bahamian business and labor interests. As a result of domestic resistance to foreign investment and high labor costs, growth can stagnate in sectors which the government wishes to diversify.

The country's infrastructure is best developed in the principal cities of Nassau and Freeport, where there are relatively good paved roads and international airports. Electricity is generally reliable, although many businesses have their own backup generators. In Nassau, there are two daily newspapers, three weeklies, and several international newspapers available for sale. There also are five radio stations. Both Nassau and Freeport have a television station. Cable TV also is available locally and provides most American programs with some Canadian and European channels.

==Areas of Opportunity==
The best U.S. export opportunities remain in the traditional areas of foodstuffs and manufactured goods: vehicles and [[automobile parts]]; [[hotel]], [[restaurant]], and [[medical]] supplies; and [[computer]]s and electronics. Bahamian tastes in consumer products roughly parallel those in the U.S. With approximately 85% of the population of primarily [[African]] descent, there is a large and growing market in the Bahamas for &quot;ethnic&quot; personal care products. Merchants in southern [[Florida]] have found it profitable to advertise in Bahamian publications. Most imports in this sector are subject to high but nondiscriminatory tariffs.

The Bahamas also associates closely with other nations of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM). The Bahamas has diplomatic relations with [[Cuba]], although not with resident ambassadors. A repatriation agreement was signed with Cuba in [[1996]], and there are commercial and cultural contacts between the two countries.

The turbulent history of [[Belarus]], as well as its close relationship with [[Russia]], have played a large role in its military structure and deployment. The armed forces of Belarus consist of the [[Army]] and the [[Air Force]], all under the command of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Belarus.

== Organization ==
[[Image:Ministry of Defense Republic of Belarus.jpg|thumb|130px|Symbol of the [[Belarusian Ministry of Defense]].]]

Prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union there were 180,000 Russian soldiers stationed in Belarus, who answered directly to Moscow High Command and not Belarusian Military Commanders. In May 1992 the Military District of Belarus was abolished, and on [[1 January]], [[1993]] all service personnel on Belarusian soil were required to either take an oath of loyalty to Belarus, or leave. This oath however did not alleviate concerns regarding loyalty to Russia in time of crisis, especially since nearly 50% of all military personnel were ethnically Russian at the end of 1992.

The current personnel levels in the armed forces are numbered at 82,900, although a reduction to 60,000 is planned. Most soldiers are [[conscripts]] serving for a period 12 months (with higher education) or 18 month (without). The branches are as follows (2004):

* '''Army''': 43,357 (two motor divisions, one artillery division, one airborne brigade, two anti-tank brigades)

* '''Air Force''': 22,466 (two interceptor regiments, three strike regiments, one reconnaissance regiment)

* '''Ministry of Defense''': 17,077 (72-1 Guard Unit Training Center, one special duties brigade)

== Equipment ==
The military forces of Belarus are exclusively armed with Soviet-era equipment acquired during the [[Cold War]] from Russia. Although large in numbers, the equipment is in questionable condition, and outdated by Western standards. The MBTs are of Russian type [[T-72]], [[T-62]], and [[T-54]], and AFVs are of Russian type [[MT-LB]], [[BMP-2]], [[BMP-1]], and the [[BMD-1]]. The Air Force is equipped with [[Mig-23]], [[Mig-25]], [[Mig-29]] [[Su-27]] fighters, [[Mig-27]], [[Su-17]], [[Su-24]], [[Su-25]] bombers, as well as [[Mi-8]], [[Mi-24]], and the [[Poland|Polish]] built [[Mi-2]] attack helicopters. Equipment statistics are as follows (including equipment held in storage and reserves) (2004):

* '''Army''': 1800 MBT, 2600 AFV/APC.

* '''Air Force''': 260 FGA/training, 80 Attack Helicopters.

== Military Doctrine ==
The military goals of the armed forces of Belarus are to defend the interests of the Belarusian state. This however is at times ambiguous, and is made even more complex with the various agreements that have been recently signed with Russia. Membership in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], as well as the Treaty on Russia-Belarus Union (1997), and the Treaty of the Formation of a Union State (1999), have seemingly returned Belarus back into the heavy sphere of influence by Russia. Much of the Air Defense system is integrated into the Russian defense network, thus making Belarus heavily dependent on Russian resources and aid. It is unclear what the future will hold for Belarusian Military Forces, and what their role in the world will be.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Belarus}}
== History (until 2000) ==
Beside [[Ukrainian SSR]], [[Byelorussian SSR]] was the only [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] republic that were members of the [[United Nations]]. Both republics and the [[Soviet Union]] joined the UN when the organization was founded in [[1945]].

Since the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], after gaining its independence, Belarus became a member of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS), the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE), [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]], the [[North Atlantic Cooperation Council]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], and the [[World Bank]]. It is also [[Union of Russia and Belarus|politically united with Russia]] since [[April 2]] [[1996]].

=== Belarus-Russia relations ===

The introduction of [[free trade]] between [[Russia]] and Belarus in mid-[[1995]] led to a spectacular growth in bilateral trade, which was only temporarily reversed in the wake of the [[History of post-Soviet Russia#The crises of 1998|financial crisis of 1998]]. President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] sought to develop a closer relationship with Russia. The framework for the [[Union of Russia and Belarus]] was set out in the Treaty On the Formation of a Community of Russia and Belarus (1996), the Treaty on Russia-Belarus Union, the Union Charter (1997), and the Treaty of the Formation of a Union State (1999). The integration treaties contained commitments to [[monetary union]], [[equal rights]], single citizenship, and a common defence and [[foreign policy]].  

=== Belarus-EU relations ===

Following the recognition of Belarus as an independent state in December [[1991]] by the [[European Community]], EC/EU-Belarus relations initially experienced a steady progression. The signature of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) in [[1995]] signaled a commitment to political, economic and trade cooperation. Some assistance was provided to Belarus within the framework of the [[TACIS]] programme and also through various aid programs and loans. However, progress in EU-Belarus relations stalled in [[1996]] after serious setbacks to the development of democracy, and the [[Drazdy conflict]]. The EU did not recognize the 1996 constitution, which replaced the [[1994]] constitution. The [[Council of the European Union]] decided against Belarus in [[1997]]: The PCA was not concluded, nor was its trade-related part; Belarusian membership in the [[Council of Europe]] was not supported; bilateral relations at the ministerial level were suspended and EU technical assistance programs were frozen.
Acknowledging the lack of progress in relation to bilateral relations and the internal situation following the position adopted in [[1997]], the EU adopted a step-by-step approach in [[1999]], whereby sanctions would be gradually lifted upon fulfillment of the four [[benchmark]]s set by the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]. In [[2000]], some moderately positive developments toward the implementation of recommendations made by the OSCE AMG were observed but were not sufficient in the realm of access to fair and free elections.

=== Belarus-U.S. relations ===

The [[United States]] has encouraged Belarus to conclude and adhere to agreements with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) on the program of macroeconomic stabilization and related reform measures, as well as to undertake increased privatization and to create a favorable climate for business and investment. Although there has been some American direct private investment in Belarus, its development has been relatively slow given the uncertain pace of reform. An Overseas Private Investment Corporation agreement was signed in June [[1992]] but has been suspended since 1995 because Belarus did not fulfill its obligations under the agreement. Belarus is eligible for [[Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]] short-term financing [[insurance]] for U.S. investments, but because of the adverse business climate, no projects have been initiated. The IMF granted standby credit in September 1995, but Belarus has fallen off the program and did not receive the second tranche of funding, which had been scheduled for regular intervals throughout 1996.

== Present situation (2001 onwards) ==

=== Belarus-Russia relations ===

[[Russia]] remains the largest and most important partner for Belarus both in the political and economic fields. After protracted disputes and setbacks, the two countries' [[customs duty|customs duties]] were unified as of March 2001 but the customs controls were soon restored. In terms of [[trade]], almost half of Belarusian [[export]] goes to Russia. Due to the structure of Belarusian [[industry]], Belarus relies heavily on Russia both for export markets and for the supply of [[raw materials]] and components. After initial negotiation with the Russian [[Central Bank]] on [[monetary union]], the [[Russian rouble]] was set to be introduced in 2004 in Belarus, but it was soon postponed. Then it was set that Russian rouble would be introduced in 2005, but it was postponed again. Finally, it was set to be introduced in [[2006]], but it seems to be cancelled again for an undefinite period of time.

=== Belarus-EU relations ===

The structure of Belarus trade reflects the low competitiveness and output decline of manufacturing industry in the country over the past decade, leading to the predominance of primary production work intensive goods in the export. Belarusian exports to EU consist mainly of agricultural and textile products, while the EU exports is primarily machinery. 

Belarus is a beneficiary of EU's Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). European Commission decided in 2003 to initiate an investigation into violation of freedom of association in Belarus as the first step towards a possible temporary withdrawal of the GSP from Belarus.
In December 2004 EU adopted a position aimed at imposing travel restrictions on officials from Belarus responsible for the fraudulent parliamentary elections and referendum on [[17 October]] [[2004]] and for human rights violations during subsequent peaceful political demonstrations in Minsk.
The [[European Parliament]] released a statement in March [[2005]] in which it denounced the Belarussian regime as dictatorship. The European parliamentarians were primarily concerned about the suppression of independent media outlets in the country and 
about the fraudulent referendum. The resolution of the European Parliament stated that personal bank accounts of President Lukashenko and other high-ranking Belarussian officials should be tracked and frozen.
 
In 2005, [[Amnesty International]] reported a ''pattern of deliberate obstruction, harassment and intimidation of human rights defenders'' in Belarus. [[Reporters Without Borders]] accused the Belarusian authorities of hounding and arresting journalists from the country's Polish minority. Lukashenko has closed the country's main Polish newspaper, printing a bogus paper instead with the same name and size that praised his [[incumbent]] regime. Several foreign, mainly Polish, journalists were arrested or expelled from the country. Lukashenko accused [[Poland]] of an attempt to overthrow his regime by stirring up a peaceful revolution in Belarus like the [[orange revolution]] in [[Ukraine]] in 2004.

Later in 2005 the Belarusian [[riot police]] seized the headquarters of the [[Union of Poles in Belarus]], an association representing the 400,000 [[ethnic minority]] [[Polish people]] living in western areas the country that were part of Poland until [[World War II]]. The dispute between Poland and Belarus escalated further as Poland responded by recalling its ambassador from Belarus for indefinite consultations, and called on the [[European Union]] to impose sanctions on the Belarusian leadership in order to curtail the [[human rights]] abuses in Belarus. Belarusian papers described this as a 'dirty political game', and part of a 'cold war' waged on president Lukashenko. Polish Foreign Minister [[Adam Rotfeld]] said a clampdown was under way, aimed at destroying ''&quot;all elements of political pluralism and independence&quot;'' in Belarus. 

In August 2005 the EU's executive commission called for human rights to be respected in Belarus. The commision said it was considering offering support to independent media in the country and had set aside more than eight million euros from its budget to offer support for human rights activities. [[France]] expressed her solidarity with Poland on the issue of human rights in Belarus a day after the EU declared it was worried about the situation in the country. Several former Soviet Republics, including neighbouring Ukraine, also expressed their concerns about the development of the situation in Belarus.

=== Belarus-U.S. relations ===

Belarus has had an ongoing discussion to relaunch IMF-backed reforms, concluding an arrangement for an IMF Staff-monitored program (SMP) in 2001. However, the authorities did not follow through with reforms as hoped, leaving an uncertain future for IMF-backed cooperation. Belarus authorities have said on several occasions that they find IMF intervention and recommendations in Belarus counter-productive to the economical development of those countries.
The relationships with the [[United States]] have been further strained, after [[Congress of the United States]] unanimously passed the [[Belarus Democracy Act of 2004]].

=== Border and territory disputes ===

* with [[Latvia]]: boundary remains undemarcated 
* with [[Lithuania]]: only a third of the border demarcated
* with [[Ukraine]]: unratified boundary treaty prevents border demarcation

== Perestroika period == 

During the time of [[perestroika]] and after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] media expression flourished, with a wide variety of newspapers that presented a wide variety of points of view.

== [[Alexander Lukashenko|Lukashenko]] period ==

[[Image:Belarus-Minsk-Mass Media in Belarus-For Diaspora.jpg|thumb|200px|&quot;Mass Media in Belarus&quot; exhibition. &quot;Mass Media for Diaspora&quot; booth. May 5, 2005]]

After 10 years of Lukashenko's presidency, most of the '''Belarusian media''' outlets (newspapers, radio, television) are owned by the state.  The state-controlled media present  pro-[[government]] points of view and interpretation of events as in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period. There are a number of privately owned media outlets, mostly small independent newspapers. They operate under a permanent threat of being closed down for violating various government regulations, such as mis-stating their corporate name on their publication or operating out of an office not registered with the government (in fact, this is the situation for all private enterprises in Belarus).

=== Free expression limited ===

Many western human rights groups state that the [[civil right]]s of free expression are severely limited in Belarus, though there are some individuals and groups that refuse to be controlled and some of the journalists have disappeared. What makes the situation complex, however, is that the relatively free Russian media is allowed to transmit television programming, sell newspapers and conduct journalistic activities in Belarus (though some Russian journalists have been expelled by the Belarusian government) thus giving some members of the public, typically those in large cities with many Russian residents, access to an alternative point of view in the Russian language (nearly all Belarusians understand and most of them speak Russian).

In [[2004]], media watchdog [[Reporters Without Borders]] ranked Belarus 144th out of 167 countries. For comparison, in the same index Ukraine was 138th and Russia was 140th, while the closest of the other European countries were Serbia at 77 and Romania at 70.

=== Examples of propaganda ===

Perhaps the most obvious examples of Belarusian [[propaganda]] are imaginary terrorist stories, whereby alleged terrorists are said to be plotting to overthrow President [[Aleksandr Lukashenko]].

The state controlled media in Belarus deny that there is any bias or censoring of [[freedom of expression]] in Belarus. They point to the Belarusian people's overwhelming re-election of Lukashenko (also known as Luka) on [[September 9]], [[2001]] claiming that this shows that the anti-democracy sentiment in Belarus is genuine and that the Belarusian people and media do have the right to free speech - they simply do not want to criticize their government because they believe it to be running the country well. Once outside Belarus and free of fear of reprisal, most Belarusians are vocal in their discontent with thcrop, accounts for nearly half of exports, while the [[banana]] industry is the country's largest employer. The government's tough austerity program in [[1997]] resulted in an economic slowdown that continued in [[1998]]. The trade deficit has been growing, mostly as a result of low export prices for sugar and bananas. The new government faces important challenges to economic stability. Rapid action to improve tax collection has been promised, but a lack of progress in reining in spending could bring the exchange rate under pressure. The tourist and construction sectors strengthened in early 1999, leading to a preliminary estimate of revived growth at 4%. The Belize Dollar is fixed to the [[U.S. dollar]] at a rate of 2:1.

==Overview==
The economy of [[Benin]] remains underdeveloped and dependent on [[subsistence agriculture]], [[cotton]] Cotton accounts for 40% of GDP and roughly 80% of official export receipts. There is also production of [[textile]]s, palm products, and [[cocoa]]. [[Maize]] (corn), [[bean]]s, [[rice]], [[peanut]]s, [[cashew]]s, [[pineapple]]s, [[cassava]], [[yam (vegetable)|yams]], and other various tubers are grown for local subsistence. Benin began producing a modest quantity of offshore oil in [[October 1982]]. Production ceased in recent years but exploration of new sites is ongoing. A modest fishing fleet provides fish and shrimp for local subsistence and export to Europe. Formerly government-owned commercial activities are now privatized. A French [[brewing|brewer]] acquired the former state-run brewery. Smaller businesses are privately owned by Beninese citizens, but some firms are foreign owned, primarily [[France|French]] and [[Lebanese]]. The private commercial and agricultural sectors remain the principal contributors to growth.

==Economic Development==
Since the transition to a [[Democracy|democratic]] government in [[1990]], Benin has undergone an economic recovery. A large injection of external investment from both private and public sources has alleviated the economic difficulties of the early 1990s caused by global recession and persistently low commodity prices (although the latter continues to affect the economy). The manufacturing sector is confined to some light industry, which is mainly involved in processing primary products and the production of consumer goods. A planned joint [[hydroelectric]] project with neighboring [[Togo]] is intended to reduce Benin's dependence on imported energy mostly from [[Ghana]], which currently accounts for a significant proportion of the country's imports. The service sector has grown quickly, stimulated by economic liberalization and fiscal reform. Membership of the [[CFA Franc Zone]] offers reasonable currency stability as well as access to French economic support. Benin sells its products mainly to [[France]] and, in smaller quantities, to the [[Netherlands]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], and [[India]]. France is Benin's leading source for imports. Benin is also a member of the [[West Africa]]n economic community [[ECOWAS]].

Despite its rapid growth, the economy of Benin still remains underdeveloped and dependent on subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional trade. Growth in real output averaged a sound 5% since 1996, but a rapid population rise offset much of this growth on a per capita basis. Inflation has subsided over the past several years. Commercial and transport activities, which make up a large part of GDP, are vulnerable to developments in [[Nigeria]], particularly fuel shortages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Economy - overview:'''
The economy of [[Bhutan]], one of the world's smallest and least developed, is based on [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]], which provide the main livelihood for 90% of the population and account for about 40% of [[gross domestic product|GDP]]. Agriculture consists largely of subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy is closely aligned with India's through strong trade and monetary links. The industrial sector is technologically backward, with most production of the cottage industry type. Most development projects, such as road construction, rely on [[India]]n migrant labor. Bhutan's hydropower potential and its attraction for tourists are key resources. The Bhutanese Government has made some progress in expanding the nation's productive base and improving social welfare. Model education, social, and environment programs in Bhutan are underway with support from multilateral development organizations. Each economic program takes into account the government's desire to protect the country's environment and cultural traditions. Detailed controls and uncertain policies in such areas as industrial licensing, trade, labor, and finance continue to hamper foreign investment.

In 2004, Bhutan became the first country in the world to ban smoking and the selling of Tobacco.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Lhop''' or '''Doya''' are a little-known tribe of southwest [[Bhutan]].  The Bhutanese believe them to be the [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] inhabitants of the country, although this claim has not be substantiated by anthropologists. The Lhop are found in the low valleys of [[Samtse]] and near [[Phuntsoling]] in the [[Duars]]. They are also known as the Lhops, Lhopu, or Lhokpu and speak a [[Tibeto-Burman]] language.  They total approximately 1000 persons.

The dress of the Lhop resembles the [[Lepcha]], but they bear little similarity with the [[Bhutia]] in the North and the [[Toto (tribe)|Toto]] in the west. The Doya trace their descent [[matrilineality|matrilineally]], marry their [[cross cousin]]s, and embalm the deceased who are then placed in a foetal position on a circular sarcophagi above the ground. They follow a blend of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] mixed with [[animism]].

      <timestamp>2002-08-07T17:14:47Z</ti experienced farmers. It produces most of [[Brazil]]'s grains and oilseeds and export crops. The other, located in the drought-ridden northeast region and in the Amazon basin, lacks well-distributed rainfall, good soil, adequate infrastructure, and sufficient development capital. Although mostly occupied by subsistence farmers, the latter regions are increasingly important as exporters of forest products, cocoa, and tropical fruits. Central Brazil contains substantial areas of [[grassland]] with only scattered trees. The Brazilian [[grassland|grasslands]] are less fertile than those of [[North America]] and are generally more suited for grazing.

During the dicatorship period, agriculture was neglected and exploited as a means of resources for the industry sector and cheap food for the urban population. Until late 1980s export and prices were controlled, with quotas on exports. This has changed since the early 1990s.

Brazilian agriculture is well diversified, and the country is largely self-sufficient in food. Agriculture accounts for 8% of the country's GDP, and employs about one-quarter of the labor force in more than 6 million agricultural enterprises. [[Brazil]] is the world's largest producer of sugarcane and coffee, and a net exporter of cocoa, soybeans, orange juice, tobacco, forest products, and other tropical fruits and nuts. Livestock production is important in many parts of the country, with rapid growth in the poultry, pork, and milk industries reflecting changes in consumer tastes. On a value basis, production is 60% field crop and 40% livestock. [[Brazil]] is a net exporter of agricultural and food products, which account for about 35% of the country's exports.

Half of [[Brazil]] is covered by forests, with the largest [[rain forest]] in the world located in the Amazon Basin. Recent migrations into the Amazon and largescale burning of forest areas have placed the international spotlight on the country and damaged Brazil's image. The government has reduced incentives for such activity and is beginning to implement an ambitious environmental plan - and has just adopted an Environmental Crimes Law that requires serious penalties for infractions.

==Industry==
[[Brazil]] has the most advanced industrial sector in [[Latin America]]. Accounting for one-third of GDP, Brazil's diverse industries range from automobiles, steel and petrochemicals to computers, aircraft, and consumer durables. With the increased economic stability provided by the Plano Real, Brazilian and multinational businesses have invested heavily in new equipment and technology, a large proportion of which has been purchased from U.S. firms.

[[Brazil]] has a diverse and sophisticated services industry as well. During the early 1990s, the banking sector accounted for as much as 16% of GDP. Although undergoing a major overhaul, [[Brazil]]'s financial services industry provides local businesses with a wide range of products and is attracting numerous new entrants, including U.S. financial firms. The [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]] stock exchanges are undergoing a consolidation and the reinsurance sector is about to be privatized.

The Brazilian government has undertaken an ambitious program to reduce dependence on imported oil. Imports previously accounted for more than 70% of the country's oil needs but now account for about 33%. [[Brazil]] is one of the world's leading producers of [[hydroelectric power]], with a current capacity of about 58,000 megawatts. Existing [[hydroelectric power]] provides 92% of the nation's electricity. Two large hydroelectrical projects, the 12,600 megawatt [[Itaipu Dam]] on the [[Parana]] River--the world's largest dam--and the Tucurui Dam in Para in northern Brazil, are in operation. Brazil's first commercial nuclear reactor, Angra I, located near [[Rio de Janeiro]], has been in operation for more than 10 years. Angra II is under construction and, after years of delays, is about to come on line. An Angra III is planned. The three reactors would have combined capacity of 3,000 megawatts when completed.

Proven mineral resources are extensive. Large iron and manganese reserves are important sources of industrial raw materials and export earnings. Deposits of nickel, tin, chromite, bauxite, beryllium, copper, lead, tungsten, zinc, gold, and other minerals are exploited. High-quality cooking-grade coal required in the steel industry is in short supply.

==Economy - overview==
Possessing large and well-developed agricultural, mining, manufacturing, and service sectors, [[Brazil]]'s economy outweighs that of all other South American countries and is expanding its presence in world markets. In the late eighties and early [[The nineties|ninetie]]s, high inflation hindered economic activity and investment. The [[Plano Real]] (''Real Plan''), instituted in the [[Spring (season)|spring]] of 1994, sought to break [[inflationary expectation]]s by [[pegging]] the real to the [[U.S. dollar]]. Inflation was brought down to single digit annual figures, but not fast enough to avoid substantial real exchange rate appreciation during the transition phase of the ''Real Plan''. This appreciation meant that Brazilian goods were now more expensive relative to goods from other countries, which contributed to large current account deficits. However, no [[shortage]] of foreign currency ensued because of the financial community's renewed interest in Brazilian markets as inflation rates stabilized and memories of the [[debt crisis]] of the [[1980s]] faded. The maintenance of large [[current account]] [[deficit]]s via [[capital account]] [[surplus]]es became problematic as investors became more risk averse to emerging market exposure as a consequence of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the Russian bond default in August 1998. After crafting a [[fiscal adjustment]] program and pledging progress on structural reform, Brazil received a $41.5 billion IMF-led international support program in November 1998. In January 1999, the Brazilian Central Bank announced that the real would no longer be pegged to the U.S. dollar. This devaluation helped moderate the downturn in economic growth in 1999 that investors had expressed concerns about over the summer of 1998. Brazil's debt to GDP ratio of 48% for 1999 beat the IMF target and helped reassure investors that Brazil will maintain tight fiscal and monetary policy even with a floating currency. The economy grew 4.4% in 2000, but problems in Argentina in 2001, and growing concerns that the presidential candidate considered most likely to win, leftist [[Luis Inácio Lula da Silva]], would default on the debt, triggered a confidence crisis that caused the economy to deccelerate. During his first year as president, in 2003, President da Silva decided to take an austere approach to the economy by controlling inflation and seeking current account surpluses in order to meet Brazil's debt obligations. This strategy caused a GDP decrease during 2003, but helped the country to attain robust GDP growth of 5.2% during 2004. The country paid off it's IMF debt pre-schedule on the 29th (2,04 billion) and the 30th (13,46 billion) of december, 2005.

For several decades, Brazilian development was based on an import substitution strategy. The main economic problem in the 1980s was enormous inflation.

In 1990, after a few years of an informal and slow opening of the economy, the country has made some dramatic changes, strongly reducing the import tariff and emphasizing the need for quality (read ISO 9000 series adoption).

In 1994, the [[Plano Real|Real Plan]] successfully eliminated inflation, after many [[Timeline of Brazilian economic stabilization plans|failed attempts]] to control it. As a result, Brazilian purchasing power has dramatically improved. Almost 25 million people turned into consumers &quot;overnight&quot;. Consumer good imports have grown very fast in recent years. Companies, realizing the business opportunities, increased their investment in Brazil and slowly the import pattern has changed from consumer goods into machinery and other capital goods.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Brazil}}
Traditionally, [[Brazil]] has been a leader in the inter-American community and has played an important role in collective security efforts, as well as in economic cooperation in the Western Hemisphere. Brazil supported the [[Triple Entente]] in World War I after 1917 and the Allies in World War II after 1942. During [[World War II]], its [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force|expeditionary force]] in [[Italy]] played a key role in the Allied victory at [[Monte Cassino]]. It is a party to the [[Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance]] (Rio Treaty) and a member of the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS). Recently, Brazil has given high priority to expanding relations with its South American neighbors and is a founding member of the [[Amazon Pact]], the [[Latin American Integration Association]] (ALADI), and Mercosul ([[Mercosur]] in Spanish), an imperfect customs union including [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Paraguay]], and Brazil. Along with [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], and the [[United States]], Brazil is one of the guarantors of the Peru-Ecuador peace process. Brazil is a charter member of the United Nations and participates in many of its specialized agencies. It has contributed troops to UN peacekeeping efforts in the Middle East, the former [[Belgian Congo]], [[Cyprus]], [[Mozambique]], [[Angola]], and more recently [[East Timor]] and [[Haiti]]. Brazil has been a member of the UN Security Council four times, most recently 1998-2000.

As Brazil's domestic economy has grown and diversified, the country has become increasingly involved in international politics and economics. The United States, western Europe, and [[Japan]] are primary markets for Brazilian exports and sources of foreign lending and investment. Brazil has also bolstered its commitment to [[nonproliferation]] through ratification of the nuclear [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT), signing a fullscale nuclear safeguard agreement with the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), acceeding to the [[Treaty of Tlatelolco]], and becoming a member of the [[Missile Technology Control Regime]] (MTCR) and the [[Nuclear Suppliers Group]].

Recently, Brazil has been considerably reluctant to help forming the [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] agreement, leaving more controversial issues up to the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).

'''Disputes - international:'''
* Two short sections of boundary with Uruguay are in dispute - [[Arroio Invernada]] (Arroyo de la Invernada) area of the [[Rio Quarai]] (Rio Cuareim) and the islands at the confluence of the Rio Quarai and the [[Uruguay River]].
* [[Brazil]] declared in 1986 the sector between 28°W to 53°W (''[[Brazilian Antarctica]]'' (''Antártica Brasileira'') as its ''Zone of Interest'' ([[informal]] [[land claim|claim]]). It overlaps [[Antarctic territories|Argentine and British claims]]. [http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Antarctica.html#Brazil][http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/islands_oceans_poles/antarctica_research_station.gif][http://www.fotw.net/flags/aq.html]

'''Illicit drugs:'''
Limited illicit producer of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], minor [[coca]] cultivation in the Amazon region, mostly used for domestic consumption; government has a large-scale eradication program to control cannabis; important transshipment country for [[Bolivia]]n, [[Colombia]]n, and [[Peru]]vian [[cocaine]] headed for the [[United States]] and Europe; increasingly used by traffickers as a way station for narcotics air transshipments between Peru and Colombia; upsurge in drug-related violence and weapons smuggling.

'''United Nations Politics'''
Currently [[Brazil]] is seeking permanent representation on the Security Council. They are a member of the G4, an organization comprised of [[Brazil]], [[Germany]], [[Japan]], and [[India]], all nations who are currently seeking permanent representation. According to their plan the [[UN Security Council]] would be expanded beyond the current fifteen members to include twenty-five members. This would be the first time that permanent status has been extended to a [[South American]] nation and suporters of the G4 plan suggest that this will lead to greater representation of developing nations rather than the current major powers.

      <text xml:space="prf Burkina Faso table}}
[[Burkina Faso]] is one of the poorest countries in the world with an average income per capita of €250 (US$300). More than 80% of the population relies on [[subsistence agriculture]], with only a small fraction directly involved in [[industry]] and [[tertiary sector of industry|services]]. Low rainfall, poor [[soil]]s, lack of adequate communications and other [[infrastructure]], a low literacy rate, and a stagnant economy are all longstanding problems. The [[export]] economy also remains subject to fluctuations in world prices.

Although handicapped by an extremely resource-deprived domestic economy, Burkina remains committed to the [[structural adjustment program]] it launched in [[1991]]. It has largely recovered from the devaluation of the CFA in January [[1994]], with a [[1996]] growth rate of 5.9%.

Many Burkinabe migrate to neighbouring countries for work, and their remittances provide a substantial contribution to the balance of payments. Burkina is attempting to improve the economy by developing its [[mineral]] resources, improving its infrastructure, making its [[agriculture|agricultural and livestock sectors]] more productive and competitive, and stabilizing the supplies and prices of [[cereal]]s.

The agricultural economy remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in rainfall. The [[Mossi Plateau]] in north central Burkina faces encroachment from the [[Sahara]]. The resultant southward migration means heightened competition for control of very limited [[water resources]] south of the Mossi Plateau. Most of the population ekes out a living as [[subsistence farming|subsistence farmers]], living with problems of climate, [[erosion|soil erosion]], and rudimentary technology. The staple crops are [[millet]], [[sorghum]], [[maize]], and [[rice]]. The cash crops are [[cotton]], [[peanut|groundnuts]], [[Shea nut|karite (shea nuts)]], and [[sesame]]. Livestock, once a major export, has declined.

Industry, still in an embryonic stage, is located primarily in [[Bobo-Dioulasso]], [[Ouagadougou]], [[Banfora]], and [[Koudougou]]. Manufacturing is limited to [[food]] processing, [[textile]]s, and other import substitution heavily protected by [[tariffs]]. Some [[factory|factories]] are privately owned, and others are set to be privatized. Burkina's exploitable natural resources are limited, although a [[manganese]] [[ore]] deposit is located in the remote northeast. [[Gold]] mining has increased greatly since the mid-1980s and, along with cotton, is a leading export moneyearner.

'''Summary:'''
One of the poorest countries in the world, landlocked Burkina Faso has a high population density, few [[natural resource]]s, and a fragile [[soil]]. Approximately 90% of the population is engaged in (mainly subsistence) agriculture which is highly vulnerable to variations in [[rain]]fall. Industry remains dominated by unprofitable government-controlled corporations. Following the African franc currency devaluation in January [[1994]] the government updated its development program in conjunction with international agencies, and exports and economic growth have increased. Maintenance of its [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] progress depends on continued low inflation, reduction in the trade deficit, and reforms designed to encourage private investment.

[[Burkina Faso]] has excellent relations with [[Europe]]an--including the [[European Union]]--[[North African]], and [[Asian]] countries, which are all active development partners. [[France]], in particular, continues to provide significant aid and supports Compaore's developing role as a regional powerbroker. Compaore has mediated a political crisis in [[Togo]] and helped to resolve the Tuareg conflict in Niger. Several thousand [[Tuareg]] refugees from [[Mali]], who sought protection in Burkina, will be repatriated by the end of [[1997]]. Burkina maintains cordial relations with [[Libya]]. Burkina maintains diplomatic relations with the [[Republic of China]] (usually referred to as &quot;Taiwan&quot;) instead of the [[People's Republic of China]].

19 provinces of Burkina Faso are joined with contiguous areas of Mali and [[Niger]] under the [[Liptako-Gourma Authority]], a regional economic organization.

In response to the drought that plagued the Sahel countries from [[1968]] to [[1974]], the U.S. provided significant emergency food assistance to Burkina Faso. Following this, the United States and other international donors began to work with the Sahel countries to plan and implement long-term development assistance programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Burundi-Demography.png|thumb|300px|right|Demographics of Burundi, Data of [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]
At 206.1 persons per sq. km., [[Burundi]] has the second-largest [[population density]] in Sub-[[Sahara]]n [[Africa]]. Most people live on [[farm]]s near areas of fertile [[volcanic soil]]. The population is made up of three major [[ethnic group]]s -- [[Bahutu]] (Hutu), [[Batutsi]] or Watusi (Tutsi), and [[Batwa]] (Twa). [[Kirundi language|Kirundi]] is the common language. Intermarriage takes place frequently between the Hutus and Tutsis. The terms &quot;[[pasture|pastoralist]]&quot; and &quot;[[agriculture|agriculturist]],&quot; often used as ethnic designations for Watusi and Bahutu, respectively, are only occupational titles which vary among individuals and groups. Although Hutus encompass the majority of the population, historically Tutsis have been politically and economically dominant.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{election burundi}}
In November 1995, the presidents of [[Burundi]], [[Rwanda]], [[Uganda]], and [[Zaire]] (currently [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]) announced a regional initiative for a negotiated peace in Burundi facilitated by former Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]]. In July 1996, former Burundian President [[Pierre Buyoya|Buyoya]] returned to power in a bloodless coup. He declared himself president of a transitional republic, even as he suspended the National Assembly, banned opposition groups, and imposed a nationwide curfew. Widespread condemnation of the coup ensued, and regional countries imposed economic sanctions pending a return to a constitutional government. Buyoya agreed in 1996 to liberalize political parties. Nonetheless, fighting between the army and [[Hutu]] militias continued. In June 1998, Buyoya promulgated a transitional constitution and announced a partnership between the government and the opposition-led National Assembly. After facilitator Julius Nyerere's death in October 1999, the regional leaders appointed [[Nelson Mandela]] as [[Facilitator]] of the [[Arusha]] peace process. Under Mandela the peace process has revived and important progress has taken place.

Multi-party system introduced after 1998. FRODEBU (the [[Front for Democracy in Burundi]], predominantly Hutu with some Tutsi membership)([[Jean Minani]], president) and UP[[Shenyang]], [[China]].  BMW has established a joint venture with Chinese manufacturer Brilliance to build BMW 3 Series and 5 Series vehicles for the local market.

===Rolls-Royce===
In the early 1990s, BMW and [[Rolls-Royce]] Motors began a joint venture that would see the new [[Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph]] and [[Bentley Arnage]] adopt BMW engines.

In 1998, both BMW and [[Volkswagen]] tried to purchase Rolls-Royce Motors. [[Volkswagen]] outbid BMW and bought the company for £430 million, but BMW outflanked its German rival.  Although Volkswagen had bought rights to the &quot;Spirit of Ecstasy&quot; mascot and the shape of the radiator grille, it lacked rights to the Rolls-Royce name. [[Rolls-Royce plc]] (the aero-engine business) retained the rights over the Rolls-Royce [[trademark]] and wished to strengthen its existing business partnership with BMW which extended to the [[Rolls-Royce Deutschland|BMW Rolls-Royce]] joint venture.  Consequently, BMW was allowed to acquire the rights to the grille and mascot, and licensed the name and &quot;RR&quot; logo after [[2003]] for £40 million. Volkswagen was permitted to build Rolls-Royces at its [[Crewe]] factory only until 2003, but quickly shifted its emphasis to the Bentley brand.

In the meantime, BMW was faced with the need to build a new factory and develop a new model. The new factory at [[Goodwood]] produced the new [[Rolls-Royce Phantom]], unveiled on [[January 2]], [[2003]], and officially launched at the [[Detroit Auto Show]] on [[January 5]], [[2003]].  The model, priced around US$330,000, has experienced disappointing sales worldwide.

==Models==
===Current and near future products===
The current BMW model lineup is split into what they call &quot;Series&quot;, traditionally identified by a single digit - e.g. the 3 Series.

In 2004 BMW announced plans to make odd-numbered models [[Sedan (car)|sedans]] and [[estate car|estates]] or wagons (BMW calls its estates/wagons Touring models), while even-numbered models will be two-door [[coupe]]s and [[cabriolet]]s.  This convention started informally in 1976 with the introduction of the [[BMW 6 Series|6 Series]] and later continued in 1989 with the [[BMW 8 Series|8 Series]], but died off when the latter was discontinued in 1999. This practice was revived as the [[BMW Z4|Z4]] replaced the aging [[BMW Z3|Z3]] roadster in 2003 and continues as the new [[BMW 6 Series|6 Series]] augments the existing [[BMW 5 Series]].

Coupe versions of the [[BMW 3 Series|3 Series]] sedans have always been named 3 Series vehicles, as well.  The company had considered renaming future 2-door derivatives of the 3 Series as 4 Series cars, but this plan has reportedly been shelved. 

[[Image:95 318ti.jpg|thumb|250px|The 1995 BMW 3 Series Compact]]

The M letter was used prior to the shift to Series-named cars to designate special &quot;Motorsport&quot; models, beginning with the [[BMW M1|M1]] supercar. Later the M letter was used as a prefix to top-of-the-range models which had received special treatment by the BMW Motorsport division. The first such car was the M535i of 1979. As these models started gaining popularity the Motorsport division was split into a separate company. [[BMW M]] GmbH now makes sporty models based on the production cars with very extensive chassis and engine upgrades. The M3 and M5 are based respectively on the 3 and 5 Series and are recognised by enthusiasts all over the world as truly excellent sports cars while retaining the practicality of the models they extend.

With the advent of the [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]], BMW also added the X5 - and in 2004 the X3 - to their model range to capitalize on this growing market. BMW calls its SUV models ''Sports Activity Vehicles''. A possible future V Series will offer [[Multi-purpose vehicle|MPV]] practicality for large families, similar to the [[Renault]] Scenic.

* [[BMW 1 Series|1 Series]]: a small car launched in autumn [[2004]] in Europe; autumn 2006 in the USA. It is the only [[rear wheel drive]] vehicle in its class. A coupe has been announced for 2006, and there are concepts of a hatchback and a minivan. Plans to label these variants as ''2 Series'' have reportedly been scrubbed.
* [[BMW 3 Series|3 Series]]: the successor to the 2002; a compact entry-level luxury sedan, now in its fifth generation (E90). The E90 line (starting with the 2006 model year) is available now in the United States. The E90 is currently available in the 325i (with a detuned 3.0 L I6 engine producing 215 bhp) and the 330i (with a 3.0 L I6 engine producing 255 bhp) as well as the AWD-versions of these 2 models, named 325xi and 330xi.  Currently the 3 series coupe and convertible is only available in the fourth generation E46 body style (with a 2.5 L I6 producing 184 bhp for the 325ci/cic and a 3.0 L I6 producing 225 bhp for the 330ci/cic) until the middle of 2006 when the E90 coupes will be available. Also available is the [[all wheel drive]] Touring (wagon) model, the 325xiT.  Other models, including diesel models, are available outside of the United States.
** [[BMW M3|M3]]: The motorsport division's race-inspired version of the 3 Series.  Currently available only in the fourth generation E46 body style and with a 3.2 L engine producing 333 bhp.  A new revision is expected in 2007 with a 400 horsepower V8.

* [[BMW 5 Series|5 Series]]: a midsize sports/[[Personal luxury car|luxury sedan]].  This series has is available with three different engines: the 525i with the same engine as the 325i, the 530i with the same engine as the 330i, and the 545i with a 4.4 L V8 producing 325 bhp.  For the 2006 model year, the 545i will be phased out in favour of the 550i, with a 4.8 L V8 producing 360 bhp. Other models, including diesel models, are available outside of the United States.
**[[BMW M5|M5]]: The motorsport division's version of the 5 Series. The new M5 (E60) is powered by an [[Formula One|F1]]-inspired V10 engine, producing 507 bhp and is mated with a 7-speed Sequential Manual Gearbox (SMG) transmission.
* [[BMW 6 Series|6 Series]]: The coupe verson of the 7 series, the 6 series is currently available only in the 650i version with a 4.8 L V8 producing 360 bhp.
** [[BMW M6|M6]]: A high performance version of the 6 Series. Developed by BMW's M Division, it is powered by the same 5.0 L V10 507 bhp engine seen in the BMW M5.  It is currently avaliable in Europe and is coming to America soon.
* [[BMW 7 Series|7 Series]]: a full-size, executive-class, luxury car competing with the [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class]], [[Audi A8]], and [[Jaguar XJ]].  The 7 series comes in the 750i and 750Li with the same engine as the 550i, and in the 760i and 760Li, with a 6.0 L V12 producing 438 bhp.  The 760Li is also made in a bulletproof version for clients who need extra protection.
* [[BMW X3|X3]]: a small SUV with emphasis on practicality and affordability
* [[BMW X5|X5]]: BMW's first SUV (called SAV or Sports Activity Vehicle by BMW) competing against the [[Porsche Cayenne]] and [[Mercedes M-Class]].

* [[BMW M1|M1]]: a [[1970s]] mid-engine sports car, designed in conjunction with [[Lamborghini]]. As Lamborghini went into bankruptcy the production was shifted to the German Karmanwerke.
* [[BMW Z3|Z3]]: a compact two-seater roadster.
** M coupé and roadster: high-performance hard-top and soft-top versions of the Z3, very popular with enthusiasts
* [[BMW 8 Series|8 Series]]: a fast, high-technology coupe of the [[1990s]] meant to replace the older 6 Series.
* [[BMW Z1|Z1]]: a late [[1980s]] two-seater with innovative modular construction; only 8,000 were made. Best known for the feature of the vertically sliding doors.
* [[BMW Z8|Z8]]: flagship sports car; design based on the classic 507 roadster from the [[1950s]].  Only 5000 were built, the last 500 being a special edition built by Alpina but sold directly from BMW. This exciting roadster was built on a aluminium space frame design.
* [[BMW Z9|Z9]] concept car designed by Adrian van Hooydonk marked a departure from BMW's traditional conservative style, and has caused some controversy among BMW enthusiasts.

===Classics===
BMW made many cars over the years which have had great impact on the world of motoring.

===Series Generations===
Internally, BMW associates an &quot;e-code&quot; for each generation of a series (&quot;E&quot; stands for ''Entwicklung'', [[German language|German]] for ''development'' or ''evolution''). These &quot;chassis codes&quot; only change to signify a major redesign of a series, or the introduction of a new series.

==Motorcycles==
[[Image:BMWbike.jpg|thumb|A modern BMW motorcycle]]
{{main|BMW motorcycles}}

BMW branded motorcycles were first produced in [[1923]] and had an unusual &quot;[[flat-twin|boxer twin]]&quot; engine, with two air-cooled cylinders protruding from opposite sides of the machine. Prior to this BMW built the &quot;Flink&quot; 2- stroke and &quot;Helios&quot; motorcycles, as well as supplying M2B15 motors to other companies such as Victoria.

The R series currently designates machines with a boxer-twin engine, the K series has an I4 engine (1000 and 1200cc) or an I3 (750cc), and the F series has a single cylinder [[Rotax]] engine.

During [[World War II|WWII]] BMW produced the [[BMW R75]] motorcycle with a [[sidecar]] attached. This motorcycle was essentially an 80% interchangeable copy of the ZUndapp KS750, made by BMW to avoid producing the KS750 under licence. Unusually, the sidecar's wheel was also driven. Combined with a lockable [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], this made the vehicle very capable off-road, an equivalent in many ways to the [[Jeep]].

BMW motorcycles tend to be relatively large and heavy, and relaxed and comfortable to ride.  All BMW motorcycles except for the F series (which have a chain or belt drive) use shaft drive, a characteristic of BMW motorcycles since 1923.

BMW updated the traditional R design in 1993. These new bikes were principally oil-cooled (hence, called [[oilhead]]s) and had 4 valves per cylinder. (Older Rs are principally air-cooled, and called [[airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]]s.) In 2004, BMW updated the oilhead boxer engine, adding double spark plugs per cylinder, a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1200&amp;nbsp;cc and enhanced performance to 100&amp;nbsp;hp (75&amp;nbsp;kW) for the R1200GS, compared to 85&amp;nbsp;hp (63&amp;nbsp;kW) of the previous oilhead s R1150GS.

In 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It is both powerful (the engine is a 167 bhp unit derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team) and significantly lighter than previous K models. It was BMW's latest attempt to keep up with the pace of development of sports machines from the likes of [[Honda]], [[Kawasaki motorcycles|Kawasaki]] and [[Suzuki]]. Innovations include a unique electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork BMW calls Duolever.

BMW was one of the earliest manufacturers to offer [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] on production motorcycles.

BMW is an innovator in motorcycle suspension design. Most modern examples use single-sided rear swingarms. Their trademark front suspension design, called the Telelever, was first seen in the early 1990s. The Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking, and is sometimes criticized by sport riders as insulating the rider from road inputs, therefore reducing the rider's &quot;feel&quot; for the roadway.

== Culture ==
BMW has also gained a reputation as part of an Internet prank, in that it is intentionally referred to ''erroneously'' as &quot;British Motor Works&quot; in order to get a charge out of [[newbie]]s.

The term &quot;beemer&quot; started as a pronunciation of the acronym &quot;BMW,&quot; adapted from the early-20th-Century British pronunciation of [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]] (as &quot;beeser&quot; or &quot;beezer&quot;), whose motorcycles were often racing BMW's. Over time, the term became closely associated with BMW motorcycles.

The term &quot;bimmer&quot; was later coined to refer (exclusively) to BMW automobiles. As such, use of the word &quot;beemer&quot; to refer to a BMW automobile is [http://www.boston-bmwcca.org/reference/Bimmer-Beemer.aspx frowned upon] by BMW enthusiasts, because it is the term used for motorcycles, though the distinction is somewhat arbitrary.  Interestingly, in the German language, the correct pronunciation of the term &quot;bimmer&quot; is &quot;beemer.&quot;

== Community ==
BMW has always had a very tight and loyal community following.  They're one of the few automakers that support driving their cars to their limits, suggesting &quot;spirited driving&quot; in certain operation manuals.  In the summer of 2001, BMW even went as far as starting the [http://www.bmwfilms.com BMW Films] website, showcasing some sporty models being driven to extremes.  These videos are very popular within the [http://www.unitedbimmer.com enthusiast community] and have opened the eyes of many owners looking for a sporty/fun car.  However, even with all this success, on October 21st, 2005, the BMW Films were taken offline.

      <comment>#REDIRECT [[Der Blaue Reiter]]</commeeral meeting takes place yearly and has the purpose of approving accounts and appointing the [[Auditor|auditors]]. The Board of Directors has administrative powers and is chaired by the governor (or by the Director General in his absence). Following reform in 2005, the governor has lost exclusive responsibility regarding decisions with external relevance (i.e. banking and financial supervision), which has been transferred to the Directorate (on majority vote). The Director General is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the bank, and acts as governor when absent.

The [[Board of Auditors]] assesses the bank's administration and compliance with the law, regulations and the statute.

===Appointment===
The Directorate's [[term of office]] lasts six years and is renewable once. The appointment of the governor is in charge of the government, heard the Board of Directors, with the approval of the [[List of Presidents of the Italian Republic|President of the Republic]] (formally a [[decree]] of the President). The Board of Directors is elected by the shareholders according to the bank [[statute]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For the founding father of tiki restaurants, bars, and nightclubs, see [[Don the Beachcomber]].''

'''Beachcomber''' was a [[pen name|''nom de plume'']] used by [[surrealism|surrealist]] humorous columnists [[D. B. Wyndham-Lewis]] and [[J. B. Morton|John Bingham Morton]] as authors of a [[Daily Express]] column called &quot;By the Way&quot;.  Other authors who used the name were Major John William Arbuthnott [[MVO]] and [[William Hartston]].

==&quot;By The Way&quot; in print==

The &quot;By The Way&quot; column was originally a society news column, published from [[1917]] onwards, written by social correspondent Major John Arbuthnott who invented the name &quot;Beachcomber&quot;.  It was taken over by Wyndham-Lewis sometime in [[1919]] who reinvented it as an outlet for his wit and humour.  It  was then passed to Morton during [[1924]] though it is likely there was a period when they overlapped.  Morton wrote the column until [[1975]]; it was revived in the early [[1990s]] and continues today, written by [[William Hartston]].  The column is unsigned except by &quot;Beachcomber&quot; and it was not publicly known that Morton (or, come to that, Wyndham-Lewis) wrote it until the [[1930s]].  Although there have been three humorous &quot;Beachcomber&quot; columnists to date, the name is mainly associated with Morton who has been credited as an influence by [[Spike Milligan]] amongst others.  Morton introduced the recurring characters and continuing stories that were a major feature of the column during his 51-year run.

The format of the column was a random assortment of small paragraphs which were otherwise unconnected.  These could be anything, such as 

*court reports, often involving Twelve Red-Bearded Dwarves before Mr Justice Cocklecarrot
*angry exchanges of letters between characters such as Florence McGurgle and her dissatisfied boarders
*interruptions from &quot;Prodnose&quot;, representing the public, who would then be roundly cursed by the author and kicked out
*installments of serials that could stop, restart from earlier, be abandoned altogether or change direction abruptly without warning
*parodies of poetry or drama, particularly of the extremely &quot;literary&quot; type such as [[Ibsen]]
*news reports from around the country

or just anything that the author thought funny at the time.  Morton's other interest, [[France]], was occasionally represented by epic tales of his rambling walks through the French countryside.  These were ''not'' intended as humour.

&quot;By The Way&quot; was very popular with the readership, one of the reasons it lasted so long.  Its style and randomness could be off-putting, however, and it is safe to say the humour could be something of an acquired taste.  Oddly, one of the column's greatest opponents was Express Newspaper's owner, [[Lord Beaverbrook]], who had to keep being assured the column was indeed funny.  Another prominent critic was [[George Orwell]] but &quot;By The Way&quot; was one of the only features kept continuously running in the often seriously reduced Daily Express throughout [[World War II]], where Morton's lampooning of [[Hitler]], including the British invention of Bracerot to make the Nazi's trousers fall down at inopportune moments, was regarded as valuable for morale.

The column was daily until [[1965]] when it was changed to weekly.  It was then cancelled in [[1975]] and revived as a daily piece in the early 1990s where it continues to the present day in much the same format.

==Other formats==

The [[Will Hay]] film [[Boys Will Be Boys]] ([[1935]]) was set at Morton's [[Narkover]] school.

In [[1969]], [[Spike Milligan]] based a BBC television series named ''The World of Beachcomber'' on the columns. According to Milligan, the columns had been an influence on the comedic style of his radio series, ''[[The Goon Show]]''.  A small selection was issued on a 1971 [[LP (format)|LP]] and a 2-cassette set of the series' soundtrack was made available in the late 1990s.

In [[1994]], [[BBC]] [[Radio 4]] broadcast the first of three series based on Morton's work.  This featured [[Richard Ingrams]], [[John Wells]], [[Patricia Routledge]] and [[John Sessions]] from compilations prepared by [[Mike Barfield]].  Series 1 was also made available as a 2-cassette set.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''William Nelson Joy''' (born [[1954]]), commonly known as '''Bill Joy''', co-founded [[Sun Microsystems]] in [[1982]] along with [[Vinod Khosla]], [[Scott McNealy]] and [[Andy Bechtolsheim]], and served as chief scientist at the company until [[2003]].

==Early career==
After growing up in rural [[Michigan]] Joy received his B.S. in [[Electrical Engineering]] from the [[University of Michigan]] and his M.S. in Electrical Engineering and [[Computer Science]] from [[UC Berkeley]].

Bill Joy was the person largely responsible for the authorship of Berkeley [[Unix|UNIX]], also known as [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]], from which spring many modern forms of UNIX, including [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]], and [[OpenBSD]]. Some of his most notable contributions were [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP/IP]], the [[vi]] editor, [[Network File System|NFS]], and the [[csh]] shell.

==Sun==
In [[1983]] he co-founded Sun Microsystems. 

There is a story about him:
[[DARPA]] had contracted [[Bolt, Beranek and Newman|BBN]] to add TCP/IP, devised by [[Vinton Cerf]] and [[Robert E. Kahn|Bob Kahn]], into Berkeley UNIX. Joy had been instructed to plug BBN's stack into Berkeley Unix. But Joy refused to do so. In his opinion, BBN's TCP/IP wasn't good enough. So he wrote his own high-performance TCP/IP stack.

As [[John Gage]] tells it, &quot;BBN had a big contract to implement TCP/IP, but their stuff didn't work, and Joy's grad student stuff worked. So they had this big meeting and this grad student in a T-shirt shows up, and they said, 'How did you do this?' And Bill said, 'It's very simple -- you read the protocol and write the code.'&quot; Others dispute this version of events.

In [[1986]], Joy was awarded a [[Grace Murray Hopper Award]] by the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] for his work on the Berkeley UNIX Operating System.

Joy was also a primary figure in the development of the [[SPARC]] microprocessors, the [[Java programming language]], and [[Jini]].

On [[September 9]], [[2003]] Sun announced that Bill Joy was leaving the company and that he &quot;is taking time to consider his next move and has no definite plans&quot;.

==Technology fears==
In [[2000]] he gained notoriety with the publication of his article in ''[[Wired Magazine]]'', &quot;[[Why the future doesn't need us]]&quot;, in which he declared, in what some have described as a &quot;neo-[[Luddite]]&quot; position, that he was convinced that growing advances in [[genetic engineering]] and [[nanotechnology]] would bring [[existential risk|risks]] to humanity. He argued that intelligent [[robot]]s would replace humanity, at the very least in intellectual and social dominance, in the relatively near future. One of those whom he admitted had set him thinking along this path was [[Theodore Kaczynski]], the anti-technology murderer known as [[the Unabomber]].

==Post-Sun activities==
In late [[2003]] Joy founded a capital venture firm, HighBar Ventures, with two Sun colleagues. In January [[2005]] he was named a partner in venture capital firm [[Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &amp; Byers]].

Bill Joy is married and lives with his four children in [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], [[Colorado]].

Bill Joy once said, &quot;My method is to look at something that seems like a good idea and assume it's true.&quot; [http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bandwidth''' is a measure of [[frequency]] range, measured in [[hertz]], of a function of a frequency variable.  
Bandwidth is a central concept in many fields, including [[information theory]], [[radio]] [[communication]]s, [[signal processing]], and [[spectroscopy]].  Bandwidth also refers to data rates when communicating over certain media or devices.  According to the [[Shannon-Hartley theorem]], the data rate of reliable communication is directly proportional to the frequency range of the signal used for the communication.  In this context, the word bandwidth can refer to either the data rate or the frequency range of the communication system (or both).  

Bandwidth is a key concept in many applications.  In radio communications, for example, bandwidth is the range of frequencies occupied by a [[modulated]] [[carrier wave]], whereas in optics it is the width of an individual [[spectral line]] or the entire [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectral range]]

There is no ''single'' universal precise definition of bandwidth, as it is vaguely understood to be a measure
of how wide a function is in the frequency domain. For different applications there are different precise definitions.
For example, one definition of bandwidth could be the range of frequencies beyond which the frequency function is zero.
This would correspond to the mathematical notion of the support of a function (i.e., the total &quot;length&quot; of values for
which the function is nonzero). 
Another definition might not be so strict and ignore the frequencies where the frequency function is ''small''. Small
could mean less than 3 [[dB]] below (i.e., less than half of) the maximum value, or it could mean below a certain absolute value. In short,
as with any definition of the ''width'' of a function, there are many definitions available, which are suitable for
different applications.

== Analog systems ==

[[Image:bandwidth.png|right]]
For [[analog signal]]s, which can be mathematically viewed as a function of time, '''bandwidth''' is the width, measured in [[hertz]], of a frequency range in which the signal's [[Fourier transform]] is nonzero. This definition can be relaxed wherein bandwidth would be the range of frequencies that the signal's Fourier transform has a power above a certain threshold, say
3 dB within the maximum value, in the frequency domain. Bandwidth of a signal is a measure of how rapidly it fluctuates with respect to time. Hence, the greater the bandwidth, the faster the variation in the signal. The word
bandwidth applies to signals as described above, but it could also apply to ''systems''. In the latter case, to say
that a system has a certain bandwidth is a short-hand for saying that the [[transfer function]] of the system has
a certain bandwidth. 

As an example, the 3 dB bandwidth of the function depicted in the figure is &lt;math&gt;f_2-f_1&lt;/math&gt;, whereas other definitions
of bandwidth would yield a different answer.

The fact that [[real numbers|real]] [[baseband]] systems have both negative and positive frequencies can lead to confusion about bandwidth, since they are sometimes referred to only by the positive half, and one will occasionally see expressions such as &lt;math&gt;B = 2W&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is the total bandwidth, and &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the positive bandwidth.  For instance, this signal would require a [[lowpass filter]] with cutoff frequency of at least &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; to stay intact.

The bandwidth of an [[electronic filter]] is the part of the filter's frequency response that lies within 3 [[Decibel|dB]] of the response at the [[center frequency]] of its peak.  

In [[signal processing]] and [[control theory]] the bandwidth is the frequency at which the [[closed-loop]] system gain drops to &amp;minus;3 dB.

In basic electric circuit theory when studying Band-pass and Band-reject filters the bandwidth represents the distance between the two points in the frequency domain where the signal is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt; of the maximum signal strength.

In photonics, the term bandwidth occurs in a variety of meanings:
*the bandwidth of the output of some light source, e.g., an ASE source or a laser; the bandwidth of ultrashort optical pulses can be particularly large
*the width of the frequency range that can be transmitted by some element, e.g. an optical fiber
*the gain bandwidth of an optical amplifier
*the width of the range of some other phenomenon (e.g., a reflection, the phase matching of a nonlinear process, or some resonance)
*the maximum modulation frequency (or range of modulation frequencies) of an optical modulator
*the range of frequencies in which some measurement apparatus (e.g., a powermeter) can operate
*the data rate (e.g., in Gbit/s) achieved in an optical communication system

== Digital systems ==

In a digital communication system, bandwidth has a dual meaning.  In the technical sense, it is a synonym for [[baud]] rate,  the rate at which symbols may be transmitted through the system.  It is also used in the colloquial sense to describe [[channel capacity]], the rate at which bits may be transmitted through the system.   Hence, a 66 MHz [[digital]] [[data bus]] with 32 separate data lines may properly be said to have a bandwidth of 66 MHz and a capacity of 2.1 Gbit/s — but it would not be surprising to hear such a bus described as having a &quot;bandwidth of 2.1 Gbit/s.&quot;   Similar confusion exists for analog [[modem]]s, where each symbol carries multiple bits of information so that a modem may transmit 56 kbit/s of information over a [[phone line]] with a bandwidth of only 12 kHz.

In [[discrete time system]]s and [[digital signal processing]], bandwidth is related to [[sampling rate]] according to the [[Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem]].

''Bandwidth'' is also used in the sense of [[commodity]], referring to something limited or something costing money. Thus, communication costs bandwidth, and improper use of someone else's bandwidth may be called  [[bandwidth theft]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Siddhartha.JPG|thumb|190px|Prince [[Siddhartha Gautama]] as a '''bodhisattva''', before becoming a [[Buddha]]. He is characteristically depicted as an Indian nobleman, posing with left hand on the hip, [[Gandhara]], 2nd-3rd century.]]

In [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] thought, a '''bodhisattva''' ({{zh-stp |s=菩萨 |t=菩薩 |p=púsà}}; [[Japanese Language|Japanese]]: 菩薩 ''bosatsu''; [[Korean language|Korean]]: bosal) is a being who is dedicated to assisting all sentient beings achieve complete [[Samyaksam-Buddha|Buddhahood]]. Conventionally, the term is applied to hypothetical beings with a high degree of [[bodhi|enlightenment]].  ''Bodhisattva'' literally means a &quot;wisdom ('bodhi') being ('sattva')&quot; in [[Sanskrit]].

== Bodhisattvas in Theravada Buddhism ==
In [[Theravada]] Buddhism, the bodhisattva (Pali: bodhisatta) is seen as seeking enlightenment so that, once awakened, he or she may efficiently aid other beings with the expertise of supreme wisdom. [[Gautama Buddha]]'s previous life experience as a bodhisattva before Buddhahood are recorded in the texts of the [[jataka]]. Lay Buddhists of Theravada seek inspiration in Gautama's skill as a good layman in these texts, which account not only his historical life, but many previous lives. When Gautama Buddha referred to himself in his pre-Buddha existence, he spoke in terms of &quot;when I was still a Bodhisattva&quot;. The only currently active bodhisattva described in thxpected £425m from the sale will be used to reduce the airline's debt mountain it may also be used to fund expansion.

It owns a 9% stake in Spanish airline [[Iberia Airlines|Iberia]].

British Airways is a founding member of the [[oneworld]] [[airline alliance]].

==Incidents and Accidents==
*On the [[24 June]] [[1982]], [[British Airways Flight 009|flight 009]], a 747-200, G-BDXH, ''City of Edinburgh'' flew through a cloud of volcanic ash and dust from the eruption of [[Mount Galunggung]], causing all four engines to fail. The aircraft managed to glide out of the dust cloud and restart three engines, allowing it to make an emergency landing at [[Jakarta]].

*On [[10 June]] [[1990]], [[British Airways Flight 5390]], a [[BAC 1-11]] flight between [[Birmingham]] and [[Malaga]], suffered a windshield blowout. The pilot was partially sucked out of the cockpit but was held back by the crew. The co-pilot landed the plane safely at [[Southampton Airport]] with no fatalities.

* On [[August 2]], [[1990]]- [[British Airways Flight 149]] landed at [[Kuwait International Airport]] four hours after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, leading to the capture of the passengers and crew, and the destruction of the aircraft.

*On [[19 February]] [[2005]], the No 2 engine of a [[Boeing 747]]-400 (G-BNLG) surged and suffered internal damage just after take off from [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] on a flight to [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]] with 16 crew and 351 passengers on board. The crew shut the engine down. They continued the climb and, having checked the performance figures, decided that continuing to [[London]] was possible. Because it was cleared for a lower transatlantic flight level than requested, the aircraft suffered a fuel shortage and had to divert to [[Manchester]]. The [[United States]] [[Federal Aviation Administration]] has been critical of the crew's decision, but there was no breach of regulations and BA has supported the crew decision (ref:Flight International, July 2005).

*On [[25 February]] [[2005]], a crew flying the same aircraft (G-BNLG) also had to shut an engine down, this time in the cruise from [[Singapore]] to [[London]], and the crew again elected to continue. This time they landed without any further incident at their destination (ref: Flight International, July 2005).

==Fleet==
[[Image:ba.a319-131.g-eupo.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|British Airways [[Airbus A319-100]] (G-EUPO)]]
[[image:britaw.a319-100.g-eupu.arp.jpg|thumb|right|250px|British Airways Airbus A319-100 (G-EUPU)]] 

Up until recently for its main fleet, BA had traditionally been a [[Boeing]] customer.  This has been always been a subject of controversy, as many expect that as a British carrier it would be natural for BA to support the British manufacturing industry and buy [[Airbus]] jets ([[BAE Systems]] build all wings for Airbus jets and many Airbus subcontractors are based in the UK).  The company has defended its decision by arguing that, with the exception of 29 of its 777 fleet, it has always equipped its Boeing aircraft with British-made [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] engines; although some of their newer 777s are now powered by Rolls Royce Trents. This goes back to the [[1960s]] when the company ordered [[Boeing 707]]s - a condition was placed on the company that it used Rolls-Royce power for the new jets.

However, it has operated non-Boeing planes in the past mainly as a result of takeovers and joint agreements with other airlines.  One example of this was planes acquired through the buyout of [[British Caledonian|British Caledonian Airways]] in the [[1980s]]; it successfully operated the [[Douglas DC-10]] and [[Airbus A320]] for a number of years. In the late 1990s British Airways placed its own first direct Airbus order, for over 100 A320/A319s to replace its own ageing fleet of Boeing 737s.

BA was an operator of the famous Aerospatiale-BAC [[Concorde (aeroplane)|Concorde]] [[supersonic]] [[airliner]], with a daily service between Heathrow and [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York JFK]] (although the original service was from London to [[Bahrain]]). Initially, Concorde was very much a financial burden, placed on the national carrier by the government, and attracted criticism from the press as a white elephant. However [[John King, Baron King of Wartnaby|Lord King]] recognised the importance of Concorde to British Airways, and the one thing that everybody agreed was the charismatic value of the aircraft. BA used Concorde to win business customers, guaranteeing a certain number of Concorde upgrades in return for corporate accounts with the airline - a key factor in winning business from transatlantic competitors.

With the [[Air France Flight 4590|Paris Crash]] in [[2000]], followed by the 9/11 [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terrorist attacks]] the following year, coupled to escalating maintenance costs, the future of Concorde was limited &amp;mdash; this despite an expensive upgrade. It was announced (on [[10 April]] [[2003]]) that, after [[24 October]] [[2003]], they would cease scheduled services with Concorde, due to depressed passenger numbers. The last day of its Saturday-only London Heathrow to [[Barbados]] Concorde flight was on [[30 August]] [[2003]].

===Current Fleet===
The British Airways fleet consists of the following aircraft (at December 2005):

*33 [[Airbus A319|Airbus A319-100]] (further 3 on order)
* 5 [[Airbus A320|Airbus A320-100]]
*21 [[Airbus A320|Airbus A320-200]] (further 3 on order)
* 7 [[Airbus A321|Airbus A321-200]]
*5 [[Boeing 737-300]]
*18 [[Boeing 737-400]]
*9 [[Boeing 737-500]]
*57 [[Boeing 747-400]]
*13 [[Boeing 757-200]]
*21 [[Boeing 767-300|Boeing 767-300ER]]
*3 [[Boeing 777-200]]
*40 [[Boeing 777-200|Boeing 777-200ER]]

===Future===
The long-term replacement of the 767 fleet is likely to lead to a purchase of the [[Boeing 787]] or [[Airbus A350]].[http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/237717_air24.html]
Additionally it is now seen likely that selection for the replacement of the Boeing 737 Classic fleet of 34 aircraft will see both  [[Airbus A320]] series and [[Boeing 737NG]] evaluated, rather than being a simple follow-on order for additional A320 series aircraft. [http://www.flightinternational.com/Articles/2006/01/17/204072/+BA+grapples+with+747+succession+.html]
British Airways' decision to replace its Boeing 747-400s will be viewed with interest, whether it selects the [[Airbus A380]] or [[Boeing 747-8]].

Since its formation in 1974, though to a limited extent until all aircraft were repainted, British Airways aeroplanes carried a [[Union Flag]] scheme painted on their [[tail fin]]s. In [[1997]], they began to be repainted (and the planes re-named) with abstract world images, [[Delft pottery]] or [[calligraphy|Chinese calligraphy]] for example, relating to countries they fly to. This caused problems with [[air traffic control]]: previously controllers had been able to tell pilots to follow a BA plane, but because they were each painted in different colours they were harder to identify.

[[Margaret Thatcher]] famously covered the tail fin of a model aircraft with the new design using her [[handkerchief]] at the 1997 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] conference. She claimed they made it look like a [[third world]] airline. &quot;We fly the British flag, not these awful things.&quot; 

In [[May 2001]], chief executive [[Rod Eddington]] declared that all BA planes would be repainted with the [[Chatham Dockyard Union Flag]], a design first used on [[Concorde]].

==World Cargo==
BA is, through its subsidiary British Airways World Cargo, the world's fifth-largest [[cargo airline]].  BA World Cargo has extensive global reach through the British Airways scheduled network.  In addition to the main fleet, BA World Cargo [[wet lease]] three [[Boeing 747-400F]] dedicated freighter aircraft from [[Global Supply Systems]] on a long term basis, as well as utilising space on dedicated freighters operated by other carriers on European services.  Dedicated freighter services allow the airline to serve airports not currently connected to the scheduled network, such as [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], [[Glasgow Prestwick International Airport|Glasgow Prestwick]], [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport|Frankfurt-Hahn]], [[Vitoria]] and [[Seoul]].  

British Airways opened its £250m World Cargo centre, ''Ascentis'', at Heathrow in 1999.  As one of the largest and most advanced automated freight handling centres in the world, it contains a Special Handling Centre for unusual and premium cargo, and a Perishables Handling Centre for fresh produce, of which it handles over 80,000 t per year.  BA World Cargo also handles freight at London's Gatwick and Stansted airports, and, through its partner British Airways Regional Cargo, at all of the main regional airports throughout the UK.

*In recent years, British Airways has transported [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] and the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] on official duties, using a dedicated Boeing 777 aircraft. [[Royal Air Force]] transports were traditionally used in such roles.
*British Airways was, together with Virgin Atlantic, a premier partner of the [[London 2012 Olympic bid]] campaign.  One of the airline's Boeing 747-400 aircraft became a &quot;flying petition&quot; for the games, with Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] being the first to sign the aircraft.

[[Image:utility bicycle.jpg|thumb|300px|Dutch utility bicycle featuring rear internal hub brake, chaincase and mudguards, kickstand for parking, permanently attached dynamo-powered lamps and touring handlebars.]]

A '''bicycle''', '''pushbike''', or '''bike''', is a pedal-driven [[land vehicle]] with two [[bicycle wheel|wheel]]s attached to a [[bicycle frame|frame]], one behind the other. First introduced in [[19th century|19th-century]] [[Europe]], bicycles evolved quickly into their familiar, current design. Numbering over 1,000,000,000 in the world today, bicycles provide the principal means of transportation in many regions and a popular form of recreational transport in others. 

The bicycle is one of the most notable of human inventions. The basic shape and configuration of the frame, wheels, pedals, saddle and handlebars has hardly changed since the first chain-driven model was developed around 1885, although many important detail improvements have been made since, especially in recent years using modern materials and computer-aided design. 

A remarkable aspect of the bicycle is its widespread adoption in many different fields of human activity, e.g. as a child's toy, in adult recreation and fitness, as a means of everyday transport, in cyclo-touring, as a basis of cycle sport (branches: track, off-road or MTB, downhill, cyclo-cross, time trialling, road racing, cycle speedway, cycle polo, BMX), and as a basis for static gymnasium or home fitness versions. 

The bicycle has affected history considerably in both the cultural and industrial realms. In its early years, bicycle construction drew on pre-existing technologies; more recently, bicycle technology has contributed, in turn, to other, newer areas.  Beyond recreation and transportation, bicycles have been adapted for use in many occupations, including the military, local policing, courier services, and sports.  A recurrent theme in bicycling has been the tension between bicyclists and drivers of [[motor vehicle]]s, each group arguing for its fair share of the world's roadways. 

==History==
{{main|History of the bicycle}}

No single time or person can be identified with the invention of the bicycle. Its earliest known forebears were called ''[[velocipede]]s'', and included many types of human-powered vehicles.  One of these, the scooter-like ''[[dandy horse]]'' of the French Comte de Sivrac, dating to 1790, was long cited as the earliest bicycle. Most bicycle historians now believe that these hobby-horses with no steering mechanism probably never existed, but were made up by [[Louis Baudry de Saunier]], a 19th-century French bicycle historian.
[[Image:bicycle two 1886.jpg|thumb|280px|A smartly dressed couple seated on an 1886 &quot;[[quadracycle]]&quot; for two.]]
The most likely originator of the bicycle is German [[Karl Drais|Baron Karl von Drais]], who rode his 1817 machine while collecting taxes from his tenants. He patented his ''draisine'', a number of which still exist, including one at the ''Paleis het Loo'' museum in [[Apeldoorn]], [[the Netherlands]]. These were ''pushbikes'', powered by the action of the rider's feet pushing against the ground.  Scottish blacksmith [[Kirkpatrick MacMillan]] shares creative credit with von Drais for adding a ''treadle'' drive mechanism, in 1840, that enabled the rider to lift his feet off the ground while driving the rear wheel. However, some reports describe MacMillan's vehicle as more of a &quot;quadricycle&quot;.

In the 1850s and 1860s, Frenchman Ernest Michaux and his pupil Pierre Lallement took bicycle design in a different direction, placing pedals on an enlarged front wheel.  Their creation, which came to be called the &quot;Boneshaker&quot;, featured a heavy steel frame on which they mounted wooden wheels with iron tires. Lallement emigrated to America, where he recorded a patent on his bicycle in 1866 in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. The Boneshaker was further refined by James Starley in the 1870s.  He mounted the seat more squarely over the pedals, so that the rider could push more firmly, and further enlarged the front wheel to increase the potential for speed. With tires of solid rubber, his machine became known as the ''ordinary''. British cyclists likened the disparity in size of the two wheels to their coinage, nicknaming it the ''[[penny-farthing]]''. The primitive bicycles of this generation were difficult to ride, and the high seat and poor weight distribution made for dangerous falls.
''[[Image:BicyclePlymouth.jpg|left|thumb|Bicycle in Victorian Plymouth, with a predecessor of the Starley diamond-frame]]'' 

The subsequent ''dwarf ordinary'' addressed some of these faults, by adding gearing, reducing the front wheel diameter, and setting the seat further back with no loss of speed. Having to both pedal and steer via the front wheel remained a problem. Starley's nephew, [[J. K. Starley]], J. H. Lawson, and Shergold solved this problem by introducing the ''chain'' and producing rear-wheel drive.   These models were known as ''dwarf safeties'', or ''safety bicycles'', for their lower seat height and better weight distribution.  Starley's 1885 Rover is usually described as the first recognizably modern bicycle.  Soon the ''seat tube'' was added, creating the double-triangle, ''diamond frame'' of the modern bike.

 
While the Starley design was much safer, the return to smaller wheels made for a bumpy ride.  The next innovations increased comfort and ushered in the 1890s ''Golden Age of Bicycles''. In 1888 Scotsman [[John Boyd Dunlop]] introduced the [[pneumatic tire]], which soon became universal. Shortly thereafter the rear [[freewheel]] was developed, enabling the rider to coast without the pedals spinning out of control. This refinement led to the 1898 invention of ''coaster brakes''. [[Derailleur gears]] and hand-operated, [[Bicycle brake systems|cable-pull brakes]] were also developed during these years, but were only slowly adopted by casual riders.  By the turn of the century, bicycling clubs flourished on both sides of the Atlantic, and touring and racing were soon the rage.
''[[Image:Bamboobike.jpg|thumb|American bike from 1896. The frame made of [[bamboo]]]]''
Successful early bicycle manufacturers included Englishman [[Frank Bowden]] and German builder Ignaz Schwinn.  Bowden started the [[Raleigh (bicycle)|Raleigh]] company in Nottingham in the 1890s, and soon was producing some 30,000 bicycles a year. Schwinn emigrated to the United States, where he founded his similarly successful company in Chicago in 1895. [[Schwinn Bicycle Company|Schwinn]] bicycles soon featured widened tires and spring-cushioned, padded seats, sacrificing some efficiency for increased comfort.  Facilitated by connections between European nations and their overseas colonies, European-style bicycles were soon available worldwide.  By the mid-20th century bicycles had become the primary means of transportation for millions of people around the globe.

[[Image:Amsterdam-flowerbike.jpg|thumb|A more-than-typical Amsterdam 'granny bike']]
In many western countries the use of bicycles levelled off or declined, as motorized transportation became affordable and car-centred policies led to an increasingly hostile road environment for bicycles. In North America, bicycle sales declined markedly after 1905, to the point where by the 1940s, they had largely been relegated to the role of children's toys.  In other parts of the world however, such as [[China]], [[India]], and European countries such as [[Germany]], [[Denmark]], and the [[Netherlands]], the traditional utility bicycle remained a mainstay of transportation, its design only gradually changing to incorporate hand-operated brakes and internal hub gears allowing up to seven speeds. In the Netherlands, such so-called 'granny bikes' have remained popular, and are again in production. Especially in [[Amsterdam]] they are often colourfully painted and/or otherwise decorated.

[[Image:Mountain bicycle.jpg|thumb|left|This ''[[Mountain bike|mountain bicycle]]'' features oversized tires, a sturdy frame, front shock absorbers, and handlebars oriented perpendicular to the bike's axis]]
In North America, increasing consciousness of physical fitness and environmental preservation spawned a renaissance of bicycling in the late 1960s. Bicycle sales in the United States boomed, largely in the form of the [[racing bicycle]]s long used in such events as the hugely popular [[Tour de France]]. Sales were also helped by a number of technical innovations that were new to the US market, including higher performance steel alloys and gearsets with an increasing number of gears. While 10-speeds were the rage in the 1970s, 12-speed designs were introduced in the 1980s, and today most bikes feature 18 or more speeds. By the 1980s these newer designs had driven the [[three-speed bicycle]] from the roads. In the late 1980s the [[mountain bike]] became particularly popular, and in the 1990s something of a major fad. These task-specific designs led many American recreational cyclists to demand a more comfortable and practical product.  Manufacturers responded with the [[hybrid bicycle]], which restored many of the features long enjoyed by riders of the time-tested European [[utility bicycle|utility bikes]].

===Legal requirements===
The  1968 [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] considers a bicycle to be a vehicle, and a person controlling a bicycle is considered a driver.  The traffic codes of many countries reflect these definitions and cieties where no monetary system exists, or in economies suffering from a very unstable [[currency]] (as when [[hyperinflation]] hits) or a lack of currency.

A disadvantage of using bilateral barter is that it can depend apon a mutual coincidence of needs. Before any transaction can be undertaken, the needs of one person must mirror the needs of another person.  To overcome this mutual coincidence problem, some communities have developed a system of intermediaries who can store, trade, and warehouse commodities. However, the intermediaries often suffer from financial risk.

To organize production and to distribute goods and services among their populations, many pre-[[capitalist]] or pre-market economies relied on [[tradition]], top-down [[command]], or community [[democracy]] instead of market exchange organized using barter. Relations of [[reciprocity]] and/or [[redistribution]] substituted for market exchange. Trade and barter were primarily reserved for trade between communities or countries. 

Barter becomes more and more difficult as people become dispossesed of the means of production to produce needed products, including their subsistence. For example, if money were to be severly devalued in the United States, most people would have very little of value to trade for food (since the farmer can only use so many cars, etc.)

In [[finance]], the word &quot;barter&quot; is used when two corporations trade with each other using non-money financial assets (such as U.S. Treasury bills). Alternatively, the standard definitions of [[money]] could be seen as being too narrow and needing to be expanded to increase near-money assets.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:BertheMorisot.jpg|right|thumbnail|180px|Berthé Morisot in a portrait by [[Édouard Manet]], 1872]]
'''Berthe Morisot''' ([[January 14]], [[1841]] &amp;ndash; [[March 2]], [[1895]]) was an [[impressionist]] [[painter]].

Born in [[Bourges]], [[Cher (département)|Cher]], [[France]] into a successful bourgeois family who encouraged her and her sister [[Edma Morisot]] in their exploration of art, she demonstrated the possibilities for women artists in [[avant-garde]] art movements at the end of the [[19th century]]. Once Morisot settled on pursuing art, her family did not impede her career.

By age 20, she met and befriended the important landscape painter of the [[Barbizon school]], [[Camille Corot]], who introduced her to other artists and teachers. She took up [[plein air]] techniques and painted small pieces outdoors either as finished works or as studies for larger works completed in the studio.

Morisot's first acceptance in the [[Paris Salon|Salon de Paris]] came in [[1864]] with two landscape paintings, and she continued to show regularly in the Salon until [[1874]], the year of the first impressionist exhibition.

She was acquainted with [[Édouard Manet]] from [[1868]], and in [[1874]] she married Eugene Manet, Édouard's younger brother. She convinced Manet to attempt [[plein air]] painting, and drew him into the circle of acquaintance of the painters who became known as the impressionists. However, he never considered himself an impressionist or agreed to show with the group.

[[Image:BMorisot.JPG|left|thumbnail|256px|''L'Enfant au Tablier Rouge'']]

Morisot, along with [[Camille Pissarro]], was one of only two artists whose work exhibited in all of the original impressionist shows.

Like [[Mary Cassatt]], during her lifetime, Berthé Morisot was relegated to the category of &quot;feminine&quot; artists because of their usual subject matter &amp;mdash; women, children, and domestic scenes. However, as a doctrinaire impressionist, Morisot painted what she saw in her immediate, everyday life. As a woman securely in the &quot;haute bourgeoisie&quot; she saw domestic interiors, holiday spots, other women, and children. Without exception, her subject matter shows the equivalent of that of her impressionist colleagues. [[Edgar Degas]], the dandy male bourgeois, painted rehearsals of the ballet, horse races, and nude women in apartments (rather than studios). [[Claude Monet]] painted his garden, his children, and his neighbor's haystacks. Female impressionists painted their social milieu in a way consistent with the impressionist approach to subject matter. 

Berthé Morisot died on March 2, [[1895]] in [[Paris]] and was interred in the [[Cimetière de Passy]].

Today, her paintings can sell for more than [[United States dollar|$]]4 million.

[[Image:McDonalds.png|thumb|100px|[[McDonald's]], represented by the [[Golden Arches]], is one of the world's most famous brands]]

In ''[[marketing]]'', a '''brand''' is the [[symbolism|symbolic]] embodiment of all the information connected with a company, [[product (business)|product]] or [[service]]. A brand typically includes a name, [[logo]], and other visual elements such as [[image]]s, fonts, color schemes, or [[symbol]]s. It also encompasses the [[set]] of [[expectation]]s associated with a product or service which typically arise in the minds of people. Such people include employees of the brand owner, people involved with distribution, sale or supply of the product or service, and ultimately [[consumer]]s.  

In other contexts the term &quot;brand&quot; may be used where the legal term [[trademark]] is more appropriate.

==Concepts==

Some marketers distinguish the psychological aspect of a brand from the experiential aspect. The experiential aspect consists of the sum of all points of contact with the brand and is known as the '''brand experience'''. The psychological aspect, sometimes referred to as the '''brand image''', is a symbolic construct created within the minds of people and consists of all the information and expectations associated with a product or service. The unicist approach to brand building considers the conceptual structure of brands, businesses and people.

Marketers seek to develop or align the expectations comprising the brand experience through '''branding''', so that a brand carries the &quot;promise&quot; that a product or service has a certain quality or characteristic which make it special or unique. A brand image may be developed by attributing a &quot;personality&quot; to or associating an &quot;image&quot; with a product or service, whereby the personality or image is &quot;branded&quot; into the consciousness of consumers. A brand is therefore one of the most valuable elements in an [[advertising]] theme, as it demonstrates what the brand owner is able to offer in the [[marketplace]]. The art of creating and maintaining a brand is called [[brand management]]. You're creating the story.

A brand which is widely known in the marketplace acquires '''brand recognition'''. Where brand recognition builds up to a point where a brand enjoys a mass of positive sentiment in the marketplace, it is said to have achieved '''brand franchise'''.  One goal in brand recognition is the identification of a brand without the name of the company present.  [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] has been successful at branding with their particular script font (originally Walt Disney's signature, but later translated to go.com).

'''[[Brand equity]]''' measures the total value of the brand to the brand owner, and reflects the extent of brand franchise. The term '''brand name''' is often used interchangeably with &quot;brand&quot;, although it is more correctly used to specifically denote written or spoken linguistic elements of a brand. In this context a &quot;brand name&quot; constitutes a type of [[trademark]], if the brand name exclusively identifies the brand owner as the commercial source of products or services. A brand owner may seek to protect [[proprietary]] rights in relation to a brand name through trademark registration.

The act of associating a product or service with a brand has become part of [[pop culture]]. Most products have some kind of brand identity, from common [[edible salt|table salt]] to [[designer]] clothes. In non-commercial contexts, the marketing of entities which supply ideas or promises rather than product and services (eg. [[political party |political parties]] or religious organizations) may also be known as &quot;branding&quot;.

Consumers may look on branding as an important [[value added]] aspect of products or services, as it often serves to denote a certain attractive quality or characteristic. From the perspective of brand owners, branded products or services also command higher prices. Where two products resemble each other, but one of the products has no associated branding (such as a [[generic]], store-branded product), people may often select the more expensive branded product on the basis of the quality of the brand or the reputation of the brand owner.

Advertising spokespersons have also become part of some brands, for example:  [[Mr. Whipple]] of [[Charmin]] toilet tissue and [[Tony the Tiger]] of [[Kellogg Company | Kellogg]]&amp;#8217;s.

==History==

Brands in the field of marketing originated in the [[19th century]] with the advent of packaged [[good (accounting) | goods]]. [[Industrialization | Industrialization]] moved the production of many household items, such as soap, from local communities to centralized [[factory | factories]]. When shipping their items, the factories would literally [[Livestock_branding | brand]] their logo or insignia on the barrels used, which is where the term comes from.

These factories, generating mass-produced goods, needed to sell their products to a wider market, to a customer base familiar only with local goods. It quickly became apparent that a generic package of soap had difficulty competing with familiar, local products. The packaged goods manufacturers needed to convince the market that the public could place just as much trust in the non-local product.

Around [[1900]], [[James Walter Thompson]] published a house ad explaining trademark advertising. This was an early commercial explanation of what we now know as branding.

Many brands of that era, such as [[Uncle Ben's]] rice and [[Kellogg Company | Kellogg's]] breakfast cereal furnish illustrations of the problem. The manufacturers wanted their products to appear and feel as familiar as the local farmers' produce. From there, with the help of advertising, manufacturers quickly learned to associate other kinds of brand values, such as youthfulness, fun or luxury, with their products. This kickstarted the practice we now know as branding.

Modern branding practices are studied and analyzed at research institutes such as the [[Zyman Institute of Brand Science]] at the Goizueta  Business School at Emory University.

== Criticisms of branding ==
Criticism has been leveled against the concept and implementation of brands, much of it associated with the &quot;[[antiglobalization]]&quot; movement. One of the better known criticisms of branding is found in [[Naomi Klein]]'s book, ''[[No Logo]].'' The book claims that corporations' brands serve as structures for corporations to hide behind, and that such global problems as sweatshop labor and environmental degradation have been permitted and exacerbated by branding.

Criticism of branding also comes from within corporations, with some employees becoming frustrated by being limited by overall brand strategies that restrict what they can say, how they say it, and what [[Pantone]] colour to say it in. Some shareholders also have concerns about the amount of money invested in branding.

Skepticism toward branding has also grown in parts of the marketing community since the end of the dotcom boom, though for a very different reason: in many ways, branding has failed to live up to its promise.

In addition, the value of the brand itself is hard to quantify because it is intangible in nature. In cases where this value is significant, it allows the company to manipulate its accounting reports around this issue.

'''Barnard College''', founded in [[1889]], is an [[independent college]] of [[liberal arts]] and sciences for women, located in the borough of [[Manhattan]], in [[New York, New York]], [[United States]]. Barnard is affiliated with [[Columbia University]], but maintains an independent [[campus]], faculty, administration, trustees, operating budget, and endowment, although there is much overlap. 

The four acre (16,000&amp;nbsp;mto the tunnel.

The system was originally built as a patchwork of local rail links operated by small private railway companies. Over the course of the [[19th century|19th]] and early [[20th century|20th centuries]] these amalgamated or were bought by competitors until only a handful of larger companies remained (see [[railway mania]]). The entire network of was brought under government control during the [[World War I|first World War]], and a number of advantages of amalgamation and planning were revealed. However, the government resisted calls for the [[nationalization]] of the network (first proposed by [[William Gladstone]] as early the 1830s). Instead, from [[January 1]] [[1923]] the remaining companies were [[Railways Act 1921|grouped]] into the &quot;big four&quot;, the [[Great Western Railway]], the [[London and North Eastern Railway]], the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] and the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] companies. These were joint stock public companies and they continued to run the railway system until [[December 31]] [[1947]]. 

The growth in road transport during the [[1920s]] and [[1930s]] greatly reduced revenue for the rail companies. Rail companies accused the government of favouring road haulage through the subsidised construction of roads. The railways entered a slow decline owing to a lack of investment and changes in transport policy and lifestyles. During the [[World War II|second World War]] the companies' managements joined together, effectively forming one company. A maintenance backlog developed during the war, and the private sector only had two years to deal with this after the war ended. After [[1945]], for both practical and ideological reasons, the government decided to bring the rail service into the [[public sector]].

From the first moment of 1948, the &quot;big four&quot; were [[nationalization|nationalised]] to form [[British Railways]] (latterly &quot;British Rail&quot;) under the control of the [[British Transport Commission]]. Although BR was a single entity, it was divided into six (later five) regional authorities in accordance with the existing areas of operation. Though there were no initial changes to the service, usage increased and the network became profitable. Regeneration of track and stations was completed by 1954. In the same year, changes to the British Transport Commission, including the privatisation of road haulage, ended the coordination of transport in the UK. Rail revenue fell and in 1955 the network again ceased to be profitable. The mid-[[1950s]] saw the rapid introduction of diesel and electric rolling stock, however the expected transfer back from road to rail did not occur and losses began to mount.

The desire for profitability led to a major reduction in the network during the mid-[[1960s]] after the [[Stedeford Committee]], chaired by Dr [[Richard Beeching]], reviewed the railway network (also known as the &quot;[[Beeching axe]]&quot;). Many branch lines, particularly in rural areas, were closed because they were deemed inefficient. The closure of stations serving rural communities removed much feeder traffic from the main line passenger services. The closure of many freight depots that had been used by larger industries such as [[coal]] and [[iron]] led to almost all freight transferring to road haulage. This neutralised any savings made by the closures, and the network began to decline again. The closures were extremely unpopular with the general public at that time, and remain so today.

Although passenger services experienced a brief renaissance with the introduction of high-speed inter-city trains in the [[1970s]], the decline of the rail network continued. Passenger levels have fluctuated since this time, increasing during periods of economic growth and falling during recessions. The [[1980s]] saw severe cuts in government funding and above-[[inflation]] increases in fares. The service became more cost-effective but increasingly unreliable. In the early [[1990s]] the five geographical Regions were replaced by a Sector organisation, where passenger services were organised into Inter City, Network SouthEast, Other Provincial Services sectors, etc. This new organisation showed promise of being a more efficient organisation of the railways, but within a couple of years of its implementation the structure was fragmented by the [[privatisation]] process. 

[[Privatisation of British Rail|Railway operations were privatised]] during [[1994]]-[[1997]]. Ownership of the track and infrastructure passed to a company called [[Railtrack]], whilst passenger operations were franchised to individual private sector operators (originally there were 25 franchises) and the freight services sold outright (6 companies were set up, but 5 of these were sold to the same buyer). The government claimed that privatisation would see an improvement in passenger services: this outcome has not yet been realised, although passenger levels initially increased to the level they had been at in the late-1980s. A series of major rail accidents after privatisation &amp;mdash; at [[Ladbroke Grove rail crash|Ladbroke Grove]], [[Hatfield rail crash|Hatfield]], [[Potters Bar rail crash|Potters Bar]], and [[Great Heck rail crash|Selby]] &amp;mdash; caused widespread loss of confidence in the safety of rail travel.

After the Hatfield crash, speed limits were drastically reduced throughout Britain and train travel was seriously disrupted for months.  Railtrack came close to [[bankruptcy]] due to the enormous cost of additional safety measures and was effectively re-nationalised, when ownership of the railway system was transferred to the newly-created &quot;not for profit&quot; company limited by guarantee,  [[Network Rail]] on [[October 3]], [[2002]]. Most of the private rail companies are heavily subsidised but much of the investment has not gone into regeneration or modernisation. However, the government has resisted public pressure to return the network to the [[public sector]].

==Geography &amp; infrastructure==
Great Britain is an island roughly triangular with an acute apex. The capital, [[London]], is in the south-east. Main railway lines radiate from London in many directions; the major lines are discussed elsewhere (''see linkbox, below''). 

At the end of September 2003 the first part of the [[Channel Tunnel Rail Link]], a high speed link to the [[Channel Tunnel]] and on to [[France]] and [[Belgium]], was completed, significantly adding to the rail infrastructure of the country. The rest of the link, from north Kent to [[St Pancras railway station]] in London, is planned to open in 2007. A major programme of remedial work on the [[West Coast Main Line]] is ongoing.

{{Seealso|List of railway lines in Great Britain}}

==Passenger services==

Passenger train services in the UK are, in the main, structured on the basis of regional franchises awarded by the [[Department for Transport]] (DfT) to [[List of UK Train Operating Companies|Train Operating Companies]]. There were initially 25 such franchises from April 2004, but the number of different operating companies is smaller as some firms including FirstGroup, National Express and Stagecoach have more than one franchise. In addition some franchises have since been combined. There are a number of local or specialised rail services franchised by local government or operated on an 'open access' basis outside the franchise arrangements. Examples include the [[Heathrow Express]] and [[Hull Trains]].

In the 2002&amp;ndash;3 operating year, franchised services provided 976 million journeys totalling 39.7 billion passenger kilometres of travel, which was an increase over 1986&amp;ndash;7 of 32% in journeys (from 738 million) and 29% in passenger kilometres (from 30.8 billion). On the other hand, taking a longer term view the number of journeys in 2002&amp;ndash;3 was lower than for the 1950&amp;ndash;60 period; the passenger kilometres figure, after being a flat from 1965&amp;ndash;1995, surpassed the 1947 figure for the first time in 1998, and continues to rise steeply.

The key index used to assess passenger train performance is the ''Public Performance Measure'' which combines figures for punctuality and reliability. Performance against this metric has been expecially poor since mid-2000. From a base of 90% of trains arriving on time in 1998, the measure dipped to 75% in mid 2001, and by the end of the 2002&amp;ndash;3 period, had only recovered to 80%.

The real increase in rail fares after accounting for [[inflation]] over the 1995&amp;ndash;2004 period was 4.7%.

Average rolling stock age &amp;mdash; thought to be an indicator of passenger comfort &amp;mdash; fell slightly from the third quarter of 2001&amp;ndash;2 to the third quarter of 2003&amp;ndash;4, from 20.7 years old, to 19.3 years old.

See [[List of UK Train Operating Companies]]

==Freight services==

There are four main freight operating companies, the largest of which is [[English, Welsh and Scottish Railway]] (EWS). There are also several smaller independent operators including [[Mendip Rail]]. Types of freight carried include ''[[intermodal freight transport|intermodal]]'' &amp;mdash; in essence containerised freight &amp;mdash; and coal, metals, oil, and construction material. Freight services have been in steady decline since the [[1950s]], although the [[Department for Transport]]'s ''Transport Ten Year Plan'' calls for an 80% increase in rail freight measured from a 2000&amp;ndash;1 base. 

Statistics on freight are specified in terms of the weight of freight lifted, and the ''net tonne kilometre''. being freight weight multiplied by distance carried. 87 million tonnes of freight was lifted in the 2002&amp;ndash;3 period, against 138 million tonnes in 1986&amp;ndash;7, a decrease of 37%. 18.7 billion net rail kilometres of freight movement were recorded in 2002&amp;ndash;3, against 16.6 billion in 1986&amp;ndash;7, an increase of 13%. 

A symbolic loss to the UK rail freight industry was the custom of the [[Royal Mail]], which from 2004 is discontinuing use of its 49-train fleet, and switching to road haulage after a near 170 year preference for trains. Red liveried [[mail train]]s have long been part of the tradition of the UK railways, not least because of the film ''[[Night Mail]]'', for which [[W. H. Auden]] wrote  the poem of the same name.

==Leasing services==
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em; font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;[[Image:Class 47 railway locomotive - Fragonset Black livery - Victoria Water railway station - 280404.jpg|thumbnail|none|Class 47 railway locomotive, hired from Fragonset Railways, Virginia Water railway station, April 2004 ]]&lt;/div&gt;
A proportion of the rolling stock of [[British Rail]] was sold off to companies that lease or hire stock to passenger and freight operators, as well as to [[National Rail]] and railway maintenance companies. Leasing is relatively commonplace in public transportation, since it enables operating companies to avoid the complication associated with raising sufficient capital to purchase assets; instead, assets are leased and paid for from ongoing revenue.

There are three major leasing companies, and a number of smaller operations:
===Leasing Companies===
* '''[[Angel Trains]]''', owned by the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], and which claims to be the biggest rolling stock company in Britain, with some 5,000 assets. [http://www.angeltrains.co.uk/ website]
* '''[[HSBC Rail]]''' a lessor of domestic passenger rolling stock, owned by [[HSBC]].
* '''[[Porterbrook]]''', owned by the [[Abbey National]] Group, which leases some 3,500 locomotives, trains and freight wagons. [http://www.porterbrook.co.uk/english/frame.html website]

===Spot-Hire Companies===
*'''[[Cotswold Rail]]''', a spot-hire company with a stock of [[British Rail Class 08|Class 08]] shunting locomotives, and [[British Rail Class 47|Class 47]] locomotives. This company works closely with [[Anglia Railways]].[http://www.cotswoldrail.com/homeset.htm website]
*'''[[FM Rail]]''' (formerly Fragonset Railways), a spot-hire company with a stock of [[British Rail Class 08|Class 08]] shunting locomotives, and [[British Rail Class 31|Class 31]], [[British Rail Class 33|Class 33]], [[British Rail Class 45|Class 45]], [[British Rail Class 47|Class 47]], [[British Rail Class 56|Class 56]], [[British Rail Class 73|Class 73]] and [[British Rail Class 86|Class 86]] main line locomotives. [http://www.fmrail.com/ website]
*'''[[GL Railease]]''' owned by GATX Capital, and Lombard, a subsidiary of  the Royal Bank of Scotland.
*'''[[Harry Needle Railroad Company]] Ltd''', an industrial and main line locomotive hire and overhaul company. Operates [[British Rail Class 08|Class 08]] shunting locomotives, and [[British Rail Class 37|Class 37]] locomotives. [http://www.hnrc.co.uk/ website]
*'''[[Riviera Trains]]''', a spot-hire company with a fleet of [[British Rail Class 47|Class 47]] locomotives.
*'''[[RT Rail]]''', a small hire company with a stock of [[British Rail Class 08|Class 08]] shunting locomotives.
*'''[[West Coast Railway Company]]''', a spot-hire and railtour-operator with a stock of [[British Rail Class 37|Class 37]] and  [[British Rail Class 47|Class 47]] locomotives, as well as the prototype passenger [[British Rail Class 57|Class 57]] locomotive.

{{Template:British_Rail_Spot_Hire_Companies}}

==Statutory framework==

UK railways are run at arm's length from the government, through two government organisations, both of which have statutory powers under various Acts of Parliament (such as the Railways Act 1993, the Competition Act 1998 and the Transport Act 2000), and both of which receive Directions and Guidance from the Secretaries of State for Transport.

The two organisations share the same purpose, but have different jurisdictions; the two entered into a concordat in February 2002 to clarify demarcation and communications issues.

The [[Strategic Rail Authority]] is the statutory strategic planning and coordinating body for the rail industry, and the guardian of passenger and freight interests.  It determines strategy for passenger and freight train services, let and manages franchises to operators, and enforces consumer protection franchise licence conditions.  Following the 2004 Rail Review, the SRA is to be wound up and its responsibilities transferred to the Government and [[Network Rail]].

The [[Office of Rail Regulation]] has as its principal functions to regulate Network Rail's stewardship of the national rail network infrastructure, and to hold train operating companies accountable to the terms of their operating licence. It replaced the [[Office of Rail Regulation]] in 2004.

In addition, safety in the railway industry is regulated and enforced by the [[Health and Safety Executive]], and the [[National Audit Office]] provides audit reports on Network Rail to the [[House of Commons]].

See also: [[Structure of the rail industry in the United Kingdom]].

==Local metro systems==

A number of towns and cities have [[metro]] systems:
{{Britishmetros}}

==UK railway stations==
Most UK [[railway station]]s date from the [[Victorian era]] and are located on the edge of [[town centre]]s.  Major stations are generally in large cities, with a particular concentration in [[London]], but some important railway junction stations lie in smaller cities, for example [[Crewe station]] and [[Carlisle station]]. Other places expanded into towns and cities because of the railway network, [[Swindon]] for example was little more than a village prior to the [[Great Western Railway]] siting their locomotive works there.

==Grouping (1923&amp;ndash;1947)==
Under the [[Railways Act 1921]] the majority of the railway companies in Great Britain (and few in Northern Ireland) were grouped into four main companies, often termed the ''Big Four'': the grouping took effect from [[1 January]] [[1923]]. The Big Four were:
*[[Great Western Railway]]                     (GWR)
*[[London and North Eastern Railway]]          (LNER)
*[[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]]      (LMS)
*[[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]]    (SR)

'''British Railways (BR)''', later rebranded as '''British Rail''', ran the [[Rail transport in the United Kingdom|British railway system]] from the [[nationalisation]] of the 'Big Four' British [[railway]] companies in 1948 until its [[Privatisation of British Rail|privatisation]] in stages between 1994 and 1997.

This period saw massive changes in the nature of the railway network: steam traction was eliminated in favour of diesel and electric power, passengers replaced freight as the main source of business, and the network was severely rationalised.

==History==
=== Background ===
[[Image:British Railways Eastern Region timetable for Summer 1963.jpg|thumb|right|British Railways [[Eastern Region of British Railways|Eastern Region]] [[timetable]] for Summer 1963.]]
The [[rail transport in Great Britain|rail transport system in Great Britain]] developed during the 19th century.  After the grouping of 1923 by the [[Railways Act 1921]] there were four large British railway companies, each dominating its own geographic area.  These were the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR), the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] (LMS), the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] (LNER) and the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] (SR).

The [[London Underground]] and the [[Glasgow Subway]] were independent concerns and there was a small number of indeHunt]] (1749-1752)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bakelite''' is a [[brand name]]d material based on the [[thermosetting plastic|thermosetting]] [[phenol formaldehyde resin]] [[polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride]], developed in [[1907]]-[[1909]] by Dr. [[Leo Baekeland]]. Formed by the reaction under heat and pressure of [[phenol]] and [[formaldehyde]], generally with a wood flour filler, it was the first plastic made from synthetic polymers. It was used for its [[nonconductor|nonconductive]] and heat-resistant properties in radio and telephone casings and electrical [[insulators]].
[[image:Bakelit Struktur.png|thumb|right|300px|Structure of Bakelite]]
Due to its hardness and durability, it was considered as a material for making [[Penny (U.S. coin)|pennies]] in the United States during World War II, due to copper being needed for shell casings.  Several patterns were made in [[1942]], but steel was used instead in [[1943]] and recycled shell casings in [[1944]] and [[1945]].

Bakelite Corp. was formed in 1922 from General Bakelite Co., Condensite Corp. and [[Redmanol Chemical Products Company|Redmanol Co]].  The company was acquired by Union Carbide and Carbon Corp. in 1938.

Bakelite Limited was formed in [[1927]] from the amalgamation of three suppliers of phenol formaldehyde materials: the Damard Lacquer Company Limited of [[Birmingham]]; Mouldensite Limited of Darley Dale and Redmanol Limited of [[London]]. Around [[1928]], A new factory opened in [[Tyseley]], Birmingham in September [[1931]]. It was demolished in [[1998]].

[[Phenolics]] are little used in general consumer products today due to the cost and complexity of production and their brittle nature. An exception to the overall decline is the use in small precision-shaped components where their specific properties are required, such as molded disc brake cylinders, saucepan handles, electrical plugs and switches, and electrical iron parts. 

The [[retro]] appeal of old Bakelite products, especially [[kitchenware]] and [[toys]], has made them quite collectible in recent years: A quick search of, for example, [[eBay]] turns up hundreds of listings for all things Bakelite, ranging from radios to poker chips to telephones.

[[Image:Heaps of beans.jpg|thumb|250px|Green beans]]

'''Bean''' is a common name for large plant [[seed]]s of several [[genus|genera]] of [[Fabaceae]] (formerly Leguminosae) used for food or feed.


== Name ==
''Bean'' originally meant the seed of the [[Vicia faba|broad bean]], but was later broadened to include members of the genus ''[[Phaseolus]]'' such as the [[common bean]] or haricot and the [[runner bean]] and the related genus ''[[Vigna]]''. The term is now applied in a general way to many other related plants such as [[soybean]]s, [[pea]]s, [[lentil]]s, [[vetch]]es and [[lupin]]s.  

Some raw beans, for example kidney beans, contain harmful toxins which need to be removed, usually by various methods of soaking and cooking. The soaking water from kidney beans should be discarded before boiling, and some authorities recommend changing the water during cooking as well. Cooking beans in a crockpot, because of the lower temperatures used, does not destroy toxins even though the beans do not smell or taste 'bad'.  Beans have been known to produce prodigious quantities of intestinal gas in some people; resulting in pronouced [[flatulence]].

[[Image:Beans.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Dry beans]]
''Bean'' can be used as a near synonym of [[pulse (legume)|pulse]], ''i.e.'' an edible [[legume]], though the term &quot;pulses&quot; is usually reserved for those leguminous crops which are harvested for their dry grain. Pulses then exclude those crops mainly used for oil extraction (like [[soybean]] and [[peanut]]) or those used exclusively for sowing purposes ([[clover]] and [[alfalfa]]). Leguminous crops harvested green for food like snap beans, green peas etc. are classified as vegetable crops. 

In English usage beans sometimes also refer to seeds or other organs of non ''leguminosae'', for example [[coffee]] beans, [[castor bean]]s and [[cacao|cocoa bean]]s (which resemble bean seeds), and [[Vanilla|vanilla beans]] (which resemble the pods).

==Cultural aspects==
The following traditional uses of beans refer to the [[Vicia faba|broad bean]].

*In ancient [[Greece]] and [[Rome]], beans were used in voting (a white bean meant ''yes'' and a black bean meant ''no'') and as a food for the dead, such as during the annual [[Feast of the Lemures|Lemuria]] festival.

*In some folk legends, such as in [[Estonia]] and the common [[Jack and the Beanstalk]] story, magical beans grow tall enough to bring the hero to the clouds.  The [[Grimm Brothers]] collected a story in which a bean splits its sides laughing at the failure of others.

*Dreaming of a bean is sometimes said to be a sign of impending conflict, though others said they caused bad dreams.

*[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] claimed that beans act as a [[laxative]] (A possible reference to the [[Castor Bean]]).

*European folklore also claims that planting beans on [[Good Friday]] or during the night-time is good luck.

*&quot;[[Beans Beans the Magical Fruit...]]&quot; is a children's song about beans' capacity for causing [[flatulence]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The term '''''breast''''', also known by the [[Latin]] '''''mamma''''' in [[anatomy]], refers to the upper ventral region of an animal's [[torso]], particularly that of [[mammal|mammals]], including [[human|human beings]]. In addition, the '''breasts''' are parts of a female mammal's body which contain the [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] that secrete [[milk]] used to feed [[infant]]s.

This article focuses on [[human anatomy | human]] [[female]] breasts, but it should be noted that [[man|male]] humans also have breasts (although usually less prominent) that are structurally identical and [[homologous]] to the female, as they develop [[embryology|embryologically]] from the same tissues. While the [[Mammary gland|mammary glands]] that produce milk are present in the male, they normally remain undeveloped. In some situations male breast development does occur, a condition called [[gynecomastia]].  Milk production can also occur in both men and women as an [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effect]] of some medicinal [[medication|drugs]] (such as some [[antipsychotic]] medication) or in endocrine disorders. 

==Anatomy of the female breast==
[[Image:illu_breast_anatomy.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cross section of the breast of a human female.]]
The breasts are covered by [[skin]]; each breast has one [[nipple]] surrounded by the [[areola]]. The areola is colored from pink to dark brown, hairless, and has several [[sebaceous gland]]s. The larger [[mammary gland]]s within the breast produce the milk; they consist of several ''lobules'', and each breast has some 10-20 ''lactiferous ducts'' that drain milk from the lobules to the nipple, where each duct has its own opening, 

Most of the breast is [[connective tissue]], i.e., [[adipose tissue]] (fat) and [[Cooper's ligaments]]. The breasts sit over the [[pectoralis major]] muscle and usually extend from the level of the 2nd rib to the level of the 6th rib [[Anatomical terms of location|anteriorly]]. The [[Anatomical terms of location|superior lateral]] quadrant of the breast extends diagonally upwards in an '[[axillary tail]]'. A thin layer of [[mammary tissue]] extends from the [[clavicle]] above to the seventh or eighth ribs below and from the midline to the edge of the [[latissimus dorsi]] [[Anatomical terms of location|posteriorly]].

The [[artery|arterial]] [[blood]] [[Circulatory system|supply]] to the breasts is derived from the [[internal thoracic artery]] (previously referred to as the ''internal mammary artery''), [[lateral thoracic artery]], [[thoracoacromial artery]], and [[posterior intercostal arteries]].  The [[vein|venous]] drainage of the breast is mainly to the [[axillary vein]], but there is some drainage to the [[internal thoracic vein]].

The breast is [[Peripheral nervous system|innervated]] by the anterior and lateral cutaneous branches of the 4th through 6th intercostal [[nerve]]s. The nipple is supplied by the T4 [[dermatomic area|dermatome]].

Both sexes have a large concentration of [[blood vessel]]s and [[nerve]]s in their [[nipple]]s. 

===Lymphatic drainage ===
About 75% of [[lymph]] from the breast travels to the [[Wiktionary:ipsilateral|ipsilateral]] axillary [[lymph node]]s. The rest travels to parasternal nodes, to the other breast, or abdominal lymph nodes. The axillary nodes include the pectoral, subscapular, and humeral groups of [[lymph]] nodes. These drain to the central axillary lymph nodes, then to the apical axillary lymph nodes. The lymphatic drainage of the breasts is particularly relevant to [[oncology]], since [[cancer]] cells can break away from a [[tumour]] ([[breast cancer]] being a common cancer), and spread to other parts of the body through the lymph system by a process known as [[metastasis|metastasis]].

==Function==
The function of the [[mammary gland]]s in female breasts is to nurture the young by producing [[milk]], which emanates from the [[nipple]]s during [[lactation]]. However, [[zoologists]] point out that no female [[mammal]] other than the human has breasts of comparable size when not lactating and that humans are the only [[primate]] that have permanently swollen breasts. This suggests that the external form of the breasts is connected to factors other than lactation alone.

The mammary glands that secrete the milk from the breasts actually make up a relatively small fraction of the overall breast tissue. It is commonly assumed by biologists that the real [[Human evolution|evolutionary]] purpose of women having breasts is to attract the male of the species; that, in other words, breasts are a sexually dimorphic, or [[secondary sex characteristic]]s. One theory is based around the fact that, unlike nearly all other primates, human females do not display clear, physical signs of [[ovulation]]. This could have plausibly resulted in human males evolving to respond to more subtle signs of ovulation. During ovulation, the increased [[estrogen]] present in the female body results in a slight swelling of the breasts, which then males could have evolved to find attractive. In response, there would be evolutionary pressures that would favor females with more swollen breasts who would, in a manner of speaking, appear to males to be the most likely to be ovulating.

Some biologists (notably [[Desmond Morris]]) believe that the shape of female breasts evolved as a frontal counterpart to that of the [[buttocks]], the reason being that whilst other primates mate in the typical piggy-back position, humans are more likely to successfully [[copulate]] mating face on. A secondary sexual characteristic on a woman's chest would have encouraged this in more primitive incarnations of the human race, and a face on encounter would have helped found a relationship between partners beyond merely a sexual one.

Others believe that the human breast evolved in order to prevent infants from suffocating while feeding&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.breastfeeding.com/reading_room/breasts_shaped_babies.html]&lt;/sup&gt;. Since human infants do not have a protruding [[jaw]] like our ancestors and the other [[primate|primates]], the infant's [[nose]] might be blocked by a flat female chest while feeding. According to this theory, as the human jaw became recessed, so the breasts became larger to compensate.

==Size, shape and composition==
[[Image:Breasts4.jpg|thumb|230px|right|[[Human]] [[female]] breasts]]
Most of the human female breast is actually [[adipose tissue]] ([[fat]]) and [[connective tissue]], rather than the mammary glands. There is naturally a great variety in the size and shape of breasts in women (and men), with size being affected by various factors including [[genetics]].

The primary anatomical support for the breasts is thought to be provided by the [[Cooper's ligaments]], with additional support from the [[skin]] covering the breasts themselves, and it is this support which determines the shape of the breasts. The breasts naturally sag through [[ageing]], as the [[ligaments]] become elongated. This process may be accelerated by high impact [[exercise]]s, and a [[brassiere]] may reduce this effect by providing external support, although the health benefits of wearing of a brassiere are not universally accepted. Sagging breasts ([[ptosis]]) are considered undesirable by some, and some older women seek [[cosmetic surgery]] to raise their busts.

As breasts are mostly composed of adipose tissue, their size can change over time if the woman gains or loses [[human weight|weight]].  It is also typical for them to grow in size during [[pregnancy]] and whilst [[breastfeeding]], mainly due to [[hypertrophy]] of the mammary gland in response to the [[hormone]] [[prolactin]]. The size of a woman's breasts usually fluctuates during the [[menstrual cycle]], particularly with [[premenstrual water retention]]. An increase in breast size is also a common [[side effect]] of use of the [[contraceptive pill]].

There is no relationship between breast size and ability to [[breastfeed]], and it is a common misconception that human female breasts are shaped the way they are so that they can feed babies by producing milk. Their shape is thought to have [[human evolution|evolved]] due to [[sexual attraction]], as described above.

The size of a woman's breasts is typically expressed as a &quot;[[Brassiere#Bra sizes|bra size]]&quot;.  According to the results of the &quot;Size UK&quot; survey &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.sizeuk.org/]&lt;/sup&gt;, the average bra size in the UK has increased from a 34B in the 1950s to a 36C today, and the average size for [[United States| U.S.]] women is a 34B as of [[2005]] by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|CDC]]. Women with exceptionally large breasts may experience [[back pain]], whilst in some [[Western world|Western societies]] there is a belief amongst some that small breasts make a woman less [[breast fetishism|sexually attractive]]. Some women suffer from insecurity about their breasts, and in some cultures a number of women who are unhappy with their size seek [[surgery]] either to artificially [[breast reduction|reduce]] or [[breast enlargement|enlarge]] their breasts.  The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery found that 334,052 breast augmentation procedures were performed in 2004 [http://www.cosmeticplasticsurgerystatistics.com/statistics.html#2004-HIGHLIGHTS].  Some women undergo [[breast reconstruction]] after [[mastectomy]] for [[breast cancer]], a result of the high value placed on [[symmetry]] of the female human form in those  cultures, and because women often identify their femininity and sense of self with their breasts.

It is typical for a woman's breasts to be unequal in size (statistically it is slightly more common for the left breast to be the larger), particularly whilst the breasts are developing during [[puberty]]. In some rare cases, fied Body]], under The Railways (Interoperability) (Notified Bodies) Regulations 2000, in one TSI area: rolling stock.

[[Bombardier Transportation]] also leads the development and production of the [[Acela Express]] train in a 75%&amp;ndash;25% arrangement with Alstom. The train runs between [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[New York, New York|New York City]] and [[Washington, DC]]. Bombardier provided carbody design and tilting mechanisms from its LRC (&quot;Light Rapid Comfortable&quot;) line of passenger trainsets, and integrated a variant of Alstom's [[TGV]] propulsion system. This is the first high-speed rail line in [[North America]], running at a top speed of 240 km/h (150 mi/h). To meet [[U.S. government]] &quot;Buy American&quot; regulations, final assembly of these trains was performed at Bombardier's U.S. rail car assembly facility in [[Barre (city), Vermont|Barre, Vermont]]. Bombardier also provided seller-arranged financing to allow [[Amtrak]] to lease the trainsets rather than purchasing them outright as the railroad had previously done.

They were, until recently, a major [[Canada|Canadian]] [[defence contractor]]. With the latest restructuring the company sold off nearly all of its military related work in Canada. However it continues to participate in military contracts in other countries, such as in the [[United Kingdom]], with the [[ASTOR]] (Airborne Stand-Off Radar) conversion of the long range Challenger [[Bombardier Global Express|Global Express]] jet. The actual conversion is carried out by [[Raytheon]].

In 2001 Bombardier Transportation acquired [[Adtranz]], making it the second largest manufacturer of railway rolling stock in the world. Depending on how one defines industrial activities, it is sometimes considered the largest in the world in this category.

== Criticisms ==

Bombardier has been criticised in Canada and abroad over the [[subsidy|subsidies]] it receives from various levels of government. They have been described as [[corporate welfare]] and accused of violating [[free trade]] agreements, especially by [[Brazil]]. Canada and Bombardier have countered by citing Brazil's direct and indirect subsidies to [[Embraer]], its own major aircraft manufacturer and one of Bombardier's principal competitors in the [[regional jet]] market.

The government of Canada provided a large interest rate subsidy for the financing that made possible Bombardier's sale of metro trains to the [[New York City Subway]]. Some Canadians object to such amounts of money being given to a private for-profit company, but the government argues that the subsidies create many jobs. Recently Bombardier opened an engineering design agreement with an [[India]]n company which subsidy critics argue may result in a loss of jobs in Canada.

Bombardier's reputation may have been tarnished in the western [[United States]] by its association with the privately-funded [[Las Vegas Monorail]] system, which has been operational since [[December 24]], [[2004]] but was plagued by delays due mechanical problems. The system reportedly lost [[United States dollar|US$]]85,000 per day while closed over a period of four months.

Recently, some human rights and Tibet support groups in [http://sftcanada.blogspot.com/2005/10/exposing-bombardier.html Canada], the [http://sftuk.blogspot.com/2005/09/tibet-activists-confront-bombardier.html U.K.], and the U.S. have put pressure on Bombardier over its sale of passenger carriages to the [[People's Republic of China]] for projects including the controversial [[Qingzang Railway]] line into [[Tibet]].

Also Bombardier has been criticized for the yearly procedure of moving assets (such as aircraft) from one Bombardier entity to another Bombardier entity and recording the transaction as revenue for the sole purpose of increasing annual bonuses of senior executives. The procedure was criticized as not being in the best interest of the shareholders although it received very little negative publicity.

==Corporate governance==
Current members of the [[board of directors]] of Bombardier Inc. are: [[Laurent Beaudoin]], [[Pierre Beaudoin]], [[André Berard]], [[J.R. André Bombardier]], [[Janine Bombardier]], [[L. Denis Desauutels]], [[Michael Durham (businessman)|Michael Durham]], [[Jean-Louis Fontaine]], [[Daniel Johnson, Jr.]], [[Jean Monty]], [[André Navarri]], [[James Perrella]], [[Carols Represas]], [[Federico Sada]], and Heinrich Weiss.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''break key''' is a special key on [[computer keyboard]]s that no longer has a well-defined purpose.  Its origins go back to telegraph practices.

A standard [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] key has a built-in [[knife switch]] that can be used to short the key's contacts.  When the key was not in use, that switch was kept closed, so that a signal was continually sent.  If that steady-state signal was interrupted, it indicated one of two things: either the operator was about to start transmitting, or something else had happened to break the connection — such as hostiles cutting the telegraph line.

As the [[teletype]] came into use, a key was created that would temporarily interrupt the communications line, allowing this practice to continue. When this occurred, the receiving teletype mechanism would activate but not print characters (it was typing the non-printing &quot;DEL&quot; character repeatedly). The noise got the operator's attention.

[[Time-sharing]] computers connected to [[modem]]s could recognize the break because the &quot;DEL&quot; characters received had &quot;bad [[parity]]&quot;. This was usually used to generate an [[interrupt]] and allow login or stop a running program.

On personal computers, the break key is used in different ways by different programs, but usually involves some sense of changing the interaction with the computer, such as switching between multiple login sessions, terminating a program, or interrupting a modem connection.

On many modern [[Personal computer|PCs]], '''Pause''' interrupts screen output by [[BIOS]]. This is effective during [[boot]] in [[text mode]] and in a [[DOS]] box in [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] safe mode with 50 lines.

In programming, especially old DOS-style [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], [[Pascal]] and [[C++]], '''Break''' is used (in conjunction with [[Control key]]) to stop program execution. In addition to this, [[Linux]] and variants, as well as many DOS programs, treat this combination the same as ''Ctrl+C''. Finally, the combination can be used to stop a batch file, which is highly useful on older DOS machines that ran batch scripts on boot up.

On modern keyboards, the break key is usually labeled '''Pause/Break'''.  On many games this is the key to pause the game. In most Windows environments, the key combination ''[[Windows key]]+Pause'' brings up the system properties.

Compact and notebook keyboards often have the Pause/Break key mapped to a function command. As a result, pressing ''Ctrl+Pause'' in a notebook computer may require the user to press something else, such as ''Ctrl+Fn+F11''.

[[Image:ac.bobcarr.jpg|thumb|200px|The Hon. Bob Carr]]

'''Robert John Carr''' (born [[September 28]] [[1947]]), [[Australia]]n politician, was [[Premier of New South Wales|Premier]] of [[New South Wales]] from [[25 March]] [[1995]] to [[3 August]] [[2005]]. He holds the record for the longest continuous service as Premier of New South Wales. Only [[Henry Parkes|Sir Henry Parkes]] has served longer, but he held the office on five separate occasions.

==Early career==
The son of a train driver, Carr was born in the [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Maroubra, New South Wales|Maroubra]], and was educated at the [[University of New South Wales]], from which he graduated as a Bachelor of Arts (Hons) in history. Unusually for an Australian politician, he is an intellectual and writer; in a recent example of his recognition as a writer, he appeared on stage at the [[2004]] [[Sydney Festival]] in conversation with [[Tom Stoppard]].

Before entering politics, Carr was a [[journalist]] for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] Radio's ''AM ''current affairs program, wrote for ''[[The Bulletin]]'' and spent a period working for the [[Labor Council of NSW]].

A member of the [[Australian Labor Party]], Carr entered the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] at a [[by-election]] as the member for [[Maroubra]] in October 1983.

In December 1984 he was appointed Minister for Planning and the Environment in the [[Neville Wran|Wran]] government. He held this position until March 1988, when the ALP lost government. In February 1986 he also took on the consumer affairs portfolio, which he held until he became Minister for Heritage In July 1986.

==Leader of the Opposition==
Carr's long-term ambition was to enter federal politics and be Minister for Foreign Affairs in a federal Labor government. But following the defeat of the New South Wales Labor government, Carr was pressured by the party organisation and his own Right faction to stand for the leadership. Carr reluctantly agreed, and became Leader of the Opposition. His diary entries from the time reveal &quot;I spent today like a doomed man, taking phone calls and drafting a statement, still saying to the press I wasn't shifting. I feel a jolt in my stomach about what I'm getting myself in for. I will destroy my career in four years. Everything's altered. It's my fate … So, for better or for worse, I become leader of the party next week.&quot;

Despite this reluctance, Carr performed well &lt;!--Verging on POV: How about 'Carr's performance as opp. l. gained wide approval in the party ...--&gt;as opposition leader and only narrowly lost a tight election to [[Nick Greiner]]'s coalition government in 1991, an election in which no one expected Labor to come close to victory.

==Premier of New South Wales==
In 1995 he became Premier at another close election and won comfortably again in 1999 and 2003.

His centrist, cautious government has been characterised by conservative financial management and the encouragement of market forces, and latterly pursued a &quot;[[tough on crime]]&quot; policy. Carr occasionally ventured into national policy issues, particularly issues concerning the environment and population growth. A keen bushwalker, he created numerous national parks in NSW over his decade-long term as Premier. During his term, he worked towards improving literacy standards in NSW schools.

In [[August]] [[2004]], Carr faced criticism due to his alleged involvement in the [[Orange Grove affair]], and also from the Commissioner of the NSW [[Independent Commission Against Corruption of New South Wales|Independent Commission Against Corruption]], due to his remarks that a minister under investigation by the ICAC would be &quot;vindicated&quot; before the release of that body's findings on the matter; this resulted in an allegation of contempt, which was subsequently dropped.

After 10 years as Premier, Carr announced his resignation both as Premier and as the member for Maroubra on [[27 July]], [[2005]] to be effective from [[3 August]]. This immediately prompted speculation that the resignation was a prelude to a move into federal politics, but Carr denied this. He cited the desire to spend more time with his wife, [[Helena Carr]], as the main motivation for his resignation. His successor as Premier is former health minister [[Morris Iemma]]. Carr's resignation triggered further resignations, namely those of Deputy Premier [[Andrew Refshauge]] and Planning Minister [[Craig Knowles]].

Unusually for a Labor leader, Carr has opposed [[Australian republicanism]] if it entailed public election of the President (he supported a President appointed by Parliament). He also opposed a [[Bill of Rights]], claiming it would merely lead to increased litigation.

==Literature==
Bob Carr is the author of several books, the best-known being ''Thoughtlines'' (Viking, 2002). He is an acknowledged expert on certain aspects of the political history of the United States, especially [[Abraham Lincoln]], whose [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural]] he quoted in his resignation speech. He is a charter member of the [[Chester A. Arthur Society]], a US political trivia group named for one of the most obscure US presidents.

In May 2003, a biography by [[Marilyn Dodkin]], ''Bob Carr: the reluctant leader'', was published to acclaim, partly because it was based on Carr's private diaries and included his often uncomplimentary thoughts on various political personalities.  A second biography, ''Bob Carr—a self-made man'', by [[Andrew West]] and [[Rachel Morris]], was published in September 2003 by Harper Collins.

==Family==
In 1972, Carr met the [[Malaysia]]n [[economics]] student Anne Helena John (now the Australian businesswoman [[Helena Carr]]) on a vacation in [[Tahiti]], and the couple was married on [[24 February]] [[1973]]. They have no children.

==After Politics==
Bob Carr became a part-time consultant for [[Macquarie Bank]], an Australian investment bank, in October 2005. Macquarie's media announcement declared he would advise on policy and strategic issues with a focus on his specialist knowledge of the United States, China and Europe.

A '''bogie''' is a wheeled wagon or trolley.  In mechanics, a bogie is a chassis or framework carrying wheels, attached to a vehicle.  It can be fixed in place, as on a cargo truck, mounted on a swivel, as on a train carriage or locomotive, or sprung as in the suspension of a caterpillar tracked vehicle.

==Railway cars==
[[Image:Bettendorf truck at Illinois Railway Museum.JPG|thumb|A Bettendorf-style truck displayed at the [[Illinois Railway Museum]].]]
[[Image:Railroad truck,FM55-20.Fig8-8.png|thumb|US-style railroad truck.]]
[[Image:Bogie-metro-Meteor-p1010692.jpg|thumb|Model of the pneumatic bogie system of the [[Paris Metro Line 14|''Meteor'' metro]].]]
A bogie in the UK, or a '''wheel truck''', or simply '''truck''' in the U.S., is a structure underneath a [[train]] to which [[wheel]] [[axle]]s (and, hence, wheels) are attached through [[bearing]]s. If they are used there are usually two for each [[carriage]], wagon and [[locomotive]], or alternatively, they are at the connections between the carriages or wagons. The connections of the bogies with the cars allow a small rotational movement around a vertical axis. Most bogies have two axles, but some cars designed for extremely heavy loads have been built with up to five-axle bogies. Heavy-duty cars may have more than two bogies using [[span bolster]]s to equalize the load and connect the bogies to the cars.

Usually the train floor is at a level above the bogies. However, for a double decker [[Double decker#train|train]] this applies only at the bogies: between them the bottom deck can be lower.

There are [[low floor]] trams without (pivoting) bogies and many [[tramway enthusiast]]s see them as &quot;retrogarde&quot; steps.

==Tracked vehicles==
Some [[tank]]s and other [[Caterpillar track|tracked]] vehicles have bogies as external suspension components.  This type of bogie usually has two or more road wheels and some type of sprung suspension to smooth the ride across rough terrain.  Bogie suspensions keep much of their components on the outside of the vehicle, saving internal space.  They are vulnerable to [[antitank]] fire, but can often repaired or replaced in the field.

See [[Suspension (vehicle)#Armoured fighting vehicle suspension |Suspension (vehicle)]].

'''British Steel''' was a large British [[steel]] producer, consisting of the assets of former private companies which had been [[nationalization|nationalised]], largely under the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government of [[Harold Wilson]] ([[1964]]-[[1970]]).  

In 1971 they sponsored Sir [[Chay Blyth]] in his record-making non-stop [[circumnavigation]] against the winds and currents, known as 'The Impossible Voyage'. In 1992 they sponsored the [[Global Challenge|British Steel Challenge]], the first of a series of 'wrong way' races for amateur crews.

It was [[privatization|privatised]] in [[1988]] under the [[Conservative Party|Conservative]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]]. It merged with the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] steel producer ''Koninklijke Hoogovens'' to form ''[[Corus Group]]'' on [[6 October]] [[1999]]. [http://www.corusgroup.com]

'''BT Group plc''' (formerly known as '''British Telecommunications plc''') which trades as '''BT''' (and previously as '''British Telecom''') is the [[privatisation|privatised]] former [[United Kingdom|UK]] state [[telecommunications]] operator. It is still the dominant fixed line telecommunications provider in the United Kingdom.

==Businesses==
BT owns and runs the [[telephone exchange]]s, trunk network and [[local loop]] connections for the vast majority of British fixed-line telephones. Currently BT is responsible for approximately 25 million telephone lines in the UK. BT is still the only UK telecoms operator to have a ''Universal Service Obligation'' (USO) which means it must provide a fixed telephone line to any address in the UK (with the exception of the [[Kingston upon Hull]] area).  It is also obliged to provide public call boxes.

It is officially designated the dominant operator in British telecommunications market. BT's businesses are operated under special government regulation by the British telecoms regulator [[Ofcom]] (formerly [[Oftel]]). 

BT Group has been organised into four business divisions:
*''BT Global Services'': Business services and solutions (formerly ''BT Ignite'' and ''[[Syntegra|BT Syntegra]]'')
*''BT Retail'': Retail telecoms to consumers
*''BT Wholesale'': Wholesale telecoms core trunk network
*''BT Exact / One IT'': Research and Development, and consultancy
*''Openreach'': fenced-off wholesale division, tasked with ensuring that all rival operators have equality of access to BT's own local network.

A number of privately owned [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] companies operang, management and calculation, conforming to legal standards.  Eventually, this means that the total amount of work involved in commercial administration outgrows the total amount of work involved in government administration. In modern capitalist society, private sector bureaucracy is ''larger'' than government bureaucracy, if measured by the number of administrative workers in the [[division of labour]] as a whole. Some corporations nowadays have a turnover larger than the national income of whole countries, with large administrations supervising operations.

A fourth source of bureaucracy inheres in the technologies of mass production, which require many standardised routines and procedures to be performed. Even if mechanisation replaces people with machinery, people are still necessary to design, control, supervise and operate the machinery. The technologies chosen may not be the ones that are best for everybody, but which create ''incomes'' for a particular class of people or maintain their power. This type of bureaucracy is nowadays often called a [[technocracy]], which owes its power to control over specialised technical knowledge.

In Marx's theory, bureaucracy rarely creates new wealth by itself, but rather controls, co-ordinates and governs the production, distribution and consumption of wealth. The bureaucracy as a social stratum derives its income from the appropriation of part of the social [[surplus product]] of human labour. Wealth is appropriated by the bureaucracy by law through fees, taxes, levies, tributes, licensing etc. 

Bureaucracy is therefore always a ''cost'' to society, but this cost may be accepted insofar as it makes [[social order]] possible, and maintains it. Nevertheless there are constant conflicts about this cost, because it has the big effect on the distribution of incomes; all producers will try to get the maximum return from what they produce, and minimise administrative costs. Typically, in epochs of strong economic growth, bureaucracies proliferate; when economic growth declines, a fight breaks out to cut back bureaucratic costs.

Whether or not a bureaucracy as a social stratum can become a genuine [[ruling class]] depends greatly on the prevailing [[property]] relations and the [[mode of production]] of wealth. In capitalist society, the state typically lacks an independent economic base, finances many activities on credit, and is heavily dependent on levying taxes as a source of income. Therefore, its power is limited by the costs which private owners of the productive assets will tolerate. If, however, the state owns the [[means of production]] itself, the state bureaucracy can become much more powerful, and act as a ruling class or power elite. Because in that case, it directly controls the sources of new wealth, and manages or distributes the social product. This is the subject of Marxist theories of [[bureaucratic collectivism]].

Marx himself however never theorised this possibility in detail, and it has been the subject of much controversy among Marxists. The core organisational issue in these disputes concerns the degree to which the ''administrative'' allocation of resources by government authorities and the ''market'' allocation of resources can achieve the social goal of creating a more free, just and prosperous society. Which decisions should be made by whom, at what level, so that an optimal allocation of resources results? This is just as much a moral-political issue as an economic issue.

Central to the Marxian concept of [[socialism]] is the idea of workers' self-management, which assumes the internalisation of a [[morality]] and self-discipline among people that would make bureaucratic supervision and control redundant, together with a drastic reorganisation of the [[division of labour]] in society. Bureaucracies emerge to mediate conflicts of interest on the basis of laws, but if those conflicts of interest disappear, bureaucracies would also be redundant.

Marx's critics are however skeptical of the feasibility of this kind of socialism, given the continuing need for administration, and the propensity of people to put their own self-interest before the communal interest. That is, the argument is that self-interest and the communal interest might ''never'' coincide, or, at any rate, can always diverge significantly. 

==Max Weber on bureaucracy==

[[Max Weber]] has probably been one of the most influential users of the word in its [[social science]] sense. He is well-known for his study of bureaucratization of society; many aspects of modern [[public administration]] go back to him; a classic, hierarchically organized [[civil service]] of the [[continental]] type is&amp;mdash;if basically mistakenly&amp;mdash;called ''&quot;Weberian civil service&quot;''.

However, contrary to popular belief, &quot;bureaucracy&quot; was an [[English language|English]] word before Weber; the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] cites usage in several different years between [[1818]] and [[1860]], prior to Weber's birth in [[1864]].

Weber described the '''[[ideal type]]''' bureaucracy in positive terms, considering it to be a more rational and efficient form of organization than the alternatives that preceded it, which he characterized as ''[[charismatic domination]]'' and ''[[traditional domination]]''. According to his terminology, bureaucracy is part of [[legal domination]]. However, he also emphasized that bureaucracy becomes inefficient when a decision must be adopted to an individual case. 

According to Weber, the attributes of modern bureaucracy include its impersonality, concentration of the means of administration, a leveling effect on social and economic differences and implementation of a system of authority that is practically indestructible.

Weber's analysis of bureaucracy concerns:
* the historical and administrative reasons for the process of bureaucratization (especially in the [[Western civilisation]])
* the impact of the [[rule of law]] upon the functioning of bureaucratic organisations
* the typical [[personal orientation]] and [[occupational position]] of a bureaucratic officials as a [[status group]]
* the most important attributes and consequences of bureaucracy in the modern world

A bureaucratic organization is governed by the following seven principles:
# official business is conducted on a continuous basis
# official business is conducted with strict accordance to the following rules:
## the duty of each official to do certain types of work is delimited in terms of impersonal criteria
## the official is given the authority necessary to carry out his assigned functions
## the means of coercion at his disposal are strictly limited and conditions of their use strictly defined
# every official's responsibilities and authority are part of a vertical hierarchy of authority, with respective rights of supervision and appeal
# officials do not own the resources necessary for the performance of their assigned functions but are accountable for their use of these resources
# official and private business and income are strictly separated
# offices cannot be appropriated by their incumbents (inherited, sold, etc.)
# official business is conducted on the basis of written documents

A bureaucratic official:
* is personally free and appointed to his position on the basis of conduct
* exercises the authority delegated to him in accordance with impersonal rules, and his loyalty is enlisted on behalf of the faithful execution of his official duties
* appointment and job placement are dependent upon his technical qualifications
* administrative work is a full-time occupation
* work is rewarded by a regular salary and prospects of advancement in a lifetime career

An official must exercise his judgment and his skills, but his duty is to place these at the service of a higher authority; ultimately he is responsible only for the impartial execution of assigned tasks and must sacrifice his personal judgment if it runs counter to his official duties.

==Criticism==

As Max Weber himself noted, in reality no ideal type organisation can exist. Thus the real bureaucracy will be less optimal and effective than his ideal model. Each of Weber's seven principles can degenerate:
* Vertical hierarchy of authority can became chaotic, some offices can be omitted in the decision making process, there may be conflicts of competence;
* Competences can be unclear and used contrary to the spirit of the law; sometimes a decision itself may be considered more important than its effect;
* [[Nepotism]], [[political corruption|corruption]], political infighting and other degenerations can counter the rule of impersonality and can create a recrutation and promotion system not based on [[meritocracy]] but rather on [[oligarchy]];
* Officials can try to avoid responsibility and seek anonymity by avoiding documentation of their procedures (or creating extreme amounts of chaotic, confusing documents)

Even a non-degenerated bureaucracy can be affected by common problems:
* Overspecialisation, making individual officials not aware of larger consequences of their actions
* Rigidity and inertia of procedures, making decision-making slow or even impossible when facing some unusual case, and similarly delaying change, evolution and adaptation of old procedures to new circumstances;
* A phenomenon of ''group thinking'' - zealotry, loyalty and lack of critical thinking regarding the organisation which is ''perfect'' and ''always correct'' by definition, making the organisation unable to change and realise its own mistakes and limitations;
* A phenomenon of ''[[Catch-22]]'' (named after a famous book) - as bureaucracy creates more and more rules and procedures, their complexity raises and coordination diminishes, facilitating creation of contradictory rules

In the most extreme examples, bureaucracy can lead to the treatment of individual human beings as impersonal objects. This process has been criticised by many philosophers and writers ([[Aldous Huxley]], [[George Orwell]], and [[Hannah Arendt]]).

'''Breton''' (Breton: ''Brezhoneg'') is a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]] spoken by some of the inhabitants of [[Brittany]] (''Breizh'') and [[Loire-Atlantique]] (historically part of Brittany) in [[France]].

== History==
Breton is not thought to be a descendant of any of the [[Continental Celtic languages]] such as [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] (though it may have borrowed some features from it); rather, it is descended from the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] branch of [[Insular Celtic languages]] brought by [[Romano-British]] settlers to [[Brittany]] after the [[Roman departure from Britain]] in the early [[5th century]].  The modern-day language most closely related to Breton is [[Cornish language|Cornish]], followed by [[Welsh language|Welsh]].  (The other [[regional language]] of Brittany, [[Gallo language|Gallo]], is an [[Langue d'oïl|Oïl language]] derived from [[Latin]]).

Breton is traditionally spoken in Lower Brittany, roughly to the west of a line linking [[Plouha]] and [[Vannes]].   It comes from a language community between [[Britain]] and [[Armorica]] (present-day Brittany).  It was the language of the elite until the [[12th century]].  However, afterwards it was only the language of the people of West Brittany (''Breizh Izel''), and the nobility, then successively the bourgeoisie adopted [[French language|French]].  As a written language, the [[Duchy of Brittany]] used [[Latin]], switching to French in the [[15th Century]]. There exists a limited tradition of [[Breton literature]]. Old Breton has left some vocabulary which has served in the present day to produce [[philosophical]] and scientific terms in Modern Breton.

The French Monarchy never really concerned itself with the minority [[languages of France]].  The [[French revolution|revolutionary period]] really started policies favouring French over the &quot;regional&quot; languages, more pejoratively called ''[[patois]]''. It was assumed that [[reactionary]] and [[monarchy|monarchist]] forces preferred regional languages in an attempt to keep the peasant masses under-informed.  According to the defenders of the Breton language, humiliating practices geared towards stamping out Breton lingered in schools and churches until the [[1960s]].

Today, despite the political centralization of France and the important influence of the media, Breton is still spoken and understood by about 500,000 people.  This is, however, down from 1.3 million in [[1930]].  At the beginning of the [[20th century]], half the population of Lower Brittany knew only Breton, the other half being bilingual.  By 1950, there were only 100,000 monolingual Bretons.

In [[1925]], thanks to Professor [[Roparz Hemon]], the first issue appeared of the review ''Gwalarn''. During its 19-year run, ''Gwalarn'' tried to raise the language to the level of other great &quot;international&quot; languages by creating original works covering all genres and by proposing Breton translations of internationally-recognized foreign works.

In [[1946]], ''[[Al Liamm]]'' replaced ''[[Gwalarn]]''. Other periodicals appeared and began to give Breton a fairly large body of literature for a minority language.

[[Image:Breton school sign in Rennes.jpg|thumb|Sign in Rennes outside a school with bilingual classes]]

In [[1977]], [[Diwan schools]] were founded to teach Breton by immersion.  They taught thousands of young people from elementary school to high school.  Another proposed teaching method was a bilingual approach, ''Div Yezh'' (two languages).

In [[2004]], the [[Asterix]] comic series were translated into Breton and Gallo. This is notable because, according to the comic, the village where Asterix lives is in Brittany.

Some poets, linguists, and writers who wrote in Breton, for example [[Yann-Ber Kalloc'h]], [[Roparz Hemon]], [[Anjela Duval]] and [[Per-Jakez Hélias]], are now known internationally.

Today, Breton is the only living [[Celtic language]] which is not recognized as an official language.  The French state has refused to change the second article of the [[French Fifth Republic|Constitution]] (added in [[1994]]), which states that &quot;the language of the Republic is French&quot;. The number of protesters demanding the repeal of this article is growing year by year. {{fact}}

The first Breton dictionary, the ''Catholicon'', was also the first French dictionary. Edited by [[Jehan Lagadec]] in [[1464]], it was a trilingual work containing Breton, French and Latin. Today the existence of bilingual dictionaries directly from Breton into languages such as English, German and Spanish demonstrates the determination of a new generation to gain international recognition for Breton. There also exists a monolingual dictionary, defining Breton words in Breton.

==Geographic distribution==
[[Image:Gallo and Breton.gif|right]]
Breton is spoken mainly in Western Brittany, but also in a more dispersed way in Eastern Brittany, and in areas around the world which have received Breton emigrants.

==Official status==
Breton is not an official language of France, despite pleas from autonomists and others for official recognition and for the language to be guaranteed a place in schools, the media, and other aspects of public life.

An attempt by the French government to incorporate the independent Breton-language immersion schools (called ''Diwan'') into the state education system was blocked by the French [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] on the grounds that, as the Constitution of the 5th Republic states that French is the language of the Republic, no other language may be used as a language of instruction in state schools. The [[Toubon Law]] states that French is the language of public education.

[[Image:Breizh-sign.jpg|thumb|Bilingual place names in road signage in Brittany]]
Nevertheless, the regional and departmental authorities do use Breton to a very limited extent insofar as they feel able, for example in signage. Some bilingual signage may also be seen, such as [[street name]] signs in Breton towns, and one station of the [[Rennes Metro|Rennes metro system]] has signs in both French and Breton. On the other hand, few shops or other private entities in Rennes have any Breton-language signs.

==Dialects==
The dialects of Breton as identified by [[ethnologists]] are Leonard, [[Trégorrois Breton|Tregorrois]], Vannetais and Cornouaillais. There are no clear borders between those dialect areas; the language changes slightly from one village to the next.

==Sounds==
&lt;!-- Description of the sound set of the language. Can include phoneme charts and example words for each phoneme like in [[French language]]. If there is significant discussion here, it is probably best to divide the section into vowels and consonants subsections. --&gt;

==Grammar==
&lt;!-- Description of the grammar of the language. --&gt;
===Verbal aspect===
As in [[English language|English]] and [[Irish language|Irish]], there are [[grammatical aspect]]s for verbs in a particular tense, detailing whether or not an action is habitual.  As in English, there is a distinction between the habitual form and [[Progressive tense|progressive]] aspect:

* Me '''zo o komz''' gant ma amezeg (&quot;I '''am talking''' with my neighbour&quot;) ;
* Me '''a gomz''' gant ma amezeg [bep mintin] (&quot;I talk with my neighbour [every morning]&quot;) ;

===&quot;Conjugated&quot; Prepositions===
As in other modern [[Celtic languages]], Breton pronouns are fused into preceding prepositions to produce a sort of &quot;conjugated&quot; preposition.  Below are some examples in Breton, [[Welsh language|Welsh]], and [[Irish language|Irish]]. Interestingly, French exhibits a similar construction to indicate possession: ''Le livre, c'est '''à moi''''' (&quot;The book is mine&quot;); ''à moi'', literally, &quot;to me&quot;.

=== Initial consonant mutations ===
Breton has four initial [[consonant mutation]]s: though modern Breton lost the nasal mutation of [[Welsh language|Welsh]], it also has a 'hard' mutation, in which voiced stops become voiceless, and a 'mixed' mutation, which is a mixture of hard and soft mutations.

==Vocabulary==
&lt;!-- This section should contain a discussion of any special features of the vocabulary (or lexicon) of the language, like if it contains a large number of borrowed words or a different set of words for different politeness levels, taboo groups, etc. --&gt;

&lt;!-- This paragraph underneath doesn't deal with Breton vocabulary but English vocabulary.  This paragraph belongs on a page about English borrowings, not on a page about the Breton language. --&gt;

The English words ''[[dolmen]]'' and ''[[menhir]]'' have been borrowed from French, which supposedly took them from Breton. However, this is uncertain: for instance, ''menhir'' is ''peulvan'', ''maen-hir'', ''maen-sav'' in Breton, and ''dolmen'' is a misconstructed word (it should be ''taol-vaen''). Some studies state that these words were borrowed from [[Cornish language|Cornish]].

==Orthography==
The first Breton texts, contained in the [[Leyde manuscript]], were written at the end of the [[8th century]]: fifty years prior to the [[Strasbourg Oaths]], considered to be the earliest example of [[French language|French]]. After centuries of orthography [[calque]]d on the French model, in the 1830s Le Gonidec created a modern phonetic system.

During the early years of the [[20th century]], a group of writers known as ''Emglev ar Skrivanerien'' elaborated and reformed Le Gonidec's system, making it more suitable as a super-dialectal representation of the dialects of [[Cornouaille]], [[Léon (diocese)|Leon]] and [[Trégor]]. This '''KLT''' (from ''Kernev, Leon'' and ''Treger'', the Breton names for Cornouaille, Leon and Trégor) orthography was established in [[1911]]. At the same time writers using the more divergent Vannetais dialect developed a system also based on that of Le Gonidec to represent their dialect. 

Following proposals made during the [[1920s]], the KLT and Vannetais orthographies were merged in [[1941]] to create an orthographic system which could represent all four dialects. One of the most salient features of this '''Peurunvan''' ''wholly unified'' orthography was the inclusion of the [[grapheme]] &lt;zh&gt;, which represents a /h/ in Vannetais which corresponds to a /z/ in the KLT dialects. This [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] also provides an alternate name for the orthography: '''Zedacheg''' i.e. ''ZH-ish''

In [[1955]] a new orthography was proposed by [[François Falc'hun]] and the group Emgleo Breiz, which had the aim of using a set of graphemes closer to the conventions of French. This ''Orthographie Universitaire'' (&quot;University Orthography&quot;, known in Breton as ''Sn>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Bankrupt computer store 02.jpg|thumb|Notice of closure stuck on the door of a computer store the day after its parent company, Granville Technology Group Ltd, declared 'bankruptcy' (strictly, administration - see text) in the UK.]]

'''Bankruptcy''' is a legally declared inability or impairment of ability of an individual or organization to pay their [[creditor]]s. A declared state of bankruptcy can be requested by creditors in an effort to recoup a portion of what they are owed; however, in the overwhelming majority of cases, the bankruptcy is initiated by the '''bankrupt''' individual or organization.

==Purpose==

The primary purpose of the laws of bankruptcy are: (1) to give an honest debtor a &quot;fresh start&quot; in life by relieving the [[debtor]] of most debts, and (2) to repay creditors in an orderly manner to the extent that the debtor has the means available for payment.

Bankruptcy allows debtors to resolve debts through the division of non-exempt assets among creditors.  Additionally the declaration of bankruptcy allows debtors to be discharged of most of the financial obligations, after their non-exempt assets are distributed, even if their [[debt]]s have not been paid in full. During the pendency of a bankruptcy proceeding, the &quot;[[debtor]]&quot; is protected from extra-bankruptcy action by creditors by a legally imposed &quot;[[stay]].&quot;

==History==

This word is formed from the ancient [[Latin]] ''bancus'' (a ''bench'' or ''table''), and ''ruptus'' (broken). [[Bank]] originally signified a bench, which the first bankers had in the public places, in markets, fairs, etc. on which they tolled their money, wrote their [[bills of exchange]], etc. Hence, when a banker failed, he broke his bank, to advertise to the public that the person to whom the bank belonged was no longer in a condition to continue his business. As this practice was very frequent in [[Italy]], it is said the term bankrupt is derived from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''banco rotto'', broken bench (''see e.g. [[Ponte Vecchio]]'').  Others rather choose to deduce the word from the [[French language|French]] ''banque'', ''table'', and ''route'', ''vestigium'', ''trace'', by metaphor from the sign left in the ground, of a table once fastened to it and now gone. On this principle they trace the origin of bankrupts from the [[economy of ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] ''mensarii'' or ''argentarii'', who had their ''tabernae'' or ''mensae'' in certain public places; and who, when they fled, or made off with the money that had been entrusted to them, left only the sign or shadow of their former station behind them.

==Bankruptcy fraud==

Bankruptcy [[fraud]] is a [[White collar crime|business crime]] of filing for bankruptcy with criminal intent, that is with the intention of evading payment for goods even though the buyer has funds that could be used to pay for them, or accepting payment for goods or services but not supplying them. Common types of bankruptcy fraud include [[petition mill]]s, false [[oath]], concealment of assets, and [[fraudulent conveyance]]. [[Multiple filings]] are not ''per se'' fraudulent; as with all things in the law, it depends on the circumstances.  Bankruptcy fraud should be distinguished from ''strategic bankruptcy'', which is not a [[crime|criminal]] act (but may prejudice a judge against the filer if there is evidence that bankruptcy is being used strategically).

== Bankruptcy in Canada ==
{{main|Bankruptcy in Canada}}

Bankruptcy in Canada is set out by [[Canadian law|federal law]], in the [[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada)|Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]] and is  applicable to businesses and individuals. The office of the [[Superintendent of Bankruptcy]], a [[federal government of Canada|federal agency]], is responsible for ensuring that bankruptcies are administered in a fair and orderly manner. [[Trustee in bankruptcy|Trustees in bankruptcy]] administer bankruptcy estates.  

===Duties of trustees===

Some of the duties of the trustee in bankruptcy are to:
	
* Prepare the bankruptcy documents that assign the person into bankruptcy.
* Review the file for any fraudulent preferences or reviewable transactions   
* Chair meetings of creditors 
* Sell any non-exempt assets 
* Perform counselling for the debtors.
* Object to the bankrupt's discharge.

===Creditors' meetings===

Creditors become involved by attending creditors' meetings.  The [[trustee]] calls the first meeting of creditors for the following purposes:
 
* To consider the affairs of the bankrupt
* To affirm the appointment of the trustee or substitute another in place thereof
* To appoint inspectors
* To give such directions to the trustee as the creditors may see fit with reference to the administration of the estate.

===Consumer proposals - an alternative to personal bankruptcy===

In Canada a person can file a consumer proposal as an alternative to bankruptcy.  A consumer proposal is a negotiated settlement between a debtor and their creditors. 

A typical proposal would involve a debtor making monthy payments for a maximum of five years, with the funds distributed to their creditors.  Even though most proposals call for payments of less than the full amount of the debt owing, in most cases the creditors will accept the deal, because if they don’t, the next alternative may be personal bankruptcy, where the creditors will get even less money.

The creditors have 45 days to accept or reject the consumer proposal.  Once the proposal is accepted the debtor makes the payments to the Proposal Administrator each month, and the creditors are prevented from taking any further legal or collection action.  If the proposal is rejected, the debtor may have no alternative but to declare personal bankruptcy.

A consumer proposal can only be made by a debtor with debts of $75,000 or less (not including the mortgage on their principal residence).  If debts are greater than $75,000, the proposal must be filed under Division 1 of Part III of the [[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada)|Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]].

The assistance of a Proposal Administrator is required.  A Proposal Administrator is generally a licensed [[trustee]] in bankruptcy, although the [[Superintendent of Bankruptcy]], may appoint other people to serve as administrators.

According to the [http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inbsf-osb.nsf/en/home Superintendent of Bankruptcy], in 2005 84,638 consumers filed a summary administration personal bankruptcy, and 16,554 individuals filed a consumer proposal.

===Bankruptcy reform===
ital
Bankruptcy reform legislation has been passed into law with [[Canadian Senate|Canadian Senate]] approval and [[Royal assent]] on [[November 25]], [[2005]]. The new law will not come into force until [[June 30]], [[2006]] at the earliest.

A summary and an analysis of the major changes are given in a link at the bottom of this page.

===Student loans in bankruptcy===

Prior to 1997, student loans were discharged in bankruptcy. In September 1997 the Bankruptcy &amp; Insolvency Act was amended so that student loans were only discharged in a bankruptcy if they were more than two years old.

In 1998 the rules were changed again, increasing the time period from two years to ten years.  Under bankruptcy reform (see above) student loans will be automatically discharged after 7 years (or 5 years with court approval).  A history of changes to the treatment of student loans in bankruptcy can be found at [http://www.student-loan-bankruptcy.ca Student Loan Bankruptcy].

==Bankruptcy in the United Kingdom==
{{main|Bankruptcy in the United Kingdom}}

In the [[United Kingdom]] (UK), bankruptcy (in a strict legal sense) relates only to individuals and [[partnerships]]. Companies and other [[corporations]] enter into differently-named legal insolvency procedures: [[liquidation]], [[administration]] and [[administrative receivership]]. However, the term 'bankruptcy' is often used (incorrectly) when referring to companies in the media and in general conversation.

A [[Trustee in bankruptcy]] must be either an [[Official Receiver]] (a civil servant) or a licensed [[insolvency practitioner]].

Following the introduction of the [[Enterprise Act 2002]], a UK bankruptcy will now normally last no longer than 12 months and may be less, if the Official Receiver files in Court a certificate that his investigations are complete.

It is expected that the UK Government's liberalisation of the UK bankruptcy regime will increase the number of bankruptcy cases; initial Government statistics appear to bear this out. It remains to be seen whether the legislation will need reviewing if this remains the case.

There were 20,461 individual insolvencies in England and Wales in the fourth quarter of 2005 on a seasonally adjusted basis. This was an increase of 15.0% on the previous quarter and an increase of 36.8% on the same period a year ago.

This was made up of 13,501 bankruptcies, an increase of 10.9% on the previous quarter and an increase of 37.6% on the corresponding quarter of the previous year, and 6,960 [[Individual Voluntary Arrangement]]s (IVA’s), an increase of 23.9% on the previous quarter and an increase of 117.1% on the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

==Bankruptcy in the United States==
{{main|Bankruptcy in the United States}}

Bankruptcy in the United States is a matter placed under [[United States federal law|Federal jurisdiction]] by the [[United States Constitution]] (in Article 1, Section 8), which allows [[United States Congress|Congress]] to enact &quot;uniform laws on the subject of Bankruptcy throughout the United States.&quot;  Its implementation, however, is found in [[statute law]].  The relevant statutes are incorporated within the '''Bankruptcy Code''', located at Title 11 of the [[United States Code]], and amplified by state law in the many places where Federal law either fails to speak or defers expressly to state law.

While bankruptcy cases are always filed in [[United States Bankruptcy Court]] (an adjunct to the [[U.S. District Courts]]), bankruptcy cases, particularly with respect to the validity of claims and exemptions, are often highly dependent upon State law. State law therefore plays a major role in many bankruptcy cases, and it is often quite unwise to generalize bankruptcy issues across state lines.

===Bankruptcy chapters===

There are six types of bankruptcy under the [[Bankruptcy Code]], located at Title 11 of the [[United States Code]]:
*[[Chapter 7]] (a liquidation-style case for individuals or businesses),
*Chapter 9 (Municipal bankruptcy)
*[[Chapter 11]] (a more complex rehabilitation-style case used primarily by business debtors, but sometimes by individuals with substantial debts and assets). 
*[[Chapter 12]] (a payment plan or rehabilitation-style case for family farmers and fishermen), and 
*[[Chapter 13]] (a payment plan or rehabilitation-style case for individuals with a regular source of income), 
*Chapter 15 (ancillary and other cross-border cases)
The most common types of personal bankruptcy for individuals are Chapter 7 and Chapter 13.

====Chapter 7====
[[Chapter 7]] personal bankruptcy is also known as straight bankruptcy, or liquidation bankruptcy. Under Chapter 7, debtors give up certain property that they own when they go bankrupt.  The property is sold, and the proceeds are used to pay the creditors. In most cases debtors do not have any assets, and thus in most cases they do not lose anything.
In most Chapter 7 cases most debts are discharged about 90 days after filing.  Debts that are discharged (which means they go away) include credit card debts.  Debts that are not discharged would include child support payments and some taxes and student loans.  Secured debts, such as car loans and house mortgages, are also not discharged.
Under the new rules implemented as a result of the [http://www.uscourts.gov/bankruptcycourts/resources.html 2005 Bankruptcy Reform], it is now more difficult to qualify for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  Debtors are subject to a means test, and if income exceeds limits set by the government, the debtor must file under Chapter 13.
====Chapter 13====
[[Chapter 13]] bankruptcy is a reorganization plan for individuals.  To qualify for Chapter 13, an individual must have secured and unsecured debts under a certain amount.  Under Chapter 13 the debtor keeps all of their property, but in return they make regular payments to a trustee, who distributes the payments to the creditors.  Most Chapter 13 plans last for three to five years, and then eligible debts are discharged.  The types of debt that can be discharged under Chapter 13 was substantially scaled back by the 2005 reform amendments. 
Creditors may challenge a Chapter 13 plan but a plan can still be confirmed over their objection if the criteria for confirmation is otherwise met.  A requirement for confirmation of a Chapter 13 plan is that unsecured creditors would receive at least as much as they would receive in a [[Chapter 7]] liquidation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Blissymbolics''' or '''Blissymbols''' were conceived of as an [[ideographic]] [[writing system]] consisting of several hundred basic symbols, each representing a concept, which can be composed together to generate new symbols that represent new concepts.  Blissymbols differ from all the world's major writing systems in that the characters do not directly correspond to the sounds of any [[spoken language]].  

They were invented by [[Charles K. Bliss]] (1897-1985) after the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Bliss wanted to create an easy-to-learn [[international auxiliary language]] to allow [[communication]] between people who do not speak the same language. He was inspired by [[Chinese written language|Chinese]] [[ideogram]]s, with which Bliss became familiar while in [[Shanghai]] as a refugee from [[Nazi]] anti-semitic persecution. His system ''World Writing'' was explained in his work ''Semantography'' (1949). This work laid out the language structure and vocabulary for his utopian vision of easy communication, but it failed to gain popularity. However, since the 1960s, Blissymbols have become popular as a method of [[Augmentative and Alternative Communication]] (AAC) for non-speaking people with [[cerebral palsy]] or other disorders, for whom it can be impossible to otherwise communicate with spoken language. 

It should be noted, however, that linguists such as [[John DeFrancis]] and [[J. Marshall Unger]] have argued that genuine ideographic writing systems with the same capacities as [[natural language|natural languages]], do not exist, but it is likely that they have not examined Blissymbols, hence the claim that Blissymbols may in fact be the exception to the rule.

Blissymbolics Communication International is an international group of people who act as an authority regarding the standardization of the Blissymbolics language. They have taken responsibility for any extensions of the Blissymbolics language as well as any maintenance needed for the language. BCI has coordinated usage of the language since 1971 for augmentative and alternative communication. BCI received a licence and copyright through legal agreements with Charles K. Bliss in 1975 and 1982.  Limiting the count of Bliss-characters (there are currently about 900) is very useful to help the user community. It also helps when implementing Blissymbolics using technology such as computers.

An example of Blissymbolics is:

[[Image:Bliss_cinema.png|blissymbols]]
''I want to go to the cinema''

== History ==
Blissymbolics was first used in 1971 helping children at the Ontario Crippled Children&amp;#8217;s Centre (OCCC, now the Bloorview-MacMillan Children&amp;#8217;s Centre) in Toronto, Canada. Since it was important that the children see consistent pictures, OCCC had a draftsman named Jim Grice draw the symbols. Both Charles K. Bliss and Margrit Beesley at the OCCC worked with Jim ensuring consistency. In 1975, a new organization named Blissymbolics Communication Foundation directed by Shirley McNaughton led this effort. Over the years, this organization changed their name to Blissymbolics Communication Institute, Easter Seal Communication Institute, and ultimately being named Blissymbolics Communication International.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], '''Bessel functions''', first defined by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[mathematician]] [[Daniel Bernoulli]] and named after [[Friedrich Bessel]], are canonical solutions ''y''(''x'') of Bessel's [[differential equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + x \frac{dy}{dx} + (x^2 - \alpha^2)y = 0&lt;/math&gt;

for an arbitrary real number &amp;alpha; (the ''order'').  The most common and important special case is where &amp;alpha; is an [[integer]], ''n''.

Although &amp;alpha; and &amp;minus;&amp;alpha; produce the same differential equation, it is conventional to define different Bessel functions for these two orders (e.g., so that the Bessel functions are mostly smooth functions of &amp;alpha;).

==Applications==

Bessel's equation arises when finding separable solutions to [[Laplace's equation]] and the [[Helmholtz equation]] in [[cylindrical coordinates|cylindrical]] or [[spherical coordinates|spherical]] coordinates, and Bessel functions are therefore especially important for many problems of [[wave propagation]], static potentials, and so on.  (For cylindrical problems, one obtains Bessel functions of integer order &amp;alpha; = ''n''; for spherical problems, one obtains half integer orders &amp;alpha; = ''n''+&amp;frac12;.)  For example:

* [[electromagnetic waves]] in a cylindrical [[waveguide]]
* [[Law of heat conduction|heat conduction]] in a cylindrical object.
* modes of vibration of a thin circular (or annular) [[membrane]].

Bessel functions also have useful properties for other problems, such as signal processing (e.g., see [[FM synthesis]] or [[Kaiser window]]).

==Definitions==

Since this is a second-order differential equation, there must be two [[linearly independent]] solutions.  Depending upon the circumstances, however, various formulations of these solutions are convenient, and the different variations are described below.

=== Bessel functions of the first kind===

Bessel functions of the first kind, denoted with ''J''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), are solutions of Bessel's differential equation which are finite at ''x'' = 0 for &amp;alpha; an integer or &amp;alpha; non-negative. The specific choice and normalization of ''J''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt; are defined by its [[Bessel function#Properties|properties]] below; another possibility is to define it by its [[Taylor series]] expansion around ''x'' = 0 (or a more general [[power series]] for non-integer &amp;alpha;):

:&lt;math&gt; J_\alpha(x) = \sum_{m=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^m}{m! \Gamma(m+\alpha+1)} {\left({\frac{x}{2}}\right)}^{2m+\alpha} &lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gamma function]], a generalization of the [[factorial]] to non-integer values. The graphs of Bessel functions look roughly like oscillating sine or cosine functions that decay proportionally to 1/&amp;radic;''x'' (see also their asymptotic forms, below), although their roots are not generally periodic except asymptotically for large ''x''.

Here is the plot of &lt;math&gt;J_\alpha (x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 0, 1, 2&lt;/math&gt;:

[[image:BesselJ_plot.svg|center|Plot of Bessel J]]

If &amp;alpha; is not an integer, the functions &lt;math&gt;J_\alpha (x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J_{-\alpha} (x)&lt;/math&gt; are linearly independent and are therefore the two solutions of the differential equation. On the other hand, if the order &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is an integer, then the following relationship is valid:

:&lt;math&gt;J_{-\alpha}(x) = (-1)^{\alpha} J_{\alpha}(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

This means that they are no longer linearly independent. The second linearly independent solution is then found to be the Bessel function of the second kind, as discussed below.

==== Bessel's integrals====

Another definition of the Bessel function is possible using an integral equation:

:&lt;math&gt;J_\alpha (x) = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{0}^{2 \pi} \cos (\alpha \tau - x \sin \tau) d\tau.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the approang a good corporate citizen. Ideally, the company will avoid a lawsuit because its employees will follow the rules. Should a lawsuit occur, the company can claim that the problem would not have arisen if the employee had only followed the code properly.

Sometimes there is disconnection between the company's code of ethics and the company's actual practices. Thus, whether or not such conduct is explicitly sanctioned by management, at worst, this makes the policy duplicitous, and, at best, it is merely a marketing tool.

To be successful, most ethicists would suggest that an ethics policy should be:
*Given the unequivocal support of top management, by both word and by example.
*Explained in writing and orally, with periodic reinforcement.
*Doable....something employees can both understand and perform.
*Monitored by top management, with routine inspections for compliance and improvement.
*Backed up by clearly stated consequences in the case of disobedience.
*Remain neutral and nonsexist.

===Ethics officers===
Ethics officers (sometimes called &quot;compliance&quot; or &quot;business conduct officers&quot;) have been appointed formally by organizations since the mid-1980s.  One of the catalysts for the creation of this new role was a series of fraud, corruption and abuse scandals that afflicted the U.S. defense industry at that time.  This led to the creation of the Defense Industry Initiative (DII), a pan-industry initiative to promote and ensure ethical business practices.  The DII set an early benchmark for ethics management in corporations.  In 1991, the [http://www.eoa.org Ethics Officer Association] was founded at the [http://www.bentley.edu/cbe Center for Business Ethics](at Bentley College, Waltham, MA) as a professional association for those responsible for managing organizations' efforts to achieve ethical best practices.  The membership grew rapidly (the EOA now has over 1,100 members) and was soon established as an independent organization. Another critical factor in the decisions of companies to appoint ethics/compliance officers was the passing of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations in 1991, which set standards that organizations (large or small, commercial and non-commercial) had to follow to obtain a reduction in sentence if they should be convicted of a federal offense.  Although intended to assist judges with sentencing, the influence in helping to establish best practices has been far-reaching.  

In the wake of numerous corporate scandals between 2001-04 (affecting large corporations like Enron, WorldCom and Tyco), even small and medium-sized companies have begun to appoint ethics officers. They often report to the Chief Executive Officer and are responsible for assessing the ethical implications of the company's activities, making recommendations regarding the company's ethical policies, and disseminating information to employees. They are particularly interested in uncovering or preventing unethical and illegal actions. This trend is partly due to the  [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] in the United States, which was enacted in reaction to the above scandals. A related trend is the introduction of risk assessment officers that monitor how shareholders' investments might be affected by the company's decisions.

The effectiveness of ethics officers in the marketplace is not clear. If the appointment is made primarily as a reaction to legislative requirements, one might expect the efficacy to be minimal, at least, over the short term. In part, this is because ethical business practices result from a corporate culture that consistently places value on ethical behavior, a culture and climate that usually emanates from the top of the organization.  The mere establishment of a position to oversee ethics will most likely be insufficient to inculcate ethical behaviour: a more systemic programme with consistent support from general management will be necessary.  

The foundation for ethical behavior goes well beyond corporate culture and the policies of any given company, for it also depends greatly upon an individual's early moral training, the other institutions that affect an individual, the competitive business environment the company is in and, indeed, society as a whole.

==Religious views on business ethics==
Many faiths have extensive literature and legal code on the accumulation and use of wealth; and many businesses rely on these ethical guidelines, both as a result of the religious beliefs of owners and managers, and as a way of ensuring that their actions meet the otherwise unwritten ethical standards of local communities.

=== Christian business ethics ===
In [[Christianity]], the basis of this [[theology]] is the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]].

For example, [[Jesus]] asked his disciples, &quot;If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you?&quot; [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 6:34. Although this may be a general injunction to disinterested benevolence, it has also been read as a condemnation of [[interest]] or [[usury]]. Jesus referenced this especially when one lends to another believer, the idea being that, as a Christian with an eternal mindset, ultimately [[God]] is our rewarder and lending to a fellow believer should be left to god to reward over collecting nominal interest.

=== Jewish business ethics ===
The basis of all [[halakha|Jewish law]] is the [[Torah]]; here there are more [[mitzva|commandments]] concerning the [[kashrut]] (fitness) of one's money than the kashrut of food (see [[613 Mitzvot]]). These laws are developed and expanded upon in the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]] (particularly in Order [[Nezikin]]), and are then delineated in the major [[Halakha#Codes of Jewish law|codes of Jewish law]] (e.g. ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', 12th c.; ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'', particularly ''[[Choshen Mishpat]]'', 16th c.). A wide array of topics on business ethics are discussed in the [[responsa]] literature.

The literature also addresses the ethical dimension. [[Rabbi]] [[Yisrael Lipkin Salanter]] (19th century), founder of the [[Mussar]] movement in Eastern European, taught that just as one checks carefully to make sure their food is kosher, so too should one check to see if their money is earned in a kosher fashion  ([[Yisrael Meir Kagan|Chofetz Chaim]], ''Sfat Tamim'', chapter 5). The teachings go much further: there is a widely quoted [[Oral law#Oral law in Judaism | tradition]] (see for e.g. ''[[Kitzur Shulkhan Arukh]]'' 62:1; originating in ''[[Talmud]] Shabbat'' 31a) that in one's judgement in [[Jewish eschatology#The afterlife and olam haba .28the world to come.29|the next world]], the ''first'' question asked is: &quot;were you honest in business?&quot;

:''See the related discussion of Judaism's approach to &quot;livelihood&quot;, under [[Torah im Derech Eretz#Earning a livelihood|Torah im Derech Eretz]] and [[Divine Providence#Contemporary Orthodox thought|Divine Providence]].''

=== Muslim business ethics ===
For [[Islam]], the basis of these laws is the [[Qur'an]], and they are amplified in the [[Hadith]].
Muslim wealth ethics include avoidance of the exploitation of people in need through lending them money at interest ([[riba]]) and prohibitions against [[false advertising]]; under Islamic law, if a vendor sells an item by making false claims about it, the customer has the right to have the transaction cancelled.

==Related disciplines==
[[Business]] ethics should be distinguished from the [[philosophy of business]], the branch of [[philosophy]] that deals with the philosophical, political, and [[ethics|ethical]] underpinnings of business and [[economics]]. Business ethics operates on the premise, for example, that the ethical operation of a private business is possible -- those who dispute that premise, such as [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]], (who contend that &quot;business ethics&quot; is an [[oxymoron]]) do so by definition outside of the domain of business ethics proper.

The philosophy of business also deals with questions such as what, if any, are the [[social responsibility|social responsibilities]] of a business; [[business management]] [[theory]]; theories of [[individualism]] vs. [[collectivism]]; [[free will]] among participants in the [[marketplace]]; the role of [[self interest]]; [[invisible hand]] theories; the requirements of [[social justice]]; and [[natural rights]], especially [[property rights]], in relation to the business enterprise.

Business ethics is also related to '''[[political economy]],''' which is [[economic analysis]] from political and [[economic history|historical]] perspectives. Political economy deals with the distributive consequences of economic actions. It asks who gains and who loses from [[economic activity]], and is the resultant [[distribution of wealth|distribution]] fair or just, which are central ethical issues.

'''British Standards''' is the new name of the '''British Standards Institution''' and is part of '''BSI Group''' which also includes a testing organisation.  '''British Standards''' has a [[Royal Charter]] to act as the [[standards organisation]] for the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. 

The standards produced are titled '''British Standard XXXX''' where XXXX is the number of the standard.  '''British Standards''' currently has over 17,000 active standards. Products are commonly specified as meeting a particular British Standard, and in general this can be done without any certification or independent testing. The standard simply provides a shorthand way of claiming that certain specifications are met, while encouraging manufacturers to adhere to a common method for such a specification.

The '''Kite Mark''' can be used to indicate certification by the BSI, but only where a Kite Mark scheme has been set up around a particular standard. It is mainly applicable to safety and quality management standards. There is a common misunderstanding that Kite Marks are necessary to prove compliance with any BS standard, but in general it is neither desirable nor possible that every standard be 'policed' in this way.

British Standards began in [[1901]] as the ''Engineering Standards Committee'', led by [[James Mansergh]], to standardise the number and type of [[steel]] sections, in order to make [[United Kingdom|British]] manufacturers more efficient and competitive.

Over time the standards developed to cover many aspects of tangible engineering, and then engineering methodologies including quality systems, safety and security.

Another key activity carried out by '''British Standards''' is the CE Marking of Medical Devices. The CE 0086 marking can be issued to devices that are found to comply with the Medical Device Directive.   

==Frequently used BS standards==
*[[BS 1363]] for mains power plugs and sockets
*[[BS 5750]] for quality management, the source for [[ISO 9000]]
*[[BS 5950]] for structural steel
*[[BS 6312]] for telephone plugs and sockets
*[[BS 6879]] for British geocodes, a superset of [[ISO 3166-2:GB]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Building society''' is the name given in [[19th century]] [[United Kingdom|Britain]] for working men's [[co-operative]] savings groups:  by pooling savings, members could buy or build their own homes.  

==Origins==
The original Building Society was formed in [[Birmingham]] in 1774. Most of the original societies were fully   ''terminating'', where they would be dissolved when all members had a house: the last of them was wound up in 1980. In the 1830s and 1840s a new development took place with the ''Permanent Building Society'', where the society continued on a rolling basis, continually taking in new members as earlier ones completed purchases. The main legislative framework for the Building Society was the ''Building Society Act'' of 1874, with subsequent amending legislation in 1894, 1939 (see [[Coney Hall]]), and 1960.

In their heyday, there were hundreds of building societies: just about every town in the country had a building society named after that town.  Over succeeding decades the number of societies has decreased, as various societies merged to form larger ones, often renaming in the process:  most of the existing larger building societies are the end result of the mergers of many smaller societies.

==1980s==
In the [[1980s]], British banking laws were changed to allow building societies to offer banking services equivalent to normal [[bank]]s.  Building societies, in the classic form, were [[mutual organisation]]s, jointly owned by those saving and borrowing. From the 1980s onwards, a number of societies, under pressure from members, `[[demutualise]]d' to become commercial enterprises with [[shares]] of [[stock]] like any other company: members of the society would get a cash `windfall' - usually several hundred pounds, sometimes more - as their share of the assets of the society.  This happened to a number of the larger societies, several of which were bought out by [[bank]]s after their [[demutualisation]].  

A movement arose whereby investors would open a savings account with a [[mutual organisation|mutual]] building society, thereby getting voting rights in the society, and pressurise for a vote on [[demutualisation]], with the intent of getting a windfall payment as a result.  A number of societies' members and managers were very unhappy about such investors, who were termed ''[[carpetbaggers]]'', maintaining that as mutual societies, they could supply better and cheaper home loans than the banks and demutualised societies, as they only had to make a profit to cover their operational costs, and had no need to generate an additional profit to return to shareholders.  

In the end, after a number of large demutualisations, and pressure from carpetbaggers moving from one building society to another to cream off the windfalls, most of the remaining societies modified their rules of membership in the late 1990s.  The method usually adopted were membership rules to ensure that anyone newly joining a society would, for the first few years, be unable to get any profit out of a demutualisation.  With the chance of a quick profit removed, the demutualisations have slowed considerably, [[As of 2001|as of December 2001]].

==Remaining building societies==

The 10 largest of the remaining building societies are listed below.

==Australia==
In [[Australia]], building societies evolved along British lines. Because of strict regulations on [[bank]]s, building societies flourished until the deregulation of the Australian financial industry in the [[1980s]]. Eventually many of the smaller building societies disappeared, while some of the largest (such as [[St. George Bank|St. George]]) officially attained the status of banks.

==USA==
In the [[United States]], the [[savings and loan association]]s have a similar organization and purpose.

'''Blue Steel''' was a [[United Kingdom]] air-launched, rocket-propelled [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] stand-off [[missile]], built to arm the [[V bomber]] force. 

==Development==
Blue Steel was the result of a [[Ministry of Supply (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Supply]] memorandum from [[5 November]] [[1954 in aviation|1954]] that predicted that by [[1960]] [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] air defenses would make it prohibitively dangerous for V bombers to attack with nuclear gravity bombs. The answer was for a [[rocket engine|rocket-powered]], [[supersonic]] missile capable of carrying a large nuclear (or projected [[thermonuclear]]) [[warhead]] with a range of at least 50 miles (90 km). This would keep the bombers out of range of Soviet ground-based defenses installed around the target area, allowing the warhead to &quot;dash&quot; in at high speed.

The weapon (officially termed a ''Stand-off bomb'') was developed primarily by [[Avro]], with guidance electronics by [[Elliots]]. Its design period was protracted, with various development problems exacerbated by the fact that designers had no way of knowing the actual size or weight of the still-hypothetical warhead. The missile was fitted with a, at the time, state-of-the-art [[inertial navigation]] unit. This inertial nav system allowed the missile to strike within 100 metres of its designated target. In addition, the pilots of the carrying Vulcan or Victor bombers could tie their systems into those of the missile and make use of the guidance system to help plot their own flight plan, since the unit in the missile was more advanced that that in the aircraft.

Blue Steel emerged as a pilotless, winged aircraft roughly the size of the experimental [[Saunders-Roe SR.53]] [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]], with clipped [[delta wing]]s and small [[canard]] foreplanes. It was powered by a two-chamber [[Armstrong Siddeley]] Stentor Mark 101 rocket engine, burning a combination of [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[kerosene]]. This was a considerable operational problem, because fueling the missile before launch took nearly a half an hour, and was quite hazardous. The warhead was a [[Red Snow]] one-[[megaton]] device. 

On launch the rocket engine's first chamber would power the missile along a predetermined course to the target at around [[Mach number|Mach]] 1.5. Once close to the target, the second chamber of the engine would accelerate the missile to Mach 3. Over the target the engine would cut out and the missile would free-fall before detonating its warhead as an [[airburst]].

Blue Steel finally entered service in February [[1963 in aviation|1963]], being carried by [[Avro Vulcan|Vulcan]]s and [[Handley Page Victor|Victor]]s, although its limitations were already apparent. The short range of the missile meant that the V bombers were still vulnerable to enemy [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]]s. A replacement for Blue Steel, the Mark 2, was planned with increased range and a [[ramjet]] engine but this was cancelled in [[1960 in aviation|1960]] due to difficulties in developing the Mark 1. The UK sought to acquire the much longer-ranged [[United States Air Force]] [[AGM-48 Skybolt]] air-launched ballistic missile, and was greatly frustrated when that weapon was cancelled in late [[1962 in aviation|1962]]. With no effective long-range weapon the original Blue Steel served on, even though it usefulness in a hot war was likely limited.

Blue Steel officially retired [[21 December]] [[1969 in aviation|1969]], with the United Kingdom's chief nuclear capacity passing to the [[submarine]] fleet.

The '''Branch Davidians''' are a religious group originating from the [[Seventh-day Adventist]] church.  From its inception, the group inherited Adventism's [[Apocalypse|apocalypticism]], in that they believed themselves to be living in a time when Christian prophecies of a final divine judgment were coming to pass.  They are best known for the [[1993]] [[Waco Siege|siege]] of their [[Mount Carmel]] Center near [[Waco, Texas]], by the [[FBI]] and the [[BATF]], which resulted in the deaths of eighty-two of the church's members, including head figure [[David Koresh]]. However, by the time of the siege, Koresh had encouraged his followers to think of themselves as &quot;students of the Seven Seals&quot; rather than Branch Davidians, while other Branch Davidian factions never accepted his leadership.

== History ==
In [[1929]], [[Victor Houteff]], a [[Bulgaria]]n immigrant, claimed that he had a new message for the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]. It was submitted in the form of a book entitled &quot;The Shepherd's Rod&quot;.  His claims were not accepted and were considered divisive by the leadership because he pointed out what he saw as their departures from basic church teachings and standards. Therefore, he was disfellowshipped ([[excommunicate]]d) from the church.

In 1935, Houteff established his headquarters outside [[Waco, Texas]]. Up to 1942, his movement was known as the Shepherd's Rod, but when Houteff found it necessary to formally incorporate so members could claim conscientous objector status, he named his association the ''Davidian Seventh-day Adventists''.  The term &quot;Davidian&quot; refers to the restoration of the Davidic kingdom. Houteff directed Davidians to focus exclusively on converting Adventists. Under Houteff's heavily [[Typology (theology)|typological]] system, Davidians believed prophesy to foretell a cyclic series of events, described as a spiral, with history returning to prophetically foretell events but each time, advance in terms of cosmological progress. 

In [[1955]], after Houteff's death, a split of this movement formed the ''Branch Davidian Seventh-day Adventists'', headed initially by [[Benjamin Roden|Benjamin L. Roden]].  &quot;Branch&quot; refers to the new name of Christ.  The group established a settlement outside of [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], [[Texas]], on the property previously occupied by the Davidian group.  In 1977, [[Benjamin Roden]]'s wife [[Lois Roden|Lois]] claimed to have a message of her own, one element of which was that the [[Holy Spirit]] is feminine in gender, causing much controversy in the group. When Ben Roden died the next year, their son George tried to assume leadership, claiming that he was the rightful prophet of the group, but she beat back his attempt.

In [[1981]] [[Vernon Howell]] (later renamed David Koresh) joined the group as a regular member.  In [[1983]] Lois Roden allowed Howell to begin to teach his own message, opening the door for him to build a following before their split in early [[1984]].  Lois also faced dissent from Canadian Charles Pace.  There was a general meeting at Mt. Carmel of all Branch Davidians over [[Passover]] [[1984]] and the end result was that the group split into several factions, one of which was loyal to Howell.  At this time George Roden forced Howell and Pace to leave the property.

Howell took his followers to [[Palestine, Texas]], while Pace went to [[Gadsden, Alabama]].  But by [[1988]], George Roden's support had dwindled, and while he was in jail for contempt of court, Howell took charge of the disputed land in his absence.  Meanwhile, Lois Roden had passed away in [[1986]], and her will appointed Teresa Moore as her successor.

In [[1990]] Howell changed his name to [[David Koresh]], invoking the biblical Kings [[David]] and [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]].  Koresh centered his teachings around the Seven Seals and his ability as the &quot;Lamb&quot; to open them. Koresh supported his beliefs with detailed [[Bible|biblical]] interpretation, using the [[Book of Revelation]] as the lens through which the entire Bible was viewed.

==Raid and Siege==
Defectors from Koresh's group alleged that he practiced polygamy with underage brides, physically abused children, and stockpiled illegal weapons. Eventually, legal authorities investigated their charges.

On [[February 28]] [[1993]], the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (ATF) raided Mount Carmel, resulting in the deaths of four agents and six Davidians. The subsequent 51-day siege ended on [[April 19]] when the complex was completely consumed by fire killing seventy-six people, including Koresh.

The government put some of the survivors on trial. All were acquitted of conspiring to murder federal agents, but some were convicted of [[voluntary manslaughter]]. Skeptics continue to dispute official government inquiries that claim to definitively prove that the fire was set on the inside by Davidians.

''For more information, see [[Waco Siege]].''

==Today==
Survivor Clive Doyle and supporter Ron Goins live at Mt. Carmel Center and run a small visitor museum as well as hold weekly Bible studies on the Sabbath.

Charles Pace, a Davidian who leads a non-Koresh group, also lives on the property and holds his own worship services.  

In 1996 the court ruled that the land belongs to the Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventist Church.  However, the court has until this point refused to rule on who exactly constitutes &quot;the church&quot;.  Currently [[Amo Bishop Roden]], George's former wife, is attempting to sue for ownership and access to the land.  Most survivors and supporters recognize Clive Doyle as the trustee of the organization and the land.

Also in 1996 a number of Koresh's remaining followers filed an [[civil action|action]] to gain quiet title to the church's property under a claim of [[adverse possession]]. Adverse possession requires that the claimant file it against a party that holds [[Title owner|title]] to the property. However, they filed this suit as the &quot;Trustees&quot; of the church. Thus they were claiming to be the Trustees of the church, while on the other they were claiming that they possessed the property adversely against the Trustees of the Church; the two positions are contradictory. With opposition from a church member (Doug Mitchell) who did not join Howell's faction, and who joined the case in 1998, they dropped their claim for adverse possession the day before the trial began, proceeding only on their claims of being the Trustees of the church. In 2000, the jury ruled against them, and also against Amo Roden, another claimant to the ownership of the property.

In spite of this court ruling, they and others still continue to assume the identity of the true church, and its property. For reasons not explained by the judge, Alan Mayfield, Doug Mitchell's claim to be the rightful Trustee of the church's property was not allowed to be considered by the jury when the survivors' and [[Amo Bishop Roden|Amo Roden]]'s claims were considered. Mitchell was only allowed to defend against the others' claims.  Mitchell contends that when Koresh left Mt. Carmel in 1984, he adopted the name &quot;''Davidian Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventist''&quot; for his followers, thus  &quot;leaving&quot; the church, forfeiting their claim to be the true Branch Davidians. 

During the pre-trial proceedings, Mitchell's attempts to obtain an injunction against Koresh's remaining followers that would have prohibited them from using the church's name and property was dismissed for &quot;lack of jurisdiction&quot;. That is, the judge (who was not a legal professional before he became a judge), felt that the matter involved church issues which the court could not rightly consider. Mitchell disputes this reasoning.

Currently, Koresh's remaining followers still have access to the church's property (living on it, and holding regular services there), in spite of the judgment affirmed by Judge Mayfield in December 2000 against them on their claim of being the lawful Trustees of the church's property.

Because of the way the government has been portrayed as having acted in the 1993 standoff, the Koresh survivors have received much sympathy and support from various people and groups who felt that the actions that the government took were wrong. This support has provided them with the means to further their assumption of the church's identity and property, to the detriment of those Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists who did not join Koresh. This situation has left those who opposed him in a difficult position in two ways. First, they cannot rightly use the property without conflicts with the survivors and others who are antagonistic or indifferent to the original members' rights.  Second, they have a great hurdle to overcome because of the notoriety that Koresh and his followers have brought upon the name and identity of the church.

Renos Avraam, one of the imprisoned Davidians, has declared that he is receiving prophetic new light, as the &quot;Chosen Vessel of the Remaining Bride.&quot; However, most of the survivors spurn his &quot;Hidden Manna&quot; faction.

A new chapel has been built by the survivors and their supporters near the site of the original complex.  The ruins of the old building, including the tornado shelter and incomplete swimming pool, can be seen by visitors.  There are also several memorials to the victims - both the Davidian victims, and the Federal Agents who lost their lives.  Memorial trees with plaques with the name of each Davidian who perished have been planted on the property.  Finally, to show their deep sympathy to the victims of the [[Oklahoma City Bombing]], a memorial has been erected at Mt. Carmel for them as well.

Approximately fifty [http://www.cesnur.org/2005/pa_pitts.htm] to seventy [http://bdsda.tripod.com/newsletters/april_2005.html] people attended the yearly memorial service on [[April 19]] [[2005]].

Former President [[Bill Clinton]] recently claimed that the two things he regretted the most while in office were standing by while the [[Rwandan genocide]] occurred and failing to find a peaceful resolution to the Waco standoff.

'''Burwash Hall''' is the second oldest of the residence buildings at [[Toronto]]'s [[Victoria University in the University of Toronto|Victoria College]].  Construction began in [[1911]] and was finished in [[1913]].  It was named after [[Nathaniel Burwash]], a former president of Victoria.  The building is an extravagant [[Neo-Gothic]] work with turrets, gargoyles, and battlements.

The building is divided between the large dining hall in the northwest and the student residence proper.  The residence area is divided into two sections.  The Upper Houses, built in 1913, consist of four houses: [[North House]], [[Middle House]], [[Gate House]], and [[South House]].   The Lower Houses were built in 1931 and were originally intended to house theology students at Emmanuel College, whose current building was opened the same year.  Ryerson House, Nelles House, Caven House, Bowles-Gandier House are now mostly home to undergraduate arts and science students.  The latter two are mostly reserved for students in the new Vic One Programme.

Famous residents of Burwash include [[Vincent Massey]], [[Lester B. Pearson]], and [[Donald Sutherland]].  The upper houses were gutted and renovated in 1995.  The lower houses have only been partially upgraded.  Before the renovations the entire building was all male, but now every house but Gate is co-ed.

Since its renovations Burwash has been viewed by residents as one of the best residences in Canada.  Each Upper House consists of three floors.  The lower floor contains a [[common room]] equipped with kitchen facilities, couches and a television.  The upper floors each have their own kitchen and dining area.  All except North House have a very high bathroom ration, with Gate House being the best with nine washrooms for its twenty-eight residents.  Upper Houses are divided between double rooms and singles, with about sixty percent of the population being in doubles.

The Lower Houses each have four floors, but are much narrower with each level having only four rooms.  Each level also has its own kitchen, but these are much smaller than in the Upper Houses. The Lower Houses do have far larger and better fitted common rooms that are similar to the one's the Upper Houses had before the renovations.  The rooms in the Lower Houses are also considered more luxurious with [[hardwood floor]]s and large sizes.leys===

In [[2003]], Bentley's 2-door convertible, the [[Bentley Azure]], ceased production, and the company introduced the [[Bentley Continental|Continental GT]], a large luxury coupe. The car is powered by a version of VW's [[W-12 engine]].

Demand has been so great that the factory at [[Crewe]], [[Cheshire]], has been unable to satisfy demand despite producing 4,500 vehicles a year and there is a waiting list of over a year for new cars to be delivered. Consequently there are proposals to produce the new model [[Bentley Continental|Flying Spur]], a four-door version of the Continental GT (140.000 Euros) in [[Dresden]] in the same factory where the [[VW Phaeton]] luxury car is made.

In April, 2005, Bentley confirmed plans to produce a 4-seat convertible model, the [[Bentley Azure|Azure]], derived from the [[Bentley Arnage|Arnage Drophead Coupe]] prototype, at Crewe beginning in [[2006]]. By the fall of 2005, the convertible version of the successful Continental GT, the [[Bentley Continental|Continental GTC]] was also presented.

Bentley sales have been strong in [[2005]] with 8,627 sold worldwide, 3654 of these vehicles were sold in the United States.

The '''CERT/CC''' (Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center) was created by [[DARPA]] in [[November]] [[1988]] after the [[Morris worm]] struck.  It is a major coordination center in dealing with [[internet security]] problems.  

The CERT/CC is run by the federally funded [[Software Engineering Institute]] (SEI) at [[Carnegie Mellon University]].  The SEI also created the Capability Maturity Model (CMM).

The CERT/CC is not to be confused with United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team ([[US-CERT]]) which is part of the [[National Cyber Security Division]] of the [[United States Government]]'s [[Department of Homeland Security]].  The two organisations work closely together and cross reference each other.

      <mculture developed, and by the late 19th century, raising livestock had become important. Early industry was based on the extraction and processing of minerals and agricultural products. Current agricultural products are [[cattle]], [[wheat]], [[dairy product]]s, [[maize|corn]], and [[hay]].

The [[federal government]] is also a major economic force in the state with many important federal facilities including [[NORAD]] and the [[United States Air Force Academy]] in [[Colorado Springs]], [[NOAA]] and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] in [[Boulder, CO|Boulder]], [[U.S. Geological Survey]] and other government agencies at the Denver Federal Center in [[Lakewood, CO|Lakewood]], the [[Denver Mint]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit| 10th Circuit Court of Appeals]] in Denver, and a federal [[ADX Florence|Supermax Prison]] and other federal [[prisons]] near [[Cañon City, CO|Cañon City]]. There are of course various other [[Independent Agencies of the United States Government|federal agencies]] and federally owned lands in the state, especially with Colorado's abundant [[National Forests]] and four [[List of U.S. national parks by state#Colorado|National Parks]]. There are also numerous private companies that have operations in Colorado that deal with the governmental agencies in the state.

In the second half of the 20th century the industrial and service sectors have expanded greatly. The state's economy is diversified and is notable for its concentration of scientific research and high-technology industries. Other industries include [[food processing]], transportation equipment, machinery, chemical products, minerals such as gold and [[molybdenum]], and tourism. Denver is an important financial center.

[http://www.bea.gov/ The Bureau of Economic Analysis] estimates that the total state product in 2003 was $187 billion. Per capital personal income in 2003 was $34,561, putting Colorado 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the nation.

=== Population ===
As of 2005, Colorado has an estimated population of 4,665,177, which is an increase of 63,356, or 1.4%, from the prior year and an increase of 363,162, or 8.4%, since the year 2000.  This includes a natural increase since the last census of 205,321 people (that is 353,091 births minus 147,770 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 159,957 people into the state.  Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 112,217 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 47,740 people.

According to estimates made in 2004, Colorado's population will increase to 7,150,000 by [[2030]] [http://cwcb.state.co.us/SWSI/Report/AppendixA.pdf]. The largest increases are expected along the [[Colorado Front Range|Front Range]], especially in the [[Denver-Aurora metropolitan area]].

As of 2004, 441,000 foreign-born persons (9.7% of the population) live in the state, including an estimated 144,000 illegal aliens (3.1% of the state population).

Colorado's Hispanic presence is one of the USA's largest—only five states have more Hispanics ([[per capita]]). Denver and some other areas have significant [[Mexican]] populations, while southern Colorado has a large number of Hispanos, the descendants of early New Mexican settlers of colonial Spanish origin.

According to the 2000 Census, the largest ancestry groups in Colorado are [[Germans|German]] (22%), [[Irish people|Irish]] (12.2%), and [[English people|English]] (12%). Persons reporting German ancestry are the largest group in the state and are especially strong in the Front Range and eastern Plains. People of British extraction are the largest group in the western Rocky Mountains.

=== Religion ===
*[[Christianity|Christian]] &amp;ndash; 75%
**[[Protestantism|Protestant]] &amp;ndash; 48%
***[[Baptist]] &amp;ndash; 9%
***[[Methodism|Methodist]] &amp;ndash; 5%
***[[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] &amp;ndash; 5%
***[[Episcopal]] &amp;ndash; 3%
***[[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] &amp;ndash; 3%

**Other Christian &amp;ndash; 1%
*[[Judaism|Jewish]] &amp;ndash; 2%
*Other Religions &amp;ndash; 1%
*Non-Religious/Agnostic &amp;ndash; 22%

Compared to the nation at large, Colorado&amp;mdash;like many other Western states&amp;mdash;has a high percentage of non-religious people. In addition, although quite small in number overall, Colorado has one of the highest concentrations of [[Tibetan Buddhists]] in North America, located primarily in Boulder and Crestone. Nonetheless, the state&amp;mdash;specifically the city of [[Colorado Springs]]&amp;mdash;is home to numerous Christian groups. [[Focus on the Family]] is among the most prominent of these.

==Professional sports teams==
[[As of 2005]], Colorado is least populous state with a franchise in each of the [[major professional sports league]]s.  In fact, as of the [[2000]] census Colorado was also the least populous state to have more than one major league team, let alone four.  The state is able to support the teams because it contains a large [[metropolitan area]], with a much higher population than any other city in over 500 miles. Therefore, many of the residents in the surrounding states support the teams in Denver, as show by the reach of the Broncos' radio network[http://www.denverbroncos.com/page.php?id=1637]. Colorado has since surpassed [[Louisiana]] in population, although the effects of [[Hurricane Katrina]] have made the futures of that state's teams uncertain.

The [[Canadian province]] of [[Alberta]] is the only less populous jurisdiction in North America besides the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] to have more than one major league team.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Carboniferous''' is a major division of the [[geologic timescale]] that extends from the end of the [[Devonian]] period, about 359.2 [[annum|Ma]] (million years ago), to the beginning of the [[Permian]] period, about 299.0 Ma ([[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]] 2004). As with most older [[geology|geologic]] periods, the rock beds that define the period's start and end are well identified, but the exact dates are uncertain by 5–10 million years. The Carboniferous is named for the extensive [[coal]] beds of that age found in [[Great Britain]] and Western [[Europe]]. The first third of the Carboniferous is called the [[Mississippian]] [[geologic time scale|epoch]], and the remainder is called the [[Pennsylvanian]]. Conifer trees 
were introduced in this important and well-known time period.

==Paleogeography==
The southern [[continent]]s remained tied together in the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]], which collided with North America-Europe ([[Laurussia]]) along the present line of eastern North America. In the same time frame, much of present eastern [[Eurasian plate]] welded itself to Europe along the line of the [[Ural mountains]]. Most of the [[Mesozoic]] supercontinent of [[Pangea]] was now assembled, although pieces of present east [[Asia]] still remained detached.

==Rocks and coal==
Carboniferous rocks in Europe and eastern North America largely consist of a repeated sequence of [[limestone]], [[sandstone]], [[shale]] and coal beds. In North America, the early Carboniferous is largely marine limestone, which accounts for the division of the Carboniferous into two periods in North American schemes. The Carboniferous coal beds provided much of the fuel for power generation during the [[Industrial Revolution]] and are still of great economic importance.

The large coal deposits of the Carboniferous primarily owe their existence to two factors. The first of these is the appearance of [[bark]] bearing trees (and in particular the [[evolution]] of the bark fiber [[lignin]]). The second is the lower sea levels that occurred during the Carboniferous as compared to the [[Devonian]] period. This allowed for the development of extensive lowland [[swamp]]s and [[forest]]s in North America and Europe. It has been hypothesized that large quantities of [[wood]] were buried during this period because animals and decomposing [[bacterium|bacteria]] had not yet [[Evolution|evolved]] that could effectively digest the new lignin. It has also been obserVerdes Estates, California]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; $69,040

== Education ==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
California's public educational system is supported by a unique constitutional amendment that requires 40% of state revenues to be spent on education.

The preeminent ''state university'' is the [[University of California]], which employs more [[Nobel Prize]] winners than any other institution in the world and is considered one of the finest public higher-education systems in the country.  The nine general UC campuses are in [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|Los Angeles]], [[University of California, San Diego|San Diego]], [[University of California, Davis|Davis]], [[University of California, Santa Cruz|Santa Cruz]], [[University of California, Santa Barbara|Santa Barbara]], [[University of California, Irvine|Irvine]], [[University of California, Riverside|Riverside]], and [[University of California, Merced|Merced]].  The [[University of California, San Francisco]], teaches only graduate health-sciences students, and the [[Hastings College of Law]], also in San Francisco, is one of UC's four law schools.   The UC system is intended to accept students from the top 12.5% of college-bound students, and provide most graduate studies and research. The University of California also administers federal laboratories for the [[United States Department of Energy|Federal Department of Energy]]: [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], and [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]].

The [[California State University]] system includes 23 universities and provides education for teachers, the trades, engineering, agriculture and industry.  With over 400,000 students, the CSU system is the largest university system in the United States.  It is intended to accept most college-bound high-school students, while carrying out some research, especially in applied sciences.  Lower-division course credits are frequently transferable to the University of California. 

The [[California Community Colleges system]] provides vocational education, remedial education, and continuing education programs.  It awards certificates and associate degrees and also provides lower division general-education courses, whose credit units are transferable to the CSU and UC systems.  It is composed of 109 colleges organized into 72 districts, serving a student population of over 2.9 million.

Notable ''private universities'' include [[Stanford University]], the [[University of Southern California]] (USC), [[Santa Clara University]] (SCU), the [[Claremont Colleges]], and the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) (which administers the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] for [[NASA]]).

California has hundreds more private colleges and universities, including many religious and special-purpose institutions.  This leads to many unique entertainment and educational opportunities for residents.  For example, Southern California, with one of the highest densities of post-secondary institutions in the world, has a very large base of classically trained vocalists that compete in large choir festivals.  Near Los Angeles, there are numerous art and film institutes, including the [[California Institute of the Arts|CalArts Institute]].

''Public secondary education'' consists of high schools that teach elective courses in trades, languages and liberal arts with tracks for gifted, college-bound and industrial arts students.  They accept students from roughly age 14 to 18, with mandatory education ceasing at age 16.  In many districts, junior high schools or middle schools teach electives with a strong skills-based curriculum, for ages from 11 to 13. Elementary schools teach pure skills, history and social studies, with optional half-day kindergartens beginning at age 5.  Mandatory full-time instruction begins at age 6.

The ''primary schools'' are of varying effectiveness. The quality of the local schools depends strongly on the local tax base, and the size of the local administration.  In some regions, administrative costs divert a significant amount of educational monies from instructional purposes. In poor regions, literacy rates may fall below 70%. One thing they all have in common is a state mandate to teach fourth grade students about the history of California, including the role of the early missions; most schools implement this by requiring students complete a [[California 4th Grade Mission Project|multiple medium project]].

== Sports ==
California's large population has helped to make it home to many professional sports teams, including fifteen [[major professional sports league]] franchises, far more than any other state.  However, since the re-location of the [[Los Angeles Raiders]] and [[Los Angeles Rams]] in the 1990s, it could be argued that no one city is able to lay claim to a &quot;[[U.S. cities with teams from four major sports|Grand Slam]]&quot; (i.e. having a team in each of the four leagues) unless Oakland, San Francisco and San Jose are counted as being in a single metropolitan area.  California hosted the [[1960 Winter Olympics]] at [[Squaw Valley]], the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]] and [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]], as well as the [[1994]] [[Football World Cup 1994|FIFA World Cup]] and several [[Superbowl]]s.  Each year, the [[California State Games]] take place here.

== Transportation ==
[[Image:Glendalefreeway.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Caltrans builds tall &quot;stack&quot; [[Interchange (road)|interchange]]s whose soaring ramps offer stunning views.]]California's vast terrain is connected by an extensive system of [[freeway]]s, [[expressway]]s, and [[highway]]s, all maintained by [[Caltrans]] and patrolled by the [[California Highway Patrol]], except for the numbered expressways in [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]] which were built and maintained by the county itself.  The main north-south arteries are [[U.S. Highway 101]], which runs close to the coast from the state's border with [[Oregon]] to downtown [[Los Angeles]], and [[Interstate 5]], which runs inland from the Oregon to [[Mexico]] borders, bisecting the entire state.  California is known for its [[car culture]], and its residents typically take to the roads for their commutes, errands, and vacations, giving California's cities a reputation for severe [[traffic congestion]].  Almost all California highways are non-toll roads. Notable exceptions are any major bridges. 

As for air travel, [[Los Angeles International Airport]] and [[San Francisco International Airport]] are major hubs for trans-Pacific and transcontinental traffic.  There are about a dozen important commercial [[airport]]s and many more [[general aviation]] airports throughout the state's 58 counties.

California also has several important [[seaport]]s.  The giant seaport complex formed by the [[Port of Los Angeles]] and the [[Long Beach, California#Shipping and transportation|Port of Long Beach]] in Southern California is the largest in the country and responsible for handling about a fourth of all container cargo traffic in the United States.  The [[Port of Oakland]] handles most of the ocean containers passing through Northern California.  

[[Image:La city hwys.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Stack [[Interchange (road)|interchange]] in [[Los Angeles]]]]
Intercity rail travel is provided by [[Amtrak]].  Los Angeles and San Francisco both have [[subway]] networks, in addition to [[light rail]]. San Jose and Sacramento have only light rail, though portions of San Jose light rail serve as [[EL Trains]].  [[Metrolink]] [[commuter rail]] serves much of Southern California, and [[Caltrain]] commuter rail connects San Jose and [[Gilroy, California|Gilroy]] (commute hour only) to San Francisco.  [[Altamont Commuter Express]] (ACE) connects [[Tracy, California|Tracy]], [[Livermore, California|Livermore]] and other edge cities with San Jose. [[BART]], an express rail service, connects San Francisco and Oakland to Millbrae in the southwest, Fremont in the southeast,  Dublin and Pleasanton in the east, Richmond in the north, and Pittsburg in the northeast. Despite its name, it does not encompass the entire Bay Area; the [[North Bay (California)|North Bay]] and [[Santa Clara Valley|South Bay]] regions are not currently included in the system.  [[San Diego]] has [[San Diego Trolley|Trolley]] light rail and [[San Diego Coaster|Coaster]] commuter rail services. Nearly all counties operate [[bus]] lines, and many cities operate their own bus and light rail lines as well.

Both [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] and Amtrak provide intercity bus service.

The rapidly growing population of the state is straining all of its transportation networks.  A regularly recurring issue in California politics is whether the state should continue to aggressively expand its freeway network or concentrate on improving mass transit networks in urban areas.

The California High Speed Rail Authority was created some years back by the state to implement an extensive 700 mile (1127&amp;nbsp;km) rail system. Construction is pending approval of the voters during next November's General Election where a 9 billion dollar state bond would have to be approved.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Columbia River Gorge.jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[Columbia River Gorge]], Washington or North side]]

The '''Columbia River''' (French: ''fleuve Columbia'') is a [[river]] situated in [[British Columbia]] and the [[Pacific Northwest]] of the [[United States]]. It is the largest [[river]] in volume flowing into the [[Pacific Ocean]] from [[North America]], and the second largest by volume in North America behind the Mississippi. In rare years, the river's flow may actually exceed that of the Mississippi. The mean total flow is 166,000 ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s (4700 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s). It is the largest [[hydroelectric power]] producing river in [[North America]]. From its headwaters to the Pacific Ocean it flows 1,232 miles (2,044 km), and drains 258,000 square miles (415,211 km&amp;sup2;).

==Geography==

[[Columbia Lake]] forms the Columbia's headwaters in the [[Canadian Rockies]] of southern British Columbia.  The river then flows through [[Windermere Lake (British Columbia)|Windermere Lake]] and the town of [[Invermere]], then northwest to [[Golden, British Columbia|Golden]] and into [[Kinbasket Lake]].  The river then turns (the &quot;Big Bend&quot;) south through [[Revelstoke Lake]] and the [[Arrow Lakes]] to the BC&amp;ndash;[[Washington]] border. 

The river then flows through the east-central portion of Washington State. The last 300 miles (480 km) of the Columbia form the Washington-[[Oregon]] boundary. The river goes into the Pacific Ocean at [[Ilwaco, Washington]] and [[Astoria, Oregon]] forming the [[Columbia Bar]].

For its first 200 miles (320 km) the Columbia flows northwest; it then bends to the south, crossing from Canada into the United States, where the river meets the Clark Fork. The [[Clark Fork River]] begins near [[Butte, Montana]] and flows through western Montana before entering [[Pend Oreille Lake]]. Water draining from the lake forms the [[Pend Oreille River]], which flows across the [[Idaho]] panhandle to Washington's northeastern corner where it meets the northern Canadian fork. 
[[Image:ColumbiarivergorgeJRH.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Columbia River Gorge, Oregon or South side]]

The river then runs southsouthwest through the [[Columbia Plateau]], changing to a southeasterly direction near the [[Columbia Basin]], where the magnificent [[Gorge at George]] is located. The [[Gorge Amphitheatre]], which looks out over the gorge, is a spectacular 40,000 person concert venue.

The river continues southeast until it passes the [[Hanford Nuclear Reservation]] just before it reaches the [[Snake River]]. The Columbia then makes a sharp bend to the west where it begins to form the Washington-Oregon border. 

Near the town of [[Hood River, Oregon]], the river begins cutting through the [[Cascade Mountains]] at the entrance to the [[Columbia River Gorge]]. The west side of the gorge is marked by [[Crown Point (Oregon)|Crown Point]]. Constant winds of 15 to 35 mph (25 to 55 km/h) blow through this wide straight [[gorge]]. It was here in [[Hood River County, Oregon]] that [[windsurfing]] was originated.

The Columbia River is the largest river in the world that has no [[River_delta|delta]]. The river continues west with one small north-northwesterly-directed stretch near [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]; [[Vancouver, Washington]]; and the [[confluence]] with the [[Willamette River]].  On this sharp bend the river's flow slows considerably and it drops the sediment that would normally form a delta.

==History==
On [[May 11]], [[1792]], Captain [[Robert Gray]] became the first white man to see the Columbia River. Gray traveled to the [[Pacific Northwest]] to trade for fur in a privately-owned vessel named ''Columbia''; he named the river after the ship.  Gray's discovery of the Columbia established a stronger belief that Americans had more of a &quot;right&quot; to the [[Oregon Country]], which was also claimed by [[Russia]]ns, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain|British]], [[Spain|Spanish]], and other nations.

&quot;Ouragan&quot; is the original name for the Columbia River.   Native American and First Nations stories hold the &quot;Ouragan&quot; as a very spiritual place.

[[Image:Cascade Columbia River.jpg|thumb|300px|Cascade on the Columbia River]]
[[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark]]'s overland expedition explored the vast, unmapped lands west of the [[Missouri River]].  On the last stretch of their expedition they traveled down the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean.  The expedition led the way in settling the west.

In 1825, on behalf of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], Dr. [[John McLoughlin]] established [[Fort Vancouver]] (currently Vancouver, Washington) on the banks of the Columbia as a [[fur trading]] headquarters in the region.  The fort was by far the largest western settlement of its time.  Every year ships would come from [[London]] (via the Pacific) to drop off supplies and trade goods in exchange for the furs. For many settlers the fort became the last stop on the [[Oregon Trail]] to buy supplies and land before starting their homestead. Because of its access to the Columbia river, Fort Vancouver's influence reached from [[Alaska]] to [[California]] and from the Rocky Mountains to the [[Hawaiian Islands]].

==Hydroelectric dams==
The mainstream of the Columbia River has 11 dams and 8 locks.
Nearly half of all [[hydroelectricity]] in the United States comes from the Columbia and its tributaries.  The largest of the 150 hydroelectric projects, the [[Grand Coulee Dam]] and the [[Chief Joseph Dam]], are also the largest in the United States.  The Grand Coulee Dam is the third largest hydroelectric dam in the world.  The dams also provide a secondary benefit in flood control and irrigation.

On its north-south str merchants of money and suppliers of capital in capitalist economies.]]

Importantly, the owners receive some of the profits or proceeds generated by the company, sometimes in the form of [[dividends]], sometimes from selling their ownership at higher price than their initial cost. They may also re-invest the profit in the company which may increase future profits and value of the company. They may also liquidate the company, selling all of the equipment, land, and other assets, and split the proceeds between them. The price at which ownership of productive capacity sells is generally the maximum of either the [[net present value]] of the expected future stream of profits or the value of the assets, net of any obligations. There is therefore a financial incentive for owners to exercise their authority in ways that increase the productive capacity of what they own. Various owners are motivated to various degrees by this incentive -- some give away a proportion of what they own, others seem very driven to increase their holdings. Nevertheless the incentive is always there, and it is credited by many as being a key aspect behind the remarkably consistent growth exhibited by capitalist economies. Meanwhile, some critics of capitalism claim that the incentive for the owners is exaggerated and that it results in the owners receiving money that rightfully belongs to the workers, while others point to the fact that the incentive only motivates owners to make a profit - something which may not necessarily result in a positive impact on society. Others note that in order to get a profit one must satisfy some need among other persons that they are willing to pay for. Also, some people in practice prefer to work for and buy products from for-profit organizations rather than to buy from or work for non-profit and communal production organizations which are legal in capitalist economies and which anyone can start or join.

When starting a [[business]], the initial owners or investors typically provide some money (the [[Capital (economics)|capital]]) which is used by the business to buy or [[lease]] some means of production. For example, the enterprise may buy or [[lease]] a piece of land and a building; it may buy machinery and hire workers ([[Labour (economics)|labor-power]]), or the capitalist may provide the labor himself. The commodities produced by the workers become the property of the capitalist (&quot;capitalist&quot; in this context refers to a person who has capital, rather than a person who favors capitalism), and are sold by the workers on behalf of the capitalist or by the capitalist himself. The money from sales also becomes the property of the capitalist. The capitalist pays the workers a portion of this profit for their labor, pays other overhead costs, and keeps the rest. This profit may be used in a variety of ways, it may be consumed, or it may be used in pursuit of more profit such as by investing it in the development of new products or technological innovations, or expanding the business into new geographic territories. If more money is needed than the initial owners are willing or able to provide, the business may need to borrow a limited amount of extra money with a promise to pay it back with interest. In effect, it may rent more capital.

====Self interest====
[[Image:Ayn_Rand1.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Ayn Rand]] was an outspoken advocate of the role of [[self-interest]] in capitalism]]

The pursuit of self-interest is commonly regarded as playing an essential role in capitalism. Many writers, such as [[Adam Smith]] and [[Ayn Rand]], point to what they believe to be the benefit of individuals trading for their [[self-interest]] rather than [[altruism|altruistically]] attempting to serve the &quot;common good.&quot; Smith, widely considered to be the intellectual father of capitalism, says in ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'':

:&quot;By pursuing his own interest, [an individual] frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the [common] good.&quot;

Ayn Rand, probably the most outspoken advocate of the role of self-interest in capitalism, says in ''Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal'':

:&quot;America's abundance was created not by public sacrifices to the common good, but by the productive genius of free men who pursued their own personal interests and the making of their own private fortunes.&quot;

Rand, though largely respectful of Smith's economic theories, didn't technically agree with his interpretation of the role of self-interest. She believed that self-interest was [[Objectivist philosophy|philosophically]] justified and did not accept Smith's idea of, as she would describe it 'people blindly pulled towards serving the common good.'

Nobel-economist [[Milton Friedman]] also embraces the role of self-interest in capitalism. In his famous article ''The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase Profits'', as he asserts that business has no [[social responsibility]] other than to increase profits and refrain from engaging in &quot;deception or fraud.&quot; He maintains that when business seeks to maximize profits, while respecting the guidelines of a [[free market]] by not defrauding or deceiving, it almost always incidentally does what is good for society. Friedman does not argue that business should not help the community but that it may indeed be in the long-run self-interest of a business to &quot;devote resources to providing amenities to [the] community...&quot; in order to &quot;generate goodwill&quot; and thereby increase profits. Some, including some supporters of capitalism, dislike the focus on self-interest. For example, self-described &quot;free market libertarian&quot; founder and CEO of [[Whole Foods Market]], [[John Mackey (businessman)|John Mackey]], claims in an article in ''Reason'' magazine that he is serving customers and society out of &quot;love&quot; rather than self-interest while he boasts the profitability of his company in that article. (''[http://www.reason.com/0510/fe.mf.rethinking.shtml Rethinking the Social Responsibility of Business]'', [[Reason magazine]] October 2005).

[[Image:Profit&amp;Loss.jpeg|200px|thumb|The pursuit of [[profit]] is one characteristic of capitalism]]

The pursuit and realization of [[profit]] as a method of self-interest is therefore an essential characteristic of capitalism. Profit is derived by selling a product for more than the cost required to produce or acquire it. Some consider the pursuit of profit to be the essence of capitalism. Sociologist and economist, Max Weber, says that &quot;capitalism is identical with the pursuit of profit, and forever renewed profit, by means of conscious, rational, capitalistic enterprise.&quot; However, it is not a unique characteristic for capitalism, some hunter-gatherers practiced profitable barter and monetary profit has been known since antiquity. In capitalism, profit is necessary for economic growth, with the growth being a function of the amount of profit reinvested rather than consumed.

===Free market===
The notion of a &quot;[[free market]]&quot; where all economic decisions regarding transfers of money, goods, and services take place on a voluntary basis, free of coercive influence, is commonly considered to be an essential characteristic of capitalism. Some contend that in systems where individuals are prevented from owning the means of production (including the profits), or coerced to share them, not ''all'' economic decisions are free of coercive influence, and, hence, are not free markets. In an ideal free market system none of these economic decisions involve coercion. Instead, they are determined in a decentralized manner by individuals trading, bargaining, cooperating, and competing with each other. In a free market, government may act in a defensive mode to forbid coercion among market participants but does not engage in proactive interventionist coercion; this state of affairs is also called ''[[laissez-faire]]''. Nevertheless, some authorities claim that capitalism is perfectly compatible with interventionist  [[authoritarian]] governments, and/or that a free market can exist without capitalism (see [[market socialism]]).

A legal system that grants and protects property rights provides property owners the entitlement to sell their property in accordance to their own valuation of that property; if there are no willing buyers at their offered price they have the freedom to retain it. According to standard capitalist theory, as explained by Adam Smith in ''Wealth of Nations'', when individuals make a trade they value what they are purchasing more than they value what they are giving in exchange for a commodity. If this were not the case, then they would not make the trade but retain ownership of the more valuable commodity. This notion underlies the concept of mutually-beneficial trade where it is held that both sides tend to benefit by an exchange.

[[Image:CME.JPG|200px|thumb|left|The [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]]. A free market consists of voluntary trade without interventionist regulation. Prices, for example, are determined by trade rather than by government.]]
In regard to pricing of goods and services in a free market, rather than this being ordained by government it is determined by trades that occur as a result of price agreement between buyers and sellers. The prices buyers are willing to pay for a commodity and the prices at which sellers are willing to part with that commodity are directly influenced by [[supply and demand]] (as well as the quantity to be traded). In abstract terms, the price is thus defined as the equilibrium point of the demand and the supply curves, which represent the prices at which buyers would buy (and sellers sell) certain quantities of the good in question. A price above the equilibrium point will lead to oversupply (the buyers wish to buy fewer goods at that price than the sellers are willing to produce), while a price below the equilibrium point will lead to the opposite situation. When the price a buyer is willing to pay coincides with the price a seller is willing to offer, a trade occurs and price is determined.

[[Financial markets]], though some of these markets are far from being free due to heavy regulation, allow the large scale, standardized, and easy trading of [[debt]], [[foreign exchange]], and ownership of companies (see [[finance capitalism]]). Similar changes have taken place for products from [[agriculture]], [[mining]], and [[energy]] production. Standardized markets have even appeared for [[pollution]] rights and for the prediction of future events like future [[weather]] and political elections.

Markets have, of course, existed throughout human history. Hunter-gatherers used to exchange their goods in [[barter]]. The appearance of money in [[Ancient history|antiquity]] facilitated exchanges, permitting the flowering of trade fairs in the [[Middle Ages]]. Nevertheless, many regulations existed, and the influence of the [[guild]]s prevented truly free markets. In modern economies, governments likewise do not allow unfettered market operation in many areas, but the price restrictions are much smaller than those imposed by guilds.

====Economic growth and mobility====
One of the primary objectives in a social system in which commerce and property have a central role is to promote the growth of capital. The standard measures of growth are Gross Domestic Product or [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]], [[capacity utilization]], and 'standard of living'. 

The ability of capitalist economies to sustainably increase and improve their stock of capital was central to the argument which [[Adam Smith]] advanced for a free market setting production, price and resource allocation. It has been argued that GDP per capita was essentially flat until the industrial revolution and the emergence of the capitalist economy, and that it has since increased rapidly in capitalist countries [http://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/04-05/essay.cfm][http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/TCEH/1998_Draft/World_GDP/Estimating_World_GDP.html]. It has also been argued that a higher GDP per capita promotes a higher standard of living, including the adequate or improved availability of food, housing, clothing, health care, reduced working hours and freedom from work for children and the elderly. These are reduced or unavailable if the GDP per capita is too low, so that most people are living a marginal existence.

Economic growth is, however, not universally viewed as an unequivocal good. The downside of such growth is referred to by economists as the 'externalization of costs' (see [[externality]]). Among other things, these effects include pollution, the disruption of traditional living patterns and cultures, the spread of pathogens, wars over resources or market access, and the creation of underclasses.

In defense of capitalism, liberal philosopher [[Isaiah Berlin]] has claimed that all of these ills are neither unique to capitalism, nor are they its inevitable consequences. See also [[Criticism of capitalism#Sustainability|Sustainability]].

One of the key markers of entrepreneurial economies and 'growth' in a society is its economic mobility, defined as the existence of large changes in the make-up of its socio-economic strata. This is manifested as the occurrence of large fluctuations in the various [[decile]]s or [[quintiles]] of income and wealth among the population, and the existence of large changes over a person's lifetime in relation to their real earning power. In standard economics, a capitalist system provides more opportunities for an individual to rise faster in the world by entering new professions or establishing a business venture. The instability of economic strata is contrasted with traditional [[feudal]] or [[tribal]] societies, which are considered to have more stable wealth relationships, and with the [[egalitarianism]] that exists in socialist societies, which distribute more of their wealth in the form of social benefits and therefore reduce income mobility, particularly among those who own capital and wish to trade it.

However, the existence of large fluctuations in income deciles does not always represent income mobility - with individuals receiving regular wage increases over their working lives and then retiring, such fluctuations alone do not show that there is 'mobility' ''per se''. Moreover, it is argued by many labor economists that wage instability represents the transfer of risk to workers and particular sectors of the economy such as agriculture, and away from the holders of capital.

====Self-organization====

[[Image:f_hayek.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Friedrich Hayek]] advocated allowing an economy to [[self-organization|self-organize]], maintaining that government cannot access or coordinate the widespread distribution of information possessed by millions of individuals.]] 
While a great deal of planning is undertaken among individual companies and other organisations in capitalist economies, few significant mechanisms for imposing overall direction are available to governments. There is also a scarcity of reliable predictive tools and foreknowledge of how an economy is likely to behave or perform more than a year or two into the future. While most transactions may be planned and agreed by the actors involved, many society-wide phenomena that emerge from the markets and its transactions are often not planned, predicted, approved or authorised by anyone. Nevertheless, such an economic system can organize itself into a complex system without an external guidance or planning mechanism. This phenomenon is called &quot;[[self-organization]].&quot; [[Friedrich Hayek]] coined the term &quot;[[catallaxy]]&quot; as a market where &quot;spontaneous order&quot; emerges when no centralized control source (government) overrides decisions of individuals pursuing their own ends. However, in all large-scale modern economies the State conducts a degree of [[planned economy|centralized economic planning]] (using such tools as allowing the country's [[central bank]] to set base [[interest rates]]), ostensibly as an attempt to improve efficiency, attenuate cyclical volatility, and further particular social goals. 

Some economists use [[chaos theory]] to argue that it is impossible to make accurate long-term economic predictions. They view the decentralized nature of economic planning and development that occurs in capitalism as one of its greatest strengths, arguing that it permits many solutions to be tried, and that real-world competition generally finds a good solution to emerging challenges. This is opposed to the [[central planning]] approach to the running of a society, which often selects inappropriate solutions as a result of faulty forecasting. One possible example is the experience in Somalia where the previously regulated telecommunications industry is reported to be &quot;thriving&quot; now that, and reportedly because, the country lacks a government. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4020259.stm]

Capitalist economies typically contain numerous companies, and people are free to enter into many different types of arrangement with each other. Such an economy reacts to technological change, new discoveries and other developments through continual readjustments in the relationships which exist among companies and individuals. In this way the economy's control mechanisms and how information flows through it evolve over time, and are characterised by  a kind of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; selection and evolution process which is not dissimilar to that exhibited in natural systems and their component relationships. 

Ancient [[Rome]] and China under the [[Song dynasty]] are examples of societies that had some of the characteristics of capitalism, like no feudal [[fiefs]], (weak) property rights, economic growth, and for their times advanced technology. It is much debated why these societies did not have their own &quot;industrial revolution&quot; and thus achieve industrial capitalism in the modern sense. It has been suggested that these states formed monopolies in their parts of the world with very limited competition from other states. The ruling class then become complacent and the successful institutions were overturned in order to enrich certain special interest groups. Much innovation has historically taken place when there where many competing states, like in the city states of ancient [[Greece]] and [[renaissance]] [[Italy]]. 

Analysis of the networks of connections and arrangements in the economy has shown a degree of similarity to other networks such as phone systems or the Internet. [http://www.theyrule.net/] contains examples of networks of company board members. Networks of customer links and monetary flows exhibit similar characteristics.

==Which economies are &quot;capitalist&quot;?==

The eminent sociologist [[Max Weber]] described capitalism as being present  &quot;wherever the industrial provision for the needs of a human group is carried out by the [[free enterprise|method of enterprise]]&quot;. In his introduction to the 1920 edition of The Protestant Work Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism he offered a broader definiton which included Marx's '[[antediluvian]] forms of mercantile and [[usury]] capital  as well as any profit-making by opportunity (for example [[speculation]]) - not just by direct economic activity (Sayer 1996).

Some believe that it is inaccurate to call any or some of the major industrialized economies &quot;capitalist&quot; because of the level of government intervention. For example, some assert that the market in the United States of America is significantly less than &amp;quot;free&quot;, and that therefore it is more appropriately termed a ''[[mixed economy]]'' that is merely skewed more toward capitalism than most national economies, rather than being a true representation of capitalism. Still others might say that the U.S. economy is capitalist, but the U.K. economy is a &quot;mixed economy,&quot; or the Hong Kong economy is capitalist and the U.S. economy is mixed and so on, depending upon their perception of how much economic freedom exists in those locales. According to economic and business historian [[Robert Hessen]] of [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]]:

:&quot;a fully free economy (true [[laissez-faire]]) never has existed, but governmental authority over economic activity has sharply increased since the eighteenth century, and especially since the Great Depression...Today the United States, once the citadel of capitalism, is a &quot;mixed economy&quot; in which government bestows favors and imposes restrictions with no clear or consistent principle in mind.&quot; [http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Capitalism.html]

A similar classification, associated largely with the [[Austrian school]] of economics, regards most present economic systems as a perversion of capitalism, sometimes called [[crony capitalism]], and envisages a de-cronied capitalist ideal. Similarly, some use the phrase &quot;[[laissez-faire capitalism]]&quot; to distinguish between &quot;ordinary capitalism,&quot; believing that there is a difference. Others find the phrase &quot;laissez-faire capitalism&quot; redundant, pointing out that the common definition of capitalism explicitly refers to trade occurring in a &quot;free market&quot;.

Many [[Marxist]]s, [[anarchists]], [[Greens]] and [[Anti-globalization|anti-globalist]]s agree that the governments in capitalist societies, that is to say societies where a capitalist class is the ruling class, are not serving in the role of protecting &quot;the free market&quot;, but would go on to say that these governments are, in fact, acting to protect the owners of capital and corporations as their first priority. [[Noam Chomsky]] says that &quot;''There's nothing remotely like capitalism in existence. To the extent there ever was, it had disappeared by the 1920s or '30s''.&quot; (interview with Detroit Metro Times). Libertarians and other free-market advocates may also share this opinion regarding some or all of the major economies. However, in the 18th century in America, production and distribution of goods were regulated by government ministries. Also, government subsidies were granted to agriculture. Economic intervention continued throughout the 19th century.

[[Image:Index2006 EconFreedomMAP.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A map of the [[Heritage Foundation]]'s [[Index of Economic Freedom]]s. Various reserachers have argued that nations with a higher economic freedom have a higher GDP/capita and less poverty.]]

Proponents of the world-system perspective suggest that the whole globe has been incorporated into a single capitalist world-economy. Even though a state (such as Cuba) may be socialist, it works in relation to a much larger, overarching capitalist world-economy.

Mainstream economists, for their part, admit that the present economic systems have diverged from earlier forms labeled &quot;capitalism&quot;, but many believe that some of the modern economies are still best described as being &quot;capitalism&quot;.

==== Index of Economic Freedom ====

There are two [[Index of Economic Freedom|Indices of Economic Freedom]] used in economic research. The publishers are [[right-wing]], business-orientated and funded [[think tank]]s. One index is released by the [[Heritage Foundation]] and [[Wall Street Journal]], the other by the [[Fraser Institute]]. Both attempt to measure of the degree of economic freedom in countries, mostly in regard to rule of law, lack of governmental intervention, private property rights, and free trade. The Index of Economic Freedom defines &quot;economic freedom&quot; [http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/faq.cfm] as &quot;the absence of government coercion or constraint on the production, distribution, or consumption of goods and services beyond the extent necessary for citizens to protect and maintain liberty itself.&quot; (This is otherwise known as [[laissez-faire]]).

==Capitalism in decline or on the rise?==
Citing the ideal of a [[free market]], many consider an economy with lower taxes, smaller government and fewer regulations to be more capitalistic. If government spending is used as a gauge of government expansion, the last century saw a very large increase in the role of government in Western countries. Combined U.S. government spending increased from 3-4% of GDP to 33% flattening somewhat since 1983 when the sharp upward trend was broken during President Ronald Reagan's term. An average for 16 industrial nations jumped from 8% of GDP to 45%. ''Non-defense'' spending in the U.S. as a percentage of net income increase from 11.5% in 1945 to 30% in 1983, remaining stable through 2003 (some exclude defense spending when gauging government expansion). Compliance with more regulations is increasingly costly [http://mwhodges.home.att.net/intl-spend.htm][http://mwhodges.home.att.net/regulation.htm]. Thus, it can be argued that the degree of capitalism has seen a remarkable ''decline'' in Western nations. However, since 1983 the percentage of non-defense government spending in the U.S. has stabilized, leading some such as Milton Friedman to express some hope that the tide may reverse toward more capitalism [http://www.hooverdigest.org/051/friedman.html]. Alan Greenspan, in a speech in 2005, expressed his belief that &quot;free-market capitalism&quot; is being rediscovered through deregulation after a period of stifling regulation brought about by [[Keynesian economics]]. [http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,16849-1823177,00.html]

One explanation for this is that the Western nations have increasingly averted or regulated various market failures such as pollution, health care, unemployment, wealth inequality, and education. Supporters of less state interference, such as [[libertarians]],  [[neoliberals]], and financial [[conservatives]], would instead argue that the regulations restrict competition, that the taxes go to the special interest groups with the most political clout, that governments do things less efficiently than the private sector, and that market failures are actually caused by government regulations, such as the minimum wage, and public schools.

==Criticisms of capitalism==
''Main article: [[Criticisms of capitalism]], [[Anti-capitalism]]''

Capitalism has met with strong opposition throughout history, mainly from the [[left wing politics|left]] but also from the [[right wing politics|right]]. These have included [[socialism|socialists]] and [[anarchism|anarchists]], such as [[Karl Marx]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lenin]], [[Peter Kropotkin]] and [[Mao Ze Dong]]. More recently, various aspects of capitalism have come under attack from the [[anti-globalisation]] movement, and activists such as [[Naomi Klein]] and [[Angela Davis]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''computer system''' is the synthesis of [[Computer hardware|hardware]] and [[Computer software|software]]. A typical computer system employs a [[computer]] that uses programmable devices to store, retrieve, and process data.  [http://computing-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/computer+system] The [[personal computer]] or PC exemplifies one example of a computer system. An [[Automatic Teller Machine]] (ATM) is another example of a computer system. The [[Internet]] does NOT exemplify a computer system persay, but rather a [[computer network|network]] of computers. [http://www.orafaq.com/glossary/faqglosi.htm]

Even the simplest computer classifies as a computer system, because at least two components (hardware and software) have to work together. But the real meaning of &quot;computer system&quot; comes with interconnection.  Many computer systems can interconnect, that is, join to become a bigger [[system]]. Interconnecting computer systems can prove difficult due to incompatibilities. Sometimes these difficulties occur between differing hardware and sometimes between differing software.

Designers of different computer systems do not necessarily aim to interconnect their creations with any other system. Technically knowledgable people can often configure disparate computers to communicate using a set of rules and constraints known  as [[protocol (computing)|protocols]]. Protocols attempt to precisely define the communication within and between computing endpoints. If two computer systems define the same [[protocol (computing)|protocols]], they may be capable of interconnecting and become a part of a larger [[system]].

      <comment>/* Media Cross Ownership */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cross ownership''' is a method of reinforcing business relationships by owning stock in the companies with which a given company does business. In the US, it also refers to a type of investment in different mass-media properties in one market.

==Cross ownership of stock==

Some countries where cross ownership of shares is a major part of the business culture are:
* [[Japan]]
* [[Germany]]

Positives of cross ownership:
* Closely ties each business to the economic destiny of its business partners
* Promotes a slow rate of economic change

Cross ownership of shares is criticized for:
* Stagnating the economy
* Wasting capital that could be used to improve productivity
* Expanding economic downturns by preventing reallocation of capital

A major factor in perpetuating cross ownership of shares is a high [[capital gains]] tax rate.  A company has less incentive to sell cross owned shares if taxes are high because of the immediate reduction in the value of the assets.

For example, a company owns $1000 of stock in another company that was originally purchased for $200.  If the capital gains tax rate is 50% (like Germany) and the company sells the stock,
the company has $600 which is 40 percent less than before it sold the stock.

Long term cross ownership of shares combined with a high capital tax rate greatly increases periods of asset deflation both in time and in severity.

==Media Cross Ownership==

Cross ownership also refers to a type of media ownership in which one type of communications (say a newspaper) owns or is the sister company of another type of medium (such as a radio or TV station). One example is ''[[The New York Times]]'' 's ownership of [[WQXR]] Radio and the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'''s similar relationship with [[WGN]] Radio and Television.

The [[Federal Communications Commission]] generally does not allow cross ownership, to keep from one license holder having too much local media ownership, unless the license holder obtains a waiver, such as [[News Corporation]] and the [[Tribune Company]] have in New York.

The mid-1970s cross-ownership guidelines grandfathered already-existing crossownerships, such as ''Tribune''-WGN, ''New York Times''-WQXR and the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' ownership of [[WPIX]] Television and Radio.

'''Capcom''' (&amp;#12459;&amp;#12503;&amp;#12467;&amp;#12531; in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]) {{tyo|9697}} is a leading [[Japan]]ese [[video game developer|developer]] and [[video game publisher|publisher]] of [[computer and video games]]. It was founded in [[1979]] as Japan Capsule Computers, a company devoted to the manufacturing and distribution of electronic game machines. Their current name is a conjunction of '''Cap'''sule '''Com'''puters''.

==History==
Over the years, Capcom has created some of the biggest and longest running [[video game franchise|franchises]] in video gaming history. The company released their first [[arcade game]] in [[1984]]: ''[[Vulgus]]''. Their early games were mostly arcade games such as the [[scrolling shooter]] ''[[1942 (video game)|1942]]''.

In the late [[1980s|80s]], [[Yoshiki Okamoto]] joined the company from [[Konami]]. In [[1987]], Capcom released the game ''[[Street Fighter]]''. In the same year, the company also released the hugely influential [[platform game|platformer]] ''[[Mega Man (video game)|Mega Man]]'' (''Rockman'' in Japan) for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. ''[[Final Fight]]'', a [[fighting game|beat 'em up]], was released in [[1989]].  In [[1991]], Okamoto's ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' was released in the [[video arcade|arcades]]. ''[[Resident Evil (video game)|Resident Evil]]'' (''Biohazard'' in Japan), a successful [[survival horror game]], was released on the [[PlayStation]] in [[1996]].

Two Capcom development houses, Clover Studio[http://games.ign.com/objects/674/674345.html] and [[Flagship]][http://games.ign.com/objects/027/027402.html] have created successful titles in recent years, including the ''[[Viewtiful Joe]]'' series and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages|The Legend of Zelda: Oracle Series]]'' (under supervision of [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]).

In [[2002]] a movie based on the series entitled ''[[Resident Evil (movie)|Resident Evil]]'' was released, which recieved a sequel )''[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse]]'') in [[2004]]. A third movie, ''[[Resident Evil: Afterlife]]'' will be released in [[2007]].

==Mascot==

[[image:Captain_Commando.png|right|thumb|Captain Commando, as he appears in ''Marvel vs. Capcom''.]]
Capcom's original [[mascot]], [[Captain Commando]], is a [[superhero]] who wears a futuristic armor of unknown origin. His name forms the words CapCom when the first three letters of each word are combined. He originally appeared in the early Capcom [[Famicom]]/NES game ''[[Section Z]]'' (the arcade version of ''Section Z'' has similar [[gameplay]], but it is not clear that the hero is the same person) and in the manuals of Capcom's early NES games to thank players for purchasing them. He later appeared as the title character in an arcade game bearing his name, as well as in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom series|Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' and its [[sequel]], in which he is often considered to be an excessively powerful character. In ''Marvel vs. Capcom'', he still serves as a mascot, regularly shouting &quot;Capcom!&quot; during fights and relaying Capcom-themed messages after winning. He displays the ability to quickly change from regular clothing, including a cowboy hat, into his armor, suggesting a [[secret identity]]. [[Mega Man (character)|Mega Man]] has superseded Captain Commando as Capcom's official mascot, primarily because of the immense popularity of the ''[[Mega Man]]'' series. Captain Commando's storyline is not connected to that of ''[[Commando (game)|Commando]]'' and ''[[Bionic Commando]]'', despite the similar name.

==Movies and Television==
Capcom's games and characters therein have been featured in a number of television cartoons and theatrical movies. Some of which include:
* One-time company mascot, '''Mega Man''', played a supporting role in a Nintendo inspired TV-show [[Captain N: The Game Master]] and has later been featured in two separate TV-cartoons. ''Mega Man'' produced by Ruby-Spears and an anime-series ''[[Mega Man: NT Warrior]]''. He also starred in three OVAs originally released in Japan in 1993, released later on DVD in North America.
* '''Street Fighter 2''' has also been a popular source films and cartoons. A flopped [[Street Fighter (film)|live action adaption]] was released in 1994. Shortly afterwards a more popular anime adaptation was released as well as an american cartoon-series based on the movie.
* The fighting-game '''Dark Stalkers''' was made into two animated adaptations in Japan and US.
* So far the most successful series (of [[Resident Evil (film)|films]]) has been based on Capcom's popular survivor horror series '''[[Resident Evil]]'''. Though the first received a cold reception in theatres, its VHS and DVD sales motivated Paul Anderson to make a sequel which was also a financial success. Two more sequels are due to be released; the plot of the third will lead to the fourth which is planned to be the last one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{History of Cambodia}}
This is the '''History of Cambodia''' series.

==Early Kingdoms==
{{main|Early history of Cambodia}}
The [[Khmer people]], one of the first inhabitants of South East Asia, were among the first in [[Southeast Asia]] to adopt religious ideas and political institutions from India and to establish centralized kingdoms encompassing large territories. The earliest known kingdom in the area, [[Funan]], flourished from around the first to the sixth century A.D. It was succeeded by [[Chenla]], which controlled large areas of modern [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], and [[Thailand]].[[Khmer empire]] The golden age of Khmer civilization, however, was the period from the ninth to the thirteenth centuries, when the kingdom of [[Kambojas |Kambuja]], which gave Kampuchea, or Cambodia, its name, ruled large territories from its capital in the region of Angkor in western Cambodia. 

Under [[Jayavarman VII of Kambuja|Jayavarman VII]] (1181-ca. 1218), Kambuja reached its zenith of political power and cultural creativity. Jayavarman VII gained power and territory in a series of successful wars against its close enemies; the Chams and the Vietnamese. Following Jayavarman VII's death, Kambuja experienced gradual decline. Important factors were the aggressiveness of neighboring peoples (especially the Thai, or [[Siam]]ese), chronic interdynastic strife, and the gradual deterioration of the complex irrigation system that had ensured rice surpluses. The [[Angkor]]ian monarchy survived until 1431, when the Thai captured [[Angkor Thom]] and the Cambodian king fled to the southern part of his country.

==Dark Ages==
{{main|Dark ages of Cambodia}}
The fifteenth to the nineteenth century was a period of continued decline and territorial loss. Cambodia enjoyed a brief period of prosperity during the sixteenth century because its kings, who built their capitals in the region southeast of the [[Tonle Sap]] along the [[Mekong River]], promoted trade with other parts of Asia. This was the period when [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] adventurers and missionaries first visited the country. But the Thai conquest of the new capital at [[Lovek]] in 1594 marked a downturn in the country's fortunes and Cambodia became a pawn in power struggles between its two increasingly powerful neighbors, Siam and Vietnam. Vietnam's settlement of the [[Mekong Delta]] led to its annexation of that area at the end of the seventeenth century. Cambodia thereby lost some of its richest territory and was cut off from the sea. Such foreign encroachments continued through the first half of the nineteenth century because Vietnam was determined to absorb Khmer land and to force the inhabitants to accept Vietnamese culture.

==French Colonial Period==
{{main|Colonial Cambodia}}
In 1863 [[Norodom of Cambodia|King Norodom]] signed an agreement with the [[France|French]] to establish a protectorate over his kingdom. The country gradually came under French colonial domination. During [[World War II]], the [[Japan]]ese allowed the French government (based at [[Vichy]]) that collaborated with the Nazis to continue administering Cambodia and the other Indochinese territories, but they also fostered Khmer nationalism. Cambodia enjoyed a brief period of independence in [[1945]] before Allied troops restored French control. King [[Norodom Sihanouk]], who had been chosen by France to succeed [[Monivong of Cambodia|King Monivong]] in [[1941]], rapidly assumed a central political role as he sought to neutralize leftist and republican opponents and attempted to negotiate acceptable terms for independence from the French. Sihanouk's &quot;royal crusade for independence&quot; resulted in grudging French acquiescence to his demands for a transfer of sovereignty. A partial agreement was struck in October 1953. Sihanouk then declared that independence had been achieved and returned in triumph to [[Phnom Penh]].

==First administration of Sihanouk==
{{main|Cambodia under Sihanouk (1954-1970)}}
As a result of the Geneva Conference on Indochina, Cambodia was able to bring about the withdrawal of the [[Viet Minh]] troops from its territory and to withstand any residual impingement upon its sovereignty by external powers. 

Neutrality was the central element of Cambodian foreign policy during the 1950s and 1960s. By the mid-1960s, parts of Cambodia's eastern provinces were serving as bases for North Vietnamese Army and [[Viet Cong]] (NVA/VC) forces operating against South Vietnam, and the port of Sihanoukville was being used to supply them. As NVA/VC activity grew, the United States and [[South Vietnam]] became concerned, and in 1969, the United States began a fourteen month long series of bombing raids targeted at NVA/VC elements, contributing to destabilization. Prince Sinanouk tacitly supported the bombing. The United States claims that the bombing campaign took place no further than ten, and later twenty miles inside the Cambodian border, areas where the Cambodian population had been evicted by the NVA. {{ref|Davidson}} &lt;!--Cite supports entire paragraph--&gt; In October 40,000 North Vietnamese soldiers entered Central Cambodia with Sihanouk's approval. {{Ref|Encyclopedia}}

Throughout the 1960s, domestic Cambodian politics polarized. Opposition grew within the middle class and among leftists including Paris-educated leaders such as [[Son Sen]], [[Ieng Sary]], and Saloth Sar (later known as [[Pol Pot]]), who led an [[insurgent|insurgency]] under the clandestine Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK). Sihanouk called these insurgents the [[Khmer Rouge]], literally the &quot;Red Khmer.&quot; But the 1966 national assembly elections showed a significant swing to the right, and Gen. [[Lon Nol]] formed a new government, which lasted until 1967. During 1968 and 1969, the insurgency worsened. In August 1969, Gen. Lon Nol formed a new government. Prince Sihanouk went abroad for medical reasons in January 1970.

==The Khmer Republic and the War==
{{main|Civil War in Cambodia}}
In March [[1970]], while Prince Sihanouk was absent, Gen. [[Lon Nol]] [[Cambodian coup of 1970|deposed Prince Sihanouk and assumed power]]. Son Ngoc Thanh announced his support for the new government. On [[October 9]], the Cambodian monarchy was abolished, and the country was renamed the Khmer Republic.

Hanoi rejected the new republic's request for the withdrawal of NVA troops.  2,000-4,000 Cambodians who had gone to North Vietnam in 1954 reentered Cambodia, backed by North Vietnamese soldiers.  In response, the United States moved to provide material assistance to the new government's armed forces, which were engaged against both the CPK insurgents and NVA forces. 

In April 1970, US President Nixon announced to the American public that US and South Vietnamese ground forces had entered Cambodia in a campaign aimed at destroying NVA base areas in Cambodia (see [[Cambodian Incursion]]). The US had already been bombing Cambodia for well over a year by that point.  Demonstrations took place across college campuses in the US, culminating in the death of four students at [[Kent State]], lending support in the US withdrawal from Vietnam.

Although a considerable quantity of equipment was seized or destroyed by US and South Vietnamese forces, containment of North Vietnamese forces proved elusive.  The North Vietnamese moved deeper into Cambodia to avoid US and South Vietnamese raids. NVA units overran many Cambodian army positions while the CPK expanded their small-scale attacks on lines of communication.

The Khmer Republic's leadership was plagued by disunity among its three principal figures: Lon Nol, Sihanouk's cousin [[Sirik Matak]], and National Assembly leader [[In Tam]]. Lon Nol remained in power in part because none of the others were prepared to take his place. In 1972, a constitution was adopted, a parliament elected, and Lon Nol became president. But disunity, the problems of transforming a 30,000-man army into a national combat force of more than 200,000 men, and spreading corruption weakened the civilian administration and army.

The Communist insurgency inside Cambodia continued to grow, with supplies and military support provided by North Vietnam. [[Pol Pot]] and [[Ieng Sary]] asserted their dominance over the Vietnamese-trained communists, many of whom were purged. At the same time, the [[Communist Party of Kampuchea]] forces became stronger and more independent of their Vietnamese patrons. By 1973, the CPK were fighting battles against government forces with little or no North Vietnamese troop support, and they controlled nearly 60% of Cambodia's territory and 25% of its population.

The government made three unsuccessful attempts to enter into negotiations with the insurgents, but by 1974, the CPK were operating openly as divisions, and some of the NVA combat forces had moved into South Vietnam. Lon Nol's control was reduced to small enclaves around the cities and main transportation routes. More than 2 million refugees from the war lived in [[Phnom Penh]] and other cities.

On New Year's Day 1975, Communist troops launched an offensive which, in 117 days of the hardest fighting of the war, collapsed the Khmer Republic. Simultaneous attacks around the perimeter of Phnom Penh pinned down Republican forces, while other CPK units overran fire bases controlling the vital lower Mekong resupply route. A US-funded airlift of ammunition and rice ended when Congress refused additional aid for Cambodia. [[Phnom Penh]] and other cities were subjected to daily rocket attacks causing thousands of civilian casualties. The Lon Nol government in Phnom Penh surrendered on April 17--5 days after the US mission evacuated Cambodia.

==Democratic Kampuchea (1975-1979)==
{{main|Democratic Kampuchea}}
Immediately after its victory, the CPK ordered the evacuation of all cities and towns, sending the complete urban population out into the countryside to work as farmers, as the CPK was trying to reshape society into a model that Pol Pot had conceived.

Thousands had been starving and dying of disease prior to the CPK takeover.  Thousands starved or died of disease during the evacuation and its aftermath. Many of those forced to evacuate the cities were resettled in newly created villages, which lacked food, agricultural implements, and medical care. Many who lived in cities had lost the skills necessary for survival in an agrarian environment.  Thousands starved before the first harvest. Hunger and malnutrition--bordering on starvation--were constant during those years. Most military and civilian leaders of the former regime who failed to disguise their pasts were executed.

Within the CPK, the Paris-educated leadership--[[Pol Pot]], [[Ieng Sary]], [[Nuon Chea]], and [[Son Sen]]--were in control. A new constitution in January 1976 established Democratic Kampuchea as a Communist People's Republic, and a 250-member Assembly of the Representatives of the People of Kampuchea (PRA) was selected in March to choose the collective leadership of a State Presidium, the chairman of which became the head of state.

Prince Sihanouk resigned as head of state on April 4. On April 14, after its first session, the PRA announced that [[Khieu Samphan]] would chair the State Presidium for a 5-year term. It also picked a 15-member cabinet headed by Pol Pot as prime minister. Prince Sihanouk was put under virtual house arrest.

The new government sought to completely restructure Cambodian society. Remnants of the old society were abolished and religion, particularly [[Buddhism]] and [[Catholicism]], was suppressed. Agriculture was collectivized, and the surviving part of the industrial base was abandoned or placed under state control. Cambodia had neither a currency nor a banking system. 

Life in 'Democratic Kampuchea' was strict and brutal. In many areas of the country people were rounded up and executed for speaking a foreign language, wearing glasses, scavenging for food, and even crying for dead loved ones. Former businessmen and bureaucrats were ruthlessly hunted down and killed along with their entire families; the Khmer Rouge feared that they held beliefs that could lead them to oppose their regime. A few Khmer Rouge loyalists were even killed for failing to find enough 'counterrevolutionaires' to find and execute.

Solid estimates of the numbers who died between 1975 and 1979 are not available, but it is likely that hundreds of thousands were brutally executed by the regime. Hundreds of thousands died of starvation and disease (both under the CPK and during the Vietnamese invasion in 1978). Some estimates of the dead range from 1 to 3 million, out of a 1975 population estimated at 7.3 million.  The CIA estimated 50,000-100,000 were executed from 1975 to 1979, mostly ae presence of numerous [[NGO]]'s which provide numerous services which the government fails to provide. As one [[UNDP]] official put it, the CAR is a country &quot;sous serum,&quot; or a country hooked up to an IV. (Mehler 2005:150) The very presence of numerous foreign personnel and organizations in the country, including peacekeepers and even refugee camps, provides an important source of revenue for many Central Africans. 

The [[Central African Republic]] is classified as one of the world's least developed countries, with an estimated annual per capita income of $310 (2000). 
Sparsely populated and landlocked, the nation is overwhelmingly agrarian, with the vast bulk of the population engaged in subsistence farming and 55% of the country's GDP arising from agriculture. Subsistence agriculture, together with forestry, remains the backbone of the economy of the Central African Republic (CAR), with more than 70% of the population living in outlying areas. The agricultural sector generates half of GDP. Principal foodcrops include [[cassava]], [[peanuts]], [[sorghum]], [[millet]], [[maize]], [[sesame]], and [[plantains]]s. Principal cash crops for export include [[cotton]], [[coffee]], and [[tobacco]].  [[Timber]] has accounted for about 16% of export earnings and the diamond industry for nearly 54%.

The country also has rich but largely unexploited natural resources in the form of [[diamond]]s, [[gold]], [[uranium]], and other [[mineral]]s. There may be [[petroleum]] deposits along the country's northern border with [[Chad]]. Diamonds are the only of these mineral resources currently being developed; reported sales of largely uncut diamonds make up close to 60% of the CAR's export earnings. Industry contributes less than 20% of the country's GDP, with artesian diamond mining, breweries, and sawmills making up the bulk of the sector. Services currently account for 25% of GDP, largely because of the oversized government bureaucracy and high transportation costs arising from the country's landlocked position.

Much of the country's limited electrical supply is provided by hydroelectric plants based in [[Boali]]. Fuel supplies must be barged in via the [[Oubangui River]] or trucked overland through [[Cameroon]], resulting in frequent shortages of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. The C.A.R.'s transportation and communication network is limited. The country has only 429 kilometers of paved road, limited international, and no domestic air service, and does not possess a railroad. River traffic on the Oubangui River is impossible from April to July, and conflict in the region has sometimes prevented shipments from moving between [[Kinshasa]] and Bangui. The telephone system functions, albeit imperfectly. Four radio stations currently operate in the C.A.R., as well as one television station. Numerous newspapers and pamphlets are published on a regular basis, and one company has begun providing internet service.

In the 40 years since independence, the C.A.R. has made slow progress toward economic development. Economic mismanagement, poor infrastructure, a limited tax base, scarce private investment, and adverse external conditions have led to deficits in both its budget and external trade. Its debt burden is considerable, and the country has seen a decline in per capita [[GNP]] over the last 30 years.  Important constraints to economic development include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor transportation system, a largely unskilled work force, and a legacy of misdirected macroeconomic policies. The 50% devaluation of the currencies of 14 Francophone African nations on [[12 January]] [[1994]] had mixed effects on the CAR's economy. Diamond, timber, coffee, and cotton exports increased, leading an estimated rise of GDP of 7% in 1994 and nearly 5% in 1995. Military rebellions and social unrest in 1996 were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and a drop in GDP of 2%. Ongoing violence between the government and rebel military groups over pay issues, living conditions, and political representation has destroyed many businesses in the capital and reduced tax revenues for the government.

The [[IMF]] approved an Extended Structure Adjustment Facility in 1998. The government has set targets of annual 5% growth and 2.5% inflation for 2000-2001. Structural adjustment programs with the [[World Bank]] and IMF and interest-free credits to support investments in the [[agriculture]], [[livestock]], and transportation sectors have had limited impact. The World Bank and IMF are now encouraging the government to concentrate exclusively on implementing much-needed economic reforms to jump-start the economy and defining its fundamental priorities with the aim of alleviating poverty. As a result, many of the state-owned business entities have been privatized and limited efforts have been made to standardize and simplify labor and investment codes and to address problems of corruption. The Central African Government is currently in the process of adopting new labor and investment codes.

* ''The national network for fixed phones'' consists of some [[Panaftel]] [[microwave]] radio relay links (from Bangui to Bossembele, Baoro, Carnot, Berberati and on to Gamboula on the border with Cameroon). This microwave network has however never been used, since the equipment requires electricity for the repeaters that are located every 50km. The current fixed-lines outside Bangui are transmitted through a DOMSAT network installed in the early 1990s as a star formation around the Bangui satellite earth station (1 [[Intelsat]]). There are about 9000 fixed-lines subscribers (2003).&lt;br&gt;
* ''GSM coverage'' was for a long time limited to the capital area. But in October 2005 coverage was expanded at least to Berberati in the western part of the country. There are currently two GSM-900 mobile operators, Telecel CAR and Nationlink Telecom RCA. A third network, Centrafrique Telecom Plus closed down in late 2003 after failing to attract more than 5000 subscribers.&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''military of the Central African Republic''' ('''Forces armées centrafricaines''' or FACA), currently numbers at approximately 2,000, and military expenditures amount to 1.1% of the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of that nation.

Under military restructuring plans formulated 1999-2000, the civilian Minister of Defense controlled and directed all armed forces, including the Presidential Security Unit (UPS), which had previously been seen as a militia supporting the president. In April 2001, the C.A.R. armed forces numbered about 3,000, including army, navy, air force, gendarmerie, national police, Presidential Security Unit, and local police personnel. An estimated 1,200 members of the army and gendarmerie fled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo following the failed coup attempt of May 2001. 

Following the 2003 coup, [[Central African Economic and Monetary Community]] ([[CAEMC]]-Communauté Économique et Monétaire de l'Afrique Centrale) and C.A.R. armed forces assumed responsibility for securing the capital city. CEMAC forces currently total approximately 400 soldiers, which are supported by an additional 200 [[France|French]] soldiers. The C.A.R. armed forces number approximately 2,000. Working with the French, the C.A.R. military is attempting to provide professional training and decentralize its troops in an effort to combat road bandits, thievery, and poaching throughout the C.A.R. territory.

The Central African Republic is an active member in several Central African organizations, including the Economic and Monetary Union ([[CEMAC]]), the [[Economic Community of Central African States]] ([[CEEAC]]), the [[Central African Peace and Security Council]] ([[COPAX]]--still under formation), and the [[Central Bank of Central African States]] ([[BEAC]]). Standardization of tax, customs, and security arrangements between the Central African states is a major foreign policy objective of the C.A.R. Government. President [[Ange-Félix Patassé]] also has manifested considerable interest in mediating conflicts in the region. The C.A.R. is a participant in the [[Community of Sahel-Saharan States]] ([[CEN-SAD]]), and the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU). [[Libya]] and, to a lesser degree, [[Sudan]] have shown increased interest in cooperation with the C.A.R. over the last year.

Outside of Africa, the C.A.R. maintains fairly close ties to [[France]], albeit considerably reduced from previous years. In the late 1990s, France withdrew its forces stationed in the C.A.R.; drops in its external assistance budget have reduced French military and social [[development aid]] to the country. Other multilateral organizations--including the [[World Bank]], [[International Monetary Fund]], [[UN]] agencies, [[European Union]], and the [[African Development Bank]]--and bilateral donors--including [[Germany]], [[Japan]], the [[European Union]], and the [[United States]]--are significant development partners for the C.A.R.

Nineteen countries have resident diplomatic representatives in [[Bangui]], and the C.A.R. maintains approximately the same number of missions abroad. Since early 1989 the government recognizes both [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian state]]. The C.A.R. also maintains diplomatic relations with the [[People's Republic of China]]. The C.A.R. generally joins other African and developing country states in consensus positions on major policy issues.

The '''Republic of Chad''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: تشاد , ''Tašād''; [[French language|French]]: ''Tchad'') is a [[landlocked]] country in [[central Africa]]. It borders [[Libya]] to the north, [[Sudan]] to the east, the [[Central African Republic]] to the south, [[Cameroon]] and [[Nigeria]] to the southwest and [[Niger]] to the west. Due to its distance from the sea and its largely [[desert]] climate, the country is sometimes referred to as the 'dead heart of Africa.' In the north, it contains the [[Tibesti Mountains]], the largest mountain chain in the [[Sahara desert]]. Formerly part of the [[Federation of French Equatorial Africa]], the country shares a relationship with [[Lake Chad]].

==History==
{{main|History of Chad}}

[[Image:Map of Aouzou stip chad.PNG|thumb|left|Libya claimed and occupied the [[Aozou Strip]] (blue) from 1976 to 1987]] The area that today is Chad was once inhabited by a group of politically disconnected tribes. Humanoid skulls and cave paintings of great antiquity have been found there. Gradually relatively weak local kingdoms developed; these were later overtaken by the larger but still completely African [[Kanem-Bornu Empire]].

Later, foreigners came to have more influence in Chad. Beginning in the [[Middle Ages]], Chad became a crossroads for Muslim traders and indigenous tribes. In [[1891]] Chad became a part of [[French colony|France's colonial system]]. 

In [[World War II|WWII]], Chad was the first [[France|French]] colony to join the Free French and the Allies, under the leadership of its Governor, [[Félix Éboué]]. In [[1960]], Chad became an independent country, with [[François (Ngarta) Tombalbaye|François Tombalbaye]] as its first president.

Chad's post-independence history has been marked by instability and violence stemming mostly from tensions between the mainly Arab-Muslim north and the predominantly Christian and animist south.

In 1969 Muslim dissatisfaction with President Tombalbaye - a Christian southerner - developed into a guerrilla war. This, combined with a severe drought, undermined his rule and, in 1975, President Tombalbaye was killed in a coup led by another southerner, [[Félix Malloum]]. Mr Malloum, too, failed to end the war, and in 1979 he was replaced by a Libyan-backed northerner, [[Goukouni Oueddei]].  

By this stage [[France]] and neighbouring [[Libya]] were intervening repeatedly  to support one side against another. The leader of the French-supported Northern rebel group [[FAN]] Forces Armées du Nord, [[Hissène Habré]], a former defence minister, became prime minister in [[1978]]. In [[1982]] he deposed President Oueddei, and assumed overall control of the state, abolishing the post of prime minister. His eight year reign led to immense political turmoil, with human rights organisations accusing him of having ordered the execution of thousands of political opponents and members of tribes thought hostile to his regime.

[[Libya]] invaded Chad in July [[1975]], theoretically to drive Habré from power. They occupied a narrow strip of land known as the [[Aouzou Strip]].
France and the United States responded by aiding Habré in an attempt to contain Libya's regional ambitions under [[Muammar al-Qaddafi]]. Civil war deepened. In December, [[1980]] Libya occupied all of northern Chad, but Habré defeated Libyan troops and drove them out in November, [[1981]]. In [[1983]], Qaddafi's troops occupied all of the country north of Koro Toro. The United States used a clandestine base in Chad to train captured Libyan soldiers, whom it tried to organize into an anti-Qaddafi force. Habré's aid from the USA and France helped him to win the war against Libya. The Libyan occupation of the north of Koro Toro ended when Habré defeated Qaddafi in [[1987]].

Despite this victory, Habré's government was weak and seemingly disliked by a majority of Chadians. He was deposed by Libyan-supported rebel leader [[Idriss Déby]] on [[December 1]], [[1990]]. Habré went into exile in Senegal. Déby installed himself as dictator. Soon after a constitution was written. Popular support for Déby was apparently shown in an election in May, [[2001]], where he defeated six other candidates with 67.3% of the vote. The election was described as being &quot;reasonably fair&quot;, although there were some noted irregularities.

In [[1998]] an armed insurgency began in the north, led by President Déby's former defence chief, [[Youssouf Togoimi]]. A Libyan-brokered peace deal in [[2002]] failed to put an end to the fighting.

In [[2003]] and [[2004]], unrest in neighbouring [[Sudan]]'s [[Darfur]] region spilled across the border, along with many thousands of refugees.  

On [[December 23]], [[2005]], Chad announced that it was in a [[Chad-Sudan conflict|&quot;state of war&quot; with Sudan]].[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4556576.stm]  [[The Organisation of the Islamic Conference]](OIC) has urged Sudan and Chad to al pension system encourage domestic investment, contributing to an estimated total domestic savings rate of approximately 22% of GDP in [[2000]].

Unemployment peaked well above Chile's traditional 4%-6% range during the recession and is stubbornly remaining in the 8%-10% range well into the economic recovery. Despite recent labour troubles, wages have on average risen faster than inflation over the last several years as a result of higher productivity, boosting national living standards. The share of Chileans with incomes below the [[poverty line]]--roughly $4,000/year for a family of four--fell from 46% of the population in 1987 to 18% in 2003.

Maintaining a moderate [[inflation]] level is a foremost Central Bank objective. In 1996, December-to-December inflation stood at 8.2%, falling to 6.1% in 1997 and to 4.7% in 1998. The rate fell to only 2.3% during the 1999 recession. Most wage settlements and spending decisions are indexed, reducing inflation volatility (See [[Unidad de Fomento]]). The rate for 2000 was 4.75%. The establishment of a compulsory [[private sector]] pension system in [[1981]] was an important step toward increasing domestic savings and the pool of investment capital. Under this system, most regular workers pay 10% of their salaries into privately managed funds. This large capital pool has been supplemented by substantial foreign investment.

Total public and private investment in the Chilean economy has remained high despite current economic difficulties. The government recognizes the necessity of private investment to boost worker productivity. The government also is encouraging diversification, including such non-traditional exports as fruit, wine, and fish to reduce the relative importance of basic traditional exports such as copper, timber, and other natural resources.

Chile's welcoming attitude toward [[foreign direct investment]] is codified in the country's Foreign Investment Law, which gives foreign investors the same treatment as Chileans. Registration is simple and transparent, and foreign investors are guaranteed access to the official foreign exchange market to repatriate their profits and capital. The Central Bank decided in May 1999 on the removal of the 1-year residency requirement on foreign capital entering Chile under Central Bank regulations, generally for portfolio investments. A modest capital control mechanism known as the &quot;Encaje,&quot; which requires international investors to place a percentage of portfolio investment in non-interest-bearing accounts for up to 2 years, has been effectively suspended through reduction to zero of the applicable percentage; the mechanism could be resurrected depending on economic circumstances.

Total foreign direct investment flows in 2000 contracted to $3.6 [[billion]] (3.6 G$), down from $9.2 billion in 1999, and $4.6 billion in 1998. The 2000 figure is about 13% of GDP. In 2000, Chile experienced an outflow of $1.4 billion, largely the result of diminished inward foreign investment and--for a second year running--elevated levels of Chilean direct investment abroad ($4.8 billion).

==Foreign Trade==

Chile's economy is highly dependent on international trade. In [[1999]], exports increased to $18.3 billion from $15.6 billion in 1999, and imports increased to $16.9 billion from $14 billion the previous year. Exports accounted for about 25% of GDP. Chile has traditionally been dependent upon copper exports; the state-owned firm [[CODELCO]] is the world's second-largest copper-producing company. Foreign private investment has developed many new mines, and the private sector now produces more copper than [[CODELCO]]. Copper output continued to increase in 2000. Non-traditional exports have grown faster than those of copper and other minerals. In [[1975]], non-mineral exports made up just over 30% of total exports, whereas now they account for about 60%. The most important non-mineral exports are forestry and wood products, fresh fruit and processed food, fishmeal and [[seafood]], and other manufactured products.

Chile's export markets are fairly balanced among [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Latin America]], and [[North America]]. The [[United States|U.S.]], the largest-single market, takes in 17% of Chile's exports. Latin America has been the fastest-growing export market in recent years. The government actively seeks to promote Chile's exports globally. Since 1991, Chile has signed several bilateral free trade agreements, including [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], [[South Korea]], [[United States|USA]],the [[People's Republic of China]], the [[Central American Common Market|CACM]] nations ([[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Guatemala]], [[Nicaragua]]), the [[EFTA]] and the [[European Union]] and has recently entered into the [[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership]] which is a multilateral free trade agreement with [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]] and [[Brunei]]. This means that Chile has free-trade access to over half of the world's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. Chile intends to negotiate further agreements with countries such as [[India]] and [[Japan]]. Also, Chile is member (in different degrees) of many international economical instances, like [[APEC]], [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], [[Mercosur]]. Such diversity of relations prevents the Chilean economy from being exclusively dependent of any major partner and thus provides stability.

After growing for several years, imports were down in 1998 and 1999, reflecting reduced consumer demand and deferred investment. Imports have rebounded in 2000 and are up 19% over 1999; capital goods make up about 22% of total imports. The United States is Chile's largest-single supplier, supplying 18.5% of the country's imports in 2000, down from 21% in 1999. Chile unilaterally is lowering its across-the-board import tariff--for all countries with which it does not have a trade agreement--by a percentage point each year until it reaches 6% in 2003. Higher effective tariffs are charged only on imports of wheat, wheat flour, vegetable oils, and sugar as a result of a system of import price bands.

==Finance==

Chile's financial sector has grown faster than other areas of the economy over the last few years; a banking law reform approved in 1997 broadened the scope of permissible foreign activity for Chilean banks. Domestically, Chileans have enjoyed the recent introduction of new financial tools such as home equity loans, currency futures and options, factoring, leasing, and debit cards.

The introduction of these new products has been accompanied by increased use of traditional instruments such as loans and credit cards. Chile's private pension system, with assets worth roughly $36 billion at the end of September 2000, has provided an important source of investment capital for the stock market. Chile has maintained one of the best credit ratings in Latin America despite the 1999 economic slump. In recent years, many Chilean companies have sought to raise capital abroad due to the relatively lower interest rates outside of Chile. There are three main ways Chilean firms raise funds abroad: bank loans, issuance of bonds, and the selling of stock on U.S. markets through [[American Depository Receipt]]s (ADRs). Nearly all of the funds raised go to finance investment. The government is rapidly paying down its foreign debt. The combined public and private foreign debt was roughly 50% of GDP at the end of 2000, low by Latin American standards.

'''Army.''' The Commander-in-Chief is Gen. Juan Emilio Cheyre. The 50,000-person army is organized into six divisions and an air brigade.

'''Navy.''' Adm. Rodolfo Codina Díaz directs the 25,000-person navy, including 5,200 marines. Of the fleet of 66 surface vessels, only six are major combatant ships and they are based in [[Valparaíso]]. The navy operates its own aircraft for transport and patrol; there are no fighter or bomber aircraft. The Navy also operates two submarines based in [[Talcahuano]].

The navy is to receive three second-hand, but modern, [[Royal Navy|British]] [[Type 23 frigate|Type 23]] [[frigate|frigates]] in 2008.

'''Air Force.''' Gen. Osvaldo Sarabia Vilches heads a force of 12,500. Air assets are distributed among five air brigades headquartered in [[Iquique]], [[Antofagasta]], [[Santiago,_Chile|Santiago]], [[Puerto Montt]], and [[Punta Arenas]]. The Air Force also operates an airbase on [[King George Island]], [[Antarctica]].

The Chilean police are comprised of a national, uniformed force (Carabineros) and a smaller, plainclothes investigations force. After the military [[coup]] in September [[1973]], the Chilean national police were incorporated into the Defense Ministry. With the return of democratic government, the police were placed under the operational control of the Interior Ministry but remain under the nominal control of the Defense Ministry. Gen. Alberto Cienfuegos, who directs the national police force of 30,000, is responsible for law enforcement, traffic management, narcotics suppression, border control, and counter-terrorism throughout Chile.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Chile}}
Since its return to democracy in [[1990]], Chile has been an active participant in the international political arena. Chile assumed a 2-year non-permanent position on the [[UN Security Council]] in January [[2003]] and is an active member of the UN family of agencies, serving as a member of the [[Commission on Human Rights]] and participating in UN peacekeeping activities. Chile hosted the second [[Summit of the Americas]] in [[1998]], was the chair of the [[Rio Group]] in [[2001]], hosted the [[Defense Ministerial of the Americas]] in [[2002]], and the [[APEC]] summit and related meetings in [[2004]]. In [[2005]] hosted the [[Community of Democracies]] ministerial conference. An associate member of [[Mercosur]] and a full member of APEC, Chile and has been an important actor on international economic issues and hemispheric free trade.

The Chilean Government has diplomatic relations with most countries. It settled its territorial disputes with [[Argentina]] during the [[1990s]], although the border between both countries in the Southern Ice Field is still officially undefined. 

Chile and [[Bolivia]] have severed and resumed diplomatic relations various times throughout history. Most recently, Generals [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]] and [[Hugo Banzer|Banzer]] resumed diplomatic relatins and attempted to settle territorial disputes. They met in the small, border town of Charaña and Pinochet agrreed to give Bolvia a small strip of land between the Chilean city of [[Arica]] and the Peruvian border. However, treaties between Peru and Chile specified that Chile must consult Peru before granting any land to a third party in the area of [[Tarapaca Region|Tarapacá]]. Peru's leftist ruler, [[Juan Velasco Alvarado|General Juan Velasco]], was, however, and ideological enemy of the rightists Pinochet and Banzer. Additionally the man who Pinochet deposed, [[Salvador Allende]], had been a close friend of Velasco. Therefore, Peru did not accept the Charaña proposal and instead drafted its own proposal, in which numerous land and sea areas would be shared between the three nations. Pinochet did not agree, and ties with Bolivia were once again severed on [[1978]]. The two countries maintain consular relations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Himno Nacional de Chile''' is the [[National Anthem]] of [[Chile]]. It is also known as ''Canción Nacional'' (National Song). It has a history of two lyrics and two melodies that made up three different versions. It was composed by [[Eusebio Lillo]] and [[Ramón Carnicer]] and has six parts plus the chorus.

==First National Anthem==

The first Chilean National Anthem dates back to 1819, when the government called for, on the 19th of July, the creation of music and lyrics for this purpose.

The composer Manuel Robles and the poet Bernardo de Vera y Pintado fulfilled this mandate and their &quot;National Song&quot; debuted on the 20th of August, 1820 in the Domingo Arteaga theater, although other historians claim that it was played and sung during the festivities of September 1819.

In the beginning, everyone would stand for the song. O'Higgins and Freire listened to it with respect and full of emotion, for they had marched to victory to its tune more than once.

The custom of always singing it at the theater slowly disappeared, until it was ordered that it only be sung at the aniversary of the country.

The doctor Bernardo Vera, known in the history of the independence, was the author of the verses that were sung to Robles' music.

This first hymn was sung until 1828, when it was replaced with what is sung today.

==Second National Anthem==

The second Chilean National Anthem was composed by the Spanish composer Ramón Carnicer, when he was exiled in England because of his liberal ideas. Mariano Egaña, Chilean Minister in London, acting on the criticism that Robles' song was receiving, asked Carnicer to compose a new hymn with Bernardo de Vera's original text.

The Spanish musician probably wrote the work by 1827, the date he returned to Barcelona, and his hymn debuted in Santiago, in the Arteaga theater, the 23rd of December 1828.

Years later, in 1847, the Chilean government entrusted the young poet Eusebio Lillo with a new text that would replace the anti-Spain poem of Vera y Pintado, and after being analyzed by Andrés Bello, retained the original chorus (&quot;Dulce patria, recibe los votos...).

During the dictatorial military government (1973-1990) of Augusto Pinochet, the Verse III was officialy incorporated because of his praise of the militaries. Once again in democracy, it was eliminated from the anthem and only sung in military events as part of the full song. Supporters from the former  from the U.S. Tourism also is booming, with the number of visitors up from 780,000 in 1996 to more than 1 million in 1999. Tourism now earns more foreign exchange than bananas and coffee combined.

The country has not discovered sources of fossil fuels--apart from minor [[coal]] deposits-- but its mountainous terrain and abundant rainfall have permitted the construction of a dozen [[hydroelectric power]] plants, making it self-sufficient in all energy needs, except oil for transportation. Costa Rica exports electricity to Central America and has the potential to become a major electricity exporter if plans for new generating plants and a regional distribution grid are realized. Mild climate and trade winds make neither heating nor cooling necessary, particularly in the highland cities and towns where some 90% of the population lives.

==Infrastructure==
Costa Rica's infrastructure has suffered from a lack of maintenance and new investment. The country has an extensive road system of more than 30,000 kilometers, although much of it is in disrepair. Most parts of the country are accessible by road. The main highland cities in the country's Central Valley are connected by paved all-weather roads with the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and by the [[Pan American Highway]] with Nicaragua and Panama, the neighboring countries to the North and the South. Costa Rica's ports are struggling to keep pace with growing trade. They have insufficient capacity, and their equipment is in poor condition. The railroad didn't function for several years, until recent government effort to reactivate it for city transportation.

The government hopes to bring foreign investment, technology, and management into the telecommunications and electrical power sectors, which are monopolies of the state. However, political opposition to opening these sectors to private participation has stalled the government's efforts. The poor state of public finances will continue to limit the state's ability to try to modernize these sectors in the absence of a political consensus to permit private investment. Failure to act soon on telecommunications could prove an obstacle to the government's desire to attract more world-class foreign investment.

The budget previously dedicated to the military now is dedicated to security, education and culture; the country maintains armed National Guard forces.
The museum ''Museo Nacional de Costa Rica'' was placed in the ''Cuartel Bellavista'' as a symbol of commitment to culture.

In [[1986]], [[List of Presidents of Costa Rica|president]] [[Oscar Arias Sánchez]] declared [[December 1]] as the ''Día de la Abolición del Ejército'' (Military abolition day) with law #8115.

Unlike its neighbours, Costa Rica has not endured a civil war since.

[[Costa Rica]] is an active member of the international community and, in [[1993]], claimed it was for [[neutral country|neutrality]].  Due to certain powerful constituencies favoring its methods, it has a weight in world affairs far beyond its size. The country lobbied aggressively for the establishment of the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] and became the first nation to recognize the jurisdiction of the [[Inter-American Human Rights Court]], based in San Jose.

Then-President [[Oscar Arias]] authored a regional plan in [[1987]] that served as the basis for the [[Esquipulas Peace Agreement]] and Arias was awarded the 1987 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his work.  Arias also promoted change in the USSR-backed Nicaraguan government of the era. Costa Rica also hosted several rounds of negotiations between the [[El Salvador|Salvadoran Government]] and the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front]] (FMLN), aiding El Salvador's efforts to emerge from civil war and culminating in that country's [[1994]] free and fair elections. Costa Rica has been a strong proponent of regional arms-limitation agreements. Former President Miguel Ángel Rodríguez recently proposed the abolition of all [[Central America|Central American]] militaries and the creation of a regional counternarcotics police force in their stead.

With the establishment of democratically-elected governments in all Central American nations by the [[1990s]], Costa Rica turned its focus from regional conflicts to the pursuit of neoliberal policies on the isthmus. The influence of these policies, along with the US invasion of Panama, was instrumental in drawing [[Panama]] into the Central American model of [[neoliberalism]].  Costa Rica also participated in the multinational [[Partnership for Democracy and Development in Central America]].

Regional political integration has not proven attractive to Costa Rica. The country debated its role in the Central American integration process under former President Calderon. Costa Rica has sought concrete economic ties with its Central American neighbors rather than the establishment of regional political institutions, and it chose not to join the [[Central American Parliament]]. President Figueres promoted a higher profile for Costa Rica in regional and international fora. Costa Rica gained election as President of the Group of 77 in the [[United Nations]] in 1995. That term ended in 1997 with the South-South Conference held in San Jose. Costa Rica occupied a nonpermanent seat in the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] from [[1997]] to [[1999]] and exercised a leadership role in confronting crises in the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]], as well as in the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. It is currently a member of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].

Costa Rica broke relations with [[Cuba]] in 1961 to protest Cuban support of the left in Central America and has not renewed formal diplomatic ties with the Castro regime. In 1995, Costa Rica established a [[consular office]] in [[Havana]]. Cuba opened a consular office in Costa Rica in [[2001]].

Costa Rica strongly backed efforts by the United States to implement [[UN Security Council Resolution 940]], which led to the restoration of the democratically elected Government of [[Haiti]] in [[October]] [[1994]]. Costa Rica was among the first to call for a postponement of the [[May 22]] elections in [[Peru]] when international observer missions found electoral machinery not prepared for the vote count.

Costa Rica maintains official relations with the [[Republic of China]] (commonly known as &quot;Taiwan&quot;) instead of the [[People's Republic of China]]. Strong economic ties exist between the two countries with projects having included the recent construction of a suspension bridge with Taiwanese capital to join the Costa Rican mainland with the Nicoya Peninsula. The bridge has been a boon for the tourist industry in the peninsula by reducing travel time to some locations by as much as two hours.

{{linguistics}}

'''Computational linguistics''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] field dealing with the statistical and [[logic]]al modeling of [[natural language]] from a computational perspective. This modeling is not limited to any particular field of [[linguistics]]. Computational linguists were formerly usually [[computer scientist]]s who had specialized in the application of computers to the processing of a [[natural language]]. Recent research has shown that language is much more complex than previously thought, so computational linguistics work teams are now sometimes interdisciplinary, including linguists (specifically trained in linguistics). Computational linguistics draws upon the involvement of linguists, [[computer science|computer scientists]], experts in [[artificial intelligence]], [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologists]] and [[logic|logicians]], amongst others.

==Origins==
Computational linguistics as a field predates artificial intelligence, a field under which it is often grouped. Computational linguistics originated with efforts in the [[United States]] in the 1950s to have computers automatically translate texts in foreign languages into English, particularly [[Russian language|Russian]] scientific journals. Since computers had proven their ability to do complex [[mathematics]] much faster and more accurately than humans, it was thought to be only a short matter of time before the technical details could be taken care of that would allow them the same remarkable capacity to process language. 

When [[machine translation]] (a.k.a. mechanical translation) failed to immediately yield accurate translations, the problem was recognized as far more complex than had originally been assumed. Computational linguistics was born as the name of the new field of study devoted to developing [[algorithm]]s and [[software]] for intelligently processing language data. When artificial intelligence came into existence in the 1960s, the field of computational linguistics became that sub-division of artificial intelligence dealing with human-level comprehension and production of natural languages.

In order to translate one language into another, it was observed that one had to understand the [[syntax]] of both languages, and at least at the level of [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the syntax of words) and whole sentences. In order to understand syntax, one had to also understand the [[semantics]] of the vocabulary, and even to understand something of the [[pragmatics]] of how the language was being used. Thus, what started as an effort to translate between languages evolved into an entire discipline devoted to understanding how to represent and process individual natural languages using computers.

==Subfields==
Computational linguistics can be divided into major areas depending upon the medium of the language being processed, whether spoken or textual; and upon the task being performed, whether analyzing language (parsing) or creating language (generation).

[[Speech recognition]] and [[speech synthesis]] deal with how spoken language can be understood or created using computers. Parsing and generation are sub-divisions of computational linguistics dealing respectively with taking language apart and putting it together. Machine translation remains the sub-division of computational linguistics dealing with having computers translate between languages.

Some of the areas of research that are studied by computational linguistics include:

*Computer aided [[corpus linguistics]]
*Design of parsers for [[natural language]]s
*Design of taggers like POS-taggers (part-of-speech taggers)

'''Cardiac arrhythmia''' is a group of conditions in which the [[muscle contraction]] of the heart is irregular or is faster or slower than normal. '''Cardiac dysrhythmia''' is technically more correct, as arrhythmia would imply that there is &quot;no rhythm,&quot; but this term is not used frequently.

Some arrhythmias are life-threatening [[medical emergencies]] that can cause cardiac arrest and sudden death.  Others cause aggravating symptoms, such as an awareness of a different heart beat, or [[palpitation]],which can be annoying.  Some are quite benign and normal.  Sinus arrhythmia is the mild acceleration followed by slowing of the normal rhythm that occurs with breathing.  In adults the normal heart rate ranges from 60 beats per minute to 100 beats per minute.  The normal heart beat is controlled by a small area in the upper chamber of the heart called the sinus node.  The sinus node contains specialized cells that have spontaneous electrical activity that starts each normal heart beat.

== Frequency too high/low ==
A heart rate faster than 100 beats/minute is considered a [[tachycardia]].  With exercise the sinus node increases its rate of electrical activity to accelerate the heart rate.  The normal fast rate that develops is called sinus tachycardia.  Arrhythmias that are due to fast, abnormal electrical activity can cause tachycardias that are dangerous.  If the [[left ventricle|ventricles]] of the heart experiences one of these tachycardias for a long period of time, there can be [[deleterious]] effects.  Individuals may sense a tachycardia as a pounding sensation of the heart, known as [[palpitations]].  If a tachycardia lowers blood pressure it may cause lightheadedness or dizzinesses, or even fainting ([[syncope]]).  If the tachycardia is so fast that the heart can not function, it leads to death, which may occur suddenly.

Most tachycardias are not dangerous.  Anything that increases adrenaline or its effects on the heart will increase the heart rate and potentially cause palpitations or tachycardias.  Causes include stress, ingested or injected substances (ie: [[caffeine]], [[ethanol|alcohol]] (see [[Holiday heart syndrome]]), and an overactive thyroid gland [[hyperthyroidism]].  Individuals who have a tachycardia are often advised to limit or remove exposure to any causative agent.

A slow rhythm, known as [[bradycardia]] (less than 60 beats/min), is usually not life threatening, but may cause symptoms.  When it causes symptoms implantation of a permanent pacemaker may be needed.

Either dysrhythmia requires medical attention to evaluate the risks associated with the arrhythmia.

== Fibrillation ==
A serious variety of arrhythmia is known as [[fibrillation]]. Fibrillation occurs when the [[heart]] [[muscle]] begins a quivering motion instead of a normal, healthy pumping rhythm. Fibrillatidered highly controversial, and the U.S. embargo was condemned for the 13th time in 2004 by the [[General Assembly]] of the [[United Nations]], by 179 countries (out of 183 voting). The main current trading partners of Cuba are: [[Venezuela]], [[China]], [[Spain]], [[Canada]] and, the [[Netherlands]].

Cuba owes approximately $5.4 billion in foreign debt to [[Paris Club]] nations such as France, Japan and Germany.  Cuba also has other sources of debt including approximately $25 billion in debt disputed with Russia dating from the era of the Soviet Union. [http://www.mosnews.com/money/2005/09/15/cubadebt.shtml] The lack of domestic sources of capital financing, an inherent by-product of its socialist economic system, makes Cuba's debt extremely vulnerable to disruptions in trade.

Although U.S. citizens are not officially banned from travelling to Cuba, they are generally prohibited from spending money there (exceptions are made for students studying in Cuba, diplomats, certain business people, and people with family members in Cuba), which amounts to a ''[[de facto]]'' travel ban, as Cuba requires that foreign visitors spend a minimum of three nights in a hotel; moreover, the only direct flights from the United States are strictly for those with family members in Cuba, or others with licences from OFAC. Nevertheless, U.S. citizens can visit Cuba by travelling through other countries (like [[Mexico]], [[Canada]] or the [[Bahamas]]) because Cuban immigration does not stamp the passports (the visum is a separate leaflet). However, U.S. citizens are liable to fines and imprisonment if discovered and prosecuted by the U.S. government.  Several Americans have been caught by US pre-clearance agents getting off flights in [[Toronto]] and [[Nassau]], so Cuban travel agents advise Americans to avoid these routes.

Although struggling with its economy since the fall of the Soviet Union, Cuba has seen substantial improvements since the early 1990s. The economy has been helped in recent years by strong tourism, international investment in nickel production and oil exploration as well as beneficial oil purchases from Venezuela, in exchange for medical services.

A major problem is damage from [[hurricanes]]. All [[Caribbean]] islands suffer from hurricanes and the Cuban government uses this as an argument to urge the islands to cooperate, promoting an agreement of mutual self-insurance, so that if one island gets hit, the other islands will help it out. He says that if the United States get hit, the economy of the rest of the country will take the blow, but if a Caribbean island gets hit, that may devastate the entire economy.

Over 7,300 homes have been completed in 2005; thus it is expected (estimating five people per residence) that in about three hundred years all housing will be replaced.  Plans to repair the  majority of homes partially affected by [[Hurricane Dennis]] and others [http://www.caribbean-on-line.com/hurricanes/] are said underway. The Cuban government predicts that no less than 10,000 of the homes destroyed will be built again as new and the plans to finish and construct new homes to cover the most urgent requirements will continue, up to at least 30,000 additional housing.

Cuba is notable for its national [[organic farming|organic agriculture]] initiative. However, it is wise to keep in mind that  Cuban government is said by some to be less than open about agricultural abuses [http://www.cubanet.org/opi/03020401.htm].  In the early 1990s, post-Soviet Union, Cuba lost over 70% of agricultural chemical imports, over 50% of food imports, and an equally significant amount of oil. Its agricultural sector, built on a large-scale, mechanized, chemical-based model, was instantly crippled. By restructuring its agricultural industry, and focusing scientific efforts on organic solutions, Cuba managed to rapidly and successfully convert the country to entirely organic production. Currently, only organic agriculture is permitted by law, which while having the effect of reducing the need for imports, has also led to lower yields. Combined with the removal of marginal land from sugar farming, this led to a reduction in total sugar production of over 70% from around 7 millions tons anually in the late 1980s to around 3 million tons annually in the late 1990s [http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/cb/cuba/asce/cuba5/FILE30.PDF] [http://www.fas.usda.gov/htp/highlights/2001/IATR/cubaiatr.pdf]; to 1.6 million tons in 2004 [http://hotdocs.usitc.gov/docs/pubs/701_731/pub3793.PDF]. Today, Cuba is a leading nation in [[biotechnology]], and Cuban expertise is exported to Iran [http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2005/enero/lun17/04iran.html]; however some claim that this relates to biowar potential [http://www.netforcuba.org/Columnists/Cereijo/001en-CubaandTerrorism.htm]. More than 100 million USD are currently being invested in the pharmaceutical industry.

On a total population of 11 million, Cuba has 250,000 educators, 67,500 medical doctors, and 34,000 physical education and sports professionals and technicians.[http://www.embacubalebanon.com/discurso05apr2001e.html]

==Infrastructure==
[[Image:Camello.JPG|thumb|275px|right|A ''Camello'' (camel) bus.  Public transportation costs 20 centavos [[Cuban Peso|CUC]] per ride.]]
Cuban infrastructure is significant and includes: massive Spanish fortifications built in principal ports [http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;id_site=204] (e.g. [[El Morro]] [http://www.regiments.org/special/essays/cuba/1762/morro.htm] castles in Havana (1589) and Santiago; [[Castillo San Salvador de la Punta]] [http://travel.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-2769840-castillo_san_salvador_de_la_punta_havana-i];  (finished by 1630); [[La Fuerza]][http://www.oldhavanaweb.com/fortresses/castillo_de_la_real_fuerza_castle_of_the_royal_force.html] (finished 1577); San Carlos de [[La Cabaña]] the largest in the Americas; [[El Principe]] [http://www.geocities.com/naforts/atlantic.html]; [[Atares]] [http://www.geocities.com/naforts/atlantic.html#cuba] around Havana Bay) [http://www.carilat.de/havannacoast.htm]. Railroads were first built in the late colonial period and finished in the first part of the 20th Century. Vital sanitation facilities were constructed in the US period. The Presidential Palace [http://www.abellaweb.com/books/tga/book-frameset.html] was built between 1913 and 1919 under presidents Gómez y de Menocal, and designed by a group that included architect Rodolfo Maruri. The central highway was constructed during the [[Gerardo Machado]] administration. There are tunnels in Havana under the bay and under the Almendares River, and some highways in the old Oriente Province, Via Azul and Via Mulata, and Havana-Matanzas Via Blanca were completed in the second [[Fulgencio Batista]] period. A complex network of massive dams [http://webcutc.org/documentos/notinoticias14.htm] and  complex semi-secret underground fortifications [http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y96/sep96/9eco2.html] were built in the present [[Fidel Castro]] period. In addition there are significant numbers of historic buildings and reinforced concrete high rises built in the Republican period.  Statues and other monuments dot the Island. Each construction has its own particular story that often relate to important events in the history of the island.  For instance some of the cobblestones that surround the Havana docks were brought in from Sweden, on the return trips of ships smuggling sugar into Britain during WWI.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Pre-Columbian Cuba==
The archeological record and evidence from [[mitochondrial DNA]] studies indicate that Cuba and the [[Antilles]] have been inhabited by peoples ancestral to the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] inhabitants for at least several thousand years. Some studies ascribe a role to tagain in 1999 with a 6.2% increase in GDP, due to the continued growth of tourism. Central control is complicated by the existence of the [[informal economy]]. Growth in recent years has picked up significantly, with a growth in GDP of 11.8 % in 2005 alone. Cuba is currently undergoing an &quot;Energy Revolution&quot;, with increased emphasis on efficient use of electrical energy and the innovative use of more efficient small-power generators linked in a synchronized network. There is talk of increasing the implementation of solar- and wind-powered generators.

Cuba's precarious economic position is complicated by the high price it must pay for [[foreign financing]]. The Cuban Government defaulted on most of its [[international debt]] in [[1986]], which means Havana must rely heavily on [[short-term loans]] to finance imports, chiefly food and fuel.  

[[image:cuba_casa_particular.jpg|thumb|300px|View from a 'casa particular'; a Cuban homestay type of lodging &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Photograph by Dirk van der Made]]

==Tourism==

In the mid 1990s tourism surpassed [[sugar]], long the mainstay of the Cuban economy, as the primary source of foreign exchange. Tourism figures prominently in the Cuban Government's plans for development, and a top official cast it as the &quot;heart of the economy&quot;. Havana devotes significant resources to building new tourist facilities and renovating historic structures for use in the tourism sector. Cuban officials estimate roughly 1.6 million tourists visited Cuba in 1999 with about $1.9 [[billion]] in gross revenues. The official projections for [[2000]] are only slightly higher than in 1999. Independent analysts and journalists partially attributed low numbers in January to Y2K concerns.

==Agriculture==

Sugar remains an important part of the Cuban economy with large amounts of [[land (economics)|land]], labour, and other resources dedicated to the industry. Sugar production in 1989 was over 8 million tons, but fell to about 3.5 million tons in the 1994-95 harvest, one of the lowest on record. With increased [[fertilizer]]s and management attention, subsequent harvests have improved but remain well below the 1989 level. Prospects for regaining that level of output are poor unless the Cuban Government undertakes substantial reform of the sugar industry, something it has been reluctant to do, since it has become government policy to substantially and deliberately phase out the sugar industry.

More recently Cuba's world-class biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry is gaining in its importance to the economy. It has been claimed that soon it will become Cuba's main source of foreign exchange.  Among the products sold internationally are vaccines against various viral and bacterial pathogens, and promising anti-cancer vaccines are undergoing exhaustive clinical trials. Some Cuban scientists, like V. Verez-Bencomo, have been awarded international prizes for their contributions in biotechnology.  Cuban vaccines are sold, among other countries,in Russia, China, India, Pakistan, and several Latin American countries. 

== Foreign Investment ==

To help keep the economy afloat, Havana actively courts foreign investment, which often takes the form of joint ventures with the Cuban Government holding half of the equity, management contracts for tourism facilities, or financing for the sugar harvest. Cuban officials said in early [[1998]] that there were a total of 332 [[joint venture]]s.  Many of these are loans or contracts for management, supplies, or services normally not considered equity investment in Western economies.  Investors are constrained by the U.S.-Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act which provides sanctions for those who &quot;traffic&quot; in property expropriated from U.S. citizens.  As of March 1998, 15 executives of three foreign companies have been excluded from entry into the United States.  Over a dozen companies have pulled out of Cuba or altered their plans to invest there due to the threat of action under the Libertad Act.

'''US Dollar'''

In [[1993]] the Cuban Government made it legal for its people to possess and use the U.S. dollar, nicknamed ''fula''.  From then until [[2004]], the dollar became a major currency in use.  To capture the hard currency flowing into the island through tourism and [[remittances]] - estimated at $500-800 million annually - the government set up state-run &quot;dollar stores&quot; throughout Cuba that sold 'luxury' food, household, and clothing items, compared with basic necessities, which were bought using the [[Cuban peso]].  As such, a gap in the standard of living developed between those with access to dollars and those without.  Jobs that could earn dollar salaries or tips from foreign businesses and tourists became highly desirable.  It was common to meet [[physician|doctors]], [[engineer]]s, [[scientist]]s, and other [[professional]]s working in [[restaurant]]s or as [[taxi driver]]s.

However, in response to stricter [[U.S. embargo against Cuba|economic sanctions by the US]], and because the authorities were pleased with Cuba's economic recovery, the Cuban government decided in [[October]] [[2004]] to remove the American dollar from circulation.  In its place, the [[Cuban convertible peso]] is now used, which although not internationally traded, has a value pegged to that of the dollar.  A 10% surcharge is levied for conversions from US dollars to the convertible peso, to discourage the entry of dollars into the country; this surcharge does not apply to other currencies, so it acts as an encouragement to tourists to bring currencies like [[Euro]]s, [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]] or [[Canadian dollar]]s into Cuba.  Indeed, an increasing number of areas rich in tourism now also accept Euros directly for many transactions.

==Self-Employment==

To provide jobs for workers laid off due to the economic crisis, furnish services the government was having difficulty providing, and to try to bring some forms of black market activity into legal - and therefore controllable - channels, Havana in 1993 legalized self-employment for some 150 occupations. The government tightly controls the small private sector, which has fluctuated in size from 150,000 to 209,000, by regulating and taxing it. For example, owners of small private restaurants (''[[paladar]]es'') can seat no more than 12 people and can only employ family members to help with the work. Set monthly fees must be paid regardless of income earned and frequent inspections yield stiff fines when any of the many self-employment regulations are violated. Rather than expanding private sector opportunities, in recent years, the government has been attempting to squeeze more of these private sector entrepreneurs out of business and back to the public sector. Many have opted to enter the informal economy or black market. In recent years there has developed what is called &quot;urban agriculture,&quot; production which takes place on small parcels of land in the cities. Growing [[organopónicos]] (organic gardens) in the private sector has been attractive to city dwelling small producers who get to sell their products in the same place where they produce them, avoiding taxes and enjoying a measure of government help from the Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) in the form of seed houses and advisors.

==Connection with Venezuela==

The relationship cultivated between Cuba and [[Venezuela]] in recent years has resulted in agreements that Venezuela provide cheap oil in exchange for Cuban &quot;missions&quot; of doctors which aid and help to improve the Venezuelan health care system. Cuba, with the highest per capita number of physicians in the world, sends tens of thousands of doctors to other countries as aid, as well as for obtaining favorable economic terms of trade.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Cuba}}
[[Cuba]]'s once-ambitious foreign policy has been scaled back and redirected as a result of economic hardship and the end of the [[Cold War]]. However, with the support and funding by [[Hugo Chavez]] of [[Venezuela]], &quot;advancing the cause of  socialism&quot; in Latin America has regained vigor. Now this trend appears to include [[Evo Morales]], leader of [[coca]] growers,  recently elected president of [[Bolivia]]. 

Cuba aims to find new sources of trade, aid, and foreign investment, and to promote opposition to [[United States|U.S.]] policy, especially the [[trade embargo]] and the [[1996 Libertad Act]].  Cuba has relations with over 160 countries and has civilian assistance workers -- principally medical -- in more than 20 nations. This is commonly believed to be a significant source of income for the Castro government (e.g., exchanged for oil from Venezuela), and thus promoted officially even though occasionally some defect e.g., [http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20051026/CUBANS26/TPNational/Canada], [http://www.tillsonburgnews.com/story.php?id=192513].

==Cuban Intervention: 1959 - Early 1990s==
Aided by a massive buildup of Soviet advisors, military personnel, and advanced weaponry during the Cold War, Cuba became a staunch ally of the USSR during Castro's rule, modeling its political structure after that of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]]. Due to this huge amount of support, Cuba became a major sponsor of Marxist &quot;wars of national liberation&quot; not only in Latin America, but worldwide.

===Latin America===
Cuba's support extended to groups such as the [[Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity|URNG]] of [[Guatemala]], the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front|FMLN]] of [[El Salvador]], the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|FSLN]] of [[Nicaragua]], and [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]] and [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]] rebels in Colombia.

Cuba supported the Sandinista leadership of Nicaragua and the [[New Jewel Movement]] government of [[Grenada]]. Following the aforementioned countries' successful revolutions in 1979, [[Fidel Castro]] is known to have boasted, &quot;Now there are three of us.&quot; Guerrilla groups supported by Cuba became quite active in the '70s and '80s, particularly in [[Central America]], with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua perhaps becoming the most unstable countries as Cuba assisted Marxist rebel coalitions dissatisfied with their respective governments.

===Black Panthers===
In the '60s and '70s, Cuba openly supported the black nationalist and Marxist-oriented [[Black Panther Party]] of the U.S. Many members found their way into Cuba for political asylum, where Cuba welcomed them after they had been convicted of crimes in the U.S.

===Palestinians===
Cuba has also lent support to [[Palestinian]] [[nationalism|nationalist]] groups against [[Israel]]. Fidel Castro claims Israel practices &quot;[[Zionism|Zionist]] Fascism.&quot; Cuba has also lent support to the prominent [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) and the lesser-known [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) both received training from Cuba's General Intelligence Directorate, as well as financial and diplomatic support from the Cuban government.

===Irish Republicans===
The [[Irish Republican]] political party, [[Sinn Fein]] (linked to the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]) is also known to have close political links to the Cuban government. In the past [[Fidel Castro]] has expressed support for the Irish Republican cause of a [[United Ireland]].

===Africa===
In [[sub-Saharan Africa]] Cuba sent troops along with the Soviet Union to aid the [[Mozambican Liberation Front|FRELIMO]] and [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola|MPLA]] dictatorships in [[Mozambique]] and [[Angola]], respectively, while they were fighting U.S. and [[South Africa]]n-backed insurgent groups [[Mozambican National Resistance|RENAMO]] (supported by [[Rhodesia]] as well) and [[National Union for Total Independence of Angola|UNITA]]. He also aided the Communist regime of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] in [[Ethiopia]] during its conflict with [[Somalia]].

Fidel Castro has a good personal relationship with former [[South Africa]]n president [[Nelson Mandela]] that arises out of Cuba's support for Mandela's [[African National Congress]] organization in the '70s and '80s.

==Post-Cold War Foreign Relations==
In the post-Cold War environment, guerrilla warfare in Latin America has largely subsided, and the region has established democratic institutions, though countries such as Peru and Colombia were still undergoing internal wars against prolonged insurgencies, while several others also suffered from severe economic strife. Cuba continued to provide assistance, of a more political than an outright military or economic nature, to some of the region's revolutionary groups, but with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the establishment of peace in most of the developing [[Western Hemisphere]], Cuba is not the influential Latin American power it once was. 

While it is commonly said that Cuba no longer exerts a revolutionary influence on the region, in reality the situation is ambiguous at best [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_espionage_and_related_extraterritorial_activity_revised].  Cuba today works with a growing bloc of Latin American politicians opposed to the &quot;[[Washington consensus]],&quot; the American attitude that [[free trade]], open markets, and [[privatization]] will lift poor third world countries out of economic stagnation. Castro has condemned [[neoliberalism]] as a destructive force in the developing world.  Cuba has continued in its support of destabilization efforts notably with this alliance with the militarily powerful President [[Hugo Chávez]] of [[Venezuela]], and with its support of the President of the Bolivian Coca growers union of [[Evo Morales]].

Currently, Cuba has diplomatically friendly relationships with Presidents Hugo Chávez of [[Venezuela]], [[Lula da Silva]] of [[Brazil]], and [[Nestor Kirchner]] of [[Argentina]], with Chavez as perhaps his staunchest ally in the post-Soviet era. Cuba has sent thousands of teachers and medical personnel to Venezuela to assist Chavez's [[socialism|socialist]] and populist-oriented economic programs.  Chavez, in turn provides Cuba with lower priced petroleum.  Cuba's debt for oil to Venezuela is believed to be on the order of one billion US dollars [http://havanajournal.com/business_comments/A1221_0_4_0_M/].

==Cuban-American relations==

Because of Cuba's Marxist-Leninist government, the power of the [[Cuban-American lobby]], especially in [[Florida]], and Castro's almost 50 years of rigid one man rule plus his constant support of destabilization relations around the world, the relations between Cuba and the United States have long been very poor. Under President [[John F. Kennedy]], the [[CIA]] launched the failed [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] in an attempt to topple [[Fidel Castro]]. The CIA also embarked on a number of failed baroque assassination attempts.  As a result of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962 the United States promised to not invade Cuba, but continued to employ strict economic sanctions.

American diplomatic representation in Cuba is handled by the [http://havana.usinterestsection.gov/ US Interests Section in Havana],which is housed by the Embassy of [[Switzerland]]. Cuba has an Interests Section in [[Washington D.C]]. Both sides handle [[Visa (document)|visa]] processing, consular issues and facilitate limited contact between the two governments. 

Despite the end of the Cold War and the normalization of American relations with such countries as the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Vietnam]], the U.S. still has a strong policy against trade with Cuba and trade is limited to cash purchases of food and  medicine. This includes travel restrictions and laws against American companies operating there.  These measures were further strengthened by the [[Helms-Burton Act]] of [[1996]] which attempted to punish any foreign companies operating in Cuba, especially those using expropriated US assets.

The US continues to operate a naval Base at [[Guantanamo Bay]]. It is leased to the US and only mutual agreement or US abandonment of the area can terminate the lease.

According to the [[CIA]]'s Factbook, Cuba's territorial waters and air space serve as transshipment zone for [[cocaine]] bound for the US and [[Europe]].

Cuba is listed by the U.S. as one of the &quot;[[outposts of tyranny]]&quot; since the [[George W. Bush|Bush administration]].

==Cuban-Canadian relations==

Perhaps mostly because of the restrictions the [[United States]] placed on [[Cuba]], [[Canada]] has a strong trade relationship with the country; [[Cuba]] is also one of Canadians' most popular travel destinations.  Relations between [[Cuba]] and [[Canada]] have been close since before Castro came to power. Following the Cuban revolution, [[Canada]]-based banks were the only ones not nationalized.  Furthermore Cuba has given Canadian companies relaxed access to assets expropriated from US companies [http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/twocomp.html] (most notably mining interests [http://www.american.edu/TED/cubamine.htm]). Canada is outwardly annoyed by American attempts to pressure it to stop trading with Cuba, the [[Helms-Burton Act]] being particularly aggravating. In 1996 a [[Private Member's Bill]] was introduced, but not made law, in the [[Canadian parliament]]; this law called the [[Godfrey-Milliken Bill]] was in response to the extra-territoriality.5% in [[1997]]) and is forecast to continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Economic prospects are good over the long term, and real growth in [[1998]] is expected to reach 3.0%.

Trade is vital to the Cypriot economy--the island is not self-sufficient in food and has few natural resources--and the trade deficit continues to grow. Exports rose by 1.3% in 1997, while imports rose by 2.2%, resulting in a trade deficit of $2.1 billion (2.7% higher than the previous year). Cyprus must import fuels, most raw materials, heavy machinery, and transportation equipment. More than 50% of its trade is with the European Union (especially the [[UK|U.K.]]); the Middle East receives 20% of exports. Cyprus signed an [[European Union Association Agreement|Association Agreement]] with the [[European Union]] (EU) in [[1972]], which resulted in the establishment of a [[Customs Union]] between the two sides. Cyprus applied for full EU membership in [[1990]] and has since linked the [[Cyprus pound]] to the [[European Currency Unit]] (ECU). EU accession negotiations started on [[March 31]], [[1998]]. In [[1991]], Cyprus introduced a [[Value Added Tax]] (VAT), which is currently 15% in line with the EU minimum. Cyprus ratified the new world trade agreement ([[GATT]]) in [[1995]] and began implementing it fully on [[January 1]], [[1996]].

On [[May 1|May 1st]] [[2004]], Cyprus became a full member of the EU.

The economic benefits of EU accession to Cyprus, as a whole, are quite substantial. Cyprus goods and services will have access to a huge single market consisting of some of the most advanced countries in [[Europe]]. Cyprus’ participation in the Union’s internal market, an area where free movement of goods, services, persons and goods is ensured, will lead in the long term to a more efficient allocation of factors of production towards activities in which Cyprus possesses comparative advantages. This will have positive repercussions on growth and employment. 

Cyprus will have a share in the growth and development of the EU economy. It will attract investment from the EU in activities in which Cyprus possesses comparative advantages, thus accelerating the transformation of Cyprus into a regional business centre. Moreover Cyprus will benefit from increased EU financial assistance. 

In the new age of globalisation and world economic integration, in an era marked by a technological revolution, which encompasses all sectors of the economy, the key to success is competitiveness coupled with high quality manufactured goods and services and the ability to adjust quickly to the ever changing preferences of the consumers.

Cyprus has the fourth-largest [[ship registry]] in the world, with 2,758 ships and 25.5 million [[Gross Register Tonnage|gross registered tons]] (GRTs). It is an open registry and includes ships from more than 43 countries, including [[Greece]], [[Germany]], and [[Russia]].

===Export opportunities===
Cyprus has been liberalizing its trade regime by eliminating import quotas and licenses and lowering tariffs on most products as a result of its obligations under the new world trade agreement and its Customs Union agreement with the European Union. As a result, U.S. products are becoming more competitive in Cyprus and prospects for further expansion of bilateral trade ties are excellent.

Government computerization and telecommunications development, two of the priorities of the government's 5-year development plan (1994-1998), provide excellent opportunities for U.S. exports. Sales of computer-assisted design systems, new capital equipment for textile, clothing, footwear production, medical equipment, environmental equipment, and services are also expected to grow. [[USA|U.S.]] pressure resulted in the adoption of a new copyright law in 1994 and a new patent law in 1998.

===Investment climate===
In February [[1997]], the government revised its policy on foreign direct investment, permitting 100% foreign ownership in certain cases. Regulations on foreign portfolio investment in the Cyprus Stock Exchange also have been liberalized. Additionally, Cyprus passed a modern banking law in July 1997, incorporating all the provisions and directives of the EU for the prudential supervision of credit institutions.

Cyprus has concluded treaties on double taxation with 26 countries, including the U.S., and has removed exchange restrictions on current international transactions. Non-residents and foreign investors may freely repatriate proceeds from investments in Cyprus.

===Offshore sector===
The 1,049 full-fledged offshore companies--which are located in Cyprus but conduct business abroad only--qualify for various tax- and duty-free concessions. Foreign exchange earnings from offshore companies rose to $346 million in [[1997]]. There are about 40 U.S.-owned firms in Cyprus; about half operate exclusively on an offshore basis.

U.S. firms are mainly engaged in the regional marketing of [[computer]]s, computer graphics, [[telecommunications]], [[printing]] equipment, household products, and soft drinks. Since 1994, re-entry visa provisions have been streamlined and 3-year work permits have been introduced for offshore employees.

===Trade between Cyprus and the United States===
The U.S. embassy in [[Nicosia]] sponsors a popular pavilion for American products at the annual Cyprus International State Fair, hosts the Commercial Awards dinner, and organizes other events to promote U.S. products throughout the year. Total U.S. exports to Cyprus were about $700 million in 1997 (compared with $670 million in 1996), making the U.S. Cyprus' number-one supplier of total imports for the third year in a row. Exports include American tobacco and tobacco products, automatic data processing and other machinery, and cereals. Principal U.S. imports from Cyprus consist of clothing, footwear, steel tubes and pipes, dairy products, and various food items.

===Turkish Cypriot economy===
The economic disparity between the two communities is pronounced. Although the Turkish Cypriot area operates on a free-market basis, the lack of private and governmental investment, shortages of skilled labor and experienced managers, plus inflation and the devaluation of the Turkish lira (which the [[Turkish Cypriot]]s use as their currency) continue to plague the economy. A Greek-Cypriot-organized economic boycott of the Turkish Cypriot region also has negatively affected the Turkish Cypriot economy.

Turkey is, by far, the main trading partner of the &quot;T.R.N.C.,&quot; supplying 55% of imports and absorbing 48% of exports. In a landmark case, the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) ruled on [[July 5]], 1994, against the British practice of importing produce from Northern Cyprus based on certificates of origin and phytosanitary certificates granted by &quot;T.R.N.C.&quot; authorities. The ECJ decision stated that only goods bearing certificates of origin from the Government of Cyprus could be recognized for trade by EU member countries. That decision resulted in a considerable decrease of Turkish Cypriot exports to the EU: from $36.4 million (or 66.7% of total Turkish Cypriot exports) in 1993 to $24.7 million in 1996 (or 35% of total exports) in 1996. Even so, the EU continues to be the &quot;T.R.N.C.'s&quot; second-largest trading partner, with a 24.7% share of total imports and 35% share of total exports.

Assistance from Turkey is the mainstay of the Turkish Cypriot economy. Under the latest economic protocol (signed [[January 3]], 1997), Turkey undertakes to provide Turkish Cypriots loans totaling $250 million for the purpose of implementing projects included in the protocol related to public finance, tourism, banking, and privatization. Fluctuation in the Turkish lira, which loses about 50% of its value against the U.S. dollar every year, continues to exert downward pressure on the Turkish Cypriot standard of living.

Turkish Cypriot seperatist authorities have instituted a free market in foreign exchange and authorize residents to hold foreign-currency denominated bank accounts. This encourages transfers from Turkish Cypriots living abroad.

The '''Military of Cyprus''' is comprised of the [[Cypriot National Guard]], a [[combined arms]] force with land, [[navy|naval]] and [[airforce|air]] elements.

[[Greece]] maintains the [[Hellenic Forces Regiment on Cyprus]] (ELDYK) on the island, but this is not part of the Republic of Cyprus military.

This article focuses on the forces loyal to the ''de jure'' government of Cyprus.  For information on the military capabilities of the [[non-recognized nations|de facto]] [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]], see [[Turkish Cypriot Security Force]] 

== Conscription ==
''See main article:'' [[Conscription in Cyprus]]

Military service in the [[Republic of Cyprus]] is mandatory for males.  The minimum obligatory service period is 18 months.

All male visitors to the island of military age (16 and over) who have a father of Cypriot extraction are required to obtain an exit visa from a Defence Ministry office.

== Equipment ==
The [[United States of America]] has an arms embargo on any recent US weapons being used by either side. The Greek Cypriot side was recently criticised for acquiring a self-propelled artillery guns (subsequently returned) from the Greek National Army for breaching this embargo.

The Turkish Cypriot side, which controls approximately 38% of the island, has also been heavily criticised for numerous breaches of the embargo.

Standard Infantry equipment used in Cyprus is the G3 Automatic rifle, both by Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot Forces.

[[Image:G3a.jpg|thumb|left|Rifle Training with the G3]]

== Main Battle Tanks == 

*  '''AMX30 - (Type: AMX30-B2)''' 

[[Image:ARMY_PICS_AMXB2.jpg|thumb|left|Cypriot AMX30-B2]]

The French made AMX 30 B2 has been in the arsenal of the Cyprus National Guard since the [[1980s]]. Currently the AMX 30 B2 has undergone several upgrades since its original purpose, none of which is more impressive than the ability to fight in all conditions. Night time fighting ability and the ability to fire while in motion make this main battle tank a worthy opponent on the field of battle.

Most notable of all is that the Cyprus National Guard maintains these vehicles in excellent condition. As a result of their high degree of readiness, and all the upgrades over the years, this tank is capable of continuing its role as the main battle tank of choice for Cypriot field commanders. It might not be as flashy as the T-80U, but its a better work horse in battle.

*  [[T-80]] ('''Type: T-80U''') 

[[Image:ARMY_PICS_T80.jpg|thumb|left|Cypriot T-80U]] [[Image:T80 in field.jpg|thumb|right|Cypriot T-80U during the Nikiforos Training Exercise]]

The T-80U is a next generation platform of armor, which is equivalent in its lethality to all other armor options in the European theatre. Capability of firing both anti-tank missiles and projectiles while moving, the T-80U represents the most durable and capable defensive weapon that the Cypriots have in case of a military conflict.

The T-80U has a crew of three.

*  [[M48]] ('''Type: M48A5''', belonging to the Greek Army, stationed in Cyprus)

[[Image:M48A5-2.jpg|thumb|Right|A M48A5 Battle Tank]]

Armament:         1 - 105mm M68 rifled gun
                            1 - 7.62mm coaxial MG
                            1 - 12.7mm AA MG
Engine:               Continental, AVDS-1790-2D, V-12, diesel super-
                            charged, 750 hp
Speed;               30 mph
Range:               300 miles
Crew:                 4
Weight:              50 tons

This model used the 105mm M68 gun of the M60 tank as well as the diesel engine. The large cupola of the earlier M48s was replaced with an Israeli  designed low profile version. Suspension and tracks were upgraded. No longer in service in the U.S. Upgraded by many allied countries to the M60 standard. Final model of the M48 line.

* '''EE-9 Cascavel'''

[[Image:ARMY_PICS_CASCAVEL.jpg|thumb|left|Cypriot Cascavel Light Tank]]

In the late 1990's Brazil began to flex its muscles in the weapons market, and one of the results was the introduction of the EE-9 Cascavel to the Cyprus National Guard. The Cascavel is in essence an all-purpose armored vehicle. It can be used to spearhead an attack, or it can be used as a purely defensive weapon, depending on the scenario.

The small frame of the Cascavel makes it difficult to square off with a main battle tank, but that was never its purpose. The Casc= French franc). This 0.70 FRF premium is the consequence of the creation of the CFA franc which spared the French African colonies the devaluation of December [[1945]] (before December 1945, 1 local franc in these colonies was worth 1 French franc).
* [[October 17]], [[1948]] to [[December 31]], [[1959]] &amp;ndash; 1 CFA franc = 2.00 FRF (the CFA franc had followed the French franc's devaluation vs. the US dollar in January 1948, but on [[October 18]] [[1948]] the French franc devalued again and this time the CFA franc was revalued against the French franc to offset almost all of this new devaluation of the French franc; after October 1948 the CFA was never revalued again vs. the French franc and followed all the successive devaluations of the French franc)
* [[January 1]], [[1960]] to [[January 11]], [[1994]] &amp;ndash; 1 CFA franc = 0.02 FRF ([[January 1]] [[1960]]: the French franc revalued, with 100 'old' francs becoming 1 'new' franc) 
* [[January 12]], [[1994]] to [[December 31]], [[1998]] &amp;ndash; 1 CFA franc = 0.01 FRF (sharp devaluation of the CFA franc to help African exports) 
* [[January 1]], [[1999]] onward &amp;ndash; 100 CFA franc = 0.152449 euro or 1 euro = 655.957 CFA franc. ([[January 1]], [[1999]]: [[euro]] replaced FRF at the rate of 6.55957 FRF for 1 euro) 

The [[1960]] and [[1999]] events are merely changes in the currency in use in France: the relative value of the CFA franc vs. the French franc / euro changed only in [[1948]] and [[1994]].

The value of the CFA franc has been widely criticized as being too high, which many economists believe favors the urban elite of the African countries which can buy manufactured goods cheaply at the expense of the farmers who cannot easily export agricultural products. The devaluation of [[1994]] was an attempt to reduce the value of the CFA franc.

===European Monetary Union===
In 1998 in anticipation of [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]], the [[Council of the European Union]] addressed the monetary agreements France has with the CFA Zone and [[Comoros]] and ruled that: 

* the agreements are unlikely to have any material effect on the [[monetary policy|monetary]] and [[exchange rate regime|exchange rate policy]] of the [[Euro zone]]
* in their present forms and states of implementation, the agreements are unlikely to present any obstacle to a smooth functioning of [[economic and monetary union]]
* nothing in the agreements can be construed as implying an obligation for the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) or any national [[central bank]] to support the convertibility of the CFA and [[Comorian franc]]s
* modifications to the existing agreements will not lead to any obligations for the European Central or any national central bank
* the French Treasury will guarantee the free convertibility at a fixed parity between the [[euro]] and the CFA and Comorian francs
* the competent French authorities shall keep the [[European Commission]], the European Central Bank and the Economic and Financial Committee informed about the implementation of the agreements and inform the Committee prior to changes of the parity between the euro and the CFA and Comorian francs
* any change to the nature or scope of the agreements would require Council approval on the basis of a Commission recommendation and ECB consultation

==Institutions==
Strictly speaking, there actually exist two different currencies called CFA franc: the West African CFA franc ([[ISO 4217]] currency code XOF), and the Central Africa CFA franc ([[ISO 4217]] currency code XAF). They are distinguished in French by the meaning of the abbreviation CFA. These two CFA francs have the same exchange rate with the euro (1 euro = 655.957 XOF = 655.957 XAF), and they are both guaranteed by the French treasury ([[Trésor public]]), but the West African CFA franc cannot be used in Central African countries, and the Central Africa CFA franc cannot be used in West African countries.

===West African===
The West African CFA franc (XOF) is just known in [[French language|French]] as the ''Franc CFA'', where CFA stands for ''Communauté financière d'Afrique'' (&quot;Financial Community of Africa&quot;). It is issued by the BCEAO (''[[Banque Centrale des États de l'Afrique de l'Ouest]]'', i.e. &quot;Central Bank of the West African States&quot;), located in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]], for the 8 countries of the UEMOA (''Union Économique et Monétaire Ouest Africaine'', i.e. &quot;[[West African Economic and Monetary Union]]&quot;):
*[[Benin]]
*[[Burkina Faso]]
*[[Côte d'Ivoire]]
*[[Guinea-Bissau]]
*[[Mali]]
*[[Niger]]
*[[Senegal]]
*[[Togo]]
These 8 countries have a total population of 75.5 million inhabitants ([[2003]]) and a combined GDP of 36.96 billion USD in [[2003]]. This is about the same population and GDP as [[Vietnam]].

In [[2004]], the 1994 series of West African banknotes were switched for a new series. These new notes have updated security features, and are more modern in design. The switch has also been welcomed by some because of the perception that the old bills were dirty and disease-ridden ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3654920.stm 1]). Despite this, there are fears that those living in rural regions will not hear of the changeover, and as a result, will lose their savings when the older series notes are demonetarized. As well, the color of the 5,000 CFA bill was changed from blueish to green, which could leave open the possiblility of the illiterate being shortchanged when switching from the old to the new series.

The anglophone states of [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Sierra Leone]], and the francophone state of [[Guinea]], have formed the [[West African Monetary Zone]] (WAMZ) and will introduce a common currency, the ECO, on [[1 December]] [[2009]]. [[Liberia]] is also set to join this monetary zone, and the ultimate goal is to unite the [[UEMOA]] and the [[WAMZ]] to form a single West African monetary zone.

[[Mauritania]], a former French colony in West Africa, uses the [[Mauritanian ouguiya]] and not the CFA franc.

===Central African===
The Central Africa CFA franc (XAF) is just known in [[French language|French]] as the ''Franc CFA'', where CFA stands for ''Coopération financière en Afrique centrale'' (&quot;Financial Cooperation in Central Africa&quot;). It is issued by the BEAC (''[[Banque des États de l'Afrique Centrale]]'', i.e. &quot;Bank of the Central African States&quot;), located in [[Yaounde]], [[Cameroon]], for the 6 countries of the CEMAC (''Communauté Économique et Monétaire de l'Afrique Centrale'', i.e. &quot;[[Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa]]&quot;):
*[[Cameroon]]
*[[Central African Republic]]
*[[Chad]]
*[[Republic of the Congo]]
*[[Equatorial Guinea]]
*[[Gabon]]
These 6 countries have a total population of 34.15 million inhabitants ([[2003]]) and a combined GDP of 28.3 billion USD in [[2003]]. This is about the same population as [[Tanzania]], and the same GDP as [[Kazakhstan]].

[[Equatorial Guinea]], the only former Spanish colony in the zone, adopted the CFA in 1984.

'''Consciousness''' is a quality of the [[mind]] generally regarded to comprise such key features as [[subjectivity]], [[self-awareness]], [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and the ability to [[perception|perceive]] the relationship between [[personal identity|oneself]] and one's [[natural environment|environment]]. It is a subject of much research in [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[neurology]], and [[cognitive science]]. Consciousness differs itself from moral [[conscience]], often designed by the expression of a &quot;voice of conscience&quot; telling the good from the evil.

Some philosophers divide consciousness into phenomenal consciousness, which is experience itself, and access consciousness, which is the processing of the things in experience (Block 2004). Others consider this distinction to be mistaken (Dennett 1991). Some philosophers believe that consciousness is part of the physical world whilst others believe it may be separate from the physical world in some sense. (Descartes, in particular, strongly held this view.) Many cultures and religious traditions place the seat of consciousness in a [[soul]] that is the mind separate from the body. Some consider consciousness to be intimately linked to the neural functioning of the [[brain]], dictating the way by which the world is experienced. [[Marx]], [[Nietzsche]] and [[Freud]] all criticized the notion of a conscious [[subject (philosophy)|subject]], [[sovereignty|sovereign]] of himself, which forms the groundworks of the [[liberalism|liberal]] tradition of the [[social contract]].

Humans (and often other animals, as well) are variously said to possess consciousness, [[self-awareness]], and a [[mind]] that contains our sensations, perceptions, [[dreams]], [[lucid dreams]], inner speech and imagination etc. Each of us has a [[subjective]] view. There are many debates about the extent to which the mind constructs or experiences the outer world, the passage of [[time]], and [[free will]].

An understanding of necessary preconditions for consciousness in the human brain may allow us to address important ethical questions. For instance, to what extent are non-human animals conscious? At what point in human development does consciousness begin? Can machines ever achieve conscious states? These issues are of great interest to those concerned with the ethical treatment of other beings, be they [[animal rights|animals]], [[fetus|fetuses]], or in the future, [[artificial consciousness|machines]]. [[Panpsychism]] is the belief that all matter is sentient or conscious.

In common parlance, consciousness denotes being [[awake]] and responsive to one's environment; this contrasts with [[unconsciousness]] as when being [[sleep|asleep]] or in a [[coma]] (distinct from Freud's [[unconscious mind]]). The term 'level of consciousness' denotes how consciousness seems to vary during [[anesthesia]] and during various states of mind, such as [[day dreaming]], [[lucid dreaming]], imagining, etc. Nonconsciousness exists when consciousness is not present. There is speculation, especially among religious groups, that consciousness may exist after death or before birth.

== Etymology  ==

&quot;Consciousness&quot; derives from Latin ''[[:la:conscientia|conscientia]]'' which primarily means [[conscience|moral conscience]]. In the literal sense, &quot;conscientia&quot; means knowledge-with, that is, shared knowledge. The word first appears in Latin juridic texts by writers such as [[Cicero]]. Here, ''conscientia'' is the knowledge that a witness has of the deed of someone else. In Christian theology, conscience stands for the moral conscience in which our actions and intentions are registered and which is only fully known to god. Medieval writers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] describe the conscientia as the act by which we apply practical and moral knowledge to our own actions {{ref|Aquinas}}.
[[René Descartes]] has been said to be the first philosopher to use &quot;conscientia&quot; in a way that does not seem to fit this traditional meaning,  and, as a consequence, the translators of his writings in other languages like French and English coined new words in order to denote merely psychological consciousness. These are, for instance, ''[[:fr:conscience|conscience]]'', and ''[[:de:Bewusstsein|Bewusstsein]]'' {{ref|Davies}}.
However, it has also been argued that [[John Locke]] was in fact the first one to use the modern meaning of consciousness in his ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', although it remains closely intertwined with moral conscience (I may be held [[responsibility|morally responsible]] only for the act of which I am conscious of having achieved; and my personal identity - [[self (philosophy)|my self]] - goes as far as my consciousness extends itself). The modern sense of &quot;consciousness&quot; was therefore first found not in Descartes' work - who sometimes used the word in a modern sense, but did not distinguish it as much as would Locke do -, but in Locke's text. The modern sense of the word (consciousness associated to the idea of [[personal identity]], which is assured by the repeated consciousness of oneself) was therefore introduced by Locke; but the word &quot;conscience&quot; itself was coined by Pierre Costes, French translator of Locke. Henceforth, the modern sense first appeared in Locke's works, but the word itself first appeared in the French language {{ref|Balibar}}.

== Philosophical approaches ==
Some philosophers suggest that consciousness resists or even defies definition, although it is generally considered as the mental perception accompanying each thought (&quot;I am conscious that I am thinking&quot;). [[John Locke]] and succeeding philosophers considered it as the basis of [[personal identity]], of the [[self (philosophy)|self]]. This classic conception, which is at the basis of the [[social contract]] theory, has been challenged by thinkers such as [[Marx]], [[Nietzsche]] and [[Freud]]. Marx considered that ''social relations'' preceded individual consciousness; Nietzsche considered consciousness to be but the effect of [[guilt]] and ''[[ressentiment]]'' (while not denying its very real existence); and Freud thought the specific concept of an [[unconscious mind]], from which [[Carl Jung]] would derive the concept of a [[collective unconscious]], sometimes related to [[ideology]]. As a major characteristic of the definition of the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]], the criticisms of consciousness necessarily led to a criticism of the notion of an [[individualism|individual]] subject and its correlating [[free will]]. Still other philosophers have also tried to distinguish consciousness between ''phenomenal consciousness'' and ''access'' or ''psychological consciousness''. In a general sense, there are many philosophical stances on consciousness, including: [[behaviorism]], [[dualism]], [[idealism]], [[functionalism]], [[phenomenalism]], [[phenomenology]] (which describes [[intentionality]] as the basic structure of consciousness), [[physicalism]], [[emergentism]], [[mysticism]], etc. 

=== Consciousness as the basis of personal identity (John Locke) ===

[[John Locke]]'s chapter XXVII &quot;On Identity and Diversity&quot; in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1689) has been said to be one of the first modern conceptualization of consciousness as the repeated self-identification of [[self (philosophy)|oneself]], through which moral [[responsibility]] could be attributed to the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] - and therefore punishment and [[guilt]]yness justified, as would critics such as [[Nietzsche]] point out.
According to Locke, [[personal identity]] (the self) &quot;depends on consciousness, not on [[substance theory|substance]]&quot; nor on the [[soul]]. We are the same person to the extent that we are conscious of our past and future thoughts and actions in the same way as we are conscious of our present thoughts and actions. If consciousness is this &quot;thought&quot; which doubles all thoughts, than personal identity is only founded on the repeated act of consciousness: &quot;This may show us wherein personal identity consists: not in the identity of substance, but... in the identity of consciousness&quot;. For example, one may claim to be a [[reincarnation]] of Plato, therefore having the same soul. However, one would be the same [[person]] as Plato only if one had the same consciousness of Plato's thoughts and actions that he himself did. Therefore, self-identity is not based on the soul. One soul may have various personalities.
Self-identity is not founded either on the body or the substance, argues Locke, as the substance may change while the person remains the same: &quot;animal identity is preserved in identity of life, and not of substance&quot;, as the body of the animal grows and change during its life. Take for example a prince's soul which enters the body of a cobbler: to all exterior eyes, the cobbler would remain a cobbler. But to the prince himself, the cobbler would be himself, as he would be conscious of the prince's thoughts and acts, and not of the cobbler's life. A prince's consciousness in a cobbler body: thus the cobbler is, in fact, a prince.
But this interesting border-case leads to this problematic thought that since personal identity is based on consciousness, and that only oneself can be aware of his consciousness, exterior human judges may never know if they really are judging - and punishing - the same person, or simply the same body. In other words, Locke argues that you may be judged only for the acts of your body, as this is what is apparent to all but God; however, you are in truth only [[responsibility|responsible]] for the acts for which you are conscious. This forms the basis of the [[insanity defense]]: one can't be held accountable for acts from which one was [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] - and therefore leads to interesting philosophical questions:

:&quot;personal identity consists [not in the identity of substance] but in the identity of consciousness, wherein if Socrate and the present mayor of Queenborough agree, they are the same person: if the same Socrates waking and sleeping do not partake of the same consciousness, Socrate waking and sleeping is not the same person. And to punish Socrates waking for what sleeping Socrates thought, and waking Socrates was never conscious of, would be no more right, than to punish one twin for what his brother-twin did, whereof he knew nothing, because their outsides were so like, that they could not be distinguished; for such twins have been seen.&quot;{{ref|Locke}}

Or again:

:&quot;PERSON, as I take it, is the name for this self. Wherever a man finds what he calls himself, there, I think, another may say is the same person. It is a forensic term, appropriating actions and their merit; and so belong only to intelligent agents, capable of a law, and happiness, and misery. This personality extends itself beyond present existence to what is past, only by consciousness, --whereby it becomes concerned and accountable; owns and imputes to itself past actions, just upon the same ground and for the same reason as it does the present. All which is founded in a concern for happiness, the unavoidable concomitant of consciousness; that which is conscious of pleasure and plain, desiring that that self that is conscious should be happy. And therefore whatever past actions it cannot reconcile or APPROPRIATE to that present self by consciousness, it can be no more concerned in it than if they had never been done: and to receive pleasure or pain, i.e. reward or punishment, on the account of any such action, is all one as to be made happy or miserable in its first being, without any demerit at all. For, supposing a MAN punished now for what he had done in another life, whereof he could be made to have no consciousness at all, what difference is there between that punishment and being CREATED miserable? And therefore, conformable to this, the apostle tells us, that, at the great day, when every one shall 'receive according to his doings, the secrets of all hearts shall be laid open.' The sentence shall be justified by the consciousness all person shall have, that THEY THEMSELVES, in what bodies soever they appear, or what substances soever that consciousness adheres to, are the SAME that committed those actions, and deserve that punishment for them.&quot; {{ref label|Locke|4|a}}

Henceforth, Lo to coin or print money was quite large. One could, literally, have &quot;a license to print money&quot;; many nobles had the right of coinage. Royal colonial companies, such as the Massachusetts Bay Company or the British East India Company could issue notes of credit&amp;mdash;money backed by the promise to pay later, or exchangeable for payments owed to the company itself. This led to continual instability of the value of money. The exposure of coins to debasement and shaving, however, presented the same problem in another form: with each pair of hands a coin passed through, its value  grew less.

The solution which evolved beginning in the late [[18th century]] and through the [[19th century]] was the creation of a central monetary authority which had a virtual monopoly on issuing currency, and whose notes had to be accepted for &quot;all debts public and private&quot;. The creation of a truly national currency, backed by the government's store of precious metals, and enforced by their military and governmental control over an area was, in its time, extremely controversial. Advocates of the old system of [[Free Banking]] repealed central banking laws, or slowed down the adoption of restrictions on local currency. (See [[Gold standard]] for a fuller discussion of the creation of a standard gold based currency).

At this time both silver and gold were considered [[legal tender]], and accepted by governments for taxes. However, the instability in the ratio between the two grew over the course of the 19th century, with the increase both in supply of these metals, particularly silver, and of trade. This is called [[bimetallism]] and the attempt to create a [[bimetallic]] standard where both gold and silver backed currency remained in circulation occupied the efforts of [[inflation| inflationists]]. Governments at this point could use currency as an instrument of policy, printing paper currency such as the United States [[Greenback]], to pay for military expenditures. They could also set the terms at which they would redeem notes for specie, by limiting the amount of purchase, or the minimum amount that could be redeemed. 

By 1900, most of the industrializing nations were on some form of gold standard, with paper notes and silver coins constituting the circulating medium. Governments too followed Gresham's Law: keeping gold and silver paid, but paying out in notes.

=== The paper money era ===
''See [[Banknote#History of Paper Money|the history of paper money]].''

== Modern currencies ==
To find out which currency is used in a particular country, start at the [[countries of the world]] or look at the [[table of historical exchange rates]].

Nowadays [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] have introduced a system, ''[[ISO 4217]]'', using three-letter codes to define currency (as opposed to simple names or [[currency sign]]s), in order to remove the confusion that there are dozens of currencies called the [[dollar]] and many called the [[franc]]. Even the [[Pound (currency)|pound]] is used in nearly a dozen different countries, all, of course, with wildly differing values. In general, the three-letter code uses the ''[[ISO 3166-1]]'' country code for the first two letters and the first letter of the name of the currency (D for dollar, for instance) as the third letter.

The [[International Monetary Fund]] uses a variant system when referring to national currencies.

:''For exchange rates, see [[Exchange rate#External links|here.]]''

== Privately-issued currencies ==
{{See also|Private currency}}
From the earliest times [[token coins]] were issued by companies in remote parts of the world to overcome the shortage of circulating currency.

Several large companies issue points to their customers, to be redeemed for products and services produced by that company. Often, a [[business network|network]] of companies will join to share in the offering and redemption of points. While these can hardly be considered stable currency systems, they present many of the same features as &quot;legitimate&quot; currency: they are a store of value, issued in discrete units; they are controlled by a central issuing authority; and they have varying rates of exchange with other forms of currency. For example, [[frequent flyer miles]] can be bought using U.S. dollars.

*[[Alternative currency]]: A currency such as the [[Liberty Dollar]], with a one-to-one exchange rate with the U.S. Dollar.

*[[Digital gold currency]]: Privately issued digital currency backed by [[gold]]

*[[Frequent flyer miles]]: A type of private currency, different versions of which are issued by most major [[airlines]] to encourage [[customer loyalty]]. Other customer loyalty incentives have followed this model, including points systems offered by soft drink manufacturers such as [[PepsiCo]]. [[Metro|Subway]] tokens, issued by city transit authorities, can be considered a highly specialized form of currency.

*[[Scrip]]: A type of private currency where a certain value is captured, and used to purchase goods from a company. Examples of scrip include gift certificates, gift cards, and [[Disney Dollar]]s or [[Canadian Tire Money]]. However, scrip is not considered a currency in itself, but merely a store of value, denominated in another currency.

== Local currencies ==
{{See also|Local currency}}
In economics, a local currency is a currency not backed by a national government, and intended to trade only in a small area. Advocates such as Jane Jacobs argue that this enables an economically depressed region to pull itself up, by giving the people living there a medium of exchange that they can use to exchange services and locally-produced goods (In a broader sense, this is the original purpose of all money.) Opponents of this concept argue that local currency creates a barrier which can interfere with economies of scale and comparative advantage, and that in some cases they can serve as a means of tax evasion.

Local currencies can also come into being when there is economic turmoil involving the national currency. An example of this is the Argentine economic crisis of 2002 in which IOUs issued by local governments quickly took on some of the characteristics of local currencies.

== World currency ==
With such developments as the [[euro]] allowing for facilitated trade and perhaps a corresponding increase in a wider identity, proposals for a [[global currency]] have accelerated, even while it is recognized that several political and economic factors would need to be addressed and intermediate steps taken before such a concept might be accepted by the diverse nations of the world.

== Circulating currencies ==

A '''central bank''', '''reserve bank''' or '''monetary authority''', is an entity responsible for the [[monetary policy]] of its [[country]] or of its group of member states, such as in the [[European Union]]. Its primary responsibility is to maintain the stability of the national [[currency]] and [[money supply]], but more active duties include controlling subsidized [[loan]] [[interest rates]], and acting as a &quot;bailout&quot; [[lender of last resort]] to the [[bank|banking sector]] during times of financial [[crisis]] (private banks often being integral to the national financial system).

It may also have supervisory powers to ensure that banks and other financial institutions do not behave recklessly or fraudulently. A central bank is usually headed by a Governor, President in the case of the European Central Bank or Chief Executive/Managing Director in the case of  Hong Kong Monetary Authority and Monetary Authority of Singapore.

In most countries the central bank is state-owned and has a minimal degree of autonomy, which allows for the possibility of [[government]] intervening in monetary policy. An &quot;independent central bank&quot; is one which operates under rules designed to prevent political interference; examples include the [[United_States|US]] [[Federal Reserve]], the [[Bank of England]] (since 1997), [[Reserve Bank of India]] ([[1935]]), the [[Deutsche Bundesbank]], the [[Bank of Canada]] and the [[European Central Bank]].

==Activities and responsibilities==
Functions of a central bank (not all functions carried out by all banks):
* monopoly on the issue of banknotes 
* the Government's banker and the bankers' bank (&quot;Lender of Last Resort&quot;)
* manages the country's foreign exchange and gold reserves and the Government's stock register; 
* regulation and supervision of the banking industry;
* setting the official interest rate - used to manage both [[inflation]] and the country's [[exchange rate]].

The central bank's main responsibility is the management of monetary policy to ensure a stable economy, including a stable currency. It aims to manage [[inflation]] (rising average prices) as well as [[deflation]] (falling prices). It is the lender of last resort, and will (at a price) assist banks in cases of financial distress (see also [[bank run]]s).

Furthermore, it will hold [[foreign exchange reserves]] (usually in the form of [[government bond]]s) and [[official gold reserves]], and will often have some influence over [[exchange rate]]s.  Some exchange rates are managed, some are market based (free float) and many are somewhere in between (&quot;managed float&quot; or &quot;dirty float&quot;). 

Typically a central bank controls certain types of short-term [[interest rate]]s. These influence the [[stock market|stock-]] and [[bond market]]s as well as [[mortgage]] and other interest rates. The [[European Central Bank]] for example announces its interest rate at the meeting of its Governing Council (in the case of the [[Federal Reserve]], the [[Board of Governors]]). 

Both the Federal Reserve and the ECB are composed of one or more central bodies that are responsible for the main decisions about interest rates and the size and type of open market operations, and several branches to execute its policies. In the case of the Fed, they are the local Federal Reserve Banks, for the ECB they are the national central banks.

==Instruments of monetary policy==

===Open Market Operations===

Through [[open market operation]]s, a central bank influences the money supply in an economy directly. Each time it buys [[security (finance)|securities]], exchanging money for the security, it raises the money supply. Conversely, selling of securities lowers the money supply. Buying of securities thus amounts to printing new money while lowering supply of the specific security.

The main open market operations are:
* Temporary lending of money for [[collateral]] securities (&quot;Reverse Operations&quot;). These operations are carried out on a regular basis, where fixed [[maturity]] loans (of 1 week and 1 month for the ECB) are auctioned off.
* Buying or selling securities (&quot;Direct Operations&quot;) on ad-hoc basis.
* [[Foreign exchange]] operations such as [[forex swap]]s.

All of these interventions can also influence the [[foreign exchange]] market and thus the exchange rate. For example the [[People's Bank of China]] and the [[Bank of Japan]] have on occasion bought several hundred billions of [[Treasury security|U.S. Treasuries]], presumably in order to stop the decline of the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] versus the [[Renminbi]] and the [[Yen]].

===Interest rates===

A central bank has several [[interest rate]]s it can set to influence markets. 
*'''Marginal Lending Rate''' (currently 3% in the Eurozone) A fixed rate for institutions to borrow money from the CB.
*'''Main Refinancing Rate''' (2% in the Eurozone) This is the publicly visible interest rate the central bank announces. It is also known as ''Minimum Bid Rate'' and serves as a bidding floor for refinancing loans (In the US this is called the [[Discount rate]]).
*'''Deposit Rate''' (1% in the Eurozone) The rate parties receive for deposits at the CB.

These rates directly affect the rates in the [[money market]], the market for short term loans.

===Reserve requirements===

Many banks are required to delegate a percentage of their deposits as [[reserves]]. Such legal [[reserve requirements]] were introduced in the nineteenth century to reduce the risk of banks overextending themselves and suffering from [[bank run]]s, as this could lead to knock-on effects on other banks. See also [[money multiplier]].

===Capital Requirements===
Reserve requirements have now largely been replaced as a tool by [[capital requirements]]. Rather than x% of liabilities being held as [[cash]], banks are these days required to hold y% of their assets as capital. For international banks, the threshold is 8% (see the [[Basel Capital Accords]].

This acts similarly to a deposit requirement in that it prevents indefinite lending: when at the threshold, a bank cannot extend another loan without acquiring further capital on its balance sheet.

==Banking supervision and other activities==

In some countries a central bank through its subsidiaries controls and monitors the banking sector. In other countries banking supervision is carried out by a government department such as The Ministry of Finance, or an independent government agency (eg UK's [[Financial Services Authority]]). It examines the banks' [[balance sheet]]s and behaviour and policies toward [[consumers]]. Apart from refinancing, it also provides banks with services such as transfer of funds, [[bank notes]] and [[coin]]s or foreign currency. Thus it is often described as the &quot;bank of banks&quot;.

==Independence==

Advocates of central bank independence argue that a central bank which is too susceptible to political direction or pressure may encourage economic cycles (&quot;[[boom and bust]]&quot;), as politicians may be tempted to boost the economy in advance of an election, to the detriment of the long-term health of the economy. In addition, it is argued that an independent central bank can run a more [[credible]] monetary policy, making market [[expectation]]s more responsive to signals from the central bank. Recently, both the Bank of England and the European Central Bank have been made independent and follow a set of published [[inflation targetting|inflation targets]] so that markets know what to expect.

Governments generally have some degree of influence over even &quot;independent&quot; central banks; the aim of independence is primarily to prevent short-term interference. For example, the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank is appointed by the [[President of the U.S.]], and his choice must be confirmed by the [[Congress of the United States|Congress]].

==History==
The oldest central bank in the world is the [[Bank of Sweden]], which was opened in [[1668]] with help from [[Dutch]] businessmen. This was followed in [[1694]] by the [[Bank of England]], created by a businessman in the [[City of London]] at the request of the [[English]] government to help pay for a war. The [[US Federal Reserve]] was created by the [[U.S. Congress]] through the passing of the [[Glass-Owen Bill]], signed by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] on [[December 23]], [[1913]].

'''Chlorine''' (from the [[Greek language]] ''Chloros'', meaning &quot;pale green&quot;), is the [[chemical element]] with [[atomic number]] 17 and symbol '''Cl'''. It is a [[halogen]], found in the [[periodic table]] in [[periodic table group|group]] 17.  As the [[chloride]] ion, which is part of [[common salt]] and other compounds, it is abundant in nature and necessary to most forms of life, including [[human]]s. As chlorine gas, it is [[green]]ish [[yellow]], is two and one half times as heavy as air, has an intensely disagreeable suffocating odor, and is exceedingly [[poison]]ous. In its liquid and solid form it is a powerful [[oxidation|oxidizing]], [[Bleach (chemical)|bleach]]ing, and disinfecting agent.

== Notable characteristics ==
The pure chemical element, has the physical form of a [[diatomic]] yellow-green gas, Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. 

This element is a member of the [[salt]]-forming halogen series and is extracted from chlorides through [[oxidation]] and more commonly, by [[electrolysis]]. Chlorine is a greenish-yellow gas that combines readily with nearly all other elements. At 10°[[Celsius|C]] one [[liter]] of [[water]] dissolves 3.10 liters of chlorine and at 30 °C only 1.77 liters.

== Applications ==
Chlorine is an important chemical for some processes of [[water purification]], in [[disinfectant]]s, and in [[bleach]].  [[Ozone]] can also be used for killing bacteria, and is preferred by many municipal drinking water systems because ozone does not form organochlorine compounds and does not remain in the water after treatment. 

Chlorine is also used widely in the manufacture of many everyday items.
*Used (in the form of [[hypochlorous acid]]) to kill [[bacterium|bacteria]] and other microbes from [[drinking water]] supplies and [[swimming pool]]s. Even small water supplies are now routinely chlorinated. ''See'' [[chlorination]].
*Used widely in [[paper]] product production, antiseptic, dyestuffs, food, [[insecticide]]s, paints, petroleum products, plastics, medicines, textiles, solvents, and many other consumer products.

[[Organic chemistry]] uses this element extensively as an oxidizing agent and in [[substitution]] because chlorine often imparts many desired properties in an [[organic compound]] when it is substituted for [[hydrogen]] (as in [[synthetic rubber]] production).

Other uses are in the production of chlorates, [[chloroform]], [[carbon tetrachloride]], and in the [[bromine]] extraction.

== History ==
Chlorine ([[Greek language|Gr.]] &amp;chi;&amp;lambda;&amp;omega;&amp;rho;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf;, greenish yellow) was discovered in [[1774]] by Swedish chemist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]], who mistakenly thought it contained [[oxygen]]. Chlorine was given its name in [[1810]] by [[Sir Humphry Davy]], who insisted that it was in fact an element.

Chlorine gas was first [[chemical warfare|used as a weapon]] against human beings in [[WWI]] on [[April 22nd]], [[1915]].

== Occurrence ==
In nature chlorine is found only as the [[chloride ion]].  Chlorides make up much of the [[salt]] dissolved in the Earth's [[ocean]]s&amp;mdash;about 1.9% of the mass of seawater is chloride ions.  Even higher concentrations of chloride are dissolved in the [[Dead Sea]] and in underground [[brine]] deposits.

Most chlorides are soluble in water, so solid chlorides are usually only found in abundance in dry climates, or deep underground.  Common chloride minerals include ''halite'' ([[sodium chloride]]), ''sylvite'' ([[potassium chloride]]), and ''[[carnallite]]'' (potassium magnesium chloride hexahydrate).

Industrially, elemental chlorine is usually produced by the [[electrolysis]] of sodium chloride dissolved in water.  Along with chlorine, this [[chloralkali process]] yields [[hydrogen]] gas and [[sodium hydroxide]], according to the [[chemical equation]]

:2 [[sodium chloride|NaCl]] + 2 [[water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] &amp;rarr; Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + [[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2d in the city is $47,979, and the median income for a family is $59,423. Males have a median income of $43,825 versus $38,489 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city is $31,156.  12.9% of the population and 8.7% of families are below the [[poverty line]].  Out of the total population, 15.1% of those under the age of 18 and 12.9% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line.

==Economy==
Although manufacturing was an important part of the late 19th and early 20th-century Cambridge economy, today long-established educational institutions are its biggest employers; [[Harvard]] employs over 10,000 people and [[MIT]] over 7,000 as of 2004. As a famous cradle of technological innovation, Cambridge has also been home to legendary technology firms, including [[Akamai]], [[BBN]], [[Lotus Development Corporation]] (now part of [[IBM]]), [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]], and [[Thinking Machines]]. 

Over the years, as companies have grown, prospered, and then either moved away or gone out of business (see this [http://www.cambridgema.gov/~CDD/data/index.html#labor list] of employers for more information), Cambridge's large-scale employment has shifted tremendously. In 1996, [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]], [[Arthur D. Little]], and [[Lotus Development Corporation|Lotus]] were all top employers with over 1,000 people in Cambridge, and all declined or disappeared a few years later.  As of 2005, alongside Harvard and MIT, health care and biotechnology dominate the Cambridge economy, with [[Genzyme]], [[Biogen Idec]], and [[Novartis]] the biggest players. Biotech's geographical locus is Kendall Square and [[East Cambridge, Massachusetts|East Cambridge]], the center of much of the city's manufacturing a century before. Of the computer-industry firms that once dominated the Cambridge economy, only [[Akamai]] remains a top-20 employer. However, many smaller start-ups and entrepreneurial companies remain an important part of the Cambridge employment scene.

== Law and government ==
Cambridge has a 9-member City Council, and a 6-member School Committee.  The councillors and school committee members are elected every two years using the [[single transferable vote]] (STV) system. [http://www.cambridgema.gov/~Election/prop-voting.html] Since the disbanding of the New York City Community School Boards in 2002, the Council is unusual in being the only governing body in the United States to use STV [http://ccrc.wustl.edu/~lorracks/projects/techreport/subsection3_4_4.html]. Once a laborious process that took several days to complete, vote counting is now done by computer. 

The mayor is elected by the city councillors, from amongst themselves, and serves as the chair of City Council meetings.  The mayor also sits on the School Committee.  However, the Mayor is not the Chief Executive of the City.  Rather, the City Manager, who is appointed by the City Council, serves in that capacity. Robert W. Healy is currently the City Manager.

== Education ==

*[[Harvard University]]
*[[Lesley University]]
*[[Longy School of Music]]
*[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]

=== Schools ===
Cambridge is host to many public and private schools serving the children of Cambridge.

The 12 public elementary schools include:
*'''Amigos School'''
*'''Baldwin School'''
*'''Cambridgeport School'''
*'''Fletcher-Maynard Academy'''
*'''Graham &amp; Parks School'''
*'''Haggerty School'''
*'''Kennedy/Longfellow School'''
*'''King Open School'''
*'''Martin Luther King Jr. School'''
*'''Morse School'''
*'''Peabody School'''
*'''Tobin School'''

There is only one public high school in Cambridge, which is [[Cambridge Rindge and Latin]], a.k.a. '''CRLS'''.

There are many other private schools in the region, serving a variety of needs in both parents and students. Some examples are '''The Shady Hill School''', '''[[Buckingham Browne &amp; Nichols]]''' (a.k.a. BB&amp;N) and '''[[German International School Boston]]''' (a.k.a. GISBOS).

==Transportation==
===Road===
Cambridge has an irregular street network due to the fact that many of the roads date from the colonial era.  Contrary to popular belief, the road system did not evolve from longstanding cow-paths.  Roads connected various village settlements with each other and nearby towns, and were shaped by geographic features, most notably streams, hills, and swampy areas. Several major roads lead to Cambridge, including the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] (Exit 18), [[Massachusetts State Highway 2|Route 2]], [[Massachusetts State Highway 16|Route 16]] and the [[Massachusetts State Highway 28|McGrath Highway (Route 28)]]. [[Massachusetts Avenue]] runs the length of the city. The Charles River forms the southern border of Cambridge and is crossed by 11 bridges, 8 of which are open to motorized road traffic.  (Part of the new I-93 bridges might also cut across a corner of Cambridge without providing any access.)

It can be hard to find a place to park in Cambridge. Main streets have metered parking. Parking on most other streets is restricted to residents with a sticker, even in areas without a parking shortage. Nonresidents cannot park in these spaces for any length of time, except on Sundays, or with a visitor permit lent by a resident. Streets are cleaned once a month (over two days, one day per side of the street), except January through March. If you park on the wrong side of street on that street's cleaning day your car ''will'' be towed. City policy discourages public off-street parking, in favor of reserved parking for residential and commercial tenants, so paid off-street parking is very expensive, and is nonexistent in many areas.

===Mass Transit===
Cambridge has one stop on the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] and five stops on the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]]. [[Alewife Station (MBTA)|Alewife Station]], with its large parking garage ($5 per day as of November 2005), is an ideal place for visitors coming from the area to the northwest to leave their cars if their destination is near a T station, although like many other Boston-area commuter lots, it tends to fill on workday mornings, and there can be major delays driving out of the garage during the evening rush. There are also several bus routes, with major local bus terminals at Alewife, Harvard Square, Central Square, and Lechmere Square, and four [[trolleybus]] routes that originate at Harvard Square.

===Cycling===
Cambridge has several [[bike path| bike paths]], including one along the Charles River [http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/maps/bikepaths_dudley.gif], the [[Minuteman Bikeway]] and a linear park connecting Alewife and the [[Somerville Community Path]]. Bike parking is common and there are bike lanes on many streets, although concerns have been expressed regarding the suitability of many of the lanes. From time to time, police target their traffic enforcement efforts towards bicyclists who do not follow the Rules of the Road for vehicles, especially going through red lights, failure to stop for pedestrians at unsignalized crosswalks, riding on the wrong side of the street or the wrong way on a one-way street, and riding without a headlight at night. Cambridge has an active, official bicycle committee.

===Intercity===
Intercity buses and [[Amtrak]] stop at [[South Station]], which is a short ride on the Red Line from Cambridge.  [[Logan International Airport]] is easy to get to by car or taxi. It can also be reached via mass transit by transferring to the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] SL1 bus at South Station.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many places called '''Cambridge''':

Perhaps the most famous 'Cambridge', and historically the first is located in [[Cambridgeshire]], [[United Kingdom]], where the [[University of Cambridge]] is based. The majority of the city lies within the [[Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|parliamentary constituency of Cambridge]].

In the general parlance of the [[United States]], 'Cambridge' usually refers to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], a renowned intellectual center near [[Boston]], where [[Harvard University]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] are located.

Other places called Cambridge include the following:

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''(Norman) Colin Dexter''' is the [[United Kingdom|British]] author of the [[Inspector Morse]] novels. Dexter was born in [[Stamford, England|Stamford]], [[Lincolnshire]], on [[29 September]] [[1930]] and was educated at [[Stamford School]]. After National Service with the [[Royal Corps of Signals]] he read [[Classics]] at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], graduating in [[1953]]. 

In [[1954]] he started his teaching career in the [[East Midlands]], becoming assistant classics master at [[Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College|Wyggeston School]], [[Leicester]]. A post at [[Loughborough Grammar School]] followed, before he took up the position of senior classics teacher at Corby Grammar School, [[Northamptonshire]], in [[1959]].  

In [[1966]] he was forced by the onset of [[hearing impairment|deafness]] to retire from teaching, and took up the post of Senior Assistant Secretary at the Oxford Delegacy of Local Examinations in [[Oxford]] - a job he held until his retirement in [[1988]].

He started writing mysteries in [[1972]] during a family holiday: &quot;We were in a little guest house halfway between [[Caernarfon]] and [[Pwllheli]]. It was a Saturday and it was raining - it's not unknown for it to rain in
north [[Wales]]. The children were moaning ... I was sitting at the kitchen table with nothing else to do, and I wrote the first few paragraphs of a
potential detective novel.&quot; ''Last Bus to Woodstock'' was published in [[1975]] and introduced the world to the character of Inspector Morse, the irascible detective whose penchants for [[cryptic crossword]]s, [[English literature]], [[cask ale]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] reflect Dexter's own enthusiasms.

The success of the [[TV series]] based on ''Inspector Morse'' and produced between [[1987]] and [[2001]], brought further acclaim for Colin Dexter. In the manner of [[Alfred Hitchcock]], he also makes a [[cameo appearance]] in each of the episodes.

Colin Dexter has been the recipient of several [[Crime Writers Association]]  &quot;Golden Dagger&quot; awards, and in [[2000]] he was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for services to literature.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The term '''college''' ([[Latin]] '''collegium''') is most often used today to denote an [[education]]al [[institution]].  More broadly, it can be the name of any [[group]] of [[colleague]]s (see for example [[electoral college]], [[College of Arms]]). Originally it meant a group of [[person|people]] living together under a common set of [[rule]]s (''con-'', &quot;together&quot; + ''leg-'', &quot;law&quot;); as a consequence members of colleges were originally styled &quot;[[fellow]]s&quot; and still are in some places. The precise usage of the term varies among [[English language|English]]-speaking countries.

== United Kingdom ==
[[United Kingdom|British]] usage of the word &quot;college&quot; remains the loosest, encompassing a range of institutions:
* certain [[independent schools|public schools]] for children such as [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Winchester College|Winchester]]
* certain [[secondary education| secondary schools]], particularly &quot;[[sixth form college|sixth form colleges]]&quot;, where students (ages 16-18) finish their secondary education, and some [[specialist school|specialist schools]]
* the constituent parts of some [[universities]] (see below)
* [[university college]]s &amp;mdash; independent higher education institutions that have been granted degree-awarding powers but not [[university]] status.
* colleges of [[further education]] and [[adult education]].
* professional associations such as the [[Royal College of Organists]], the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] and other various [[Royal College]]s.
* the [[College of Justice]] or [[Court of Session]] of [[Scotland]]

In general use, a &quot;college&quot; refers to; institutions between secondary school and university, colleges of further education and adult education. Many types of institutions have &quot;college&quot; in its name but are not &quot;colleges&quot; in the general use of the word. For example Eton College would not be refered to as a college, but as a school or by its full name.

===Universities and colleges===
In relation to universities, the term ''college'' normally refers to a part of the university which does not have degree-awarding powers in itself.  Degrees are always awarded by ''universities'', ''colleges'' are institutions or organisations which prepare students for the degree.  In some cases, colleges prepare students for the degree of a university of which the college is a part (eg colleges of the [[University of London]], [[University of Cambridge]], etc) and in some cases colleges are independent institutions which prepare students to sit as external candidates at other universities (eg many higher education colleges prepare students to sit for external examinations of universities). In the past, many of what are now universities with their own degree-awarding powers were colleges which had their degrees awarded by either a federal university (eg [[Cardiff University]]) or another university (eg many of the [[Post-1992 university|post-1992 universities]]).

====Oxford and Cambridge====
The two [[ancient universities]] of [[England]]: [[University of Oxford |Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge |Cambridge]] (collectively termed [[Oxbridge]]), are [[federation]]s of [[autonomous]] colleges. While many of the [[Student Affairs]] functions are housed in the colleges, each college is more than a [[residence hall]].

In addition to [[dwelling|accommodation]], [[meal]]s, [[Junior Common Room|common room]]s, [[libraries]], [[sport]]ing and social facilities for its students, each college admits students to the University and, through [[tutorial]]s or supervisions, contributes to the work of educating them.

The [[Faculty (university)|faculties]] at each university provide [[lecture]]s, central facilities such as libraries and laboratories, and examines for and awards degrees. Academic staff are commonly employed both by the university (typically as [[lecturer]] or [[professor]]) and by a college (as [[fellow]] or [[tutor]]), though some may have only a college or university post. Nearly all colleges cater to students studying a range of school, and the most critical situation is in the mining zone of Choco, Bolivar, and Sucre.

Economic consequences of privatization and liberal institutions have meant changes in taxation to attract foreign investment. Colombia will lose another $800 million over the next ninety years that [[Glencore International]] operates in El [[Cerrejon]] Zona Media, if the company continues to produce coal at a rate of 5 million tons/year, because of the reduction of the royalty tax from 10-15% to .04%. If the company, as is plausible, doubles or triples its production, the losses will be proportionally greater. The operational losses from the three large mining projects ([[El Cerrejon]], [[La Loma]], operated by Drummond, and [[Montelibano]], which produces [[ferronickel]]) for Colombia to more than 12 billion. Just $10 billion would be enough to provide employment for Colombia's three million unemployed, to save the lives of the up to 160 children who die daily of [[hunger]], [[malnutrition]] and [[curable diseases]], and to have avoided the closing of over 20 hospitals around the country, which has created a [[humanitarian emergency]] in the poorest sectors of the population.

Coal production has grown rapidly, from 22.7 million tons in 1994 to 50.0 million tons in 2003.{{ref|coalprod}}  Over 90% of this amount was exported, making Colombia the world's sixth largest coal exporter, behind [[Australia]], [[China]], [[Indonesia]], [[South Africa]] and [[Russia]].{{ref|coalworld}}  From the mid-1980s the center of coal production was the [[Cerrejón]] mines in the [[Guajira_Department|Guajira]] department.  However, the growth in output at [[La Loma, Cesar|La Loma]] in neighboring [[Cesar_Department|Cesar]] mean that this department has been the leader in coal production since 2004.  Production in other departments, including [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]], [[Cundinamarca]] and [[Norte de Santander]], forms about 13% of the total.  The coal industry is largely controlled by international mining companies, including a consortium of [[BHP Billiton]], [[Anglo American]] and [[Glencore International]] at Cerrejón, and [[Drummond Company]] at La Loma, which is undergoing a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Alabama for union assassinations and alleged paramilitary links.

While Colombia has vast hydroelectric potential, a prolonged drought in 1992 forced severe electricity rationing throughout the country until mid-1993. The consequences of the drought on electricity-generating capacity caused the government to commission the construction or upgrading of 10 [[thermoelectric]] power plants. Half will be coal-fired, and half will be fired by [[natural gas]]. The government also has begun awarding bids for the construction of a natural gas pipeline system that will extend from the country's extensive gas fields to its major population centers. Plans call for this project to make natural gas available to millions of Colombian households by the middle of the next decade.

As of 2004, Colombia has become a net energy exporter, exporting electricity to [[Ecuador]] and developing connections to [[Perú]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Panama]] to export to those markets as well. A pipeline connecting western Venezuela to Panama through Colombia is also under construction, thanks to cooperation between presidents [[Alvaro Uribe]] of Colombia and [[Hugo Chávez]] of Venezuela.

==Trade==
Colombia's estimated balance of trade showed a surplus $910 million in 1999, up from a $3.8 billion deficit in 1998. Total 1999 imports were $10.6 billion, while exports were $11.5 billion. Estimated 2000 imports were $11.2 billion with $14.0 exports. Colombia's major exports continue to be petroleum, coffee, coal, nickel, gold and nontraditional exports (e.g., cut flowers, semiprecious stones, sugar, and tropical fruits).

The United States remained Colombia's major trading partner in 1999, taking 48.5% of exports and providing 42.1% of imports. The EU and Japan also are important trading partners, as are [[Andean Pact]] countries.

==Foreign Investment==
In 1990, to attract foreign investors and promote trade, an experiment from the [[IMF]] known as &quot;la apertura&quot; was adopted by the government as an open trade strategy. Although the analysis of the results are not clear, the fact is that the agricultural sector was severely impacted by this policy.

In 1991 and 1992, the government passed laws to stimulate foreign investment in nearly all sectors of the economy. The only activities closed to foreign direct investment are defense and national security, disposal of hazardous wastes, and real estate--the last of these restrictions is intended to hinder money laundering. Colombia established a special entity--CoInvertir--to assist foreigners in making investments in the country. Foreign investment flows for 1999 were $4.4 billion, down from $4.8 billion in 1998.

Major foreign investment projects underway include the $6 billion development of the Cusiana and Cupiagua oil fields, development of coal fields in the north of the country, and the recently concluded licensing for establishment of cellular telephone service. The United States accounted for 26.5% of the total $19.4 billion stock of nonpetroleum foreign direct investment in Colombia at the end of 1998.

On [[October 21]] [[1995]], under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), President Clinton signed an Executive Order barring U.S. entities from any commercial or financial transactions with four Colombian drug kingpins and with individuals and companies associated with the traffic in narcotics, as designated by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General. The list of designated individuals and companies is amended periodically and is maintained by the Office of Foreign Asset Control at the Department of the Treasury, tel. (202) 622-0077 (ask for Document #1900). The document also is available at [http:/www.ustreas.gov the Department of Treasury web site].

Colombia is the United States' fifth-largest export market in Latin America--behind Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina--and the 26th-largest market for U.S. products worldwide. The United States is Colombia's principal trading partner, with two-way trade from November 1999 through November 2000 exceeding $9.5 billion--$3.5 billion U.S. exports and $6.0 billion U.S. imports. Colombia benefits from duty-free entry--for a 10-year period, through 2001--for certain of its exports to the United States under the Andean Trade Preferences Act. Colombia improved protection of intellectual property rights through the adoption of three Andean Pact decisions in 1993 and 1994, but the U.S. remains concerned over deficiencies in licensing, patent regulations, and copyright protection.

The petroleum and natural gas coal mining, chemical, and manufacturing industries attract the greatest U.S. investment interest. U.S. investment accounted for 37.8% ($4.2 billion) of the total $11.2 billion in foreign direct investment at the end of 1997, excluding petroleum and portfolio investment. Worker rights and benefits in the U.S.-dominated sectors are more favorable than general working conditions. Examples include shorter-than-average working hours, higher wages, and compliance with health and safety standards above the national average.

'''Industry and Agriculture'''&lt;br&gt;
The most industrially diverse member of the five-nation Andean Community, Colombia has four major industrial centers--Bogota, Medellin, Cali, and Barranquilla, each located in a distinct geographical region. Colombia's industries include textiles and clothing, leather products, processed foods and beverages, paper and paper products, chemicals and petrochemicals, cement, construction, iron and steel products, and metalworking. Its diverse climate and topography permit the cultivation of a wide variety of crops. In addition, all regions yield forest products, ranging from tropical hardwoods in the hot country to pine and eucalyptus in the colder areas.

[[Cacao]], [[sugarcane]], [[coconut]]s, [[banana]]s, [[plantain]]s, [[rice]], [[cotton]], [[tobacco]], [[cassava]], and most of the nation's beef cattle are produced in the hot regions from sea level to 1,000 meters elevation. The temperate regions -- between 1,000 and 2,000 meters -- are better suited for [[coffee]]; certain flowers; [[maize]] and other vegetables; and fruits such as [[citrus]], [[pear]]s, [[pineapple]]s, and [[tomato]]es. The cooler elevations -- between 2,000 and 3,000 meter -- produce [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[potato]]es, cold-climate vegetables, flowers, [[dairy]] cattle, and [[poultry]].

==Statistics==
'''Economy - overview:'''
Colombia's economy has been on a recovery trend during the past two years despite a serious armed conflict. The economy continues to improve thanks to austere government budgets, focused efforts to reduce public debt levels, and an export-oriented growth focus. Ongoing economic problems facing President Uribe range from reforming the pension system to reducing high unemployment. New exploration is needed to offset declining oil production. On the positive side, several international financial institutions have praised the economic reforms introduced by URIBE, succeeded in reducing the public-sector deficit below 1.5% of GDP. The government's economic policy and democratic security strategy have engendered a growing sense of confidence in the economy, particularly within the business sector. Coffee prices have recovered from previous lows as the Colombian coffee industry pursues greater market shares in developed countries such as the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Colombia''''s [[Ministry of Defense of Colombia|Ministry of Defense]], charged with the country's internal and external defense and security, has an [[Army]], [[Navy]] (which includes both [[marines]] and [[coast guard]]) [[Air Force]], and National [[Police]] under the leadership of a [[civilian]] Minister of Defense. In [[1999]], Colombia assigned 3.6% of its GDP to defense, according to the National Planning Department. The armed forces number about 250,000 uniformed personnel: 145,000 military and 105,000 police. These figures do not include assistance personnel such as cooks, medics, mechanics, etc. Many Colombian military personnel have received training in the [[United States]] or in Colombia. The United States has provided equipment to the Colombian military and police through the military assistance program, foreign military sales, and the international narcotics control program.

[[Narcotics decertification]] in [[1996]] forced a temporary halt to U.S. military assistance programs, except for those related to counternarcotics. On August 1, [[1997]], the U.S. and Colombia signed an [[End Use Monitoring]] (EUM) memorandum of understanding which stipulated that U.S. counternarcotics assistance to the Colombian military be conditioned on [[human rights]] screening of proposed recipient units. Once equipment is provided, it continues to be subject to end-use monitoring to ensure it is being used for counternarcotics purposes.

U.S. assistance to Colombian military and police forces is provided strictly in accordance with Section 564 of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act (Public Law 106-113) and with Section 8098 of Department of Defense Appropriations Act (Public Law 106-79). No assistance is provided to any unit of the security forces for which the U.S. Government has credible evidence of commission of gross violations of human rights, unless the [[Secretary of State of the United States|Secretary of State]] is able to certify that the Government of Colombia has taken effective measures to bring those responsible to justice. End-use monitoring also is required in these cases.

Since 2000 the Ministry of Defense (Ministerio de Defensa) and the Joint Staff Command (Comando General de las Fuerzas Militares) started a program to overhaul and improve the performance of the military branches (Army, Navy and Air Force) it was the result of an study (1998-1999) suggesting to improve the military mobility, personnel training and internal organization to allow more flexibility.  It is also known that increasing use of [[Special Forces]] such as [[AFEUR]] (Urban Warfare/CounterTerrorism Units), [[Lancero]] units (Jungle Warfare/[[Ranger]] like) is suggested by the study.

In addition to its own domestic needs, Colombia also provides troops to international [[peacekeeping]] efforts, most notably the [[Multinational Force and Observers]], to whom it has provided a full [[infantry]] [[battalion]] since [[1982]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the '''[[history]] of [[Colombia]]'''. See also [[history of South America]] and the [[history of present-day nations and states]].

== Pre-Colombian period ==

The two main linguistic groups that dominated the territory now known as Colombia during the pre-Colombian period were the [[Carib]] and the [[Chibcha]].  They possessed different organizational structures and distinct languages and cultures. In upper Magdalene region, from 5th to 8th century, many tumuli with scuptures were raised in [[San Agustin Archaeological Park|San Agustin]].The region now occupied by the city of [[Bogotá]] was inhabited by the [[Muisca]]. The Muisca based their social organization on trade. They exchanged [[salt]], [[emeralds]], [[beans]], [[maize]] and other crops with other [[Chibchan]] tribes such as the [[Chitareros]], [[Guanes]] and [[Laches]].

==Colonial times==

The [[Spain|Spanish]] sailed along the north coast of today's Colombia as early as [[1500]], but their first permanent settlement, at Santa Marta, was not established until [[1525]]. In [[1549]], the institution of the [[Audiencia]] in Santa Fe de [[Bogotá]], gave that city the status of capital of the [[New Granada]], it included most of the provinces of what makes up the territory of Colombia. In [[1717]] the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] was originally created, and then it was temporarily removed, to finally be reestablished in [[1739]]. The [[chemistry|chemical]] production, [[electronics]], transportation equipment, [[textile]]s, [[glass]], brewing, china, [[ceramic]]s, and [[pharmaceutical]]s. It's main agricultural products are [[sugarbeet]]s, [[fodder root]]s, [[potato]]es, [[wheat]], and [[hops]].

The &quot;[[Velvet Revolution]]&quot; in [[1989]] offered a chance for profound and sustained economic reform. Signs of economic resurgence began to appear in the wake of the shock therapy that the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) labelled the &quot;big bang&quot; of January 1991. Since then, astute economic management has led to the liberalization of 95% of all price controls, annual inflation in the 10% range, modest [[budget deficit]]s, low [[unemployment]], a positive [[balance of payments]] position, a stable [[exchange rate]], a shift of exports from former [[Eastern bloc|communist economic bloc]] markets to [[Western Europe]], and relatively low [[foreign debt]].

Particularly impressive have been the Republic's strict [[fiscal policy|fiscal policies]]. Following a series of currency [[devaluation]]s, the [[koruna|crown]] has remained stable in relation to the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]]. The Czech crown became fully [[convertibility|convertible]] for most business purposes in late [[1995]].

In addition, the government has revamped the legal and administrative structure governing [[investment]] in order to stimulate the economy and attract foreign partners. Shifting emphasis from the East to the West has necessitated restructuring existing facilities in banking and telecommunications as well as adjusting commercial laws and practices to fit Western standards. The republic has made progress toward creating a stable investment climate.

This success has enabled the Czech Republic to become the first post-communist country to receive an investment-grade credit rating by international credit institutions. Successive Czech governments have welcomed [[United States of America|U.S.]] investment, in particular, as a counter-balance to the strong economic influence of Western Europe, especially of their powerful neighbour, [[Germany]]. &lt;!-- Which was not always successful, see the flop with Boeing vs Aero Vodochody. --&gt; Although [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) runs in uneven cycles, with a 12.9% share of total FDI between 1990 and March 1998, the U.S. was the third-largest foreign investor in the Czech economy, behind Germany and the [[Netherlands]].

The republic boasts a flourishing consumer production sector and has [[privatization|privatized]] most state-owned heavy industries through the [[voucher privatization]] system. Under the system, every citizen was given the opportunity to buy, for a moderate price, a book of vouchers that represents potential shares in any state-owned company. The voucher holders could then invest their vouchers, infusing the chosen company with valuable capital. State ownership of businesses was estimated to be about 97% under [[communism]]. In [[1998]], more than 80% of enterprises are in private hands. When the voucher privatization process is complete, Czechs will own shares of each of the Czech companies, making them one of the highest per capita share owners in the world. Privatization through restitution of real estate to the former owners was largely completed in 1992.&lt;!-- The voucher privatization is already finished. Some people think it was a flop. Shouldn't it be reflected here? --&gt;

The republic's economic transformation is far from complete. A recession in 1998 revealed that the government still faces serious challenges in completing industrial restructuring, increasing [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]] in [[capital market]] transactions, fully [[privatization|privatizing]] the [[banking]] sector, transforming the [[housing]] sector, privatizing the [[health care]] system, and solving serious environmental problems.

'''Economy - overview:'''
Political and financial crises in [[1997]] shattered the Czech Republic's image as one of the most stable and prosperous of post-Communist states. Delays in enterprise restructuring and failure to develop a well-functioning capital market played major roles in Czech economic troubles, which culminated in a currency crisis in May. The currency was forced out of its fluctuation band as investors worried that the current account deficit, which reached nearly 8% of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] in [[1996]], would become unsustainable. After expending $3 [[billion]] (3 G$) in vain to support the currency, the central bank let it float. The growing current account imbalance reflected a surge in domestic demand and poor export performance, as wage increases outpaced productivity. The government was forced to introduce two [[austerity]] packages later in the spring (called vernacularly &quot;The Packages&quot;), which cut government spending by 2.5% of [[gross domestic product]]. Growth dropped to 0.3% in 1997, -2.3% in 1998, and -0.5% in 1999. The basic transition problem continues to be too much direct and indirect government influence on the privatized economy. The government established a restructuring agency in 1999 and launched a revitalization program - to spur the sale of firms to foreign companies. Key priorities include accelerating legislative convergence with [[European Union|EU]] norms, restructuring enterprises, and privatizing banks and utilities. The economy, fuelled by increased export growth and investment, is expected to recover in 2000.

The '''Czech Armed Forces''' ([[Czech Language|Czech]]: ''Armáda České republiky'') consists of Land and [[Czech air force|Air Forces]] and of specialized support units. Being a member of [[NATO]] since [[1999]], the [[Czech Republic]] completes a major overhaul of the extensive [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] armed forces which until [[1989]] formed one of the pillars of the [[Warsaw Pact]] military alliance. Czech forces have been gradually downsized from 200,000 to 35,000 and at the same time modernized and reoriented toward defensive posture. In year [[2004]] the army transformed into fully professional organization and compulsory military service has been ended. 

==Structure==

The structure of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic is as follows:
*The Army 
**Joint Forces
***Joint Forces Command
***Land Forces
***[[Czech Air Force|Air Force]]
***Joint Forces Support Units
**Support and Training Forces
*The Military Office of President of the Republic
*The [[Prague Castle|Castle]] Guard

==Recent operations==

The Czech Republic is a member of the [[United Nations|UN]] and [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] and has contributed to numerous peacekeeping operations, including [[IFOR]]/[[SFOR]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina | Bosnia]], [[Desert Shield]]/[[Desert Storm]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Kosovo]] and Iraq.

Current deployments (as of 2005):

*[[Kosovo]]: NATO Operation &quot;Joint Enterprise&quot; ([[KFOR]]) - 500 soldiers
*[[Iraq]]:  Coalition Operation of Multinational Forces - 96 soldiers
*[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]: European Union Operation (ALTHEA) - 65 soldiers
*[[Afghanistan]]: NATO Operation ([[ISAF]]) - 17 soldiers

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of the Czech Republic}}
Until [[1989]], the foreign policy of Czechoslovakia had followed that of the [[Soviet Union]]. Since independence, the Czechs have made integration with Western institutions their chief foreign policy objective.

Fundamental to this objective is Czech membership in the [[European Union]]. The Czech Republic became a member of the [[EU]] in May [[2004]]. This followed signature of the Treaty of Accession with nine other candidate nations in [[1993]]. Although there have been disagreements with established EU member nations over some economic issues, such as agricultural quotas and a recent amendment to the gaming law, relations are good.

The Czech Republic is a member of the [[United Nations]] and participates in its specialized agencies. It is a member of the [[General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs]]. It maintains diplomatic relations with more than 85 countries, of which 63 have permanent representation in Prague. The Czech Republic became a member of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]], along with Poland and Hungary, on [[12 March]] [[1999]]. This membership represents a milestone in the country's foreign policy and security orientation.

:''Climber'' is also a synonym for [[vine]].

'''Climbing''' is going up, or, depending on context, also down. It may refer to [[aircraft]], a land [[vehicle]], and [[human]]s and other [[animal]]s. On land, in particular it refers to steep climbs, e.g. on a [[hill]], [[mountain]] or [[stairs]], in a pole or [[tree]], etc. This article covers climbing without a vehicle.

== Types of climbing ==
'''By terrain:'''
* Rock climbing is climbing on steep rocky terrain.
* [[Mountaineering]] is climbing on [[mountain]]s.
* [[Ice climbing]] is climbing on frozen [[water]] features.
* Mixed climbing is climbing on both frozen water features, as in [[ice climbing]], as well as rocky  terrain.
* [[Bouldering]] is [[solo climbing]] on [[boulder]]s.
* Stack climbing is climbing [[sea stack]]s: near vertical columns of rock in the sea, near coasts.
* [[Buildering]] (pun on bouldering) is climbing on the outside of buildings.
* [[Indoor climbing]] is climbing on artificial [[climbing wall]]s.
* [[Artificial climbing tower]] is a wooden or steel [[climbing wall]] used outdoors.
* [[Recreational tree climbing]] is climbing on [[tree]]s.
* Professional [[tree climbing]] is climbing on [[tree]]s for the purpose of hardware installation, pruning, or removal.

'''By method of ascent:'''
* In [[aid climbing]], all means of ascent are used, from pulling on gear to climbing rope ladders attached to drilled bolts.
* In [[free climbing]], climbers use only their hands, feet and other body parts to make progress. Ropes and other gear are only used for protection.

'''By type of protection:'''
* In [[traditional climbing]] (commonly referred to as &quot;trad climbing&quot;) the leader places all protection. The [[climbing system]] is used to protect the climber against the consequences of a fall.
* [[Sport climbing]] is climbing on routes that are protected mostly or entirely by [[bolt (climbing)|bolt]]s drilled into the rock.
* [[Top-rope climbing]] uses a rope passed through an anchor at the top of the climb. 
* [[Solo climbing]] is climbing without a partner. It can be done with a rope for protection (&quot;roped solo&quot;) or without any form of protection at all (&quot;free-soloing&quot;). [[Deep-water soloing]] relies on water at the base of the climb to protect against injury. 
*[[Bouldering]] relies on a partner (a &quot;spotter&quot;) and a [[Crash pad|bouldering mat]] to avoid injury.

[[Image:Calico Hills climbing.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Short (one-pitch) climbs on the Calico Hills, west of Las Vegas, Nevada]]

== Competitions ==
Competitions (&quot;comps&quot;) are usually held indoors on purpose built [[climbing wall]]s.  There are three main categories.
* Difficulty: competitors climb the same route one after the other. The winner is the one who reaches the highest point on the climb; if several competitors reach the top (or the same high point) the time taken may be used to determine the winner.  Alternatively, some difficulty competitions involve a number of routes. Each route is assigned a point value based on difficulty.  Competitors climb as many routes as they want, and their score is derived from their top few completed routes (with the exact number of routes differing between competitions).  If a tie-breaker is needed, the numbers of &quot;falls&quot; (attempts) is counted.  Some competitions limit the number of attempts, others do not.

* Speed: on two identical routes, competitors race each other to the top. The first to reach the top wins.

* Bouldering: Competitors work through a series of boulder problems on either a time limit, or an attempt limit for each problem. Points are awarded for completing each problem. In a tie-break situation or where limited attempts are allowed then points are awarded for the fewest number of attempts required to complete the problem. Bouldering competitions at higher levels usually have ''[[Isolation (climbing competitions)|isolation]]'' to ensure that the competitors cannot see the problems before climbing them.

Sometimes climbers must climb the route ''[[climbing on sight|on sight]]''. This means that they are not allowed to see other climbers on the route, or receive any form of advice (beta) from other climbers, and have only a limited amount of time to visually inspect the route from ground level. (Otherwise later climbers would be able to learn from previous competitors' mistakes, giving them a considerable advantage.)

In addition to competitions, festivals such as the [[Phoenix Boulder Blast]] and the[[ International Climbing Festival]] (held in [[Lander, Wyoming]]) are a gathering place for rock climbers from around the world. They feature trade shows for climbing specific merchandise, clinics from world-renowned climbers, and parties.

== Grading ==
Climbers grade the difficulty of the routes they climb. The [[grade (climbing)|grading system]] used varies from country to country (and region) and according to the style of climb.  See also [[grade (bouldering)]]. Grade opinions can vary from person to person. This phenomenon can be seen frequently in climbing gyms where grading will vary vastly between gyms.

Different forms of grading are also used for mountaineering and bouldering. There is no common bouldering grading technique yet.

== Climbing techniques of animals ==

Many animals have developed excellent climbing techniques. Some animals, such as [[gecko]]es, can walk up and down vertical walls and even walk on ceilings without any problems. But some other animals have the same problem as humans in that climbing down is more difficult than climbing up, because backwards movements are required. The best known example are [[cat]]s, which have to be rescued sometimes from trees, because they cannot climb down from them.

== Climbing and the law ==

Rock climbing is not necessarily allowed on any given rock formation.  The regulations vary from place to place but [[trespass]] laws are the most common impediment to climbing.  Even where physical access is not an issue, climbing might not be allowed due to public [[liability]id not have an [[income tax]] until [[1991]], making it an attractive haven for high earners fleeing the heavy taxes of [[New York State]], but putting an enormous burden on Connecticut [[property tax]] payers, particularly in the cities with their more extensive [[municipal services]]. As a result, the [[middle class]] largely fled the urban areas for the [[suburb]]s, taking stores and other tax-paying businesses with them, and leaving only the [[urban poor]] in the now impoverished Connecticut cities. As evident from the dichotomy in income figures described above, this problem has yet to be successfully solved. Exacerbating this problem, the state has a very high cost of living, due to a combination of expensive real estate, expensive heating for the winters, the need to import much food from warmer states, and the dependence on private automobiles for mobility. 

While Connecticut is home to four poor cities (Bridgeport, Hartford, New Haven and Waterbury), the state in general is extremely wealthy. Surrounding these four cities are some of the wealthiest areas on the globe, and many visitors of the state note the lack of middle class. This is due to the exodus of the middle class, as homes in the suburbs start around $450,000, and the further south in the state, the more expensive. In southern Connecticut, a three bedroom home on 1/4 acre will run about $1 million. Connecticut has the highest amount of million-dollar plus homes in the country.

The agricultural output for the state is [[Nursery (horticulture)|nursery stock]], [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[dairy product]]s, [[cattle]], and [[tobacco#shade tobacco|tobacco]]. Its industrial outputs are [[transport|transportation]] equipment (especially [[helicopters]], [[aircraft]] parts, and [[nuclear submarine]]s), heavy industrial machinery and electrical equipment, [[fabricated metal product]]s, [[chemical]] and [[pharmaceutical]] products, and [[scientific instrument]]s.

==History of Connecticut industry==
Connecticut began, as most communities at the time, as a [[farm]]ing economy. It rapidly developed trade and manufacturing as the farmers, and then the merchants and manufacturers themselves, became affluent enough to start buying things. Manufacturing was aided by a plenitude of resources, including water power, wood for fires and building material, and iron ore, while transportation benefited from several excellent natural harbors, and navigable rivers leading all the way to Massachusetts. As in most of New England, the residents believed that industry, in all senses of the word, not only strengthened individual moral fiber, but also served to make the colony independent and free to pursue its own religious and philosophical beliefs. While manual labor was valued, learning and study was also prized and many schools were founded, with [[Yale University]] the most significant. The development by [[Eli Whitney]] of the system of precision manufacturing of interchangeable parts and the [[assembly line]] in the late [[1700s]], however made Connecticut into a major center of manufacturing. This development changed &quot;made in the United States&quot; from a phrase connoting shoddy workmanship and expensive maintenance, into a world standard for high quality, and the entire system became known as the [[American system of manufacturing]].

Between [[1800]] and [[1860]], Connecticut manufacturers applied the system to the manufacture of economically priced high quality firearms, leading to Connecticut's nickname &quot;the [[arsenal]] of [[democracy]].&quot; [[Middletown, Connecticut]] was the major supplier of [[pistol]]s to the United States government during the [[War of 1812]], with numerous gun manufacturers in the area. In [[1810]], [[Oliver Bidwell]] built the first [[pistol]] factory in the United States on the [[Pameacha River]] in Middletown, winning a contract with the United States [[war department]] for handmade pistols. Also in 1810, Colonel [[Simeon North]] built a pistol factory in Middletown on the West River, now the [[Coginchaug River]], also winning a contract from the [[secretary of war]], which led to enlarging his factory to 8,500 square feet (790 m²); he built about 10,000 pistols a year, up until just before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], designing America's first [[milling machine]]. Even more successful was Colonel [[Nathan Starr Jr.]], whose factory (built of stone quarried from the river) was about the same size as North's, and located across the river half a mile northeast. Starr initially manufactured [[sword]]s, about 5,000 a year; including presentation swords for the state of [[Tennessee]] and [[War of 1812]] heroes, colonel [[Richard M. Johnson]], General [[Edmond P. Gaines]], and General [[Andrew Jackson]]. The factory later manufactured [[musket]]s and rifles until [[1845]], after which the United States government started government [[Armory (military)|armories]] in [[Massachusetts]] and [[West Virginia]] partially modeled after Starr's. In [[1812]], [[John R. Johnson]] and [[J. D. Johnson]] built a factory, also on the Pameacha River, which was to sell rifles to the government until [[1825]]. After this period, firearm manufacturing declined in Middletown, but briefly revived during the Civil War. The [[Savage Revolving Fire Arm Company]] manufactured pistols between [[1859]] and [[1866]], and the [[Sage Ammunition Works]] manufactured ammunition between [[1864]] and [[1867]].

In [[1836]], [[Samuel Colt]] invented the [[revolver]] design which continues to be used to this day. [[Colt's Manufacturing Company]] hired [[Elisha K. Root]] to modernize production, making Colt weapons the first in the world with truly interchangeable parts. [[Horace Smith (inventor)|Horace Smith]] and [[Daniel B. Wesson]] designed the first [[repeating rifle]] in [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]] in the early [[1850s]], which went into production by the [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became the [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company]]), and, just across the border in [[Massachusetts]], the [[Springfield Armory]]. Smith also patented a metallic rifle [[Cartridge (weaponry)|cartridge]] in [[1854]]. [[Christian Sharps]] designed the Sharps [[breech-loading]] rifle which in [[1854]] began to be manufactured in Hartford by the [[Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company]]. [[Christopher Spencer]] designed the [[Spencer repeating rifle]] which played an important role for [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].

Another area where precision manufacture led to industrial dominance for Connecticut was in the manufacture of [[clock]]s, [[watch]]es, and other [[timepiece]]s, by [[Eli Terry]] and his apprentice [[Seth Thomas]], the [[Forestville Manufacturing Company]] (which became the [[E. N. Welch Company]]), the [[New England Clock Company]], the [[Ansonia Clock Company]], [[Gilbert Clocks]], [[Ingraham Clocks]], the [[New Haven Clock Company]], [[Welch Clocks]], [[Sessions Clocks]], and the [[Waterbury Clock Company]], which became [[Timex Corporation]], and is the sole Connecticut survivor of this once flourishing field, now decimated by lower costs of production elsewhere, in the United States and overseas. The [[American Clock and Watch Museum]] is located in [[Bristol, Connecticut]].

Similarly, Connecticut industry became well known in allied fields. [[Hardware]] and [[tool]]s continue to be manufactured by [[Stanley Corporation]] in [[New Britain]], despite having almost moved elsewhere for financial reasons. Connecticut was a major area for development and manufacture of [[machine tool]]s. In [[1818]], [[Simeon North]] designed America's first [[milling machine]]. Machinist Elisha Root first designed machinery for the [[Collins Company]] of [[Collinsville]] which manufactured [[axe]]s which became world-famous, then was hired by Colt in [[1849]] to modernize firearm production by designing precision [[drop hammer]]s, [[boring machine]]s, [[gauge]]s, [[jig]]s, etc., and improving the milling machines designed by [[Francis A. Pratt]] for the [[George S. Lincoln]] company in Hartford; the resulting [[Lincoln Miller]] became world-famous, selling over 150,000 machines. Another Colt engineer, [[William Mason (Colt)|William Mason]], patented 125 inventions for manufacture of firearms, as well as steam pumps and power looms. [[Christopher Spencer]] invented the [[automatic lathe turret]] for machining screws, as well as the variable cam cylinder used to control the turret. [[Francis A. Pratt]] and [[Amos Whitney]] invented a thread milling machine in [[1865]]; Whitney also perfected various measurement instruments and Pratt designed the original milling machine manufactured by the [[George S. Lincoln]] company of Hartford. [[Simon Fairman]] invented the [[lathe chuck]] in [[West Stafford]] in [[1830]], and his son-in-law, [[Austin F. Cushman]], invented the self-centering [[Cushman Universal Chuck]] in [[1862]]. [[Edward P. Bullard]] designed the [[vertical boring mill]] in [[1883]]. [[Charles E. Billings]] perfected the [[drop hammer]] for [[metal forging]] in the [[1870s]] and designed the copper [[commutator]] central to the operation of electrical [[generator]]s and [[motor]]s. [[Edwin R. Fellows]] of [[Torrington]] designed the first [[flat turret lathe]], and in [[1896]] built a gear shaper which permitted the manufacture of effective and reliable gear transmissions for the soon-to-come automobile industry. The name [[Bridgeport]] on heavy [[industrial machinery]] continues to be a guarantee of high quality around the world, for people who have no idea that it is a city in Connecticut. Even the world of toys was dominated by the [[A. C. Gilbert Company]], manufacturers of [[Erector Set]]s as well as other educational toys such as [[chemistry set]]s, [[microscope]]s, [[toy train]]s, etc.

Another area of industry where Connecticut excelled was in [[bicycle]] manufacturing, and its spin-off, the earliest [[automobile manufacturing]]. [[Albert Pope]] of Hartford saw a bicycle in [[Philadelphia]] in [[1876]] and was immediately enthralled with the concept of an &quot;ever-saddled horse that eats nothing and requires no care.&quot; He subsequently began the first bicycle manufacturing in America, [[Columbia Bicycles]], and set about marketing the vehicle, setting up a system of distributorships with fixed prices, hiring doctors to tout cycling as healthy exercise, and founding cycling magazines. When the [[safety bicycle]] was developed in the [[1880s]], he was in a perfect position to benefit from the subsequent craze.

Connecticut also became an innovative leader in the [[shipbuilding]] industry. The first recorded [[steam power]]ed boat in America was built by [[South Windsor, Connecticut|South Windsor]]'s [[John Fitch (inventor)|John Fitch]] in [[1786]]. The first military [[submarine]], the [[Turtle (submarine)|Turtle]], was built in Connecticut in [[1775]] by [[David Bushnell]]; since then, Connecticut has remained a world leader in the manufacture of these specialized ships. [[Simon Lake]] produced submarines for the US Navy in Bridgeport, beginning in [[1913]], and the work done by [[John P. Holland]] led to submarine production by the [[Electric Boat Company]] in [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] beginning in [[1924]], which continues to this day.

In the late [[1700s]], the Connecticut government engaged in financial incentives for building and operating [[textile]] mills.

Between the birth of the U.S. [[patent]] system in [[1790]] and [[1930]], Connecticut had more patents issued per capita than any other state; in the [[1800s]], when the U.S. as a whole was issued one patent per three thousand population, Connecticut inventors were issued one patent for every 700&amp;ndash;1000 residents. Connecticut's first recorded invention was a [[lapidary]] machine, by [[Abel Buell]] of [[Killingworth]], in [[1765]].

The Connecticut Valley ([[Wethersfield]], [[East Windsor]], and [[Colchester]]) was a center of [[cabinetmaking]] and [[furniture]] construction in the latter half of the [[1700s]]. Beginning in the [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne]] style, by the end of the period the furniture had evolved into four distinct variations of the [[Chippendale]] style; that of [[Eliphalet Chapin]], one of the masters of the craft, who tended to produce pieces which were more compact and chunky in appearance, incorporating some of the [[Philadelphia]] [[rococo]] style without as much fussiness; that of the [[Colchester, Connecticut|Colchester]]/[[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]] area, exemplified by [[Samuel Loomis]], as well as those of the [[Wethersfield]] and [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]]&amp;ndash;[[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]] areas.

As of 2005, Connecticut has an estimated population of 3,510,297, which is an increase of 11,331, or 0.3%, from the prior year and an increase of 104,695, or 3.1%, since the year 2000.  This includes a natural increase since the last census of 67,427 people (that is 222,222 births minus 154,795 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 41,718 people into the state.  Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 75,991 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of 34,273 people.

As of 2004, 11.4% of the population (400,000) was foreign-born, and 10% of the foreign-born in the state were illegal aliens (about 1.1% of the population).

=== Race / Ethnicity ===
The racial / ethnic makeup of Connecticut:
*77.5% [[White (people)|White]] non-Hispanic
*9.4% [[Hispanic]]
*9.1% [[Black (people)|Black]]
*2.4% [[Asian American|Asian]]
*0.3% [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]
*2.2% [[Mixed race]]

=== Languages ===
As of 2000, 81.7% of Connecticut residents age 5 and older speak [[English language|English]] at home and 8.4% speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. [[Italian language|Italian]] is the third most spoken language at 1.6%, followed by [[French language|French]] at 1.6% and [[Polish language|Polish]] at 1.2%.

=== Ancestry ===
The five largest reported ancestries in the state are: [[Italian-American|Italian]] (18.6%), [[Ireland|Irish]] (16.6%), [[British-American|English]] (10.3%), [[German-American|German]] (9.9%), [[African American]] (9.1%).

Connecticut has a large [[Italian-American]] population, although residents of British, Irish, German, and other ancestries are also present, with old-stock Americans being the largest percentage of the population in the eastern part of the state. Italian is the largest ancestry group in five of the state's counties, while the Irish are the largest group in Tolland county, French-Canadians the largest group in Windham county, and old stock New England Yankees are present throughout. Connecticut is the second most Italian-American state percentage-wise, after Rhode Island. Blacks and Hispanics (mostly Puerto Ricans) are numerous in the urban areas of the state.

6.6% of its population was reported as being under 5 years old, 24.7% under 18 years old, and 13.8% were 65 years of age or older. Females made up approximately 51.6% of the population, with 48.4% male.

=== Religion ===
The religious affiliations of the people of Connecticut are:

*[[Christianity|Christian]] &amp;ndash; 83%
**[[Protestantism|Protestant]] &amp;ndash; 48%
***[[Baptist]] &amp;ndash; 10%
***[[Episcopal]] &amp;ndash; 6%
***[[Methodism|Methodist]] &amp;ndash; 4%

*[[Judaism|Jewish]] &amp;ndash; 3%
*Other Religions &amp;ndash; 1%
*Non-Religious &amp;ndash; 13%

There is a significant [[Jewish]] population in the state, mostly concentrated in the &quot;Gold Coast&quot; towns between [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and in the [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] suburb of [[West Hartford, Connecticut|West Hartford]]. New Haven once had a significant Jewish population, but it has mostly moved elsewhere, although there is still a large concentration in the suburban towns west of New Haven. Recent immigration has brought other non-Christian religions to the state, but the numbers of adherents of other religions are still low.

== September 11, 2001 ==
Connecticut was particularly hard-hit on [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] as many of the state's residents work in New York City. Over five-hundred people from Connecticut were killed, most of them from the southwestern area of the state. Many schools in Connecticut closed for the day because of the number of students who had parents who worked in New York City. By nightfall, [[Metro-North Railroad|train stations]] in Greenwich, Fairfield, Westport, Seymour and Danbury still had full parking lots, giving residents a fearful sense of reality to the number of people who were missing.

However, an expensive investment in an all-new full-size lineup went largely to waste as the new 1974 vehicles appeared almost precisely as [[gasoline]] prices reached a peak and large-car sales collapsed; that same year marked the end of Barracuda production — 10 years to the day. At mid-decade, the company scored a conspicuous success with its first entry in the [[personal luxury car]] market, the [[Chrysler Cordoba]]. However, the introduction of the [[Dodge Aspen]]/[[Plymouth Volare]] twins in 1976 did not repeat the success of the discontinued Valiant/[[Dodge Dart]] line, and the company had delayed in producing an entry in the now all-important subcompact market. Problems were mutliplying abroad as well, as Chrysler Europe essentially collapsed in 1977. It was offloaded to [[Peugeot]] the following year, ironically just after having helped design the new [[Plymouth Horizon]] and [[Dodge Omni]], on which the increasingly-desperate company was pinning its hopes. Shortly thereafter, [[Chrysler Australia]], which was now producing a [[badge engineering|rebadged]] [[Japan]]ese [[Mitsubishi Galant]], was sold to [[Mitsubishi Motors]]. The subcompact Horizon was just beginning to reach the U.S. market when the second gas crisis struck, devastating sales of Chrysler's larger cars and trucks, and the company now had no strong compact line to fall back on.

In desperation, the Chrysler Corporation on [[September 7]], [[1979]], petitioned the United States government for [[US dollar|US$]]1 [[billion]] in loan guarantees to avoid [[bankruptcy]]. At the same time, [[Lee Iacocca]], a former [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] executive, was brought in to take the position of [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], and proved a capable public spokesman for the firm. A somewhat reluctant Congress passed the &quot;Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979&quot; (Public Law 96-185) on December 20, 1979 (signed into law by President [[Jimmy Carter]] on January 7, 1980), prodded by Chrysler workers and dealers in every congressional district who feared the loss of their livelihoods. With such help and a few innovative cars (such as the [[Chrysler K platform|K-car]] platform), especially the invention of the [[minivan]] concept, a market where Chrysler brands are still important, Chrysler avoided bankruptcy and slowly fought its way back up. By the early 1980s, the loans were being repaid at a brisk pace and new models based on the K-car platform were selling well. A [[joint venture]] with Mitsubishi called [[Diamond Star Motors]] strengthened the company's hand in the small-car market. The acquisition of [[American Motors|AMC]] by Chrysler in 1987, mostly for its [[Jeep]] brand, bolstered the firm further, although Chrysler was still the weakest of the Big Three American auto makers. 

In the early 1990s, Chrysler made its first tentative steps back into Europe, setting up car production in [[Austria]], and beginning right-hand drive manufacture of certain Jeep models in a 1993 return to the [[UK]] market. The continuing popularity of Jeep, bold new models for the domestic market such as the [[Dodge Ram]] pickup, [[Dodge Viper]] sports car, and [[Plymouth Prowler]] hot rod, and new &quot;cab forward&quot; [[front wheel drive]] sedans put the company in a strong position as the decade waned.

===Daimler-Benz merger===
{{npov}}
Chrysler merged in 1998 with [[Daimler-Benz]] to form DaimlerChrysler AG. This was initially touted as a ''merger of equals'', but within a couple of years the truth was evident; it was effectively a buyout of Chrysler by Daimler-Benz, with the latter very much the dominant partner. As if on cue, the company went into another of its financial tailspins soon after the merger, greatly depressing the stock price of the merged firm and causing serious alarm at headquarters in Germany, which sent new CEO Jurgen Schremp to take charge. The Plymouth brand was phased out in 2001 and plans for cost-cutting by sharing of platforms and components began. The strongly Mercedes-influenced [[Chrysler Crossfire]] was one of the first results of this program. A return to [[rear wheel drive]] was announced, and in 2004, a new [[Chrysler 300]] using this technology and a new Hemi V8 appeared and became a solid hit. Ironically, by most standards, Dodge, Jeep, and Chrysler vehicles have surpassed the parent Mercedes in quality. Financial performance began to improve somewhat, with Chrysler now providing the lion's share of DCX profits, but the long-standing partnership with Mitsubishi appeared to be unraveling as DaimlerChrysler divested its stake in that firm.

On [[April 7]], [[2005]], a conclusion was announced by U.S. District Judge Joseph Farnan Jr. presiding over a bench trial in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] between Kirk Kerkorian and DaimlerChrysler AG regarding allegations that [[Jürgen Schrempp]] of Daimler Benz AG, prior to the 1998 merger, lied and manipulated the Security Exchange Commission and Chrysler Corporation's shareholders (the largest of which was Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda Corporation) by touting the 1998 merger as a merger of equals, and not an outright acquisition. The judge was found to be in favor of DaimlerChrysler's position by rejecting Kerkorian's case. However, another case (based on the same merit) was settled in 2003 for $300 million to other shareholders. The Kerkorian case called for many more causes of action that undoubtedly needed to be carefully dealt with and took over one year to decide on.

==Logos==
[[Image:Logo pentastar.gif|right|Pentastar]]
The design shown at the top of the page is an adaptation of the original winged logo which Chrysler used on its cars at its inception in 1925. The logo was revived for the Chrysler division in the mid-1990s, and was surrounded by a pair of silver wings after the Daimler-Benz merger in 1998. 

In 1963, the company had switched over to a star design which became known as the '''Pentastar''' (right) and was extensively used on dealer signage, advertisements, and promotional brochures. Contrary to popular belief, it was not designed to symbolize the five divisions of the corporation at the time, Plymouth, Dodge, Chrysler, Imperial and Dodge Truck. By 1963 there were only two auto divisions in the United States, Chrysler-Plymouth and Dodge. As well there were over a dozen other divisions in the Chrysler Corporation family, and management were after a symbol that all divisions could use.

Then Chrysler head Lynn Townsend was looking for a symbol that could be used by all divisions, on packaging, stationery, signage, advertising, etc. He wanted something that would be universally recognizable as &quot;Chrysler&quot; to anyone who saw it, from any perspective, from any culture. Chrysler's trademark symbol, the pentastar, was simple and easily recognizable from any perspective, even in motion on revolving signs. The symbol also facilitated Chrysler's expansion in the international market by removing the need to translate any text that is commonly used on logos.

Thus all divisions of Chrysler adopted the Pentastar.  All car brands (Valiant, Plymouth, Dodge, Chrysler, Imperial, Hillman, Humber, Sunbeam, Singer, Simca), truck brands (Fargo, DeSoto, Dodge, Commer, Karrier), and all the other Chrysler divisions (air conditioning systems, heating, industrial engines, marine engines, outboard motors, boats, transmissions, [[four wheel drive]] systems, powdered metal products, adhesives, chemical products, plastics, electronics, tanks, missiles) and services (leasing and finance) were identified by the Pentastar. It united the firm's various products and services in the public's eye as no other auto firm has done.

The Pentastar appeared consistently but inconspicuously on the lower passenger-side fender of all Chrysler products, including foreign brands from 1964-71. It was placed on the passenger-side fender so it could be viewed by passers-by, a subtle method of getting the symbol ingrained in the public's mind. A nameplate has to be read, but a symbol is recognizable even to the illiterate. Thus North American and French cars had the Pentastar on the right fender and British on the left. The practice was revived in the 1990's. Beginning in 1981, the Pentastar replaced individual logos that had been used by Plymouth, Dodge and Chrysler and had in some cases identfied individual models, such as the [[Chrysler New Yorker]] in uses such as hood ornaments and decklid badges. 

By 1993, Chrysler started to phase out the Pentastar, with Dodge getting its own &quot;Ram&quot; logo, and by 1995, Chrysler revived the rosette symbol it had used prior to the Pentastar; Plymouth was given a new sailboat logo. The Pentastar's last badging appearance was on the [[steering wheel]] and keys of the [[Chrysler minivans]] produced from 1996 through 2000.

Currently the only remaining traces of this motif are a large, star-shaped window at DaimlerChrysler's American headquarters in [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]], and '''Pentastar Aviation''', a former DaimlerChrysler subsidiary which reverted to its original name after being purchased, ironically, by a member of the Ford family. It is also likely that many dealerships still have signage and other traces still visually apparent to the Pentastar. Today, glass on Chrysler Group cars and trucks still have the Pentastar on them, however, its days appear to be numbered.

The '''[[city status in the United Kingdom|City]] of London''' is a small area in [[Greater London]]. The modern [[conurbation]] of [[London]] developed from the City of London and the nearby [[City of Westminster]], which was the centre of the royal government. The City of London is now London's main financial district. It is often referred to as just '''the City''' or as the '''Square Mile''', as it is approximately one square mile (2.6 square kilometres) in area; note that these terms are also often used as synonyms for the UK financial services industry, which is principally based there.  In the [[medieval]] period the City was the full extent of London (as distinct from the nearby but then-separate [[City of Westminster]]), but the term London now refers to a much larger [[conurbation]] containing both 'cities'. The City of London is still part of London's [[city centre]], but apart from financial services, most of London's metropolitan functions are centred on the [[West End of London|West End]]. The City of London has a resident population of under 9,000 but a daily working population of around 300,000. 

The City itself has two independent [[enclave]]s within it — [[Inner Temple]] and [[Middle Temple]]. These two areas form part of the City and Ceremonial county, but are not governed by the [[Corporation of London]]. The Corporation governs the rest of the City and also owns various open spaces (parks, forests and commons) in and around London.

Its [[Latin]] motto is &quot;''Domine dirige nos''&quot; which means &quot;''Lord, direct us''&quot;.


==Extent==
The size of the City was originally constrained by a defensive perimeter wall, known as '[[London Wall]]’, which was built by the Romans to protect their strategic port city.   However, the boundaries of the City of London are no longer the old City Wall  as the city expanded its jurisdiction to the so-called City Bars — such as [[Temple Bar London|Temple Bar]].  The boundary froze in the medieval period, thus the City did not and does not control the whole of London.

The walls have long since disappeared although several sections remain visible above ground.  A section near the [[Museum of London]] was revealed after the devastation of an air-raid on [[29 December]] [[1940]] at the height of the [[The Blitz|Blitz]].  Other visible sections are at [[St Alphage]], [[London Wall]], and there are two sections near the [[Tower of London]].
[[Image:050114 2495 london city.jpg|thumb|right|275px|The eastern side of the City of London viewed from [[St. Pauls Cathedral]]. [[Canary Wharf]] is on the horizon.]]
The City of London borders the [[City of Westminster]] to the west — the border cutting through [[Victoria Embankment]], passing to the west of [[Middle Temple]], going east along [[Strand, London|Strand]] and [[Fleet Street]], north up [[Chancery Lane]], where it becomes instead the border with the [[London Borough of Camden]].  It continues north to [[Holborn]], turns east, continues, and then goes northeast to [[Charterhouse Lane]].  As it crosses [[Farringdon Road]] it becomes the border with the [[London Borough of Islington]].  It continues to [[Aldersgate]], goes north, and turns into some back streets soon after it becomes [[Goswell Road]].  It ends up on Ropemakers Lane, which as it continues east past [[Moorgate]] becomes South Place.  It goes north, becomes the border with the [[London Borough of Hackney]], then east, north, east on backstreets, meeting [[Norton Folgate]] at the border with the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]]. It continues south into [[Bishopsgate]], and takes some backstreets to [[Middlesex Street]] where it continues south-east then south.  It makes a divergence to the west at the end of Middlesex Street to allow the [[Tower of London]] to be in Tower Hamlets, and then reaches the river.  The boundaries of the City are marked by black bollards bearing the City's emblem. ([http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/about_us/voting/wards/ward_boundaries_map.htm boundary map]). In some places the financial district extends slightly beyond the political boundaries of the City to the north and east, into the boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Islington, and informally these locations are seen as part of the &quot;Square Mile&quot;. Since the 1990s the eastern fringe of the City, extending into Hackney and Tower Hamlets, has increasingly been a focus for large office developments due to the relatively easy availability of large sites there compared to within the City itself. 

The City of London is England's smallest [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] by both population and area covered and is the second smallest [[City status in the United Kingdom|British city]] in both population and size, after [[St David's]] in Wales.

At its maximum extent the City included areas now not part of it, including [[Southwark]] (as the 'ward of bridge without').  The City today controls the full spans of [[London Bridge]] and [[Blackfriars Bridge]], but only half of the river underneath them.

The City of London also owns and looks after a number of open spaces well outside its own boundaries. These are: [[Ashtead Common]], [[Burnham Beeches]], [[Epping Forest]], [[Hampstead Heath]] (including [[Parliament Hill, London|Parliament Hill]]), [[Highgate Wood]], [[Queen's Park (London)|Queen's Park]], [[West Ham Park]], and [[West Wickham and Coulsdon Common]].

The area of the City of London has been administered separately since 886, when [[Alfred the Great]] appointed his son-in-law [[Earl Aethelred of Mercia|Earl Ætheldred of Mercia]] as Governor of London. Alfred made sure that there was suitable accommodation for merchants from north west Europe, which were then extended to traders from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[Italy]]. 

The City developed its own code of law for the mercantile classes, developing such autonomy that Sir [[Laurence Gomme]] regarded the City as a separate Kingdom making its own laws. The City was composed of wards governed by [[Alderman|Aldermen]], who chaired the Wardmotes. There was a folkmoot for the whole of the city held in the shadows of [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. In the [[10th century|tenth century]], [[Athelstan]] permitted eight [[royal mint|mints]] to be established, compared to six in his capital, [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]], indicating the wealth of the city.

Following the [[Battle of Hastings]], [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] marched on London, to [[Southwark]] and failed to get across London Bridge or to defeat the Londoners.  He eventually crossed the River Thames at [[Wallingford]], pillaging the land as he went.  Rather than continuing the war  [[Edgar Atheling|Edgar Ætheling]], [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia|Edwin of Mercia]] and [[Morcar, Earl of Northumbria|Morcar of Northumbria]] surrendered at [[Berkhamstead]]. William rewarded London in granting the citizens a charter in 1075; the City of London was one of the few institutions where the English retained some authority.

However, William insured against attack by building 3 Castles nearby so as to keep the Londoners subdued:

* [[Tower of London]]
* [[Baynard's Castle]]
* [[Montfichet's Castle]]

In 1132, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] recognised full [[county borough|County]] status for the City, and by 1141 the whole body of the [[citizen]]ry was considered to constitute a single community. This was the origin of the [[Corporation of London]].

The City burned nearly to the ground twice, first in 1212 and then again (and more famously) in the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666. Both of these fires were referred to as ''the'' Great Fire.

The City elected four members to the [[unreformed House of Commons]], which it retained after the [[Reform Act 1832]] and into the 20th century.  Today it is included wholly in the [[Cities of London and Westminster]] constituency, and statute requires that it not be divided between two neighbouring areas.

The City's population fell rapidly in the 19th century and through most of 20th century as many houses were demolished to make way for office blocks. This trend has now been reversed as the Corporation is encouraging residential use, although the resident population is not expected to go much above ten thousand people. Some of the extra accommodation is in small pre [[World War II]] commercial buildings which are not suitable for occupation by the large companies which now provide much of the City's employment. The largest residential section of the City is the [[Barbican Estate]].

Since the 1990s, the City has diversified away from near exclusive office use in some other ways as well. For example, several hotels have opened and also the City's first [[department store]]. However, large sections of it remain very quiet at weekends, and it is quite common to find pubs and cafes closed on these days.

:''see also [[Corporation of London]]''
The City of London has a unique political status, a legacy of its uninterrupted integrity as a corporate city since the Anglo Saxon pe resolved, and are a major source of customer dissatisfaction).
* Provide a fast mechanism for handling problems and complaints (complaints that are resolved quickly can increase customer satisfaction).
* Provide a fast mechanism for correcting service deficiencies (correct the problem before other customers experience the same dissatisfaction).
* Identify how each individual customer defines quality, and then design a service strategy for each customer based on these individual requirements and expectations.
* Use internet cookies to track customer interests and personalize product offerings accordingly.
* Use the Internet to engage in collaborative customization or real-time customization  
* Provide a fast mechanism for managing and scheduling followup sales calls to assess post-purchase cognitive dissonance, repurchase probabilities, repurchase times, and repurchase frequencies.
* Provide a fast mechanism for managing and scheduling maintenance, repair, and on-going support (improve efficiency and effectiveness).
* Provide a mechanism to track all points of contact between a customer and the company, and do it in an integrated way so that all sources and types of contact are included, and all users of the system see the same view of the customer (reduces confusion).
* The CRM can be integrated into other cross-functional systems and thereby provide accounting and production information to customers when they want it.

==Improving customer relationships==

CRMs are also claimed to be able to improve customer relationships . Proponents say this is so because:

* CRM technology can track customer interests, needs, and buying habits as they progress through their life cycles, and tailor the marketing effort accordingly. This way customers get exactly what they want as they change.
* The technology can track customer product use as the product progresses through its life cycle, and tailor the service strategy accordingly. This way customers get  what they need as the product ages.
* In industrial markets, the technology can be used to micro-segment the buying centre and help coordinate the conflicting and changing purchase criteria of its members.
* When any of the technology-driven improvements in customer service (mentioned above) contribute to long-term customer satisfaction, they can ensure repeat purchases, improve customer relationships, increase customer loyalty, decrease customer turnover, decrease marketing costs (associated with customer acquisition and customer &amp;ldquo;training&amp;rdquo;), increase sales revenue, and thereby increase profit margins.
* Repeat purchase, however, comes from customer satisfaction - which in turn comes from a deeper understanding of each customer, their individual business challenges and proposing solutions for those challenges rather than a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach.
* CRM software enables sales people to achieve this one on one approach to selling and can automate some elements of it via tailorable marketing communications. However, all of these elements are facilitated by or for humans to achieve - CRM is therefore a company-wide attitude as much as a software solution.

==Technical functionality==

A '''CRM solution is characterised by the following functionality:'''
* scalability - the ability to be used on a large scale, and to be reliably expanded to whatever scale is necessary.
* multiple [[communication channel]]s - the ability to interface with users via many different devices (phone, WAP, internet, etc)
* [[workflow]] - the ability to trigger a process in the backoffice system, e. g. Email Response, ...
* [[assignment]] - the ability to assign requests (Service Requests, Sales Opportunities) to a person or group.
* [[database]] - the centralised storage (in a data warehouse) of all information relevant to customer interaction
* [[customer privacy]] considerations, e.g. [[data encryption]] and the destruction of records to ensure that they are not stolen or abused

== Privacy and ethical concerns==

CRMs are not however considered universally good - some feel it invades [[customer privacy]] and enable coercive sales techniques due to the information companies now have on customers - see [[persuasion technology]].  However, CRM does not necessarily imply gathering new data, it can be used merely to make &quot;better use&quot; of data the corporation already has. But in most cases they are used to collect new data.

Some argue that the most basic privacy concern is the centralised database itself, and that CRMs built this way are inherently privacy-invasive. See the commercial version of the debate over the [[carceral state]], e.g. [[Total Information Awareness]] program of the [[United States federal government]].

==Setting up a framework for CRM==

* When you start setting up your CRM segment for your business you first want to see what profile aspects you feel are relevant to your business. Which information will provide you the keys to serve your customers in the best way possible?  If you can look at your financial history for this information then what would you have liked to know about your customers in the past? What would have been the effects? And what information is not useful? Being able to eliminate unwanted information is a big aspect in implementing your CRM systems
*When designing your CRM's structure, always remember who your primary customers are. You want to keep more extensive information on them because they are your high-margin customers. You can keep less extensive details on the clients you identify as &amp;#8220;low-margin&amp;#8221;.

==CRM in Business==

In this day and age the use of internet sites and specifically e-mail, in particular, are touted as less expensive communication methods, compared to traditional methods like telephone calls. This revolutionary type of service can be very helpful, but it is completely useless if you are having trouble reaching your customers. It has been determined by some major companies that the majority of clients trust other means of communication, like telephone, more than they trust e-mail. Clients, however, are not the ones to blame because it is often the manner of connecting with consumers on a personal level making them feel as though they are cherished as customers. It is up to the companies to focus on reaching every customer and developing a relationship.
  
CRM software can run your entire business. From prospect and client contact tools to billing history and bulk email management. The CRM system allows you to maintain all customer records in one centralized location that is accessible to your entire organization through password administration. Front office systems are set up to collect data from the customers for processing into the [[data warehouse]]. The [[data warehouse]] is a back office system used to fulfill and support customer orders. All customer information is stored in the [[data warehouse]]. Back office CRM makes it possible for a company to follow sales, orders, and cancellations. Special regressions of this data can be very beneficial for the marketing division of a firm/company.

      <text xml:space="preserve">More of a carnival game than anything else (no gaming commission in the world will allow it), '''Chuck-a-luck''' is a simple [[gambling]] [[game]]. There is a cage containing three [[dice]]. Players have the option of betting on the numbers 1 through 6. Should one of your numbers come up once, you get paid even money. Should one of your numbers come up twice you get paid 2-1. Should your number come up three times, you get paid 3-1.

Even an elementary examination will find that the game's [[expected value]] (barring [[loaded dice]], which are common), is far worse than that of any other table game. The game is sometimes used as a fundraiser for charity, but the odds of coming away with more money than originally put in are quite small.

'''Chipmunk''' is the common name for any small [[squirrel]]-like [[rodent]] species of the genus ''Tamias'' in the family [[Sciuridae]]. About 23 species fall under this title, with one species in northeastern [[Asia]], one in the eastern portions of Canada and the US, and all the rest native to the western part of [[North America]]. 

The name may have originally been spelled &quot;chitmunk&quot; (perhaps from the [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] word ''ajidamoo'', meaning &quot;red squirrel&quot;). However, the earliest form cited in the Oxford English Dictionary (from 1842) is &quot;chipmonk&quot;. Other early forms include &quot;chipmuck&quot; and &quot;chipminck&quot;. They are also called striped squirrel or ground squirrel; however, the name &quot;ground squirrel&quot; is more usually kept for the genus ''[[Spermophilus]]'', though ''Tamias'' and ''Spermophilus'' are only two of the 13 [[genus|genera]] of ground-living [[Sciuridae|sciurids]]. 

Eastern chipmunks mate in early spring and again in early summer to produce two litters, each of four to five young, but western chipmunks only breed once a year. The young emerge from the burrow after about six weeks and strike out on their own within the next two weeks.

Though they are commonly depicted with their paws up to the mouth, eating peanuts, or more famously their cheeks bulging out on either side, chipmunks eat a much more diverse range of foods than just nuts. Their [[omnivore|omnivorous]] diet consists of grain, nuts, birds' eggs, fungi, and insects. Come autumn, many species of chipmunk begin to stockpile these goods in their burrows, for [[winter]]. Other species make multiple small caches of food. These two kinds of behavior are called [[larder-hoarder|larder hoarding]] and [[scatter-hoarder|scatter hoarding]]. Larder hoarders usually live in their nests until [[spring (season)|spring]].

These small squirrels fulfill several important functions in [[forest]] [[ecosystem]]s. Their activities with regards to harvesting and hoarding tree seeds play a crucial role in [[seedling]] establishment.  They also consume many different kinds of [[fungi]], including those involved in symbiotic mycorrhizal associations with trees, and are an important vector for dispersal of the spores of subterranean [[sporocarps]] (truffles) which have co-evolved with these and other [[mycophagous]] mammals and thus lost the ability to disperse their spores through the air.

Chipmunks play an important role as prey for various predatory mammals and birds, but are also opportunistic predators themselves, particularly with regard to bird eggs and [[nestling]]s.  In [[Oregon]], [[Mountain Bluebird]]s (''Siala currucoides'') have been observed energetically mobbing chipmunks that they see near their nest trees.

Chipmunks construct expansive [[burrow]]s which can be more than 3.5 m in length with several well-concealed entrances.  The sleeping quarters are 
kept extremely clean as shells and feces are stored in refuse tunnels.

If unmolested they often become bold enough to accept food from the hands of humans.  The temptation to pick up or pet any wild animal should
be strictly avoided. While rabies is exceptionally rare, if non-existent, in rodents, chipmunk bites can transmit virulent and dangerous bacterial infections.

==Pop Culture References==

===Alvin and the Chipmunks===
In [[1958]] [[Ross Bagdasarian]] (using the stage name [[David Seville]], named after [[Seville, Spain]]) released &quot;The Chipmunk Song&quot; (&quot;Christmas, Don't Be Late&quot;), a sped-up recording of himself performing three-part harmony. The resulting high-pitched cartoony voices were named &quot;Alvin&quot;, &quot;Simon&quot;, and &quot;Theodore&quot; after executives at the record company which published the record. &quot;The Chipmunk Song&quot; went on to win two [[Grammy Award]]s and a new &quot;group&quot; called &quot;[[Alvin &amp; the Chipmunks|David Seville &amp; the Chipmunks]]&quot; became a popular novelty act.

In [[1961]], the group starred in their own [[animation|animated]] [[television series]], ''The Alvin Show''. The characters substantially regained popularity in the early [[1980s]] under the guidance of Bagdasarian's son [[Ross Bagdasarian, Jr.|Ross Jr.]]. A new series, ''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks]]'', debuted in [[1983]], with a feature film (''The Chipmunk Adventure'', [[1987]]) and several [[direct-to-video]] releases in the [[1990s]] following it. Ross Bagdasarian, Jr. provides the voices of Dave, Alvin, and Simon in the new production; his wife [[Janice Karman]] does the voice of Theodore and the female Chipmunk spin-off group The Chipettes.

===Walt Disney===
In [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s animated movie ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', character Krunk regularly converses with chipmunks, in their language of squeaks. Walt Disney also created two talking chipmunks, [[Chip and Dale]], during the 1940's.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''criminal organization''' is a group run by [[criminal]]s to further their illegal activities. They are usually involved with [[Illegal drug trade|drugs]], [[prostitution]], [[money laundering]] and [[black market]]eering. These activities are also called [[vice]] and [[organized crime]]. Some also engage in acts of political, racist, and religiously motivated violence, and in acts of [[terrorism]] and [[crimes against humanity]]. 

Examples of criminal organizations would include the [[Mafia]] and the [[Yakuza]].  The role of [[prison gang]]s, by definition criminal, on activities on the outside is under-estimated by many.

----

Another use of the term &quot;criminal organization&quot; exists in [[human rights law]] and refers to an organization which has been found guilty of [[crimes against humanity]].  Once an organization has been determined to be a criminal organization, then one must only demonstrate that an individual belonged to that organization to be punished and not that the individual actually individually committed illegal acts.

The concept of the criminal organization came into being during the [[Nuremberg Trials]].  Several [[public sector]] organizations of [[Nazi Germany]] such as the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and [[Gestapo]] were judged to be criminal organizations, while other organizations such as the [[German Army High Command]] {{dubious}} were indicted but acquitted of charges.

This conception of criminal organizations was, and continues to be, controversial, and has not been used in human rights law since the trials at Nuremberg.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Computer music''' is [[music]] generated with, or composed with the aid of [[computer]]s.  It also refers to a field of study that examines both the theory and application of new and existing technologies in the areas of [[music]], [[sound design]] and diffusion, [[acoustics]], [[sound synthesis]], [[digital signal processing]], and [[psychoacoustics]].  The field of computer music can trace its roots back to the origin of [[electronic music]], and the very first experiments and innovations with electronic instruments at the turn of the 20th century.

Much of the work on computer music has drawn on the relationship between [[music theory]] and [[mathematics]]. The world's first computer music was generated in Australia by programmer [[Geoff Hill]] on the [[CSIRAC]] computer which was designed and built by [[Trevor Pearcey]] and [[Maston Beard]]. Subsequently, [[Lejaren Hiller]] (e.g., the Illiac Suite) used a computer in the 1950s to compose works that were then played by conventional musicians. Later developments included the work of [[Max Mathews]] at Bell Laboratories, who developed the influential [[MUSIC-N|MUSIC I]] program. [[Vocoder]] technology was also a major development in this early era. More recently, [[MIDI]] technology has allowed personal computers to interact with synthesizers through a standardized interface, which has widened the use of computer technology. 

Throughout the world there are many organizations and institutions dedicated to the area of computer and electronic music study and research, including the [[ICMC]] (International Computer Music Association), [[IRCAM]], [[SEAMUS]] (Society for Electro Acoustic Music in the United States), and a great number of institutions of higher learning around the world.

      <contholder interest in corporate profitability generally guides the actions of corporate governing bodies, and it is in the pursuit of this interest that corporations exercise their financial and marketplace power in order to influence public policy.

The term however is accurate to describe actions of Corporations interested in maintaining (for them) positive laws, and thus makes it a question of resources to spend (it can be cheaper to give money to a few individuals than to bow to strict laws that cost a lot)

Corporatocracy is also used by John Perkins in his 2004 book ''Confessions of an Economic Hit Man'' to describe a system of governance controlled by &quot;big corporations, international banks, and government&quot; (Perkins / Plume paperback edition, 94).  Harking back to the &quot;military-industrial complex&quot;, Perkins sees the corporatocracy manifested in the following cycle: the World Bank issues loans to developing nations to pay for large-scale development projects; contracts are then doled out to a handful of American engineering firms; as a result, these countries become ensared in a net of interest payments and debts they cannot repay.  American corporations benefit through increased profits, and the U.S. government benefits through securing its political clout and control over developing countries with vast natural resources.  The majority of people in those countries do not benefit, however, since a large portion of their country's budget goes toward servicing the national debt instead of improving living conditions.  

Perkins describes how the convergence between big corporations, international banks, and government - according to him, the three pillars of corporatocracy - allows economic elite to move easily between these sectors.  He offers several examples, including that of Vice President and former Halliburton CEO Dick Cheney (Perkins / Plume paperback edition, 91).

      <text xml:space="preserve">It has been said that '''Canadian culture''' rests solely in the effort to distinguish itself from its southern neighbour, the [[United States]]. However, others argue that while the two countries share some aspects of a common cultural heritage, there is also a separately identifiable [[Canada|Canadian]] culture. They point to what they view as a greater integration of their [[First Nations|Native]] culture; the retention of traditions descended from those of [[France|French]] settlers; and a notable infusion of [[Modern Celts|Celtic]] settlers in later phases of the country's history.

One matter of contention in the effort to study Canadian culture rests in the fact of Canada's [[bilingualism]]; there is little reason to question the distinct identities of the [[English language|English]]- and [[French language|French]]-speaking peoples of Canada. However, [[John Ralston Saul]] conjectures that [[Gabrielle Roy]] is better known in [[anglophone]] Canada than in [[France]], and more [[Francophone|French-Canadians]] know of [[Margaret Laurence]] and [[Atom Egoyan]] than Americans.

{{main|Theatre in Canada}}
Canada has a thriving stage theatre scene, especially in Southern Ontario and in Quebec. Theatre festivals draw many tourists in the summer months, especially the [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival]] in [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]] [[Ontario]], and the [[Shaw Festival]] in [[Niagara On The Lake]], [[Ontario]].  The [[Famous People Players]] are only one of many touring companies that have also developed an international reputation.  Canada also boasts the world's second largest live theatre festival, the Edmonton Fringe Festival.

== Film and television ==
{{main|Cinema of Canada}}{{see also|Cinema of Quebec}}

The Canadian film market was dominated by the American film industry for decades. In the 1960s  [[Michel Brault]], [[Pierre Perrault]], [[Gilles Groulx]], [[Jean-Pierre Lefebvre]], [[Arthur Lamothe]]  and other filmmakers from [[Québec]] began to challenge [[Hollywood]] by making innovative and politically relevant documentary and feature films. Among the important English-speaking filmmakers from this period are [[Allan King]], Norman Jewison and [[Robin Spry]]. [[Michael Snow]] continues to be one of the most respected experimental film makers in the world.  Norman Jewison recently recieved a Lifetime Achievement 'Oscar' Academy Award.

Canada has developed a vigorous [[film]] industry that has produced a variety of well-known films, [[actor]]s, and auteurs. In fact, this eclipsing may sometimes be creditable for the rather bizarre and quite innovative directions of the works of such auteurs as [[Atom Egoyan]] (''[[The Sweet Hereafter]]'', 1997) and [[David Cronenberg]](&quot;A History of Violence&quot;, &quot;The Fly&quot;, &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;). Also, the distinct French-Canadian society permits the work of directors such as [[Denys Arcand]] and [[Denis Villeneuve]]. However given Canada's small population and perhaps, because of the closeness of the giant American TV and film industries, distinctively Canadian productions such as those in [[TIFF's List of Canada's Top Ten Films of All Time]] are relatively thin on the ground, compared with the situations in the United Kingdom.  However, Lion's Gates Films and Alliance Atlantis are two film production companies headquartered in Canada who have grown large enough to compete with larger American productions down south.  In addition, because of the intricate relationship between the American and Canadian film industry, numerous films such as David Cronenberg's &quot;A History of Violence&quot; (2005) are often credited as both Canadian films by Canadian publications and an American films by American publications due to differing definitions of what constitutes a Canadian or American film by each country.

A number of [[Canadian pioneers in early Hollywood]] significantly contributed to the creation of the motion picture industry in the early days of the 20th century. Over the years, many Canadians have made enormous contributions to the American entertainment industry, although they are frequently not recognized as Canadians (see [[Famous Canadians]]).   

Canada's film industry is in full expansion as a site for Hollywood productions. The series ''[[The X-Files]]'' was famously shot in [[Vancouver]] as is ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', the 2003 version of ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2003)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', and ''[[The Outer Limits]]''.  The American ''[[Queer as Folk (US)|Queer as Folk]]'' is filmed in [[Toronto]].  Since the 1980s Canada, and Vancouver in particular, has become known as [[Hollywood North]]. As with its' southern counterpart in California, USA, many Canadians are employed in the film industry and celebrity-spotting is frequent throughout many Canadian cities.  [[Montreal]], due to its [[Europe|European]] appearance, has served in a great variety of mainstream movies, attracting the loyalty of industry people such as [[Bruce Willis]]; there are plans to build the world's biggest film studio on the outskirts of the city. The choice of location is allegedly due to cost, rather than a requirement for a 'Canadian atmosphere'. The frequent question of a Canadian, seeing a film crew on their local streets is 'Which bit of the States are we pretending to be today?'.

Canadian [[television]], especially supported by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], is the home of a variety of locally-produced shows. French-language television, like French Canadian film is buffered from excessive American influence by the fact of language, and likewise supports a host of home-grown productions. The relative success of French-language domestic television and movies in Canada often exceeds that of its English-language counterpart.

The [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]]'s Canadian content regulations dictate that a certain percentage of a domestic broadcaster's transmission time must include content that is produced by Canadians, or covers Canadian subjects. This also applies to [[United States|US]] [[cable television]] channels such as [[MTV]] and the [[Discovery Channel]], which have local versions of their channels available on Canadian cable networks. Similarly, [[BBC Canada]], while primarily showing [[BBC]] shows from the [[United Kingdom|UK]], also carries Canadian output.

[[National Film Board of Canada]] [http://www.nfb.ca/e/index_about.html ], is 'a public agency that produces and distributes films and other audiovisual works which reflect Canada to Canadians and the rest of the world'.

The Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) is considered by many to be one of the most prevlent film festivals for Western cinema.

Canada has produced many film and television stars, newscasters, directors and producers including:
[[Brent Butt]], [[Pamela Anderson]], [[William Shatner]], Norman Jewison, Michael j. Fox, Lorne Michaels (producer of &quot;Satuday Night Live&quot;) Alan Thicke, Alex Trebek, Mike Myers, Eugene Levy, Martin Short, Kiefer Sutherland, Keanu Reeves, Rick Moranis, Peter Jennings and [[Jim Carrey]].

In addition, many popular political documentaries such as Noam Chomsky's Manufacturing Consent, The Corporation and Bowling for Columbine involved Canadian production and funding.

== Comedy ==
{{main|Canadian humour}}
Canadian TV is noted for cutting political satire such as ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'', ''[[Rick Mercer Report]]'', and ''[[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]''. 

There are plenty of eminent Canadian humourists. The [[Kids in the Hall]] were a popular Canadian sketch group. Also the [[Second City Television]] show originated in the Toronto ''[[The Second City|Second City]]'' operation, which produced many comedians that went on to success worldwide, including [[John Candy]], [[Rick Moranis]], [[Eugene Levy]], [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]], [[Catherine O'Hara]], and others.   The team of creators for SCTV including Lorne Michaels were later transplanted in New York City to create Saturday Night Live.

Other Canadian comics and comedy groups include [[Jim Carrey]], [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]], Martin Short, Tom Green, Dan Aykroyd, Leslie Nielsen, ''[[CODCO]]'' (the precursors to This Hour Has 22 Minutes), [[Maggie Cassella]], and [[Elvira Kurt]]. The ''[[Just for Laughs]]'' Festival in [[Montreal]] is the world's largest comedy festival.

Canadian humour tends to translate better via 'sketch comedy' rather than the primarily US 'sitcom' format, although solo stand-up is equally important. 

Canadian humour is often defined as being not as 'punchline-friendly' as the US, but not as 'off-the-wall' as the UK.

==Music==
{{see also|Music of Canada}}
Canada has developed its own brands of traditional music, including the French, Irish and Scottish-derived [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]] fiddle music of the [[Maritimes]], the Franco-Celtic styles of [[Quebec]] that often include foot percussion and a scat style called ''turlutte''; and other national styles from the [[Ottawa River | Ottawa Valley]] to the west.  Noted proponents are [[Buddy MacMaster]] and his niece [[Natalie MacMaster|Natalie]] of [[Cape Breton]] and [[Madame Bolduc]] of Quebec, whose recordings in the [[1930s]] lifted her people through depressing times.

The Canadian music industry has been helped by government regulation designed to protect and encourage the growth of distinct Canadian culture. The Canadian Content (CANCON) regulations force all radio stations in Canada to play at least 35% Canadian music. This has enabled Canadian artists to garner success on the airwaves which were once dominated by American and European acts. Now it is common to hear several Canadian songs on the radio every hour you listen.

In the realm of popular music, Canada has produced a variety of internationally successful performers, including (alphabetically): [[Bryan Adams]], [[The Arcade Fire]], [[Broken Social Scene]], [[Paul Anka]], [[The Band]], [[Barenaked Ladies]], [[Bachman-Turner Overdrive | BTO]], [[Billy Talent]],  [[Terri Clark]], [[Bruce Cockburn]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Delerium]], [[Celine Dion|Céline Dion]], [[Do Make Say Think]], [[Feist]], [[Nelly Furtado]], [[Matthew Good]], [[Robert Goulet]], [[Great Big Sea]], [[Guess Who]], [[Richie Hawtin]], [[k-os]], [[Diana Krall]], [[Avril Lavigne]], [[Gordon Lightfoot]],  [[Holly McNarland]], [[Sarah McLachlan]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Alanis Morissette]], [[Anne Murray]], [[Bif Naked]], [[Nickelback]], [[Our Lady Peace]], [[Kim Mitchell]], [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Sam Roberts]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Simple Plan]], [[Hank Snow]], [[Sum 41]], [[The Tea Party]], [[The Tragically Hip]], [[Shania Twain]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], and [[Neil Young]].

==Symbols==
{{see also|Canadian identity}}
Official symbols of Canada include the [[maple leaf]], [[American Beaver|beaver]], and [[common loon]]. Many official symbols of the country such as the [[Flag of Canada]] have been changed or modified over the past few decades in order to 'Canadianize' them and de-emphasise or remove references to the [[United Kingdom]]. Symbols of the [[monarchy in Canada]] continue to be featured in, for example, the [[Coat of Arms of Canada]], and the designation '[[Royal]]' remains for institutions as varied as the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and the [[Royal Winnipeg Ballet]].

==Aboriginal effects==

There were and are many distinct Aboriginal peoples across Canada, each with its own culture, language and history.   Much of this artistic legacy remains celebrated in Canada to this day. The emblem of the [[Vancouver]] [[2010 Winter Olympics]] is the [[inukshuk]], a stack of rocks in human form that is a part of [[Inuit]] culture. [http://www.vancouver2010.com/Emblem/home.htm]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Chełmno Land''' or '''Culmland''' ([[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Ziemia Chełmińska'', [[German language|German]]: ''Kulmerland'') is a historical region in central [[Poland]] bounded by the [[Vistula]] and [[Drwęca]] rivers. It is named after the city of [[Chełmno]]. The largest cities in the region are [[Toruń]], [[Grudziądz]], [[Chełmno]], and [[Chełmża]]. In various times it was considered to be part of the neighbouring provinces of [[Masovia]], [[Kuyavia]], [[Greater Poland]], [[Prussia]], and [[Pomerania]]; it is currently part of the [[Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodship]]. The region is also sometimes referred to as Kulmer Land, Culmerland, or Culmer Land.

It is located on the right bank of the [[Vistula]] river, from the mouth of the [[Drwęca]] river to Chełmno. Where the Vistula river takes a sharp turn northward, the Drwęca forms the eastern border of the region, while its southern and western border is the Vistula river.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Kulmland.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Chełmno Land in [[1547]]]] --&gt;

== History ==

In the [[10th century]] Chełmno Land was inhabited by the [[Lechitic]] Kuyavian and Masovian tribes. When this area was subdued by the rulers of the [[Polans (western)|Polans]] Chełmno became a local centre of administration (kasztelania). Chełmno Land was [[Christianised]] in the [[11tinefficiency accounts for the majority of call centre operating expenses, influencing '''[[outsourcing]]''' in the call centre industry.

Inadequate computer systems can mean staff take one or two seconds longer than necessary to process a transaction.  This can often be quantified in staff cost terms.  This is often used as a driving factor in any business case to justify a complete system upgrade or replacement.  For several factors, including the efficiency of the call centre, the level of computer and telecom support that may be adequate for staff in a typical branch office may prove totally inadequate in a call centre.

==Technology==
Call Centres use a wide variety of different technologies to allow them to manage the large volumes of work that need to be managed by the call centre. These technologies ensure that agents are kept as productive as possible, and that calls are queued and processed as quickly as possible, resulting in good levels of service.  

These include ;

* ACD ([[automatic call distribution]])
* Agent performance analytics
* BTTC (best time to call)/ Outbound call optimization
* IVR ([[interactive voice response]])
* CTI ([[computer telephony integration]])
* [[Enterprise Campaign Management]]
* Outbound [[predictive dialer]]
* CRM ([[customer relationship management]])
* CIM ([[customer interaction management]]) solutions (Also known as 'Unified' solutions)
* Email Management
* Chat and Web Collaboration
* Desktop Scripting Solutions
* TTS ([[text to speech]])
* WFM ([[workforce management]])
* [[Voice analysis]]
* [[Voice recognition]]
* [[Voicemail]]
* [[Voice over IP|VoIP]]
* [[Speech Analytics]]

==Call centre dynamics==
Types of calls are often divided into ''outbound'' and ''inbound''.  Inbound calls are calls that are made by the consumer to obtain information, report a malfunction, or ask for help.  These calls are substantially different from outbound calls, where agents place calls to potential customers mostly with intentions of selling or service to the individual. ''[[Telemarketing|(See telemarketing)]]'' 

Call centre staff are often organized into a multi-tier support system for a more efficient handling of calls. The first tier in such a model consists of operators, who direct inquiries to the appropriate department and provide general directory information. If a caller requires more assistance, the call is forwarded to the second tier, where most issues can be resolved. In some cases, there may be three or more tiers of support staff. If a caller requires more assistance, the caller is forwarded to the third tier of support; typically the third tier of support is formed by product engineers/developers or highly-skilled technical support staff of the product. 

Call centres have their critics. Some critics argue that the work atmosphere in such an environment is de-humanising. Others point to the low rates of pay and restrictive working practices of some employers. There has been much controversy over such things as restricting the amount of time that an employee can spend in the bathroom.  Furthermore, call centres have been the subject of complaints by callers who find the staff often do not have enough skill or authority to resolve problems, while the dehumanized workers very often exhibit an attitude of apathy to even the most abusive customer.

Owing to the highly technological nature of the operations in such offices, the close monitoring of staff activities is easy and widespread. This can be argued to be beneficial, to enable the company to better plan the workload and time of its employees. Some people have argued that such close monitoring breaches human rights to privacy.  Yet another argument is that close monitoring and measurement by quantitative metrics can be counterproductive in that it can lead to poor customer service and a poor image of the company, and an ability to keep within the &quot;stats&quot; while still doing horrible things.

Many call centres in the UK have been built in areas that are depressed economically. This means that the companies get cheap land and labour, and can often benefit from grants to encourage them to improve employment in a given area.  There has also been a trend to move call centres to [[India]], where there is a large pool of cheap English-speaking labour. This phenomenon has led to media reports of poor telephone connections and operators with insufficient local knowledge to do their job. But, call centres in India may be more professionally managed than their counterparts elsewhere in the world. Whereas a typical call centre employee in the developed world may be a high school drop-out, the typical employee in an Indian call centre is a graduate.

Another popular call centre site is the [[Philippines]], owing to its abundant English speakers that are college graduates and Americanized when it comes to English accent and cultural affinities. The Philippines was an American colony for almost 50 years. Filipinos are said to be the best outsourcing site outside North America since the accent is nearer to that of American consumers.

For the Asia Pacific region, from India to Australia and New Zealand, [[Malaysia]] is emerging as one of the top locations for setting up call centres. The country has a history of ties with the English-speaking world and English-language education, as a former British colony.   

Canada is also a popular call centre site, with the relatively low [[Canadian dollar]] and low telecommunication rates. [[Sitel Corporation|SITEL Corporation]], which operates call centres in [[Ottawa]] and [[St. Catharines, Ontario|St. Catharines]], [[Ontario]] is one such company. 

However the [[BPO Industry]] in India is booming at a much faster rate, owing to the fact that not only is the Indian Economy booming and it's basic infrastructure becoming much better, but that [[scalability]] in terms of Human Resource is more easily delivered by Indian Call Centers then those run in any other country. 

Around the world, there are a number of professional organisations forming to develop and promote call centre best practice management and operation, to overcome the negative aspects of a call centre.

==Management of call centres==
Management of call centres involves balancing the requirements of cost effectiveness and service. Callers do not wish to wait in exorbitantly long [[teletraffic queuing theory|queues]] until they can be helped and so management must provide sufficient staff and inbound capacity to ensure that the quality of service is maintained. However, staff costs generally form more than half the cost of running a call centre and so management must minimise the number of staff present.

To perform this balancing act, call centre managers make use of demand estimation, Telecommunication forecasting and dimensioning techniques to determine the level of staff required at any time. Managers must take into account staff tea and lunch breaks and must determine the number of agents required on duty at any one time.

==Forecasting demand==
[[telecommunication forecasting|Forecasting]] results are vital in making management decisions in call centres. Forecasting methods rely on data acquired from various sources including historical data, trend data and so on. Forecasting methods must predict the traffic intensity within the call centre in quarter-hour increments and these results must be converted to staffing rosters. Special attention must be paid to the [[busy hour]]. Forecasting methods must be used to pre-empt a situation where equipment needs to be upgraded as traffic intensity has exceeded the maximum capacity of the call centre.

==Call centre performance==
There are many standard [[traffic measurement (telecommunications)|traffic measurement]]s that can be performed on a call centre to determine its [[network performance|performance]] levels. However, the most important performance measures are:

*The average delay a caller may experience whilst waiting in a queue
*The mean conversation time, otherwise referred to as Average Talk Time (ATT)
*The mean dealing time, otherwise referred to as Average Handling Time (equal to ATT plus wrap up time)
*The percentage of calls answered within a determined time frame (referred to as a Service Level or SL%)
*The percentage of calls which completely resolve the customer's issue (if the customer does not call back about the same problem for a certain period of time, it is considered a successful resolution).

==Refinements of call centres==
There are many refinements to the generic call centre model. Each refinement helps increase the efficiency of the call centre thereby allowing management to make better decisions involving economy and service.

The following list contains some examples of call centre refinements:

*''Predictive Dialling'' &amp;#8211; Computer software attempts to predict the time taken for an agent to help a caller. The software begins dialling another caller before the agent has finished the previous call. This, because not every call will be connected (think of busy or not answered calls) and also because of the time it takes to set up the call (usually around 20 seconds before someone answers). Frequently, predictive dialers will dial more callers than there are agents, counting on the fact that not every line will be answered. When the line is answered and no agent is available, it is held in a retention queue for a short while. When still no agent has become available, the call is hung up and classified as a nuisance call. The next time the client is called an agent will be reserved for the caller.
*''Multi-Skilled Staff'' &amp;#8211; In any call centre, there will be members of staff that will be more skilled in areas than others. A Voice Response Unit can be used to allow the caller to select the reason for his call. Management software, called an Automatic Call Distributor, must then be used to route calls to the appropriate agent. Alternatively, it has been found that a mix of general and specialist agent creates a good balance.
*''Queuing Systems'' &amp;#8211; The selection of a [[teletraffic queuing theory|queuing]] system type is a very important decision in a call centre as it determines the level of quality of service. Queueing systems in call centres are usually described as M/M/N type queues where N is the number of agents. The preferred method of queuing is a FIFO (First In First Out) model, as it causes minimum delay to callers.
*''Prioritisation of Callers'' &amp;#8211; Classification of callers according to priority is a very important refinement. Emergency calls or callers that are reattempting to contact a call centre are examples of callers that could be given a higher priority.
*''Automatic Number Identification'' &amp;#8211; This allows agents to determine who is calling before they answer the call. Greeting a caller by name and obtaining his/her information in advance adds to the quality of service and helps decrease the conversation time.

==Additional issues in call centres==
There are many other issues that have to be planned for when managing a call centre. A few of these issues are listed below:

*Planning for failure of equipment
*Need for flexibility in meal-times
*Need for job variety and training
*Job exhaustion and stress
*Staff turnover

==Variations on the generic call centre model==
The various components in a call centre discussed in the previous sections are the generic form of a call centre. There are many variations on the model developed above. A few of the variations are listed below:

*''Remote Agents'' &amp;#8211; An alternative to housing all agents in a central facility is to use remote agents. These agents work from home and use a Basic Rate ISDN access line to communicate with a central computing platform. Remote agents are more cost effective as they don&amp;#8217;t have to travel to work, however the call centre must still cover the cost of the ISDN line.
*''Temporary Agents'' &amp;#8211; Temporary agents are useful as they can be called upon if demand increases more rapidly than planned. They are offered a certain number of quarter hours a month. They are paid for the amount they actually work, and the difference between the amount offered and the amount guaranteed is also paid. Managers must use forecasting methods to determine the number of hours offered so that the difference is minimised.
*''Virtual Call Centres'' &amp;#8211; Virtual Call Centres are created using many smaller centres in different locations and connecting them to one another. The advantage of virtual call centres is that they improve service levels, provide emergency backup and enable extended operating hours over isolated call centres. There are two methods used to [[Routing in the PSTN|route]] traffic around call centres: pre-delivery and post-delivery. Pre-delivery involves using an external switch to route the calls to the appropriate centre and post-delivery enables call centres to route a call they&amp;#8217;ve received to another call centre.
*''Interaction Centres'' &amp;#8211; As call centres evolve and deal with more media than [[telephony]] alone, some have taken to the term, &quot;interaction centre&quot;. [[Email]], [[Web Callback]] and more are gradually being added to the role.

== Criticism of call centres ==
Criticisms of call centres generally follow a number of common themes:

From Callers:
** operators working from a script.
** non-expert operators (call screening).
** overseas location, with language and accent problems.
** automated queuing systems.

From Staff:
** close scrutiny by management.
** low pay.
** restrictive working practices.

As detailed above, none of these are inherent in the call centre model, although many companies will experience some or all of the above while implementing a call centre approach.  As the science suggests, done properly, a call centre can offer the quickest route to resolution of customer queries, capitalising on the ready availability of highly skilled and intelligent people in some areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Islam}}
'''Caliph''' is the term or title for the Islamic leader of the ''[[Ummah]]'', or community of [[Islam]]. It is an Anglicized/Latinized version of the Arabic word &amp;#1582;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1601;&amp;#1577; or ''Khalīfah'' ({{Audio|Ar-khalifa.ogg|listen}}) which means &quot;successor&quot;, that is, successor to the prophet [[Muhammad]]. Some academics prefer to transliterate the term as ''Khalīf''. The caliph has often been referred to as ''Amīr al-Mu'minīn'' (&amp;#1571;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1585; &amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1572;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1606;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1606;) &quot;Prince of the Faithful,&quot; where &quot;prince&quot; is used in the context of &quot;commander.&quot;

After the first four Sunni caliphs ([[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], [[Uthman ibn Affan]], and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]), the title was claimed by the [[Umayyads]], the [[Abbasids]], and the [[Ottoman Empire | Ottomans]], as well as by other, competing lineages in [[Spain]], [[Northern Africa]], and [[Egypt]]. Most historical Muslim rulers simply titled themselves [[sultan]]s or [[emir]]s, and gave token obedience to a caliph who often had very little real authority. The title has been defunct since the [[Republic of Turkey]] abolished the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] caliphate in [[1924]]. 

==Origins of the caliphate==

Most academic scholars agree that Muhammad had not explicitly established how the Muslim community was to be governed after his death. Two questions faced these early Muslims: who was to succeed Muhammad, and what sort of authority he was to exercise. 
[[Image:Age of Caliphs.gif|225px|thumb|left|The Caliphate.]]

===Succession to Muhammad===

[[Fred Donner]], in his book ''The Early Islamic Conquests'' (1981), argues that the standard Arabian practice at the time was  for the prominent men of a kinship group, or tribe, to gather after a leader's death and choose a leader from amongst themselves. There was no specified procedure for this [[shura]], or consultation. Candidates  were usually from the same lineage as the deceased leader, but they were not necessarily his sons. Capable men who would lead well were preferred over an ineffectual direct heir. Muhammad, if he considered the matter of succession at all, would possibly have thought that the standard procedure would apply. 

This is also the argument advanced by [[Sunni]] Muslims, who believe that Muhammad's lieutenant [[Abu Bakr]] was chosen by the community and that this was the proper procedure. They further argue that a caliph is ideally chosen by election or community consensus, even though the caliphate soon became a hereditary office, or the prize of the strongest general. 

[[Shi'a]] Muslims disagree. They believe that Muhammad had given many indications that he considered [[Ali|ˤAlī ibn Abī Talib]], his cousin and son-in-law, as his chosen successor. They say that Abū Bakr seized power by force and trickery. All caliphs other than ˤAlī were usurpers. ˤAlī and his descendents are believed to have been the only proper Muslim leaders, or [[imam]]s. This matter is covered in much greater detail in the article [[Succession to Muhammad]], and in the article on [[Shi'a]] Islam. 

A third branch of Islam, the [[Ibadi]], believes that the caliphate rightly belongs to the greatest spiritual leader among Muslims, regardless of his lineage. They are currently an extremely small sect, found mainly in [[Oman]].

===The authority of the caliph===

''Who'' should succeed Muhammad was not the only issue that faced the early Muslims; they also had to clarify the extent of the leader's powers. Muhammad, during his lifetime, was not only the Muslim leader, but the Muslim prophet and the Muslim judge. All law and spiritual practice proceeded from Muhammad. Was his successor to have the same status? 

None of the early caliphs claimed to receive divine revelations, as did Muhammad; none of them claimed to be ''an-nabī'' &quot;a prophet&quot;. Muhammad's revelations were soon codified and written down as the [[Qur'an]], which was accepted as a supreme authority, limiting what a caliph could legitimately command.

However, there is some evidence that the early caliphs did believe that they had authority to rule in matters not specified in the Qur'an. They believed themselves to be the spiritual and temporal leaders of Islam, and insisted that implicit obedience to the caliph in all things was the hallmark of the good Muslim. The modern scholars [[Patricia Crone]] and Martin Hinds, in their book ''God's Caliph'', outline the evidence for an early, expansive view of the caliph's importance and authority. They argue that this view of the caliphate was eventually nullified (in Sunni Islam, at least) by the rising power of the [[ulema]], or Islamic scholars, clerics, and religious specialists. The ulema insisted on ''their'' right to determine what was legal and orthodox. The proper Muslim leader, in the ulema's opinion, was the leader who enforced the rulings of the ulema, rather than making rulings of his own. Conflict between caliph and ulema was a recurring theme in early Islamic history, and ended in the victory of the ulema. The caliph was henceforth limited to temporal rule. He would be considered a righteous caliph if he were guided by the ulema. Crone and Hinds argue that Shi'a Muslims, with their expansive view of the powers of the [[imamate]], have preserved some of the beliefs of early Islam. Crone and Hinds' thesis is not accepted by all scholars. 

Most Sunni Muslims now believe that the caliph has always been a merely temporal ruler, and that the ulema has always been responsible for adjudicating orthodoxy and Islamic law ([[shari'a]]). The first four caliphs are called the Rashidun, the Rightly Guided Caliphs, because they are believe to have followed the Qur'an and the way or [[sunnah]] of Muhammad in all things. This formulation itself presumes the Sunni ulema's view of history.

==The history of the caliphate==
 
Abū Bakr nominated Umar as his successor on his deathbed, and the Muslim community submitted to his choice. Uthman was elected by a council of electors, but was soon perceived by some Muslims to be ruling as a &quot;king&quot; rather than an elected leader. Uthman was killed by rebellious soldiers. ˤAlī then took control, but was not universally accepted as caliph. He faced numerous rebellions and was assassinated after a tumultuous rule of only five years. This period is known as the Fitna, or the [[first Islamic civil war]].  

One of ˤAlī's challengers was Muˤāwiyya, a relative of Uthman. After ˤAlī's death, Muˤāwiyya managed to overcome all other claimants to the Caliphate. He is remembered by history as [[Muawiyah I|Muˤāwiyya]], the founder of the [[Umayyad]] dynasty. Under Muˤāwiyya, the caliphate became a hereditary office.

Under the Umayyads, the Muslim empire grew rapidly. To the West, Muslim rule expanded across [[North Africa]] and into [[Spain]]. To the east, it expanded through [[Iran]] and ultimately to [[India]].

However, the Umayyad dynasty was not universally supported within Islam itself. Some Muslims supported prominent early Muslims like [[Zubayr ibn al-Awwam|az-Zubayr]]; others felt that only members of Muhammad's clan, the Banū Hisham, or his own lineage, the descendants of ˤAlī, should rule. There were numerous rebellions against the Umayyads, as well as splits within the Umayyad ranks (notably, the rivalry between Yaman and Qays). Eventually, supporters of the Banu Hisham and Alid claims united to bring down the Umayyads in [[750]].  However, the ''Shiˤat ˤAlī'' &quot;the Party of ˤAlī&quot;, were again disappointed when the [[Abbasid]] dynasty took power, as the Abbasids were descended from Muhammad's uncle, [[Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib]] and not from ˤAlī. Following this disappointment, the Shiˤat ˤAlī finally split from the majority Sunni Muslims and formed what are today the several Shiˤa denominations. 

The Abassids would provide an unbroken line of caliphs for over three centuries, consolidating Islamic rule and cultivating great intellectual and cultural developments in the Middle East. But by [[940]] the power of the caliphate under the Abassids was waning as non-Arabs, particularly the [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] (and later the [[Mamluks]] in Egypt in the latter half of the 13th century), gained influence, and [[sultan]]s and [[emir]]s became increasingly independent. However, the caliphate endured as both a symbolic position and a unifying entity for the Islamic world. 

During the period of the Abassid dyprinciples to non-profit organizations &amp;mdash; as the underlying structures of these two types of entity often resemble each other.

===Closely-held and public===

The institution most often referenced when the word &quot;corporation&quot; is used, as in the title of the movie ''[[The Corporation]]'', is a '''public''' or '''publicly traded''' corporation, the shares of which are traded on a public market (e.g., the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq) designed specifically for the buying and selling of shares of stock of corporations by and to the general public. Most of the largest businesses in the world are publicly traded corporations. However, the majority of corporations are said to be '''closely held''', '''privately held''' or '''close corporations''', meaning that no ready market exists for the trading of ownership interests. Many such corporations are owned and managed by a small group of businesspeople or companies, although the size of such a corporation can be as vast as the largest public corporations.

The affairs of publicly traded and closely held corporations are similar in many respects. The main difference in most countries is that publicly traded corporations have an additional burden of complying with securities laws, which (especially in the U.S.) grant further rights to stockholders to protect them from fraud or unfairness in connection with the sale and purchase of stock. The publicly traded corporation must usually follow much more stringent disclosure requirements, and sometimes additional procedural obligations in connection with major transactions (e.g. mergers) or events (e.g. elections of directors).

===Multinational corporations===
Following on the success of the corporate model at a national level, many corporations have become transnational or [[multinational corporation]]s: growing beyond national boundaries to attain sometimes remarkable positions of power and influence in the process of [[globalisation | globalising]].

The typical &quot;transnational&quot; or &quot;multinational&quot; may fit into a web of overlapping ownerships and directorships, with multiple branches and lines in different regions, many such sub-groupings comprising corporations in their own right. Growth by expansion may favour national or regional branches; growth by [[acquisition]] or [[merger]] can result in a plethora of groupings scattered around and/or spanning the globe, with structures and names which do not always make clear the structures of ownership and interaction.

In the spread of corporations across multiple continents, the importance of [[corporate culture]] has grown as a unifying factor and a counterweight to local national sensibilities and cultural awareness.

==National features==
There are various [[types of corporations]] throughout the world.
===United States===
In the [[United States]], several corporate forms exist; the name of &quot;corporation&quot; generally applies to a [[business]], run for profit, to which one of the [[states of the United States]] has granted a [[corporate charter]]. American corporations often charter as a [[Delaware Corporation]] in [[Delaware]], which charges no tax on activities outside the state and has courts experienced in [[commercial law]]. Corporations set up for [[privacy]] or asset protection often charter in [[Nevada]], which allows setting them up with no record of who owns them. The federal [[government of the United States]] usually does not grant corporate charters, except for some special instances such as [[Amtrak]] and [[Freddie Mac]] and banks and credit unions which opt not to receive charters from their home states.

Historically, most [[U.S. state]]s issued charters for fixed lengths of time (for example, a manufacturing corporation might receive a charter good for 40 years), and only by an act of the legislature.  Some individuals believed corporations should remain [[accountability|accountable]] to the government and used these limited charters as a means of forcing companies to do so. Investors, however, noted that it led to unhealthy amounts of political payoffs and graft.  Most states now charter unlimited-term corporations for a small fee, and possibly for a yearly tax.

Legally, corporations are accorded some [[corporate personhood]], i.e.  [[Constitutional]] [[rights]] similar to those held by persons.  The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled on this question in the [[1886]] case ''[[Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad]]''.

Many countries around the world now have corporate laws based upon state laws from the [[United States]]. For example, corporations in [[Japan]] are organized under a variant of the corporate law of [[Illinois]], and corporations in [[Saudi Arabia]] follow corporate laws copied from [[New York]].

The oldest corporation in the [[United States]], and the oldest in North America, is the [[President and Fellows of Harvard College]] (also known as the Harvard Corporation), chartered in [[1650]].

===Canada===
In [[Canada]] both the federal government and the [[Provinces of Canada|province]]s have corporate statutes, and thus a corporation may have a provincial or a federal charter. Many older corporations in Canada stem from [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] passed before the introduction of general corporation law.  The oldest corporation in Canada, and second oldest in North America, is the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], chartered in [[1670]]. Federally recognized corporations are regulated by the [[Canada Business Corporations Act]].

===German-speaking countries===
[[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] recognize two forms of corporation: the [[Aktiengesellschaft]] (AG), analogous to public corporations in the English-speaking world, and the [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung]] (GmbH), similar to (and an inspiration for) the modern [[limited liability company]].

==Corporate taxation==
In many countries, including the United States and United Kingdom, corporate profits are taxed at a [[corporate tax]] rate, and dividends paid to shareholders are taxed at a separate rate. Such a system is sometimes referred to as &quot;double taxation,&quot; because any profits distributed to shareholders will eventually be taxed twice.  One solution to this (as in the case of UK tax system) is for the recipient of the dividend to be entitled to a tax credit which addresses the fact that the profits represented by the dividend have already been taxed.  The company profit being passed on is therefore effectively only taxed at the rate of tax paid by the eventual recipient of the dividend.

Where a double taxation system exists, the additional tax burden is often an incentive for smaller businesses to organize in the form of a partnership, limited liability company, or other type of entity that is not separately taxed. Such entities are often called &quot;pass-through entities.&quot;

In the [[United States]], business corporations owe taxes according to two basic categories. A &quot;[[C corporation]]&quot; must pay [[corporate tax]]es, while &quot;[[S corporation]]s&quot; pay no corporate taxes but instead pass profits and losses directly to their owners (the stockholders) who declare such profits and losses as part of their personal [[income tax|taxable income]]. An S corporation must generally have no more than 100 stockholders, who must be [[natural person]]s (not other corporations or entities), must reside in the United States, and must consent to the classification; moreover, the S corporation can only issue a single class of stock. As a result of these restrictions, all publicly traded corporations and many larger close corporations have C corporation status.  Certain kinds of [[investment company|investment companies]] are also exempt from corporate income taxes, provided they distribute almost all of their income to shareholders in the form of [[dividend]]s or [[capital gain]]s distributions.

==Other commercial entities==

Several other forms of business entity exist under the laws of various countries. These include:

* [[Partnership]]
* [[Limited partnership]] (LP)
* [[Limited liability partnership]] (LLP)
* [[Limited liability company]] (LLC)
* [[Limited company]] (Ltd.)
* [[Sole proprietorship]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Fairchild_channel-f.gif|thumb|right|The Fairchild Channel F]]
The '''Fairchild Channel F''' is the world's first cartridge-based [[video game console]]. It was released by [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] (ostensibly by their parent company though) in August 1976 at a cost of $169.95. At this point it was known as the '''Video Entertainment System''', or '''VES''', but when [[Atari]] released their [[Atari 2600|VCS]] the next year, Fairchild quickly re-named it.

==The Channel F console==

The Channel F was based on the [[Fairchild F8]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]], invented by [[Robert Noyce]] before he left Fairchild to start his own company, [[Intel]]. The F8 was so early that the [[process technology]] of the era couldn't fit all the needed circuitry onto a single chip, and the F8 was in fact a &quot;family&quot; of chips that had to be wired together to form a complete CPU. The video was quite basic, although it was in color which was a large step forward from the contemporary [[PONG]] machines. Sound was played through an internal speaker, rather than in the TV.

The controllers were a kind of joystick without a base; the main body was a large hand grip with a triangular &quot;cap&quot; on top, the top being the portion that actually moved. It could be used as both a joystick and paddle (twist), and pushed down to operate as a fire button. The unit contained a small compartment for storing the controllers when moving it: useful because the wiring was notoriously flimsy and even normal movement could break it.

Only 20 cartridges were released for the system (typically at $19.95), despite its initial popularity. However, the games are generally detested. One reviewer described the racing game (every system seemed to have one at the time) as something like &quot;losing a toe in an industrial accident.&quot;

The biggest effect of the Channel F in the market was to spur [[Atari]] into releasing their next-generation console that was then in design. Currently named &quot;Stella&quot; the machine was also going to use cartridges, and after seeing the Channel F they realized they needed to get it out as soon as possible before the market was flooded with cartridge based machines. With cash flow dwindling as sales of their existing Pong-based systems dried up, they were forced to sell to [[Warner Communications]] in order to gain the capital they needed. Naming their system as a takeoff of the VES, when the [[Atari 2600|Atari VCS]] was released a year later it had considerably better graphics.

==The Channel F System II==

[[Image:Fairchild_channel-f_system_2.jpg|250px|thumb|right| The Channel F System II]]

Fairchild decided to compete with the VCS, and started a re-design as the '''Channel F System II'''. The major changes were in design, the controllers were removable from the base unit instead of being wired directly into it, the storage compartment was moved to the rear of the unit, and the sound was now mixed into the TV signal so the unit no longer needed a speaker. This version featured a simpler and more modern-looking case design. However by this time the market was in the midst of the first video game crash, and Fairchild eventually threw in the towel and exited the market.

Some time in 1979 Zircon International bought the rights to the Channel F and released the '''Channel F System II'''. Only six new games were released after the release of the second system before its death, several of which were developed at Fairchild before they sold it off.

A number of licensed versions were released in Europe, including the '''Luxor Video Entertainment System''' in Sweden, '''Adman Grandstand''' in the UK, and the '''Saba Videoplay''', '''Nordmende Teleplay''' and '''ITT Tele-Match Processor''', from Germany.

== Playing Channel F over the phone ==

By the use of some special circuitry, it is possible to turn voice into simple digital signals. In the 70s, it seems someone did just this to Channel F. The voice input could be connected to a phone line, and thus someone on a phone at the other end could make loud noises to trigger the button on a Channel F.

It appears this was employed in a TV show which aired as a locally produced show in many markets in the US (some say a human merely listened to the pows and pressed a controller button instead of a circuit doing it). There were also reports of the same kind of show airing in Australia. This show was usually called &quot;TV Pow&quot;. It was organized as a call-in game show. A person would send a letter to say they wanted to be on the show, and the organizers would select contestants and arrange to call them during the show. The host would small talk with the contestant a while and prep them to play the game. When the host said &quot;go&quot;, the output of a Channel F playing shooting gallery would be aired on the station. The voice of the contestant could be heard over the game, and the contestant could only activate the &quot;fire&quot; functionality of the game by saying a world loudly into the phone (the word &quot;pow&quot; was suggested and usually used).

Shooting Gallery was comprised of a target which would move down the far right-hand side of the screen at an even rate. Somewhere left of that target (it varied) would be the player's &quot;gun&quot;. The gun looked exactly like the &quot;bat&quot; in Pong, although sometimes it would be turned at a 45 degree angle. When the player fired the &quot;bullet&quot; would come out perpendicular to the gun in the middle of the long sides.

To play TV Pow, the player would have to watch the target move down the screen on the TV station and say &quot;pow&quot; into the phone when he wanted to fire at the target. The system would then fire at the target. Once the target passed by the spot the gun was aimed at, the player could only wait until the target went off the bottom and came out at the top again for a fresh run.

Even in the days of all-analog production, there was significant lag in producing and transmitting a TV signal. The player would experience all this lag and it must have made playing the game somewhat more difficult.

=== Strategies ===

Perhaps due to this lag or perhaps just because most of the contestants were somewhat young and impatient, very often the player would throw any kind of ideas of timing out the window and just bark &quot;pow pow pow pow pow&quot; into the phone to fire as fast and as often as possible. It at times seemed like a kind of a speed contest, with the words from the fastest contestants running together.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''Alphabetical redirects here.  For the alphabet, [[Alphabet|click here]]. For the meal, see [[collations]].''

In [[textual criticism]] and [[bibliography]], '''[[collation]]''' is the reading of two (or more) texts side-by-side in order to note their differences.

In [[printing]] and [[photocopying]], '''collation''' is the arrangement of pages in order when several copies of a document are [[bookbinding|bound]] after printing or copying.

'''Collation''' can also refer to the detailed [[bibliography|bibliographical description]] of a book or the comparison of the physical makeup of two copies of a book.

In [[library and information science]] and [[computer science]], '''collation''' is the assembly of written information into a standard order. In common usage, this is called '''alphabetisation''', though collation is not limited to ordering letters of the [[alphabet]]. Collating lists of words or names into alphabetical order is the basis of most office filing systems, library catalogues, and books of reference.

Collation differs from '''classification''' in that classification is concerned with arranging information into logical categories, while collation is concerned with the [[partial order]]ing of those categories.

Collation differs from a [[sort algorithm]] in that whereas sort algorithms decide which pairs of elements to compare, collation defines a [[total order]] '''&amp;le;''' on pairs that the sort algorithm uses to determine when to swap the elements (usually a [[lexicographical order]]). In fact, sort algorithms are often implemented to take a collation as an input.

==Collation systems==
===Numerical sorting===
The simplest collation system is '''numerical sorting''': ordering numbers by their magnitude.
For example, the list of numbers ''4 · 17 · 3 · 5'' collates to ''3 · 4 · 5 · 17''.

While this might appear to work only for numbers, [[computer]]s can use this method for any textual information since computers internally use [[character set]]s which assign a numeric ''code point'' to each letter or [[glyph]].
For example, a computer using [[ASCII]] code (or any of its [[superset]]s such as [[Unicode]]) and numerical sorting would collate the list of characters ''a · b · C · d · $'' to ''$ · C · a · b · d''.

Why the curious &quot;[[ASCIIbetical order]]&quot;?
The numerical values that ASCII uses are ''$'' = 36, ''a'' = 97, ''b'' = 98, ''C'' = 67, and ''d'' = 100.

This style of collation is commonly used, often with the refinement of converting uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ASCII values, since most people do not expect capitalised words to jump the head of the list.

This system fails to properly sort numbers written as text because a human-readable number stored in a computer text string is a sequence of numeric codes for [[numeral]]s.

For example, ''156.1'' (a string) is represented by ASCII code as the five ordered numbers 49, 53, 54, 46, and 49; ''35.29'' corresponds to 51, 53, 46, 50, and 57; because 49 comes before 51, ''156.1'' comes before ''35.29''.

===Alphabetical sorting===
A more elaborate collation system is '''alphabetical sorting''', which orders words or names based on the conventional order of letters in an [[alphabet]] or [[abjad]] (most of which have a single conventional order).
Each ''n''th letter is compared with the ''n''th letter of other words in the list, starting at the first letter of each word and advancing to the second, third, fourth, and so on, until the order is established.

For example, the list of words ''foo · bar · bibble'' collates to ''bar · bibble · foo'' because (1) ''f'' comes after ''b'' so ''bar'' and ''bibble'' both precede ''foo'' and (2) ''a'' comes before ''i'' so ''bar'' precedes ''bibble''.

Numerical sorting on a computer and alphabetical sorting often produce the same ordering for [[English language|English]].

The difference between computer-style numerical sorting and true alphabetical sorting becomes obvious in languages using an extended [[Latin alphabet]].

For example, the thirty-letter alphabet of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] treats ''ñ'' as a basic letter following ''n'', and formerly treated ''ch'' and ''ll'' as basic letters following ''c'', ''l'', respectively. ''Ch'' and ''ll'' are still considered letters, but are alphabetized as digraphs. (The new alphabetization rule was issued by the [[Royal Spanish Academy]] in [[1994]].
On the other hand, the letter ''rr'' follows ''rqu'' as expected, both with and without the 1994 alphabetization rule.)
A numeric sort may order ''ñ'' incorrectly following ''z'' and treat ''ch'' as ''c + h'', also incorrect when using pre-1994 alphabetization.

Similar differences between computer numeric sorting and alphabetic sorting occur in [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] (''aa'' is ordered as ''å'' at the end of the alphabet), [[German language|German]] (''ß'' is ordered as ''s + s''; ''ä, ö, ü'' are ordered as ''a + e, o + e, u + e'' in phone books, but as ''o'' elsewhere, and behind ''o'' in Austria), [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] (''&amp;#240;'' follows ''d''), English (''&amp;#230;'' is ordered as ''a + e''), and many other languages.

Usually the [[space (punctuation)|space]]s or [[hyphen]]s between words are ignored.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about monetary coins. For other meanings see: [[Coin (disambiguation)]]''
{{Numismatics}}
A '''coin''' is usually a piece of hard material, generally [[metal]] and usually in the shape of a [[disc]], which is issued by a government to be used as a form of [[money]].  Along with [[banknote]]s, coins make up the cash forms of all modern money systems.  Coins are usually used for lower-valued units, and banknotes are usually used for the higher values; also, in most money systems, the highest value coin is worth less than the lowest-value note. 

==Collecting coins==

See [[Coin collecting]] and [[Numismatics]] for more information on the collecting of coins, bank notes, [[token coins]] and [[Exonumia]].

==The value of a coin==

The market exchange value of a coin comes from its [[historic value]], and/or the [[intrinsic value]] of the component metal (for example [[gold coin]]s, [[silver coin]]s or [[platinum coin]]s).

However, in modern times, most coins are made of a [[base metal]] and their value comes strictly from their status as [[fiat money]]. This means that the value of the coin is decreed by government fiat rather than agreed by the people, which really makes it less a coin and more a [[Token (Numismatics)|token]] in the strictest sense.

To distinguish between these two types of coins, as well as from other forms of tokens which have been used as money, monetary scholars have defined three criteria that an object must meet to be a &quot;true coin&quot;.  These criteria are:

# It must be made of a valuable material, and trade for close to the market value of that material.
# It must be of a standardized weight and purity.
# It must be marked to identify the authority that guarantees the content.

By the above definition, the invention and first known usage of coins comes from the Kingdom of [[Lydia]] circa 643-630 B.C.  Under three generations of Lydian kings, the money of Lydia gradually moved from being lumps of [[electrum]] (a naturally occurring alloy of silver and gold) to coins of a guaranteed weight and purity, marked with the seal of the King.  True coins also developed very close to this time frame in both [[India]] and [[China]].

The [[history of coins]] is a long and interesting one. For example, in 1979 and 1980, a Chinese architectural team excavating the region surrounding the ancient kingdom of [[Loulan]] discovered some [[Mesolithic]] stone [[tools]] and '''coins''' (see [[Loulan#Modern Chinese Expeditions|Loulan: Modern Chinese Expeditions]]).

==Coin debasement==

[[image:US_price_history.png|frame|[[United States|US]] price levels, 1800&amp;ndash;2000&lt;br&gt;Red line marks leaving silver standard]]

Throughout history, governments have been known to create more coinage than their supply of precious metals would allow. By replacing some fraction of a coin's precious metal content with a base metal (often [[copper]] or [[nickel]]), the intrinsic value of each individual coin was reduced (thereby ''&quot;debasing&quot;'' their money), allowing the coining authority to produce more coins than would otherwise be possible.  [[Debasement]] of money almost always leads to price [[inflation]] unless [[price control]]s are also instituted by the governing authority.  Some consider a classic example of this phenomenon to be the behavior of price levels in the [[United States]] since [[1964]] (the last year circulating [[United States Coin]]s were minted of 90 percent silver).  It should be remembered, however, that for most of the era of U.S. silver coinage, such coins were actually fiat money, because the value of silver was relatively low.   For example, in 1960, the silver in a dime was worth less than four cents.  It also should not be inferred that such debasement and inflation were unique to the U.S.  Virtually every other country debased their coinage too.  The United Kingdom saw similar inflation during the same era.   What is unique to the United States, among the developed countries, is that the U.S. has never revised its coinage system to accommodate this inflation, and as a result, coins in America today are scarcely regarded as &quot;money&quot; in any practical sense.  Increasingly common are coin counting machines which charge money to consumers for converting their &quot;coins&quot; into &quot;cash&quot;.

==Features of modern coinage==

The milled, or reeded, edges still found on many coins were originally designed to show that none of the valuable metal had been shaved off the coin.  Prior to the use of milled edges, circulating coins suffered from &quot;shaving,&quot; a common problem where unscrupulous persons would shave a small amount of precious metal from the edge of a circulating coin. Circulating unmilled British [[sterling silver]] coins were known to be shaved to almost half of their minted weight.  This form of debasement in [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] England led to the formulation of [[Gresham's Law]]. The monarch would have to periodically recall, paying only bullion value of the silver, and re-mint circulating coins.

Traditionally the side of a coin carrying a bust of a monarch or other authority, or a [[national emblem]], is called the ''obverse'', or colloquially ''heads''. The back side is called the ''reverse'', or colloquially ''tails''. However, the rule is violated in some cases. [http://www.ucalgary.ca/~cns/euro.html] Another rule is that the side carrying the year of [[mint (coin)|mint]]ing is the obverse, although most [[Canada|Canadian]] coins, and all [[Japan]]ese coins, are an exception.

The orientation of the obverse with respect to the reverse differs between countries. Some coins have [[coin orientation]], where the coin must be flipped vertically to see the other side; other coins, such as British coins, have [[medallic orientation]], where the coin must be flipped horizontally to see the other side.

Coins that are not round (British [[British Fifty Pence coin|50 pence]] for example) usually have an odd number of sides, with the edges rounded off. This is so that the coin has a [[Curve of constant width|constant diameter]], and therefore will be recognised by machines whichever way it is inserted. If a coin had an even number of sides this would not be true.  Some older such designs remain, such as the [[dodecagon|12-sided]] [[Australian dollar|Australian 50 cent coin]].

Coins are popularly used as a sort of two-sided [[dice|die]]; in order to choose between two options with a random possibility, one choice will be labeled &quot;heads&quot; and the other &quot;tails,&quot; and a coin will be flipped or &quot;tossed&quot; to see whether the heads or tails side comes up on top. See [[Bernoulli trial]]; a fair coin is defined to have the probability of heads (in the parlance of Bernoulli trials, a &quot;success&quot;) of exactly 0.5. A widely publicized example of an asymmetrical coin is the [[Belgian euro coins|Belgian one euro coin]] [http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn1748].  See also [[coin flipping]].

Coins are sometimes falsified to make one side weigh more. Such a coin is often said to be &quot;weighted.&quot;

Some coins, called [[Bracteate|bracteates]], are so thin they can only be struck on one side.

Bi-metallic coins are used for comemorative purposes and in the 1990s,France used a tri-metallic coin.

Coins with guitar shapes were issued in Somalia this year.
Poland issued a fan-shaped 10 zloty coin but the oddest coin ever was the 2002 Nauru,Europe-shaped coin.

A '''cubewano''' is a [[Kuiper belt]] object, [[orbit]]ing beyond [[Pluto]] and not controlled by [[orbital resonance|resonances]] with [[Neptune]]. Cubewanos, called also ''Classical'' Kuiper Belt objects, have semi-major axes in 40-50 [[astronomical unit|AU]] range and, unlike Pluto, do not cross Neptune’s orbit.
  
The odd name is derived from the first [[Trans-Neptunian object|trans-Neptunian object]] found, {{mpl|(15760) 1992 QB|1}}. Later objects were called &quot;QB1-o's&quot;, or cubewanos.

Objects identified as cubewanos include:

*{{mpl|(15760) 1992 QB|1}}
*{{mpl|2005 FY|9}} the largest known cubewano and one of the largest [[trans-Neptunian object]]s
*{{mpl|2003 EL|61}}, notable for its two moons and rapid rotation (3.9h) 
*[[(50000) Quaoar]]
*[[(20000) Varuna]]
*[[(19521) Chaos]]
*[[(53311) Deucalion]]
==Orbits==
[[Image:TheKuiperBelt_55AU_Classical.svg|right|thumb|400px|Large cubewanos and [[plutino]]s.]]
Most classical Kuiper objects are found between the 2:3 [[orbital resonance]] with Neptune (populated by [[plutino]]s) and the 1:2 resonance. The diagram illustrates larger cubewanos with [[semi-major axis]] on X axis. The [[eccentricity]] of the orbits is represented by red segments (extending from [[perihelion]] to [[aphelion]]) with [[inclination]] represented on Y axis. 

The largest [[plutino]]s ([[Pluto]], [[90482 Orcus]] and [[28978 Ixion]]) are also plotted for comparison (in grey). [[50000 Quaoar]], for example, has a typical, near circular (short red segment), close to the [[ecliptic]] orbit. Plutinos on the other hand, have more eccentric orbits bringing some of them closer to the Sun than [[Neptune]] (marked as 1:1 resonance).

The majority of objects, so called '''cold''' population, have low inclination, near circular orbits. (the brightest: {{mp|1997 CS|29}}, {{mp|2001 QT|297}} and {{mp|2001 QS|322}} are shown on the diagram). A smaller population, named '''hot''', is characterised by highly inclined, more eccentric orbits&lt;ref&gt;D.Jewitt,A.Delsanti ''The Solar System Beyond The Planets'',to appear in the book ''Solar System Update'', Springer-Praxis Ed., Horwood, Blondel and Mason, 2006. [http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/papers/2006/DJ06.pdf Preprint version (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt;.
=== Distribution ===
[[Image:TheKuiperBelt_55AU_ClassicalAndPlutinos.svg|right|thumb|400px|Distribution of cubewanos and [[plutino]]s.]]
The distribution of all known cubewanos (532 as of February, 2006) is plotted on the second diagram. The small inserts on the right show [[histogram]]s for orbit inclinations '''i''' (5° interval) and eccentricity '''e''' (interval 0.05).&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 
The vast majority of objects (more than &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) have inclination &lt; 5° and eccentricity &lt;0.1. The distribution of semi-major axis '''a''', also shown, illustrates the preference for the middle of the main belt; arguably, smaller objects close to the limiting resonances have been either captured into resonance or have their orbits modified by Neptune.

The inserts on the left side of the diagram compare the populations of cubewanos and plutinos &lt;ref&gt;Minor Planet Circular 2005-X77 [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/mpec/K05/K05X77.html Distant Minor planets] was used for plutinos' orbits classification. The updated data can be found in [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/mpec/K06/K06D28.html MPC 2006-D28].
&lt;/ref&gt; using eccentricity versus inclination plots. Each small square represents a given range for both the eccentricity '''e''' and the inclination '''i''' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  The relative population of objects within this range is represented with ‘cartographic’ colours (from small numbers plotted as green ''valleys'' to brown ''peaks''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. 

The two populations are quite different: more than 30% of all cubewanos are on low inclination, near circular orbits (the low bottom corner ‘peak’). The parameters of plutinos’ orbits are more evenly distributed with a local maximum in moderate eccentricities in  0.15-0.2 range and low inclinations 5-10°. 
See also the comparison with [[scattered disk#Scattered objects versus classical objects|scattered disk objects]].

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;Distribution of plutinos is plotted but excluded from cubewanos’ histograms.&lt;/small&gt; &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;As near-circular orbits occupy the first column (e&lt;0.05) and the orbits with the lowest inclination (i&lt;5 degrees) occupy the lowest row, the square in the bottom left corner represents the number of near circular, very lowly inclined orbits.&lt;/small&gt; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;A grey square represents a  single object (an outlier) in this range.&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
=== Orbit plots ===
[[Image:TheKuiperBelt_Projections_55AU_Classical_Plutinos.svg|left|thumb|240px|The orbits of [[plutino]]s and classical objects.]]
The graph on the left represents polar and ecliptic views of the (aligned) orbits of the classical objects (in blue) together with the plutinos (in red)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The solid blue ring, resulting from hundreds of overlapping orbits of the classical objects, fully deserves the name of the main (classical or cubewanos) '''belt'''. Unlike the classical objects with the orbits entirely outside, the plutinos approach, or even cross, the orbit of Neptune (in yellow).

On the ecliptic view, the yellow arc represents Neptune’s orbit (at ~30AU). The perihelia, typically inside Neptune’s orbit for the plutinos, and always safely outside for the cubewanos, are the distinctive attribute between the two families. Hot cubewanos can also be easily distinguished by their inclination, the plutinos typically keeping orbits below 20°. 

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;For roughly a half of known TNO the orbits are not yet known with the precision sufficient for the classification (a particularly delicate task for resonant objects).&lt;/small&gt;

A '''congressional-executive agreement''' is an agreement with a foreign power that has been approved by [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] and the [[United States]].  Unlike a [[treaty]], in the US constitutional sense of that term, it cannot cov like salary or benefits, then the spy has breached the contract by revealing its existence.  It is thus unenforceable on that ground, as well as the public policy of maintaining [[national security]] (since a disgruntled agent might try to reveal ''all'' the government's secrets during his lawsuit).

==Bilateral v. unilateral contracts==
Contracts may be bilateral or unilateral.  The more common of the two, a bilateral contract, is an agreement in which each of the parties to the contract makes a promise or promises to the other party.  For example, in a contract for the sale of a home, the buyer promises to pay the seller $200,000 in exchange for the seller's promise to deliver title to the property.  

In a unilateral contract, only one party to the contract makes a promise.  A typical example is the reward contract: A promises to pay a reward to B if B finds A's dog.  B is not obliged to find A's dog, but A is obliged to pay the reward to B if B finds the dog.  In this example, the finding of the dog is a [[condition precedent]] to A's obligation to pay.  

An offer of a unilateral contract may often be made to many people (or 'to the world') by means of an advertisement.  In that situation, acceptance will only occur on satisfaction of the condition (such as the finding of the offeror's dog).  If the condition is something that only one party can perform, both the offeror and offeree are protected &amp;mdash; the offeror is protected because he will only ever be contractually obliged to one of the many offerees; and the offeree is protected, because if she does perform the condition, the offeror will be contractually obliged to pay her.  

In unilateral contracts, the requirement that acceptance be communicated to the offeror is waived.  The offeree accepts by performing the condition, and the offeree's performance is also treated as the price, or [[consideration]], for the offeror's promise.

The most common type of unilateral contract is the insurance contract.  The insurance company promises to pay the insured a stated amount of money on the happening of an event if the insured pays premiums; note that the insured does not make any promise to pay the premiums.

Courts generally favor bilateral contracts. The general rule in the United States is: &quot;In case of doubt, an offer is interpreted as inviting the offeree to accept ''either'' by promising to perform what the offer requests ''or'' by rendering the performance, as the offeree chooses.&quot; ''Restatement (Second) of Contracts'' § 32 (1981) (emphasis added). Here the law attempts to provide some protection from the risk of revocation in a unilateral contract to the offeree. Note that if the offer specifically requests performance rather than a promise, a unilateral contract will exist. See [[option contract]]s for more information on protection given to the offeree in a unilateral contract.

==Express and implied contracts==
A contract can be either an express contract or an implied contract. An express contract is one in which the terms are expressed verbally, either orally or in writing. An implied contract is one in which some of the terms are not expressed in words.

===Implied in fact or implied in law===
An implied contract can either be [[implied in fact contract|implied in fact]] or [[implied in law contract|implied in law]]. A contract which is implied in fact is one in which the circumstances imply that parties have reached an agreement even though they have not done so expressly.  For example, by going to a doctor for a physical, a patient agrees that he will pay a fair price for the service. If he refuses to pay after being examined, he has breached a contract implied in fact.

===Quasi-contract===
A contract which is implied in law is also called a [[quasi-contract]], because it is not in fact a contract; rather, it is a means for the courts to remedy situations in which one party would be unjustly enriched were he or she not required to compensate the other.  For example, an unconscious patient treated by a doctor at the scene of an accident has not agreed (either expressly or by implication) to pay the doctor for emergency services, but the patient would be unjustly enriched by the doctor's services were the patient not required to compensate the doctor.

==Incorporation of terms==
===Course of dealing===
If two parties have regularly conducted business on certain terms, it may be reasonable to presume that in future dealings where there is no contract, the parties wish to incorporate the terms of the previous contracts. However, if a party wishes to incorporate terms by course of dealing, the original document must have been contractual in nature, and delivery receipts may not fit this description. In Australia, there is a further requirement that the document was procured after formation.

==Express and implied terms==
===Different types of statements===
Whether a statement is a term of a contract is important because only if a promise is a term of the contract can a party sue for the breach of the contract. Statements can be split into the following types:
* '''Puff (sales talk):''' If no reasonable person hearing this statement would take it seriously, it is a puff, and no action in contract is available if the statement proves to be wrong.
* '''Representation:''' A representation is a statement of fact made to induce another person to enter into a contract and which does induce them to enter into a contract, but it is one that the maker of the statement does not guarantee its truth. If the statement proves to be incorrect, it cannot be enforced, as it is not a term of the contract, but it may prove to be a [[misrepresentation]], whereupon other remedies are available.
* '''Term:''' A term is similar to a representation, but the truth of the statement is guaranteed by the person who made the statement. The test is an objective test.

Factors that a court may take into account in determining the nature of a statement include:
* '''Timing:''' If the contract was concluded soon after the statement was made, this is a strong indication that the statement induced the person to enter into the contract.
* '''Content of statement:''' It is necessary to consider what was said in the given context, which has nothing to do with the importance of a statement.
* '''Knowledge and expertise:''' In ''Oscar Chess Ltd v. Williams'' [1957] 1 WLR 370, a person selling a car to a second-hand car dealer stated that it was a 1948 Morris, when in fact it was a 1939 model car. It was held that the statement did not become a term because a reasonable person in the position of the car dealer would not have thought that an inexperienced person would have guaranteed the truth of the statement.

===Terms implied in fact===
The Privy Council proposed a five stage test in ''BP Refinery Western Port v. Shire of Hastings'':
# '''Reasonableness and equitableness:''' The implied term must be reasonable and equitable.
# '''Business efficacy:''' The implied term must be necessary for the business efficacy of the contract. For instance, if the term simply causes the contract to operate better, that does not fit this criterion.
# '''Obviousness:''' The term is so obvious that it goes without saying. Furthermore, there must be one and only one thing that would be implied by the parties. For example, in ''Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v. State Rail Authority of New South Wales'' (1982) 149 CLR 337, a term regarding the inability of construction company to work three shifts a day could not be implied because it was unclear what form it would have taken.
# '''Clear expression:''' The term must be capable of clear expression. No specific technical knowledge should be required.
# '''Consistency:''' The implied term may not contradict an express term.

In Australia, the High Court has ruled that the test in BP Refinery applies only to [[formal contract]]s, while the test in ''Byrne and Frew v. Australian Airlines Ltd'' (1995) 185 CLR 410 shall apply to [[informal contract]]s:
* '''Necessity:''' The term must be necessary to ensure ''reasonable'' or ''effective'' operation of a contract of the nature before the court.
* '''Consistency:''' The implied term may not contradict an express term (same as for formal contracts).
* '''Clear expression:''' The term must be capable of clear expression (same as for formal contracts).
* '''Obvious:''' McHugh and Gummow JJ have stated that it must also be obvious.

===Terms implied in law===
These are terms that have been implied into standardised relationships. The other difference between this and terms implied in fact is that the test is one of necessity (''Liverpool City Council v. Irwin'' [1976] 2 WLR 562); a necessary term is one where the contract is rendered worthless or nugatory if it is without it.

===Terms implied by custom or trade===
You are generally bound by the custom of the industry that you are in. To imply a term due to custom or trade, you must prove the existence of the custom, which must be notorious, certain, legal and reasonable (''Con-stan Industries of Australia Pty Ltd v. Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Ltd'' (1986) 160 CLR 226).  See also ''Frigaliment Importing Co., Ltd., v. B.N.S. International Sales Corp.'', 190 F. Supp. 116 (S.D.N.Y. 1960) (plaintiff failed to prove what he meant by &quot;chicken&quot;) and U.C.C. § 1-205.

==Agreements to negotiate==
It is common for lengthy negotiations to be written into a heads of agreement document that includes a clause to the effect that the rest of the agreement is to be negotiated. Although these cases may appear to fall into the category of agreement to agree, courts nowadays (at least in Australia) will imply an obligation to negotiate in [[good faith]] provided that certain conditions are satisfied (''Coal Cliff Collieries Pty Ltd v. Sijehama Pty Ltd'' (1991) 24 NSWLR 1):
* Negotiations were well-advanced and the large proportion of terms have been worked out; and
* There exists some mechanism to resolve disputes if the negotiations broke down.

The test of whether one has acted in good faith is a subjective one; the cases suggest honesty, and possibly also reasonably.

==&quot;Subject to&quot; contracts==
If a contract specifies &quot;subject to contract&quot;, it may fall into one of three categories (''Masters v. Cameron'' (1954) 91 CLR 353):
# The parties are immediately bound to the bargain, but they intend to restate the deal in a formalised contract that will not have a different effect; or
# The parties have completely agreed to the terms, but have made the execution of some terms in the contract conditional on the creation of a formalised contract; or
# It is merely an agreement to agree, and the deal will not be concluded until the formalised contract has been drawn up.

If a contract specifies &quot;subject to finance&quot;, it imposes obligations on the purchaser (''Meehan v. Jones'' (1982) 149 CLR 571):
* The purchaser must seek finance; and
* When offers of finance arrive, the purchaser must make a decision as to whether the offers of finance are suitable.

Once again, there is an element of good faith involved.

This may also refer to contingent conditions, which come under two categories: condition precedent and condition subsequent.
Conditions precedent are conditions that have to be complied with before performance of a contract.
With conditions subsequent, parties have to perform until the condition is not met.
Failure of a condition does not void the contract, it is just regarded as voidable.

==Statutory law applicable to contracts==
The rules by which many contracts are governed are provided in specialized statutes that deal with particular subjects.  Most countries, for example, have statutes which deal directly with [[contract of sale|sale of goods]], [[lease]] transactions and [[trade practices]].   For example, most American states have adopted Article 2 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], which regulates contracts for the sale of goods.

There are also many acts around the world which deal with specific types of transactions and businesses.  For example, the  states of [[California]] and [[New York]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] have statutes that govern the provision of services to customers by health studios, and the UK has the Sale of Goods Act 1979 which governs the contracts between sellers and buyers.

==Remedies==
===Damages===
Typically, the remedy for [[breach of contract]] is an award of money [[damages]]. Courts usually adopt one of three ways of calculating the value of damages. 

The most common is to assess the sum which would restore the injured party to the economic position that he or she expected from performance of the promise or promises (known as an &quot;[[expectation measure]]&quot; or &quot;benefit-of-the-bargain&quot; measure of damages).  

When it is either not possible or desirable to award damages measured in that way, a court may award money damages designed to restore the injured party to the economic position that he or she had occupied at the time the contract was entered (known as the &quot;reliance measure&quot;), or designed to prevent the breaching party from being unjustly enriched (&quot;[[restitution]]&quot;). 

===Specific perfomance===
There may be circumstances in which it would be unjust to permit the defaulting party simply to buy out the injured party with damages. For example where an art collector purchases a rare painting and the vendor refuses to deliver, the collector's damages would be equal to the sum paid. 

The court may make an order of what is called &quot;[[specific performance]]&quot;, requiring that the contract be performed.  In some circumstances a court will order a party to perform his or her promise (an order of &quot;[[specific performance]]&quot;) or issue an order, known as an &quot;injunction,&quot; that a party refrain from doing something that would breach the contract.    

Both an order for specific performance and an injunction are discretionary remedies, originating for the most part in [[equity]]. Neither is available as of right and in most jurisdictions and most circumstances a court will not normally order specific performance. The one general exception to this rule is the contract of sale of real estate which, in most jurisdictions, is enforceable by specific performance as real property is considered unique. However, even in this case the defenses to an action in equity (such as [[laches]] or [[unclean hands]]) may act as a bar to specific performance.

==Procedure==
In the United States, in order to obtain damages for breach of contract or to obtain specific performance, the injured party may file a civil (non-criminal) lawsuit, usually in a state court, or petition a private arbitrator to decide the contract issues presented.  

Many contracts provide that all contract disputes must be arbitrated by the parties to the contract, rather than litigated in courts.  By law, some contracts, including most securities brokerage contracts, must be arbitrated; other contracts are referred by courts as a matter of local law or policy.  Arbitrated judgements are generally enforced and appealed in the same manner as ordinary court judgements; a majority of states have adopted the [[Uniform Arbitration Act]] to facilitate the enforcement of arbitrated judgements.

In [[England and Wales]], a contract may be enforced by use of a [[claim]], or in urgent cases by applying for an [[interim injunction]] to prevent a breach.

==Theoretical considerations==
[[Contract theory]] is the body of legal theory that addresses normative and conceptual questions in contract law. One of the most important questions asked in contract theory is why contracts are enforced. One prominent answer to this question focuses on the economic benefits of enforcing bargains. Another approach, associated with Charles Fried, maintains that the purpose of contract law is to enforce promises. This theory is developed in Fried's book, ''Contract as Promise.'' Other approaches to contract theory are found in the writings of [[legal realism|legal realist]]s and [[critical legal studies]] theorists.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Christian alternative music''' is a form of [[alternative rock]] music lyrically grounded in a [[Christianity|Christian]] worldview. The degree to which the faith appears in the music varies from artist to artist.

==History==
Christian alternative rock has its roots in the early [[1980s]], as the earliest efforts at [[Christian punk]] and [[new wave music]] were recorded by artists like [[Daniel Amos]], [[Andy McCarroll and Moral Support]], [[Undercover]], [[The 77s]], [[Adam Again]], [[Quickflight]], Youth Choir (later renamed [[The Choir]]), [[Lifesavers Underground]], [[The Altar Boys]], [[Steve Taylor]], [[David Edwards]], and [[Vector (band)|Vector]]. By the [[1990s]], many of these bands were being carried by independent labels, such as the growing [[Tooth &amp; Nail Records]], because their music tended to be more lyrically complex (and often more controversial) than mainstream [[Contemporary Christian Music]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Clive Barker''' (born [[October 5]], [[1952]], [[Liverpool]], England) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] author, director and visual artist.

Before reaching college, he went to, as he has often boasted, all the same schools as [[John Lennon]]. He studied English and Philosophy at [[Liverpool University]].

Barker is one of the leading authors of contemporary [[horror fiction|horror]]/[[fantasy fiction|fantasy]], starting out with pure horror writing early in his career, mostly in the form of short stories (collected in ''[[Books of Blood]]'' 1 - 6), and the [[Faustian]] novel ''[[The Damnation Game (novel)|The Damnation Game]]''. Later he moved towards epic modern-day fantasy  with some horror elements. Barker's distinctive style is characterized by the notion of hidden fantastical worlds existing side by side with our own (an idea he shares with contemporary [[Neil Gaiman]]), the role of sexuality in the [[supernatural]] and the construction of coherent, complex and detailed mythologies. Barker has referred to this style as &quot;dark fantasy.&quot;

When the ''Books of Blood'' were first published in the [[United States]] in cheap [[paperback]] editions, the originality, intensity and overall quality of the stories led  popular author [[Stephen King]] to say of Barker: &quot;I have seen the future of horror and its name is Clive Barker.&quot; (This is a paraphrase of a famous quote said of [[Bruce Springsteen]] at the beginning of his career.)

A critical analysis of Barker's work appears in [[S. T. Joshi]]'s ''The Modern Weird Tale'' (2001).

==Movies==
Barker has a keen interest in movie production, although his movies have received varying acclaim. The most successful was [[1987]]'s ''[[Hellraiser]]'', based on his novella &quot;[[The Hellbound Heart]]&quot;. His early movies, the shorts ''The Forbidden'' and ''Salome'' are experimental art movies with surrealist elements, now rereleased together, to moderate critical acclaim. After his film ''[[Nightbreed]]'', which was widely considered to be a flop, Barker returned to write and direct ''[[Lord of Illusions]]''.  He is currently working on a series of movie adaptations of his ''The Abarat Quartet'' books, under Disney's management; about the creepily-universal supernatural myths homeless children tell one another; and a film based on his [[Tortured Souls]] line of toys from [[McFarlane Toys]]. 

He recently produced &quot;Urban Myths: Bloody Mary&quot; from a script based on a newspaper report from Miami, Florida [http://www.miaminewtimes.com/issues/1997-06-05/feature.html newspaper article]. 

A short story titled ''The Forbidden'' from Barker's ''In the Flesh'' provided the basis for the film ''[[Candyman]]'' and its two sequels.

He has also produced the film ''[[Gods and Monsters]]'' which received major critical acclaim.

==Visual art==
Barker is also a prolific and talented visual artist, working in a variety of media, often illustrating his own books. His paintings can be seen on the covers ofarded as considerate and atmospheric, but too often were conventional, placid and slow.  Nevertheless, he was nominated seven times for an [[Academy Award]] (six times as a director, once as a [[film producer|producer]]) but never received the Oscar.

The Clarence Brown Theater, on the campus of the [[University of Tennessee]], is named in his honor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Conciliation''' is an [[alternative dispute resolution]] process whereby the parties to a dispute (including future interest disputes) agree to utilize the services of a conciliator, who then meets with the parties separately in an attempt to resolve their differences.  Conciliation differs from [[arbitration]] in that the conciliation process, in and of itself, has no legal standing, and the conciliator usually has no authority to seek evidence or call witnesses, usually writes no decision, and makes no award. Conciliation differs from [[mediation]] in that the main goal is to conciliate, most of the time by seeking concessions. In mediation, the mediator tries to guide the discussion in a way that optimizes parties needs, takes feelings into account and reframes representations. 

In conciliation the parties seldom, if ever, actually face each other across the table in the presence of the conciliator. (This latter difference ''can'' be regarded as one of species to genus. Most practicing mediators refer to the practice of meeting with the parties separately as &quot;caucusing&quot; and would regard conciliation as a specific type or form of mediation practice -- &quot;[[shuttle diplomacy]]&quot; -- that relies on exclusively on caucusing. All the other features of conciliation are found in mediation as well.)

If the conciliator is successful in negotiating an understanding between the parties, said understanding is almost always committed to writing (usually with the assistance of legal counsel) and signed by the parties, at which time it becomes a legally binding contract and falls under contract law. 

Recent studies in the processes of [[negotiation]] have indicated the effectiveness of a technique which deserves mention here.  A conciliator assists each of the parties to independently develop a list of all of their objectives (the outcomes which they desire to obtain from the conciliation).  The conciliator then has each of the parties separately prioritize their own list from most to least important.  She then goes back and forth between the parties and encourages them to &quot;give&quot; on the objectives one at a time, starting with the least important and working toward the most important for each party in turn.  The parties rarely place the same priorities on all objectives, and usually have some objectives which are not on the list compiled by parties on the other side. Thus the conciliator can quickly build a string of successes and help the parties create an atmosphere of trust which the conciliator can continue to develop.

Most successful conciliators are highly skilled negotiators. Some conciliators operate under the auspices of any one of several non-governmental entities, and for governmental agencies such as the [[Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Cyclone''' [[programming language]] is intended to be a safe dialect of the [[C programming language]]. Cyclone is designed to avoid [[buffer overflow]]s and other vulnerabilities that are endemic in C programs, without losing the power and convenience of C as a tool for [[systems programming]].

Cyclone was jointly developed by [[Greg Morrisett]]'s group at [[Cornell University]] and [[AT and T Labs Research|AT&amp;T Labs Research]] in the early 2000s. It received a certain amount of publicity in November 2001. As of June 15, 2004, the Cyclone compiler stands at version 0.8.1.

== Language features ==
Cyclone attempts to avoid some of the common pitfalls of the [[C programming language]], while still maintaining the look and performance of C. To this end, Cyclone places the following restrictions upon programs:
* &lt;code&gt;[[NULL]]&lt;/code&gt; checks are inserted to prevent [[segmentation fault]]s
* [[Pointer arithmetic]] is restricted
* Pointers must be initialized before use
* [[Dangling pointer]]s are prevented through region analysis and limitations on [[Malloc|&lt;code&gt;free()&lt;/code&gt;]]
* Only &quot;safe&quot; casts and unions are allowed
* [[Control flow | &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;]] into scopes is disallowed
* [[Control flow | &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt;]] labels in different scopes are disallowed
* Pointer-returning functions must execute &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;
* [[Setjmp/longjmp|&lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt;]] are not supported

In order to maintain the tool set that C programmers are used to, Cyclone provides the following extensions:
* '''Never-&lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; pointers''' do not require &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; checks
* '''&quot;Fat&quot; pointers''' support pointer arithmetic with run-time [[bounds checking]]
* '''Growable regions''' support a form of safe manual memory management
* '''[[Garbage collection (computer science)|Garbage collection]]''' for heap-allocated values
* '''[[Tagged union]]s''' support type-varying arguments
* '''Injections''' help automate the use of tagged unions for programmers
* '''[[Polymorphism (computer science)|Polymorphism]]''' replaces some uses of [[void pointer|&lt;code&gt;void *&lt;/code&gt;]]
* '''varargs''' are implemented as fat pointers
* '''[[Exception handling|Exceptions]]''' replace some uses of &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt;

For a better high-level introduction to Cyclone, the reasoning behind Cyclone and the source of these lists, please see [http://www.research.att.com/projects/cyclone/papers/cyclone-safety.pdf].

Although Cyclone looks, in general, much like [[C programming language|C]], it should be thought of as a [[:Category:C dialects|C-like language]]. With that, let us look at more features of the language, in depth.

===Pointer/reference types===
Cyclone implements three kinds of [[reference]] (following C terminology these are called pointers):
* &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; (the normal type)
* &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; (the never-&lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; pointer), and
* &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; (the only type with [[pointer arithmetic]] allowed, &quot;fat&quot; pointers).
The purpose of introducing these new pointer types is to avoid common problems when using pointers. Take for instance a function, called &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; that takes a pointer to an int:

 int foo(int *);

Although the person who wrote the function &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; could have inserted &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; checks, let us assume that for performance reasons they did not. Calling &lt;code&gt;foo(NULL);&lt;/code&gt; will result in [[undefined behavior]] (typically, although not necessarily, a '''SIGSEGV''' being sent to the application). To avoid such problems, Cyclone introduces the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; pointer type, which can never be &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, the &quot;safe&quot; version of &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; would be:

 int foo(int @);

This tells the Cyclone compiler that the argument to &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; should never be &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;, avoiding the aforementioned undefined behavior. The simple change of &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; saves the programmer from having to write &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; checks and the operating system from having to trap &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; pointer dereferences.  This extra restriction, however, can be a rather large stumbling block for most C programmers, who are used to being able to manipulate their pointers directly with arithmetic. Although this is desirable, it can lead to [[buffer overflow]]s and other &quot;off-by-one&quot;-style mistakes. To avoid this, the &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; pointer type is delimited by a known bound, the size of the array. Although this adds overhead due to the extra information stored about the pointer, it improves safety and security. Take for instance a simple (and naïve) &lt;code&gt;strlen&lt;/code&gt; function, written in C:

 int strlen(const char *s)
 {
     int iter = 0;
     if (s == NULL) return 0;
     while (s[iter] != '\0') {
        iter++;
     }
     return iter;
 }

This function assumes that the string being passed in is terminated by NUL (&lt;code&gt;'\0'&lt;/code&gt;). However, what would happen if &lt;code&gt;char&amp;nbsp;buf[]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{'h','e','l','l','o','!'};&lt;/code&gt; were passed to this string? This is perfectly legal in C, yet would cause &lt;code&gt;strlen&lt;/code&gt; to iterate through memory not necessarily associated with the string &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;. There are functions, such as &lt;code&gt;strnlen&lt;/code&gt; which can be used to avoid such problems, but these functions are not standard with every implementation of [[ANSI C]]. The Cyclone version of &lt;code&gt;strlen&lt;/code&gt; is not so different from the C version:

 int strlen(const char ? s)
 {
    int iter, n = s.size;
    if (s == NULL) return 0;
    for (iter = 0; iter &lt; n; iter++, s++) {
       if (*s == '\0') return iter;
    }
    return n;
 }

Here, &lt;code&gt;strlen&lt;/code&gt; bounds itself by the length of the array passed to it, thus not going over the actual length. Each of the kinds of pointer type can be safely cast to each of the others, and arrays and strings are automagically cast to &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; by the compiler. (Casting from &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; invokes a [[bounds checking|bounds check]], and casting from &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; invokes both a &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; check and a bounds check. Casting from &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; results in no checks whatsoever; the resulting &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; pointer has a size of 1.)

===Dangling pointers and region analysis===
Consider the following code, in C:

 char *itoa(int i)
 {
    char buf[20];
    sprintf(buf,&quot;%d&quot;,i);
    return buf;
 }

This returns an object that is allocated on the stack of the function &lt;code&gt;itoa&lt;/code&gt;, which is not available after the function returns. While [[GNU Compiler Collection|gcc]] and other compilers will warn about such code, this will typically compile without warnings:

 char *itoa(int i)
 {
    char buf[20], *z;
    sprintf(buf,&quot;%d&quot;,i);
    z = buf;
    return z;
 }

Cyclone does regional analysis of each segment of code, preventing dangling pointers, such as the one returned from this version of &lt;code&gt;itoa&lt;/code&gt;. All of the local variables in a given scope are considered to be part of the same region, separate from the heap or any other local region. Thus, when analyzing &lt;code&gt;itoa&lt;/code&gt;, the compiler would see that &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; is a pointer into the local stack, and would report an error.

===Manual memory management===
== Examples ==
The best example to start with is the classic [[Hello world]] program:

 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;core.h&gt;
 using Core;
 int main(int argc, string_t ? args)
 {
    if (argc &lt;= 1) {
       printf(&quot;Usage: hello-cyclone &lt;name&gt;\n&quot;);
       return 1;
    } else {
       printf(&quot;Hello from Cyclone, %s\n&quot;, args[1]);
    }
    return 0;
 }

      <text xml:space="preserve">''This article is about the term counter used in electronics and computing. For other meanings of counter, see [[counter (disambiguation)]]''

In general, a '''counter''' is a device which stores (and sometimes displays) the number of times a particular [[event]] or [[process]] has occurred often in relationship to a [[clock signal]].  In practice, there are two types of counters:
*[[up counter]]s which increase ([[increment]]) in value
*[[down counter]]s which decrease ([[decrement]]) in value



== Counters in electronics ==

In [[electronics]], counters can be implemented quite easily using register-type circuits such as the [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]], and a wide variety of designs exist, e.g:

* Asynchronous (ripple) counters
* Synchronous counters
* Johnson counters
* Decade counters

Each is useful for different applications. Usually, counter circuits are [[digital]] in nature, and count in [[binary code|binary]], or sometimes [[binary coded decimal]]. Many types of counter circuit are available as digital building blocks, for example a number of chips in the [[4000 series]] implement different counters.

The simplest counter circuit is a single [[Flip-flop_%28electronics%29#D_flip-flop|D-type flip flop]], with its D (data) input fed from its own inverted output. This circuit can store one bit, and hence can count from zero to one before it overflows. By cascading a series of D-type flip flops, a ripple counter is formed, which can count to 2&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt; where n is the number of bits (flip flop stages) in the counter. Ripple counters suffer from unstable outputs as the overflows &quot;ripple&quot; from stage to stage, but they do find frequent application as dividers for clock signals, where the instantaneous count is unimportant, but the division [[ratio]] overall is. (To clarify this, a 1-bit counter is exactly equivalent to a divide by two circuit - the output frequency is exactly half that of the input when fed with a regular train of clock pulses).

[[Image:4_bit_counter.png|thumb|400px|right|A 4-bit synchronous counter]]Where a stable count value is important across several bits, which is the case in most counter systems, synchronous counters are used. These also use flip-flops, either the D-type or the more complex J-K type, but here, each stage is clocked simultaneously by a common clock signal. [[Logic gate]]s between each stage of the circuit control data flow from stage to stage so that the desired count behaviour is realised. Synchronous counters can be designed to count up or down, or both according to a direction input, and may be presettable via a set of parallel &quot;jam&quot; inputs. Most types of hardware-based counter are of this type.

Decade counters are a kind of counter that counts in tens rather than having a binary representation. Each output will go high in turn, starting over after ten outputs have occurred. This type of circuit finds applications in [[multiplexer]]s and demultiplexers, or wherever a scanning type of behaviour is useful. Similar counters with different numbers of outputs are also common.

A Johnson counter is a special case of [[shift register]], where the output from the last stage is inverted and fed back as input to the first stage. A pattern of bits equal in length to the shift register thus circulates indefinitely. These counters are sometimes called &quot;walking ring&quot; counters, and find specialist applications, including those similar to the decade counter, digital to analogue conversion, etc.

''See also'': [[Frequency counter]]

== Counters in computer science ==

In [[Computability theory (computation) | computability theory]], a '''counter''' is considered a type of memory. A  counter stores a single [[natural number]] (initially [[0 (number)|zero]]) and can be [[bignum|arbitrarily-many digits long]].  A counter is usually considered in conjunction with a [[finite state machine]] (FSM), which can perform the following operations on the counter:
* Check whether the counter is zero
* Increment the counter by one
* Decrement the counter by one (if it's already zero, this leaves it unchanged).

==Power==
The following machines are listed in order of power, with each one being strictly more powerful than the one below it:
# Deterministic or Non-deterministic FSM plus two counters
# Non-deterministic FSM plus one [[Stack (computing)|stack]]
# Non-deterministic FSM plus one counter
# Deterministic FSM plus one counter
# Deterministic or Non-deterministic FSM 

For the first and last, it doesn't matter whether the FSM is deterministic or non-deterministic (see [[determinism]]).  They have equivalent power.  The first two and the last one are levels of the [[Chomsky hierarchy]].

The first machine, an FSM plus two counters, is equivalent in power to a [[Turing machine]].  This equivalence can be shown in three steps.  First, a Turing machine can be simulated by two stacks.  Then, a stack can be simulated by two counters.  Finally, four counters can be simulated by two counters.

===Step 1: A Turing machine can be simulated by two stacks.===
A Turing machine consists of an FSM and an infinite tape, initially filled with zeros, upon which the machine can write ones and zeros.  At any time, the read/write head of the machine points to one cell on the tape.  This tape can be conceptually cut in half at that point.  Each half of the tape can be treated as a [[Stack (computing)|stack]], where the top is the cell nearest the read/write head, and the bottom is some distance away from the head, with all zeros on the tape beyond the bottom.  Accordingly, a Turing machine can be simulated by an FSM plus two stacks.  Moving the head left or right is equivalent to popping a bit from one stack and pushing it onto the other.  Writing is equivalent to changing the bit before pushing it.

===Step 2: A stack can be simulated by two counters.===
A stack containing zeros and ones can be simulated by two counters, when the bits on the stack are thought of as representing a binary number, with the top being the least significant bit.  Pushing a zero onto the stack is equivalent to doubling the number.  Pushing a one is equivalent to doubling and adding 1.  Popping is equivalent to dividing by 2, where the [[remainder]] is the bit that was popped.  Two counters can simulate this stack, in which one of the counters holds a number whose binary representation represents the bits on the stack, and the other counter is used as a scratchpad.  To double the number in the first counter, the FSM can initialize the second counter to zero, then repeatedly decrement the first counter once and increment the second counter twice.  This continues until the first counter reaches zero. At that point, the second counter will hol      <comment>/* CCC projects and life */</comment>

[[Image:CCC-C&amp;O.jpg|thumb|270px|Civilian Conservation Corps workers restoring the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]].]] 
The '''Civilian Conservation Corps''' ('''CCC''') was an organization established on [[March 31]], [[1933]], during [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s first month in office. It was part of the social and economic relief program provided under Roosevelt's [[New Deal|First New Deal]] to combat the [[poverty]] and [[unemployment]] of the [[Great Depression]], and was one of the first measures to be introduced during the [[New Deal#The First Hundred Days|first hundred days]]. The CCC came to be seen as a rite of passage by its enrollees, and became one of the most popular New Deal programs among the general public. 

==Establishment==
Roosevelt proposed the establishment of a civilian conservation corps during the [[U.S. presidential election, 1932|1932 presidential campaign]]. During his first &quot;Hundred Days&quot; in office much of the [[New Deal]] was passed, including Senate Bill 5.598, the [[Emergency Conservation Work Act]]; it was signed into law on March 31, 1933. 

The [[United States Department of Labor|Labor Department]]'s role was to recruit participants into the program; the actual camps were operated by the Army, using reserve officers. Within a week the Labor Department organized a National Re-Employment Service for CCC recruitment. The usual requirement was that the boy's father had to be registered as unemployed.  The first CCC enrollee entered on [[1933-04-07]], just thirty-seven days after Roosevelt's [[inauguration]]. In a short time there were 250,000 enrollees working in CCC camps. Enrollment peaked in September 1935 at about 502,000. By the time the CCC disbanded in 1942, over three million young men had participated. 

There was serious concern about the CCC from the [[American Federation of Labor]] which feared it would be a job training program.  With so many union construction workers unemployed a new job training program would introduce new competition for scarce jobs.  Roosevelt promised there would be no skills taught that would compete with established unions, and named a labor leader to run the CCC.

==CCC projects and life==
[[Image:ccc we can take it.jpg|200px|thumb|right|&quot;The slogan of the Civilian Conservation Corps is 'We can take it!' Building strong bodies is a major CCC objective. More than half the enrollees who entered CCC the last year were seventeen years of age. Work, calisthenics, marching drill, good food, and medical care feature the CCC health program.&quot;]]

The CCC was an interdepartmental work and relief program that sent young, unemployed men from the cities to work on conservation projects in rural areas for $1 per day. The corps took part in many conservation projects, including prevention of [[soil erosion]] and the impounding of [[lake]]s. The CCC constructed many buildings and trails in [[state park|state]] and [[national park]]s that are still used today. Other projects of the CCC included installation of telephone and power lines, construction of logging and fire roads, fence construction, tree-planting, and even [[beekeeping]], [[archeology|archeological]] excavation, and furniture manufacture. The CCC also provided the first truly organized [[wildfire]]-fighting crews and planted  an estimated 3 billion trees for government agencies such as the [[United States Forest Service]].  

CCC enrollees worked 40 hours a week and were paid $30 a month, with the requirement that $25 of that be sent home to family. Members lived in camps, wore [[uniform]]s, and lived under quasi-[[military discipline]]. 
The U.S. Army operated the camps, using reserve presonnel called to active duty.  The Army thereby gained valuable experience in handling large numbers of young men, but there was no military drill or training in the camps, and the work projects were civilian in nature.  Eventually over 4,000 camps were be established in all 48 states and in the Hawaii, Alaska Territory, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The first camp was at [[George Washington National Forest]] in Virginia.

Initially, the CCC was limited to young men age 18 to 25 whose fathers  were on relief. Two exceptions to the age limits were [[veterans]], who had a special CCC program and their own camps, and older people with needed skills, hired by the CCC to supervise the young men on the job. These older CCC members were known as &quot;LEMs&quot; (Local Experienced Men). In 1937, Congress changed the age limits to 17 to 23 years old, and dropped the requirement that enrollees be on relief. Members enrolled for six months, with the option of enrolling for another six months.  

In Roosevelt's second [[fireside chats|fireside chat]] on [[1933-05-07]], he spoke about the CCC in a radio address:  
:&quot;First, we are giving opportunity of employment to one-quarter of a million of the unemployed, especially the young men who have dependents, to go into the forestry and flood prevention work. This is a big task because it means feeding, clothing and caring for nearly twice as many men as we have in the regular Army itself. In creating this civilian conservation corps we are killing two birds with one stone. We are clearly enhancing the value of our natural resources and second, we are relieving an appreciable amount of actual distress.&quot;

==Disbandment==
Despite Roosevelt's desire that the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] make the CCC a permanent agency, Congress failed to do so. Congress did pass several bills extending the life of the CCC. The last extension passed was in 1939, extending the CCC until [[1943-06-30]].  Due to the changing manpower and budgetary needs after U.S. entry into [[World War II]], this was to be the last extension of the Civilian Conservation Corps. After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on [[1941-12-07]], all CCC work, except for wildland firefighting, was shifted onto U.S. military bases to help with construction there. The agency disbanded one year earlier than planned, after Congress voted to cut off funding for the CCC entirely after [[1942-06-30]].

Former CCC sites in good condition were reactivated from 1941 to 1947 as [[Civilian Public Service]] camps where [[conscientious objectors]] performed ''work of national importance'' as an alternative to military service. In some cases these camps permitted the original CCC work to continue.

After the CCC disbanded, the federal agencies responsible for [[public lands]] administration went on to organize their own seasonal fire crews, roughly modeled after the CCC, which filled the firefighting role formerly filled by the CCC and provided the same sort of outdoor work experience to young people.

==California Conservation Corps==
In 1976, the [[Governor of California|Governor]] [[Jerry Brown]] of [[California]] established the [[California Conservation Corps]]. This new program differed drastically from the original CCC as its aim was primarily youth development rather than economic revival. Today it is the largest, oldest and longest-running youth conservation in the world.

==Corps Today==
Today, corps are state and local programs that engage primarily youth and young adults (ages 16-25) in full-time community service, training and educational activities.  The nation’s 109 corps operate in multiple communities across 37 states and the District of Columbia. In 2004, they enrolled over 23,000 young people.  The [[National Association of Service and Conservation Corps - NASCC]] works to expand and enhance the corps movement throughout America.

The '''Caribbean Sea''' is a [[tropics|tropical]] body of water adjacent to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and southeast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. It covers most of the [[Caribbean Plate]] and is bounded on the south by [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], and [[Panama]], to the west by [[Costa Rica]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]], [[Guatemala]], [[Belize]], and the [[Yucatan]] peninsula of [[Mexico]], to the north by the [[Greater Antilles]] islands of [[Cuba]], [[Hispaniola]], [[Jamaica]], and [[Puerto Rico]], and to the east by the [[Lesser Antilles]].

The Caribbean Sea is one of the largest [[sea|salt water seas]] and has an area of about [[1 E12 m²|2,754,000]] km² (1,063,000 square miles). The sea's deepest point is the [[Cayman Trench]], between [[Cuba]] and [[Jamaica]], at [[1 E3 m|7,686]] m (25,220 feet) below sea level.

The entire area of the Caribbean Sea, especially the numerous islands, is known as the [[Caribbean]].

The '''Caribbean''', ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Caribe''; [[French language|French]]: ''Caraïbe'' or more commonly ''Antilles''; [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Cariben'' or ''Caraïben'', or more commonly ''Antillen'') or the '''West Indies''', is a group of [[island]]s and countries which are in or border the [[Caribbean Sea]] which lies on the [[Caribbean Plate]].  The countries and islands of the Caribbean are located to the south and east of [[Mexico]] and to the north and west of [[Venezuela]], [[South America]]. There are at least 7,000 islands, [[islets]], [[reef]]s, and [[caye]]s in the region. They are organized into 25 territories including [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] states, overseas departments, and [[dependent area|dependencies]].

The name &quot;West Indies&quot; originates from [[Christopher Columbus]]' idea that he had landed in the [[Indies]] (then meaning all of south and east [[Asia]]) when he had in fact reached [[Americas|the Americas]]. The name &quot;Caribbean&quot; is named after the [[Carib]]s, one of the dominant [[Amerindian]] groups in the region at the time of [[Europe]]an contact. The Caribbean consists of the Greater and Lesser [[Antilles]], and is often considered part of [[North America]].

At one time, there was a short-lived country called the [[Federation of the West Indies]] composed of ten of the English-speaking Caribbean territories of the region.

The Caribbean area is also famous for its sea [[pirate]]s. See the article [[piracy in the Caribbean]].

The region known as &quot;Caribbean&quot; is usually restricted to the islands of the Caribbean Sea, although sometimes the continental American coastline is included.

==Historical groupings==
:''Main article: [[History of the Caribbean]]''

Most islands at some point were, or still are, colonies of [[Europe]]an nations:
* [[British West Indies]] / [[Anglophone Caribbean]] - [[Anguilla]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Barbados]], [[British Virgin Islands]], [[Cayman Islands]], [[Dominica]] (also [[Antillean Creole|French Creole]] speaking), [[Grenada]], [[Guyana]], [[Jamaica]], [[Montserrat]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Saint Lucia]] (also [[Antillean Creole|French Creole]] speaking), [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]]
* [[Danish West Indies]] - present-day [[United States Virgin Islands]]
* [[Dutch West Indies]] - present-day [[Netherlands Antilles]] and [[Aruba]]
* [[French West Indies]] - [[Anguilla]] (briefly), [[Antigua and Barbuda]] (briefly), [[Dominica]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Grenada]], [[Haiti]], [[Montserrat]] (briefly), [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Sint Eustatius]] (briefly), [[St Kitts and Nevis]] ([[St Kitts]], but not [[Nevis]]), [[Trinidad and Tobago]] ([[Tobago]] only), present-day [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] ([[Saint Croix]] only, briefly), and the current French [[Département d'outre-mer|overseas ''départements'']] of [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]] (including [[Saint-Barthélemy]] and northern half of [[Saint Martin]])
* [[Spain]] - [[Cuba]], [[Hispaniola]] (present-day [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Haiti]]), [[Puerto Rico]]

The British West Indies were formerly united by the [[United Kingdom]] into a [[West Indies Federation]]. The independent countries which were once a part of the B.W.I. still have a unified composite [[cricket]] team that successfully competes in [[Test cricket|test match]]es and [[one-day international]]s. The [[West Indian cricket team]] includes the South American nation of [[Guyana]], the only former British colony on that continent.

In addition, these countries share the [[University of the West Indies]] as a regional entity. The university consists of three main campuses in  [[Jamaica]], [[Barbados]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]], a smaller campus in the [[Bahamas]] and Resident Tutors in other contributing territories.

Pre-modern economies (those existing before the [[industrial revolution]]) are more difficult to analyze by today's standards, but a number of them, particularly those of [[hydraulic empire]]s, may be seen as having been centrally planned as well.

There is a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] theory of the [[permanent arms economy]], put forward by [[Michael Kidron]], which leads on from the contention that war and accompanying [[industrialisation]] is a continuing feature of capitalist states and that central planning and other features of the [[war economy]] are ever present. {{ref|Kidron}}

==Transition from a planned economy to a market economy ==

The shift from a command economy to a market economy has proven to be difficult; in particular, there were no theoretical guides for doing so before the 1990s.  One transition from a command economy to a market economy that is widely considered to be successful is that of the [[People's Republic of China]], in which there was a period of some years lasting roughly until the early 1990s during which both the command economy and the market economy coexisted, so that nobody would be much worse off under a mixed economy than a command economy, while some people would be much better off.  Gradually, the parts of the economy under the command economy decreased until the mid-1990s when resource allocation was almost completely determined by market mechanisms.

By contrast, the [[Soviet Union]]'s transition was much more problematic and its [[successor republic]]s faced a sharp decline in [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] during the early 1990s. While the situation has since improved, these countries have yet to generate the high rate of sustained economic growth that China has.

==Similar economic models==

A [[palace economy]] may be considered as a [[subsistence economy]] augmented with elements of command economy.

The '''Common Chimpanzee''' (''Pan troglodytes''), also known as the '''Robust Chimpanzee''', is a [[Hominidae|great ape]]. Colloquially, it is often called the [[chimpanzee]] (or simply &quot;chimp&quot;), though technically this term refers to both [[species]] in the [[genus]] ''[[Chimpanzee|Pan]]'': the Common Chimpanzee and the closely-related [[Bonobo]], or Pygmy Chimpanzee.

Several subspecies of the Common Chimpanzee are been recognized:

* [[Central Chimpanzee]], ''Pan troglodytes troglodytes'', in [[Cameroon]], the [[Central African Republic]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gabon]], the [[Republic of the Congo]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]];
* [[West African Chimpanzee]], ''Pan troglodytes verus'', in [[Guinea]], [[Mali]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Ghana]], and [[Nigeria]];
* West Nigeria/East Cameroon or simply [[Nigerian Chimpanzee]], ''Pan troglodytes vellerosus'', in [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]];
* [[Eastern Chimpanzee]], ''Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii'', in the [[Central African Republic]], the [[Sudan]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Zambia]].

==Basic facts==
Common Chimpanzees are found in the [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical forests]] and wet [[Tropical_and_subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|savannas]] of Western and Central [[Africa]]. They used to inhabit most of this region, but their [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] has been dramatically reduced in recent years.

Adults in the wild weigh between 40 and 65 kg (88 and 143 lbs); males can measure up to 160 cm (63 inches) and females to 130 cm (51 inches), and both are much stronger than humans. Their bodies are covered by a coarse dark brown hair, except for the face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Both their thumbs and their big toes are opposable, allowing a precision grip. Their [[pregnancy|gestation]] period is 8 months. Infants are weaned when they are about 3 years old, but usually maintain a close relationship with their mother for several more years; they reach [[puberty]] at the age of 8-10, and their lifespan in captivity is about 50 years.

Although omnivores, their diet is mainly vegetarian, consisting of [[fruits]], [[leaves]], [[Nut (fruit) | nuts]], [[seeds]], [[tuber]]s, and miscellaneous plantlife supplemented by [[insect]]s and small prey. There are also instances of organized hunting; in some cases, such as the killing of [[leopard]] cubs, this seems to be primarily a protective effort. However, Common Chimpanzees sometimes band together and hunt [[Western Red Colobus|Western Red Colobus monkeys]] (''Piliocolobus badius'') for their meat. Isolated cases of [[cannibalism]] have been documented. Chimpanzees have also been known on rare occasions to attack and eat human infants.

[[Image:Apeclade.png|thumb|right|'''The ape clade'''. Chimpanzees are the closest living relatives to humans. The numbers in this diagram provide an estimate of relatedness based on similarities in proteins between the various apes.]]

==Social behavior==
Common Chimpanzees live in communities that typically range from 20 to more than 150 members, but spend most of their time traveling in small parties of just a few individuals. They are both arboreal and terrestrial, spending equal time in the trees and on the ground. Their habitual gait is [[quadruped|quadrupedal]], using the soles of their feet and resting on their knuckles, but they can walk upright for short distances.

The Common Chimpanzee lives in a [[fission-fusion society]], where [[mating]] is promiscuous and may be found in groups of the following types: all-male, adult females and offspring, bisexual, one female and her offspring, or a single individual. The core of the societies are males who roam around, protecting members of the group as well as engaging in the search for food. Among males, there is generally a dominance hierarchy. However, this unusual fission-fusion social structure, &quot;in which portions of the parent group may on a regular basis separate from and then rejoin the rest&quot;{{ref|goodall}}, is highly variable in terms of which particular individual chimpanzees congregate at a given time. This is mainly due to chimpanzees having a high level of individual autonomy within the fission-fusion society. Also, communities have large ranges that overlap with those of other groups.   

As a result, individual chimpanzees often forage for food alone, or in smaller groups (as opposed to the much larger ''parent'' group, which encompasses all the chimpanzees who regularly come into contact and congregate into parties in a particular area). As stated, these smaller groups also emerge in a variety of types, for a variety of purposes. For example, an all-male troop may be organized in order to [[hunt]] for meat, while a bi-sexual group consisting of one mature male and one mature female may occur for the purposes of [[copulation]]. An individual may encounter certain individuals quite frequently, but have run-ins with others almost never or only in large-scale gatherings. Due to the varying frequency at which chimpanzees associate, the structure of their societies is highly complicated.

==Chimpanzee Genome Project==
{{main|Chimpanzee Genome Project}}
[[Human]] and Common Chimpanzee [[DNA]] is very similar. After the completion of the [[Human genome project]], a Common [[Chimpanzee Genome Project]] was initiated. In December of 2003, a preliminary analysis of 7600 genes shared between the two genomes confirmed that certain genes such as the forkhead-box P2 [[transcription factor]], which is involved in speech development, have undergone rapid evolution in the human lineage. A draft version of the chimpanzee genome was published on [[September 1]], [[2005]], in an article produced by the [[Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium]]{{ref|genome}}. The DNA sequence differences between humans and chimpanzees is about thirty-five million [[Point mutation|single-nucleotide]] changes, five million [[Mutation#Structural classification|insertion/deletion]] events, and various [[chromosome|chromosomal]] [[Chromosomal translocation|rearrangements]]. Typical human and chimp [[homolog]]s of [[protein]]s differ in only an average of two [[amino acid]]s. About 30 percent of all human proteins are identical in sequence to the corresponding chimp protein. Duplications of small parts of [[chromosome]]s have been the major source of differences between human and chimp genetic material, with about 2.7 percent of the genome now representing differences having been produced by gene duplications or deletions during approximately 6 million years since humans and chimps diverged from their common evolutionary ancestor. Results from the human and chimp genome analyses should help in understanding the genetic basis of some human diseases.

[[Image:Charcot-marie-tooth---foot.jpg|thumb|250px|The foot of a person with Charcot-Marie-Tooth. The lack of muscle, high arch, and hammer toes are signs of the genetic disease.]]
'''Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease''', also known as Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy (HMSN) or Peroneal Muscular Atrophy, is a heterogeneous inherited disorder of [[nerve]]s ([[neuropathy]]) that is characterized by loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation, predominantly in the feet and legs but also in the hands and arms in the advanced stages of disease. Though presently incurable, this disease is one of the most common inherited neurological disorders, with 36 in 100,000 affected (Krajewski et al.,2000).

The disorder is caused by the absence of molecules that are essential for normal function of the nerves due to deficiencies in the structure of the genes coding these molecules. The absence of these chemical substances gives rise to dysfunction either in the [[axon]] or the [[myelin]] sheath of the nerve cell. 

The different classes of this disorder have been divided into the primary demyelinating neuropathies (CMT1, CMT3, and CMT4) and the primary axonal neuropathies (CMT2).  Recent studies, however, show that the the pathologies of these two classes are frequently intermingled, due to the dependence and close cellular interaction of Schwann cells and neurons.  Schwann cells are responsible for myelin formation, enwrapping neural axons with their plama membranes in a process called “myelination” (Berger et al., 2002).

The molecular structure of the nerve depends upon the interactions between neurons, Schwann cells, and fibroblasts.  Schwann cells and neurons, in particular, exchange signals that regulate survival and differentiation during development.  These signals are important to CMT disease because a disturbed communication between Schwann cells and neurons, resulting from a genetic defect, is observed in this disorder (Berger et al., 2002).

It is clear that interaction with demyelinating Schwann cells causes the expression of abnormal axonal structure and function, but we still do not know how these abnormalities result in CMT.  One possibility is that the weakness and sensory loss experienced by patients with CMT is a result of axonal degradation.  Another possibility is that axonal dysfunction occurs, not degeneration, and that this dysfunction is induced by demyelinating Schwann cells (Krajewski et al., 2000).   

Most patients experience demyelinating neuropathies, and this is characterized by a reduction in nerve conduction velocity (NCV), due to a partial or complete loss of the myosin sheet.  Axonopathies, on the other hand, are characterized by a reduced compound muscle action potential (CMAP), while NCV is normal or only slightly reduced (Berger et al.,2002).

The disease is named for those who classically described it: [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] (1825-1893) and his pupil [[Pierre Marie]] (1853-1940)  (''&quot;Sur une forme particulière d'atrophie musculaire progressive, souvent familiale débutant par les pieds et les jambes et atteignant plus tard les mains&quot;'', Revue médicale, Paris, 1886; 6: 97-138.), and [[Howard Henry Tooth]] (1856-1925) (&quot;The peroneal type of progressive muscular atrophy&quot;, dissertation, London, 1886.)

==Symptoms==
Symptoms usually begin in late-childhood or early adulthood. Usually, the initial symptom is foot drop due to involvement of the peroneal nerve, which is responsible for raising the feet, early in the course of the disease. This can also cause hammer toe, where the toes are always curled. Wasting of muscle tissue of the lower parts of the legs may give rise to &quot;stork leg&quot; appearance. Weakness in the Hands and forearms are greatly affected in many people later in life as the disease progresses. Symptoms and progression of the disease can vary. Breathing can be affected in some ,so can hearing, vision, the neck and shoulder muscles; scoliosis is common; hip sockets can be malformed; gastrointestinal problems can be part of CMT, as can chewing, swallowing, speaking (as vocal cords atrophy); and a tremor can develop as muscles waste. Pregnancy has been known to exacerbate CMT as well as extreme emotional stress.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is established by [[electromyography]] examination (which shows that the velocity of nerve impulse conduction is decreased and the time required to charge the nerve is increased) and nerve [[biopsy]].  [[Genetic marker]]s have been identified for some, but not all forms of the disease.

==Types of the disease==
===CMT Type 1 (CMT1)===
Type 1 affects approximately 80% of CMT patients and is the most common type of CMT.  The subtypes share clinical symptoms.  [[Autosomal dominant]].  Causes demyelination, which can be detected by measuring nerve conduction velocities.
*'''CMT type 1A''' - '''CMT1A''' ({{OMIM|118220}}) - The most common form of the disease, caused by mutations in the PMP22 gene ([[locus]] 17p11.2).  70-80% of Type 1 patients.  Average [[Nerve conduction velocity|NCV]]: 15-20[[Metre per second|m/s]]
*'''CMT type 1B''' - '''CMT1B''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=118200 OMIM 118200]) - Caused by mutations in the MPZ gene (1q22) producing protein zero (P0). 5-10% of Type 1 patients. Average [[Nerve conduction velocity|NCV]]: &lt;20[[Metre per second|m/s]]
*'''CMT type 1C''' - '''CMT1C''' - Sometimes called '''Dejerine-Sottas disease''' - Causes severe [[myelin|demyelination]], which can be detected by measuring nerve conduction velocities.  [[Autosomal dominant]].  Usually shows up in infancy.  LITAF Gene (16p13.1-p12.3) Average [[Nerve conduction velocity|NCV]]: 26-42[[Metre per second|m/s]].  Identical symptoms to CMT-1A.
*'''CMT type 1D''' - '''CMD1D''' - EGR2 Gene (10q21.1-q22.1) - Average [[NCV]]: 15-20[[m/s]]

===CMT Type 2 (CMT2)===
Type 2 affects approximately 20-40% of CMT patients.  Type 2 CMT is [[Autosomal dominant]] neuropathy  with its main affect on the axon.  The average [[nerve conduction velocity]] is slightly below normal, but generally above 38[[Metre per second|m/s]]
*'''CMT type 2A''' - '''CMT2A''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=118210 OMIM 118210]) - The cause is likely located on chromosome 1 for the mitofusion 2 (MFN2) protein ([[locus]] 1p36).   Some research has also linked this form of CMT to the protein kinesin 1B (KIF1B) (1p36.2). Does not show up on nerve condution velocity tests, because it is caused by [[axonopathy]].
*'''CMT type 2B''' - '''CMT2B''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=600882 OMIM 600882]) - RAB7 gene (3q21).
*'''CMT type 2C''' - '''CMT2C''' - (12q23-q24) - May cause vocal cord, diaphragm, and distal weaknesses.
*'''CMT type 2D''' - '''CMT2D''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=601472 OMIM 601472]) - GARS gene (7p15). Patients with mutations in the GARS gene tend to have more severe symptoms in the upper extremities (hands), which is atypical for CMT in general.
*'''CMT type 2E''' - '''CMT2E''' - NEFL gene (8p21).
*'''CMT type 2F''' - '''CMT2F''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=606595 OMIM 606595]) - HSPB1 gene (7q11-q21).
*'''CMT type 2G''' - '''CMT2G''' - (12q12-13)
*'''CMT type 2H''' - '''CMT2H''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=607731 OMIM 607731])
*'''CMT type 2J''' - '''CMT2J''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=607736 OMIM 607736]) - (1q22)
*'''CMT type 2K''' - '''CMT2K''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=607831 OMIM 607831]) - (8q13-q21.1)
*'''CMT type 2L''' - '''CMT2L''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=608673 OMIM 608673]) - (12q24)

===CMT Type 3 (CMT3)===
Type 3 affects a very few CMT patients.
*'''CMT type 3''' - '''CMT3''' - Rarely found. [[Autosomal recessive]]. Average [[Nerve conduction velocity|NCV]]: Normal (50-60m/s)
===CMT Type 4 (CMT4)===
Type 4 affects a very few CMT patients.
*'''CMT type 4A''' - '''CMT4A''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=214400 OMIM 214400]) - GDAP1 Gene ([[locus]] 8q13-q21.1) - [[Autosomal recessive]].
*'''CMT type 4B1''' - '''CMT4B1''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=601382 OMIM 601382]) - MTMR2 Gene (11q22) - [[Autosomal recessive]].
*'''CMT type 4B2''' - '''CMT4B2''' - CMT4B2 Gene, may be called &quot;SBF2/MTMR13&quot; (11p15) - [[Autosomal recessive]].
*'''CMT type 4C''' - '''CMT4C''' - KIAA1985 Gene (5q32) - May lead to respiratory compromise.
*'''CMT type 4D''' - '''CMT4D''' - NDRG1 Gene (8q24.3)
*'''CMT type 4E''' - '''CMT4E''' - EGR2 (10q21.1-10q22.1) - &quot;CMT4E&quot; is a tentative name
*'''CMT type 4F''' - '''CMT4F''' - PRX (19q13.1-19q13.2) - &quot;CMT4F&quot; is a tentative name

===CMT X-Linked (CMTX)===
CMTX affects approximately 10-20% of CMT patients and is [[Dominant gene|X-linked dominant]].
*'''CMTX''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=302800 OMIM 302800]) - GJB1 Gene ([[locus]] Xq13.1) - Average [[Nerve conduction velocity|NCV]]: 25-40[[Metre per second|m/s]]
*Other X-linked forms - Approx 10% of X-linked CMT patients have some other form than CMTX.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Central pontine myelinolysis''' is a neurologic disease caused by severe damage of the [[myelin sheath]] of [[neuron|nerve cells]] in the [[brainstem]], more precisely in the area termed the ''[[pons]]''. The most common cause is the rapid correction of low blood sodium levels ([[hyponatremia]]). Some scholars postulate that the real cause might be the lack of a substance that is essentcultural sector]], and Dominica's primary agricultural [[exports]] include [[tobacco]], [[bananas]], [[vegetables]], [[citrus]], [[copra]], [[coconut oil]], and [[essential oils]] such as [[bay leaf|bay oil]].  The country's industries, other than tourism, include [[soap]], [[furniture]], cement blocks, and [[shoes]].  Dominica is further benefited by the presence of an offshore medical school, [http://www.rossmed.edu/ Ross University], in the northern town of Portsmouth. About 900 students live and study in Portsmouth.

The Dominican economy has high [[poverty]] (30%), high [[unemployment]] (23%), and a low per capita [[GDP]] (US$5,400).  The Dominican economy has been hurt by problems in the banana industry.  The entire economy suffers when weather conditions damage the banana crop, or when the price of bananas falls.  The [[European Union]] has phased out preferred access of bananas to its markets, causing banana demand to fall.  In response, the Dominican government privatized the banana industry.  Also, the government has attempted to diversify the economy and has lifted [[price controls]] in an attempt to improve the lagging economy.  The government is also trying to develop tourism, especially [[ecotourism]].  The lack of a large international airport and lack of sandy beaches decrease opportunities for standard tourism, but the heavily rainforested island could lure those who want unconventional ecotourism experiences.  Indeed, it is remarked that of all the islands of the Caribbean, Dominica is the only one [[Christopher Columbus]] would still recognise.

==Demographics==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Dominica]]''

Almost all of the seventy thousand nationals of Dominica today are descendants of African slaves, brought in by colonial planters in the 18th century.  However, Dominica is also one of the few islands in the Eastern Caribbean to possess a population of pre-Columbian Carib Indians, about 3,000 of whom live on the island's east coast in their own territory.

The population growth rate of Dominica is very low, due primarily to emigration to more developed Caribbean Islands, the United Kingdom, the United States, or Canada.  English is the official language of Dominica and is universally understood; however, because of historic French domination, Antillean Creole &quot;[[Patwa]]&quot;, a French-based [[creole language]], is also widely spoken. About 80% of the population is Catholic, though in recent years a number of Protestant churches have been established.

==Culture==
''Main article: [[Culture of Dominica]]''

Dominica is home to a wide range of people. Historically occupied by several native tribes, only a [[Carib]] tribe remained by the time European settlers reached the island. French and British settlers each claimed the island, and imported [[slaves]] from [[Africa]]. The native Caribs have a reserve on which they live in their traditional manner. This mix of cultures is important to Dominica.

The famed novelist [[Jean Rhys]] was born and raised in Dominica. The island is obliquely depicted in her best-known book, ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]''. Rhys's friend, the political activist and writer [[Phyllis Shand Allfrey]], set her [[1954]] novel, ''[[The Orchid House]]'' ISBN 081352332X, in Dominica.
 
The dialect of Dominica also includes Cocoy and a French Patios. &quot;Cocoy&quot;, is primarly a mix of cockney english imported by English settler and with an infusion of African lingual. Cocoy is mainly spoken in the north-eastern part of the island. The French patios which is more widely spoken came from the French plantation owners from the neighbouring French islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The island of '''[[Dominica]]''''s indigenous [[Arawak]] people were expelled or exterminated by [[Carib]]s in the 14th century. [[Christopher Columbus]] landed there in November [[1493]]. [[Spain|Spanish]] ships frequently landed on Dominica during the 16th century, but fierce resistance by the Caribs discouraged Spain's efforts at settlement.

In [[1635]], [[France]] claimed Dominica. Shortly thereafter, French missionaries became the first European inhabitants of the island. Carib incursions continued, though, and in [[1660]], the French and [[United Kingdom|British]] agreed that both Dominica and [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|St. Vincent]] should be abandoned. Dominica was officially neutral for the next century, but the attraction of its resources remained; rival expeditions of British and French foresters were harvesting timber by the start of the 18th century.

Largely due to Dominica's position between [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]], France eventually became predominant, and a French settlement was established and grew. As part of the [[1763]] [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] that ended the [[Seven Years' War]], the island became a British possession. In [[1778]], during the [[American Revolutionary War]], the French mounted a successful invasion with the active cooperation of the population, which was largely French. The [[1783]] Treaty of Paris, which ended the war, returned the island to Britain. French invasions in [[1795]] and [[1805]] ended in failure.

In 1763, the British established a legislative assembly, representing only the white population. In [[1831]], reflecting a liberalization of official British racial attitudes, the [[Brown Privilege Bill]] conferred political and social rights on free nonwhites. Three Blacks were elected to the legislative assembly the following year. Following the abolition of slavery, in [[1838]] Dominica became the first and only British Caribbean colony to have a Black-controlled legislature in the 19th century. Most Black legislators were small holders or merchants who held economic and social views diametrically opposed to the interests of the small, wealthy English planter class. Reacting to a perceived threat, the planters lobbied for more direct British rule.

In [[1865]], after much agitation and tension, the colonial office replaced the elective assembly with one comprised of one-half elected members and one-half appointed. The elected legislators were outmaneuvered on numerous occasions by planters allied with colonial administrators. In [[1871]], Dominica became part of the [[Leeward Island Federation]]. The power of the Black population progressively eroded. Crown Colony government was re-established in [[1896]]. All political rights for the vast majority of the population were effectively curtailed. [[Development aid]], offered as compensation for disenfranchisement, proved to have a negligible effect.

Following [[World War I]], an upsurge of political consciousness throughout the Caribbean led to the formation of the representative government association. Marshaling public frustration with the lack of a voice in the governing of Dominica, this group won one-third of the popularly elected seats of the legislative assembly in [[1924]] and one-half in [[1936]]. Shortly thereafter, Dominica was transferred from the Leeward Island Administration and was governed as part of the [[Windward Islands|Windwards]] until [[1958]], when it joined the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]].

In [[1961]], a Dominica Labor Party government led by [[Edward Oliver LeBlanc]] was elected. After the federation dissolved, Dominica became an associated state of the United Kingdom on [[February 27]], [[1967]] and formally took responsibility for its internal affairs. LeBlanc retired in [[1974]] and was replaced by [[Patrick John]]. On [[November 3]], [[1978]], the Commonwealth of Dominica was granted independence by the United Kingdom.

Independence did little to solve problems stemming from centuries of economic [[underdevelopment]], and in mid-[[1979]], political discontent led to the formation of an interim government. It was replaced after the [[1980]] elections by a government led by the [[Dominica Freedom Party]] under Prime Minister [[Eugenia Charles]], the Caribbean's first female prime minister. 

On [[April 27]], [[1981]], [[Ku Klux Klan]] Grand Wizards [[Don Black (nationalist)|Don Black]] and [[Wolfgang Droege]], [[Larry Lloyd Jacklin]] and seven other men were arrested by [[United States|U.S.]] federal agents in [[New Orleans]] as they prepared to board a boat with guns and dynamite for an invasion of Dominica. The invasion (dubbed &quot;[[Operation Red Dog]]&quot; by its organizers) was meant to restore [[Patrick John]] to power and to transform the island into a white supremacist nation. The incident was later dubbed the &quot;Bayou of Pigs.&quot;

Chronic economic problems were compounded by the severe impact of hurricanes in 1979 and in 1980. By the end of the 1980s, the economy had made a healthy recovery, which weakened in the 1990s due to a decrease in banana prices.

In 1995 the government was defeated in elections by the United Workers Party of [[Edison James]]. James became prime minister, serving until the February 2000 elections, when the [[Dominica United Workers Party]] (DUWP) was defeated by the [[Dominica Labour Party]] (DLP), led by [[Rosie Douglas]]. He was a former [[socialist]] [[radical]], and many feared that his approach to politics might be impractical. However, these were somewhat quieted when he formed a coalition with the more conservative Dominica Freedom Party. Douglas died suddenly after only a few months in office, on October 1, 2000, and was replaced by [[Pierre Charles]], also of the DLP. In 2003, [[Nicholas Liverpool]] was elected and sworn in as president, succeeding [[Vernon Shaw]].. On January 6, 2004, Prime Minister Pierre Charles, who had been suffering from heart problems since 2003, died. He became the second consecutive prime minister of Dominica to die in office of a heart attack. The foreign minister, [[Osborne Riviere]] immediately became prime minister, but the education minister, [[Roosevelt Skerrit]] succeeded him as prime minister and became the new leader of the Dominica Labour Party. Election were held on [[May 5]] [[2005]] with the ruling coalition maintaining power.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:DominicaMap.gif|thumb|300px|Map of Dominica]]
[[Dominica]] is an [[island]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]], located about halfway between [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].  Its coordinates are 15 25 N, 61 20 W.  The island is roughly four times the size of [[Washington, DC]] (in area, not population).  There are no significant lakes on the island.

The island's [[climate]] is tropical, moderated by northeast [[trade wind]]s and heavy [[rain]]fall.  The interior features rugged [[mountain]]s of [[volcano|volcanic]] origin. Volcanism is still quite evident on the island, the most popular examples being Dominica's boiling lake and &quot;valley of desolation.&quot; The boiling lake (the world's second largest) is within a crater and is fed by a waterfall - the boiling is believed to be caused by the heat of a magma chamber beneath the lake. The valley of desolation is a sulfurous valley of volcanic vents and hot springs that inhibits significant plant growth - in stark contrast to the surrounding rain forest. The lowest point in the country is at [[sea level]] along the coast, and the highest is [[Morne Diablotins]] (1,447 m).  The extreme southwestern coast of the island includes a large collapsed submarine caldera. Portions of the exposed rim of this caldera form the southwestern tip of the island at Scott's Head. 

Natural resources include [[farming]], [[hydropower]] and [[timber]].

Geographically, Dominica is distinctive in many ways. The country has one of the most rugged landscapes in the Caribbean, covered by a largely unexploited, multi-layered rain forest. It is also among the earth's most rain-drenched lands, and the water runoff forms cascading rivers and natural pools. The island, home to rare species of wildlife, is considered by many as a beautiful, unspoiled tropical preserve. According to a popular West Indian belief, Dominica is the only New World territory that Columbus would still recognize.

Dominica is the largest and most northerly of the Windward Islands. The island faces the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Caribbean Sea to the west. Its nearest neighbors are the French islands of Guadeloupe, some forty-eight kilometers north, and Martinique, about forty kilometers south. Oblong-shaped and slightly smaller than New York City, Dominica is 750 square kilometers in area, 47 kilometers in length, and 29 kilometers in width. Roseau, the nation's capital and major port, is favorably situated on the sheltered, southwestern coast.

Geologically, Dominica is part of the rugged Lesser Antilles volcanic arc. The country's central spine, a northwest-southeast axis of steep volcanic slopes and deep gorges, generally varies in elevation from 300 meters to 1,400 meters above sea level. Several east-west trending mountain spurs extend to the narrow coastal plain, which is studded with sea cliffs and has level stretches no wider than 2,000 meters. The highest peak is Morne Diablatins, at 1,447 meters; Morne Trois Pitons, with an elevation of 1,423 meters, lies farther south and is the site of the national park.

Dominica's rugged surface is marked by its volcanic past. Rock formations are mainly volcanic andesite and rhyolite, with fallen boulders and sharp-edged protrusions peppering slope bases. The light- to dark-hued clayey and sandy soils, derived from the rocks and decomposed vegetation, are generally fertile and porous. Only a few interior valleys and coastal strips are flat enough for soil accumulations of consequence, however. Although scores of mostly mild seismic shocks were recorded in 1986, volcanic eruptions ceased thousands of years ago. Sulfuric springs and steam vents, largely concentrated in the central and southern parts of the island, remain active, however. One of the largest springs, Boiling Lake, is located in the national park.

Dominica is water-rich with swift-flowing highland streams, which cascade into deep gorges and form natural pools and crater lakes. The streams are not navigable, but many are sources of hydroelectric power. Trafalgar Falls, located near the national park, is one of the most spectacular sites on the island. The principal rivers flowing westward into the Caribbean are the Layou and the Roseau, and the major one emptying eastward into the Atlantic is the Toulaman. The largest crater lake, called Boeri, is located in the national park.

Dominica has a tropical wet climate with characteristically warm temperatures and heavy rainfall. Excessive heat and humidity are tempered somewhat by a steady flow of the northeast trade winds, which periodically develop into hurricanes. The steep interior slopes also alter temperatures and winds. Temperature ranges are slight. Average daytime temperatures generally vary from 26°C in January to 32°C in June. Diurnal ranges are usually no greater than 3°C in most places, but temperatures dipping to 13°C on the highest peaks are not uncommon.

Most of the island's ample supply of water is brought by the trade winds. Although amounts vary with the location, rain is possible throughout the year, with the greatest monthly totals recorded from June through October. Average yearly rainfall along the windward east coast frequently exceeds 500 centimeters, and exposed mountainsides receive up to 900 centimeters, among the highest accumulations in the world. Totals on the leeward west coast, however, are only about 180 centimeters per year. Humidities are closely tied to rainfall patterns, with the highest values occurring on windward slopes and the lowest in sheltered areas. Relative humidity readings between 70 percent and 90 percent have been recorded in Roseau.

Hurricanes and severe winds, most likely to occur during the wettest months, occasionally are devastating. The most recent hurricanes of note were David and Frederick in August 1979 and Allen in August l980. The 1979 hurricanes caused over 40 deaths, 2,500 injuries, and extensive destruction of housing and crops. Many agricultural commodities were destroyed during the 1980 storm, and about 25 percent of the banana crop was demolished by strong winds in 1984.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Almost all [[Dominica]]ns are descendants of [[Africa]]n [[Slavery|slave]]s brought in by [[colony|colonial]] planters in the [[18th century]]. Dominica is the only island in the eastern [[Caribbean]] to retain some of its pre-Columbian population--the [[Carib]] Indians--about 3,000 of whom live on the island's east coast.

The population growth rate is very low, due primarily to emigration to more prosperous Caribbean Islands, the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and [[Canada]]. [[English language|English]] is the official language and universally understood; however, because of historic [[French language|French]] domination, [[Antillean Creole]], a French patois, is also widely spoken. About 80% of the population is [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]]. In recent years, a number of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches have been established.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Dominica}}
'''Politics of Dominica''' takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[Prime Minister of Dominica]] is the [[head of government]], and of a pluriform multi-party system. [[Executive power]] is exercisedin books 1992, p 135.)

==Sir William Petty==
[[Sir William Petty]] was the first modern writer to take note of division of labour, showing its existence and usefulness in Dutch shipyards.  Classically the workers in a shipyard would build ships as units, finishing one before starting another.  But the Dutch had it organised with several teams each doing the same tasks for successive ships.  People with a particular task to do must have discovered new methods that were only later observed and justified by writers on political economy.   

Petty also applied the principle to his survey of Ireland.  His breakthrough was to divide up the work so that large parts of it could be done by people with no extensive training.  (The ethics of doing this is another matter.)

==Adam Smith==

In the first sentence of ''[[An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776), [[Adam Smith]] foresaw the essence of industrialism by determining that division of labour represents a qualitative increase in productivity. His original example was the making of pins. Unlike Plato, Smith did not regard the division of labour as a consequence of human inequality but famously argued that the difference between a street porter and a philosopher was as much a consequence of the division of labour as its cause. Therefore, while for Plato the level of specialisation determined by the division of labour was externally determined, for Smith it was the dynamic engine of economic progress.  However, in a further chapter of the same book Smith criticises the division of labour saying it leads to a 'mental mutilation' in workers; they become ignorant and insular as their working lives are confined to a single repetitive task. This contradiction has led to some debate over Smith's opinion of the division of labour.

The [[specialization]] and concentration of the workers on their single subtasks often leads to greater skill and greater productivity on their particular subtasks than would be achieved by the same number of workers each carrying out the original broad task.  

Worker skill is the chief source of productivity gain in Smith's thinking. In modern economic theory, that role has been taken over by overall [[technology|technological]] progress and the concept of [[human capital]].

== Karl Marx ==

Increasing specialization may also lead to workers with poorer overall skills and a lack of enthusiasm for their work. This viewpoint was extended and refined by [[Karl Marx]]. He described the process as [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]; workers become more and more specialized and work repetitious which eventually leads to complete alienation. Marx wrote that &quot;with this division of labour&quot;, the worker is &quot;depressed spiritually and physically to the condition of a machine&quot;. He believed that the fullness of production is essential to human [[liberation]] and accepted the idea of a strict division of labour only as a temporary ''necessary evil''.

Marx's most important theoretical contribution was his sharp distinction between the ''social'' division and the ''technical'' or economic division of labour. That is, some forms of labor cooperation are due purely to ''technical necessity'', but others are purely a result of a ''social control'' function related to a class and status hierarchy. If these two divisions are conflated, it might appear as though the existing division of labour is technically inevitable and immutable, rather than (in good part) socially constructed and influenced by [[Power (sociology)|power]] relationships. 

It may be, for example, that it is technically necessary that both pleasant and unpleasant jobs must be done by a group of people. But from that fact alone, it does not follow that any particular person must do any particular (pleasant or unpleasant) job.
If particular people get to do the unpleasant jobs and others the pleasant jobs, this cannot be explained by technical necessity; it is a socially made decision, which could be made using a variety of different criteria. The tasks could be rotated, or a person could be assigned to a task permanently, and so on. 

Marx also suggests that the capitalist division of labour will evolve over time such that the maximum amount of labour is [[productive and unproductive labour|productive labour]], where productive labour is defined as labour which creates [[surplus value]]. 

However, [[time use survey]]s suggest that commercially performed labour always depends on, and goes together with, the performance of a very large amount of  voluntary labour. To the extent that state [[subsidies]] are cut and [[privatisation]] increases, more work often devolves on people who must do that work without pay.

In Marx's [[communist]] utopia, the division of labour is transcended, meaning that balanced human development occurs where people fully express their nature in the variety of creative work that they do.

==Durkheim==

[[Émile Durkheim]] wrote about a fractionated, unequal world by divining it along the lines of &quot;[[Solidarity (sociology)|human solidarity]],&quot; its essential moral value is division of labour. In 1893 he published &quot;[[The Division of Labor in Society]]&quot;, his fundamental statement of the nature of [[human society]] and its [[social development]]. According to [[Franz Borkenau]] it was a great increase in division of labour occurring in the 1600s after the [[Industrial Revolution]] that introduced the abstract category of work, which may be said to underlie, in turn, the whole modern, [[Cartesian]] notion that our bodily existence is merely an object of our (abstract) consciousness.

==Von Mises, and globalisation==

On the other hand, Marx's theories, including the negative claims regarding the division of labour have been criticized by the [[Austrian economists]], such as [[Ludwig von Mises]]. 

The main argument here is that the gains accruing from the division of labour by far outweigh the costs; that it is fully possible to achieve balanced human development within [[capitalism]], and that [[alienation]] is more a [[romantic]] fiction. After all, work is not all there is; there is also [[leisure]] time.

The issue reaches its broadest scope in the controversies about [[globalisation]], which is often interpreted as a euphemism for the expansion of world trade based on [[comparative advantage]].
This would mean that countries specialise in the work they can do best. Critics however allege that international specialisation cannot be explained very well in terms of &quot;the work nations do best&quot;, rather this specialisation is guided more by [[commerce|commercial]] criteria, which favour some countries over others. 

The [[OECD]] recently advised ([[28 June]] [[2005]]) that:

&quot;Efficient policies to encourage employment and combat
unemployment are essential if countries are to reap the full benefits of globalisation and avoid a backlash against open trade... Job losses in some sectors, along with new job opportunities in other sectors, are an inevitable accompaniment of the process of globalisation... The challenge is to ensure that the adjustment process involved in matching available workers with new job openings works as smoothly as possible/.&quot;

==Modern debates==

In the modern world, those specialists most preoccupied in their work with theorising about the division of labour are those involved in [[management]] and [[organisation]]. In view of the global extremities of the division of labour, the question is often raised about what division of labour would be most ideal, beautiful, efficient and just. 

Labour [[hierarchy]] is to a great extent inevitable, simply because no one can do all tasks at once; but of course the way these hierarchies are structured can be influenced by a variety of different factors. The question to ask is what the hierarchy is a hierarchy of.

An important Western concept in this regard is the concept of [[meritocracy]], which could alternately be read as an [[explanation]] or as a [[justification]] of why a division of labour is the way it is. But it is often agreed that the most equitable principle in allocating people within hierarchies is that of true (or proven) [[competency]] or [[ability]].

==US 2002 estimates for the division of labour==

Statistics may help to reveal some of the dimensions of the division of labour. This example concerns the USA.

First, we can derive the ''basic'' employment categories in the USA in 2002 in approximate figures from BLS data, as follows (working our way down from the total population):

*American total resident population 288 million
*population (16+) 224 million
*economically active population 218 million
*total civilian non-institutional population (16+) 215 million
*population 16-65 years old 188 million
*civilian labour force 145 million
*employed civilian labour force 137 million
*Unpaid family workers 0.03 million
*employers 10 million (4.9 million distinct firms, 7 million establishments)
*self-employed (farm) 1 million
*self-employed (non-farm) 9 million
*wage &amp; salary earners 136 million
*employees 127 million
*government employees 20 million
*private sector workforce 105 million
*Parttime workers non-farm 27 million
*Parttime workers farm 0.5 million
*private sector waged employees 95 million
*unionised wage earners   18 million

We can then look at the proportions of what the ''total American population'' actually did in 2002, in approximate figures and broad categories:

*Children (under 16, not working for pay) 64 million
*Retired (over 65, not in the labour force) 28 million
*Fulltime housewives, house-husbands and idle not working for pay 22 million
*Industrial production workers 26.2 million
*Managers and executives 15.8 million
*Clerical and administrative workers 15.3 million
*Sales workers 15 million
*Reserve army of unemployed 13 million
*Engineers, architects, technicians, programmers and scientists 10.5 million
*Employers of workers, all kinds 9.8 million
*Supervisors of workers, all kinds 9.1 million
*Teachers, professional childcare workers and paid childcare assistants 8 million
*Transport workers 5 million
*Unskilled labourers, handlers and helpers  4.8 million
*Aides, ushers, guides, orderlies, and attendants 4.8 million
*Personal care, health and medical workers 4.3 million
*Cleaners, janitors, private cooks, maids &amp; housekeepers 3.7 million
*Accountants, auditors, underwriters, and financial officers 2.6 million
*Adults in institutional care n.e.c. 2.5 million
*Specialists &amp; consultants in human resources, PR and labour relations  2.1 million
*Prison &amp; jail inmates 2 million
*Artists, entertainers &amp; designers, photographers, professional athletes, recreational services 1.6 million
*Nursing home residents 1.6 million
*Fulltime criminals and lumpenised, not in corrective institutions 1.5 million
*Lawyers, judges and legal assistants 1.3 million
*Therapists, counselors, social workers and welfare service aides 1.2 million
*Police, detective, and law enforcement officers 1.2 million
*Medical doctors, dentists, vetinarians, optometrists, and podiatrists 1.1 million
*Military personnel, domestic 1.1 million
*Groundskeepers, gardeners, animal caretakers (non-farm) 1.1 million
*Security guards   1 million
*Farmers 1 million
*Prostitutes 1 million
*Working children (under 16) 1 million
*Inspectors (construction, production and compliance) 0.9 million
*Editors, writers, reporters, proofreaders, librarians, archivists, and curators 0.6 million
*Adult hospital patients 0.5 million
*Religious clergy, and employees of religious institutions 0.4 million
*Corrective institution &amp; prison officers 0.3 million
*Firefighting, fire prevention and pest control workers 0.3 million
*Water, sewage and electricity workers 0.2 million
*Hospice inpatients 0.1 million
*Adult psychiatric patients 0.2 million

Finally, we can look at the occupational structure of the employed labour force (including salaried and self-employed) in the USA in 2002, in broad categories, as follows:
 
*Managers and executives 15,800,000
*Supervisors 9,100,000
*Teaching staff, all kinds  6,600,000
*Machine operating and assembly workers 6,400,000
*Food &amp; beverage preparing and service workers 6,100,000
*Administrative support clerks n.e.c.  5,800,000
*Construction trade workers  5,300,000
*Aides, ushers, guides, orderlies, and attendants     4,800,000

These 2002 figures are just intended to provide a modest indication or illustration; of course, the way the division of labour is viewed depends greatly on the identification, classification and aggregation principles applied. A portion of migrant labour typically fails to be captured in the data.

It should be emphasized that the ways in which the division of labour may be viewed are potentially ''infinite''. This give rise to a never-ending stream of [[management]] literature. 

Normally, statisticians focus on the main occupational activity or employment status of members of the population; but of course individuals may also divide their time between different activities which are still not adequately captured in survey data. 

Consequently, it is always important in making generalisations about the division of labour to be very clear about the assumptions being made about ''how people differ'' and ''what they have in common''.

==The global division of labour==

There exist as yet few comprehensive studies of the global division of labour (an intellectual challenge for researchers), although the [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] and national statistical offices can provide plenty data on request for those game to try.

In one study, Deon Filmer estimated that 2,474 million people participated in the global non-domestic labour force in the mid-1990s. Of these around a fifth, 379 million people, worked in industry, 800 million in services, and 1,074 million in agriculture. The majority of workers in industry and services were wage &amp; salary earners - 58 percent of the industrial workforce and 65 percent of the services workforce. But a big portion were self-employed or involved in family labour. Filmer suggests the total of employees worldwide in the 1990s was about 880 million, compared with around a billion working on own account on the land (mainly peasants), and some 480 million working on own account in industry and services.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Davy_lamp.png|thumb|Davy lamp]]
The '''Davy lamp''' is a candle containing safety [[lamp]] devised in [[1815]] by [[Humphry Davy]]. It was created for use in [[coal mine]]s, allowing deep seams to be mined despite the presence of [[methane]] and other flammable [[gas]]es, called [[firedamp]] or minedamp.

Davy had discovered that, to [[explosion|explode]], the gas must be heated to its [[ignition]] temperature and that if such heating is prevented, combustion cannot occur. If the flame in a lamp is surrounded by metal [[gauze]] to distribute the heat over a large area, the maximum temperature of the screen is below the ignition temperature of the gas. The first trial of a Davy lamp with a wire sieve was at [[Hebburn Colliery]] on [[9 January]] [[1816]].

The lamp also provided a crude test for the presence of gases. If inflammable gas mixtures were present, the flame of the Davy lamp burned higher with a blue tinge. Miners could also place a safety lamp close to the ground to detect gases, such as [[carbon dioxide]], that are denser than air and so could collect in depressions in the mine, if the mine air was oxygen-poor, the lamp flame would be extinguished (chokedamp).

There was some controversy, since [[George Stephenson]] also produced a similar safety lamp, called the [[Geordie lamp]] in [[1815]].

How far the difference was appreciated at the time is hard to say; supporters of both men seem to have regarded the other as having copied their man’s idea and copied it wrongly. The Stephenson lamp (with no gauze around the [[flame]]) gave a brighter light and was popular with the pitmen. The Davy lamp was simpler and cheaper to make and was popular with the mineowners.  

There were supposed safety arguments on both sides: in principle, a poorly maintained (or badly designed) Davy lamp could overheat the gauze if it met a high concentration of methane. A more serious objection to the Stephenson lamp was that it stopped being a safety lamp if the glass was broken. In the long term, the Davy lamp (or at least the principle of a gauze enclosure round the flame) won out. 

The introduction of the Davy lamp actually led to an increase in accidents in mines as the availability of the lamp encouraged the working of mines that had previously been closed for safety reasons. [http://www.bopcris.ac.uk/bopall/ref4654.html]

The '''Docklands Light Railway''' ('''DLR''') is a [[light rail|light-rail]] [[public transport]] [[metro]] for the redeveloped [[Docklands]] area of eastern [[London]], [[England]]. The DLR is separate from the [[London Underground]], having  processing cheques (despite cheques being very costly for the banks). This imbalance most probably dates from the unilateral introduction in [[France]] of [[Chip and PIN]] debit cards in the early 1990s, when the cost of this technology was much higher than it is now. Credit cards of the type found in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]] are unusual in [[France]] and the closest equivalent is the deferred debit card, which operates like a normal debit card, except that all purchase transactions are postponed until the end of the month, thereby giving the customer between 1 and 31 days of interest-free credit. The annual fee for a deferred debit card is around €10 more than for one with immediate debit. Most [[France|French]] debit cards are branded with the [[Carte Bleue]] logo, which assures acceptance throughout [[France]]. Most card holders choose to pay around €5 more in their annual fee to additionally have a [[Visa (credit card)|Visa]] logo on their [[Carte Bleue]], so that the card is accepted internationally. A [[Carte Bleue]] without a [[Visa (credit card)|Visa]] logo is often known as a &quot;[[Carte Bleue]] Nationale&quot; and a [[Carte Bleue]] with a [[Visa (credit card)|Visa]] logo is often known as a &quot;[[Carte Bleue]] Internationale&quot;. Many smaller merchants in [[France]] refuse to accept debit cards for transactions under €15.25 (equivalent to 100 [[French Franc]]s) because of the minimum fee charged by merchants' banks per transaction. Merchants in [[France]] do not differentiate between debit and credit cards, and so both have equal acceptance.

In the [[United Kingdom]], banks started to issue debit cards in the late 1980s in a bid to reduce the number of cheques being used at the point of sale, which are costly for the banks to process. As in most countries, fees paid by merchants in the [[United Kingdom]] to accept credit cards are a percentage of the transaction amount, which funds card holders' interest-free credit periods as well as incentive schemes such as points, airmiles or cashback. On the contrary, debit cards do not usually have these characteristics, and so the fee for merchants to accept debit cards is a low fixed amount, regardless of transaction amount. This means it is cheaper for a merchant to accept a debit card for a large amount and to accept a credit card for a small amount. Although merchants won the right through [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1990/Uksi_19902159_en_1.htm The Credit Cards (Price Discrimination) Order 1990] to charge customers different prices according to the payment method, few merchants in the UK charge less for payment by debit card than by credit card, the most notable exceptions being [[budget airline]]s, [[travel agent]]s and [[IKEA]]. Debit cards in the UK lack the advantages offered to holders of UK-issued credit cards, such as free incentives (points, airmiles, cashback etc), interest-free credit and protection against defaulting merchants under [http://www.oft.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/DB431C9A-F28B-488A-B4C7-58C51C045169/0/oft303.pdf Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974]. Despite these disadvantages of debit cards over credit cards, many people in the UK prefer paying with debit cards rather than credit cards, often because they fear that using credit cards will result in accumulation of unmanageable debts. All establishments in the [[United Kingdom]] that accept credit cards also accept debit cards (although not always [[Solo (debit card)|Solo]] and [[Visa Electron]]), but a minority of merchants, for cost reasons, accept debit cards and not credit cards (for example the [[Post Office Ltd|Post Office]]).

In [[Germany]] and [[Belgium]], many merchants, including most supermarkets, do not accept credit cards because of the higher fees charged by their banks. However, most merchants usually accept debit cards, because the fees for accepting them are much lower, for example in [[Germany]] 0.3% with a minimum of €0.08.

==Online and offline debit cards==
There are currently two ways that debit card transactions are processed: online debit cards and offline debit cards. Online debit cards are essentially enhanced [[automatic teller machine]] [[ATM card|(ATM) cards]], as they use the same [[personal identification number]] (PIN) [[authentication]] system and debits are reflected in the user’s account immediately. The PIN authentication is much more secure than the alternative signature (used in offline debit cards). One difficulty in using online debit cards is the necessity of a separate [[keyboard technology|keypad]] at the [[point of sale]] (POS) to enter the PIN, although this is becoming commonplace for all card transactions in many countries. Overall, the online debit card is generally viewed as superior to the offline debit card because of its more secure authentication system and live status, which alleviates problems with processing [[lag]] on transactions that may have been forgotten or not authorized by the owner of the card. Banks in some countries, such as [[Canada]], only issue online debit cards.

Offline debit cards have the [[logo]]s of major credit cards (e.g. [[VISA (credit card)|Visa]] or [[MasterCard]]) or major debit cards (e.g. [[Maestro (debit card)|Maestro]]) and are used at point of sale like a credit card. This type of debit card may be subject to a daily limit, as well as a maximum limit equal to the amount currently deposited in the current/checking account from which it draws funds. Offline debit cards in some countries are not compatible with the PIN system, in which case they can be used with a forged signature, since users are rarely required to present [[personal identification|identification]]. Transactions conducted with offline debit cards usually require 2-3 days to be reflected on users’ account balances. This type of debit card is similar to a [[secured credit card|secured credit card]].

Many debit cards are actually capable of accomplishing both types of transactions, depending on the availability of proper equipment at the POS.

In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Solo (debit card)|Solo]] and [[Visa Electron]] are examples of online debit cards, which are typically issued by banks to customers whom the bank does not want to go overdrawn under any circumstances, for example under-18s.

==&quot;Credit&quot; and &quot;debit&quot; purchases==
In some countries (e.g. the [[United States]]), terminals allow the user of a Visa or MasterCard debit card to choose whether the purchase is a &quot;credit&quot; or &quot;debit&quot; purchase. In a &quot;credit&quot; purchase, the user signs a charge slip (as in a traditional credit card purchase); in a &quot;debit&quot; purchase, the user enters a PIN. In either case, the user's bank account is debited. 

In some countries and with some merchant service organisations (as of this writing), a &quot;credit&quot; transaction is without cost to the purchaser beyond the face value of the transaction, while a small fee may be charged for &quot;debit&quot; transactions (although it is often absorbed by the [[retailer]].) Other differences are that &quot;debit&quot; purchasers may opt to withdraw cash in addition to the amount of the debit purchase (if the merchant supports that functionality); also, from the merchant's standpoint, the merchant pays lower fees on a &quot;debit&quot; transaction as compared to &quot;credit&quot; transactions.  

The fees charged to merchants on &quot;credit&quot; debit card purchases -- and the lack of fees charged merchants for processing &quot;debit&quot; debit card purchases and paper checks -- have prompted some major merchants to file [[lawsuit]]s against debit-card transaction processors such as Visa and MasterCard.  Visa and MasterCard recently agreed to settle the largest of these lawsuits and agreed to [[settlement (law)|settlement]]s of billions of dollars.

Many consumers prefer &quot;credit&quot; transactions because of the lack of a fee charged to the consumer/purchaser -- and many terminals at PIN-accepting merchant locations now make the &quot;credit&quot; function more difficult to access.  Also, in the case of a benign or malicious error by the merchant and/or bank, a debit transaction may cause more serious problems (e.g. money not accessible; overdrawn account) than in the case of a credit or charge card transaction (e.g. credit not accessible; over [[credit limit]]).  

To the consumer, a debit transaction is real-time; i.e. the money is withdrawn from their account immediately following the authorization request from the merchant. This is in contrast to a typical credit card or charge card transaction which can have a lag time of a few days before the transaction is posted to the account, and many days to a month or more before the consumer makes repayment with actual money.

==[[Chip and PIN]]==
In many countries, the use of PIN validated transactions with [[smartcard]] [[chip]] [[reader]]s is being strongly encouraged by the banks as a method of reducing cloned-card [[fraud]]; to the extent that cardholder-present transactions will soon not be possible in these countries without knowledge of a PIN, and the POS terminal reading the smart card chip on the card.

==Popularity==
Debit cards and [[secured credit card]]s are popular among college students who have not yet established a credit history.  There are also forms of debit cards (e.g. [[Visa Buxx]]) that are purchased by parents for [[teenager]]s as young as 13.  The parent retains a great deal of control over the child's use of the cards.

Debit cards are also similar to [[stored-value card]]s in that they represent a finite amount of money owed by the card issuer to the holder.  They are different in that stored-value cards are generally anonymous, while debit cards are generally associated with an individual's bank account.  Debit cards usually offer some protection against loss, theft, or unauthorized use while stored-value cards usually do not.

[[Image:Dewar Flask.PNG|256px|right|thumb|A dewar flask, the red area is a [[vacuum]]]]

A '''Dewar flask''' is a vessel designed to provide very good [[thermal insulation]]. For instance, when filled with a hot liquid, the vessel will not allow the [[heat]] to easily escape, and the liquid will stay hot for far longer than in a typical container.  The Dewar flask was named after its inventor [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[physicist]] Sir [[James Dewar]] ([[1842]]&amp;ndash;[[1923]]).

In form, a Dewar flask is a [[glass]] or metal bottle, with a double-layer construction; in fact, it can be considered to be two thin-walled bottles nested one inside the other, and sealed together at the neck. The narrow space between is evacuated almost entirely of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]; the near [[vacuum]] prevents [[heat conduction|conduction]] and [[convection]] of heat.

The inner surfaces of the outer bottle, and the outer surface of the inner bottle, have a metallic or similar reflective coating to prevent heat from being transmitted via [[Thermal radiation|radiation]]. Dewar himself used [[silver]] for this purpose. This is so effective that what little heat transport does occur is almost entirely via the neck and stopper; insulating materials such as [[Cork (material)|cork]] are often used for the stopper.

A very common use of the Dewar flask in laboratories is the storage of liquid [[nitrogen]]; in this case, the leakage of heat into the extremely cold interior of the bottle results in a slow &quot;boiling-off&quot; of the liquid (a [[pressure relief valve]] is provided to prevent [[pressure]] from building up). The excellent insulation of the Dewar flask results in a very slow &quot;boil&quot; and thus the nitrogen lasts a long time without the need for expensive [[refrigeration]] equipment.

A &quot;Thermos bottle&quot; ([[trademark]]ed), or [[vacuum flask]] (generic) used to keep [[coffee]] or other beverages hot, is usually based on the design of a Dewar flask; since glass dewar flasks are fragile and somewhat expensive to fabricate, other constructions based on [[plastic]] or insulated metal are also popular.

[[Image:DDR(bag).jpg|250px|thumb|right|The main gameplay screen of ''Dance Dance Revolution''.]]
'''''Dance Dance Revolution''''', or '''''DDR''''' (known as ''[[Dancing Stage]]'' in Europe), is a [[music video game]] series produced by [[Konami]]. It was first introduced to [[Japan|Japanese]] [[video arcade]]s in 1998, after being shown at the [[Tokyo Game Show]] earlier that year. Since then, the game has gained significant popularity elsewhere in the [[world]], including large portions of [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. As of 2005, over 90 official versions have been produced, including those for home [[video game console]]s. The ''Dance Dance Revolution'' series is a subset of the larger [[Bemani]] series of music games.

The game is typically played on a [[dance pad]] with four [[arrow]] panels: [[up]], [[down]], [[left]], and [[right]]. These panels are pressed using the player's [[foot|feet]], in response to arrows that appear on the screen in front of the player. The arrows are [[synchronization|synchronized]] to the general [[rhythm]] or [[beat (music)|beat]] of a chosen [[song]], and success is dependent on the player's ability to time his or her steps accordingly.

==Gameplay details==

In ''Dance Dance Revolution'', a player must move his or her feet to a set pattern, stepping in time to the general rhythm or beat of a song. During normal gameplay, arrows scroll upwards from the bottom of the screen and pass over stationary, transparent arrows near the top (referred to as the &quot;guide arrows&quot; or &quot;arrow casting&quot;). When the scrolling arrows overlap the stationary ones, the player must step on the corresponding arrows on the dance platform. Successfully hitting the arrows in time with the music fills the &quot;Dance Gauge&quot;, or [[life bar]], while failure to do so drains it. If the Dance Gauge is fully depleted during gameplay, the player fails the song, usually resulting in a [[game over]]. Otherwise, the player is taken to the Results Screen, which rates the player's performance with a [[letter grade]] and a numerical [[score (video games)|score]], among other statistics. The player may then be given a chance to play again, depending on the settings of the particular machine (the limit is usually 3-5 songs per game).

''DDR'' is often criticized as being rigid and bearing little resemblance to actual [[dance|dancing]]. Many players, in order to better focus on timing and pattern reading, will minimize any extraneous body movement during gameplay. These players are commonly referred to as &quot;technical&quot;, &quot;tech&quot; or &quot;perfect attack&quot; (PA) players. However, there are those who prefer style over accuracy, and may incorporate complex or flashy techniques into their play movements. Some dedicated &quot;freestyle&quot; players will even develop intricate dance routines to perform during a song. Technical players will often practice the most difficult songs for extended periods of time, while freestyle players will choose songs on lower difficulty levels, as to accommodate their desires for easier movement.

===Songs and difficulty levels===
[[Image:DDR US 1st how to play cropped.jpg|thumb|left|250px|How to play screen]]
Music in ''DDR'' comes from two primary sources: songs licensed from, although not limited to, [[Toshiba-EMI]]'s ''[[Dancemania]]'' collections, and music made specifically for the [[Bemani]] series by in-house artists such as [[Naoki Maeda]] and &quot;[[Scotty D]]&quot; (Konami translator [[Scott Dolph]]). Most songs average between one and two minutes long, and may be edited from their original length to accommodate this limit. Exceptions include the three-song or four-song [[medley]]s (better known as &quot;Megamix,&quot; &quot;Nonstop&quot; or &quot;Marathons&quot;, where the music and step patterns from three different songs are mixed together into one stage or played back-to-back.)Megamixes are only found in  ''[[Dance Dance Revolution Solo BASS MIX|DDR Solo Bass]]'' and ''[[Dance Dance Revolution Solo 2000|Solo 2000]]'', and Long Version songs from ''[[Dance Dance Revolution 5thMIX|DDR 5thMIX]]'' (songs at a normal 3:00 length.), double-length &quot;Long Versions&quot;, and, for the home version, the 40-minute-plus &quot;Nonstop Megamixes&quot;. 

Music in ''DDR'' may be fast or slow, and may even change tempo. It is a common mistake to assume that slower songs must be easier; often, the exact opposite is true, as reading fast-scrolling and thus widely spaced arrows is often easier than reading lots of dense, slow-scrolling arrows. 

Excluding full song pauses, [[Dance Dance Revolution Club Mix|be in my paradise]] from [[Dance Dance Revolution Club Mix]] has the slowest scrolling speed of any DDR song, clocking in a constant 63 [[Beats per minute|BPM]]- only slightly slower than the vastly more difficult 65-BPM [[Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME|bag]] from [[Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME]]. [[Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME|Sakura]], also from [[Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME]], reaches a tempo of just around 14 BPM for only one note near the midpoint of the song, but speeds up to 320 BPM moments later. On the other end of the spectrum are the MAX songs, including [[DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX|MAX 300]] at 300 BPM, [[DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX|MAXX Unlimited]] at 300 and later 320 BPM, [[Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME|The legend of MAX]] at 333 BPM with a speed-up to 666 in the middle of a freeze, and finally [[Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2|MAX. (period)]] at 300 BPM for a majority of the song with 20 seconds of 180BPM (a tribute to [[PARANOiA]] with it as the only music) to 600BPM (only quarter notes, 15 seconds) and a sudden slowdown to 150 BPM.

The common misconception of the stated BPM is that the song in question actually contains an integer multiple of the actual BPM. These songs can usually be identified by their BPM scrolling to the slowest BPM then to the highest BPM on the Music Select screen however there are some that will not have this option availble.

Each song has multiple step patterns, rated in difficulty from 1-10. The difficulty is measured in units called &quot;feet&quot;, as the game screen will display a certain number of feet attributed to the song's difficulty before the player chooses it. Naturally, the more &quot;feet&quot;, the more complex the step pattern will be.

The 1-3 foot step patterns are recommended for newer players and 4-8 range from intermediate to, at times, frustratingly difficult (many players have complained about songs being &quot;mislabeled&quot;, that is, given foot ratings that do not properly measure their difficulty.)  Nine foot songs, commonly referred to as &quot;catas&quot; (short for &quot;catastrophic&quot;, the label given to this difficulty of steps on ''3rdMIX'' and ''DDR USA''), generally require high levels of practice of one or more specific ''DDR'' skills. The skills include:
*Stamina - Ability to hit arrows in rapid succession for an extended period of time
*Rhythm - Ability to stay on beat throughout the song
*Alternation - Ability to alternate feet on each step, leading into more complex steps
*Spins - Following a circular pattern around the pad
*Crossovers - In alternating feet per step, the one foot must hit an arrow on the opposite of its original position
*Gallops - A set of 1/4th and 1/16th or 1/4th and 1/12th (or eighth note triplets) notes in rapid succession
*Triplets - One beat divided into 3 equal 1/16th notes.
*Trills - Alternating on two steps that must be hit repeatedly in rapid succession.
*Jackhammers (also called jacks) - Steps on one arrow that must be hit rapidly.

Songs with 10 foot step patterns are considered the most difficult, including runs of up to 10 arrows a second for 10-20 seconds and complicated rhythm patterns. Four songs have earned the distinction as &quot;Flashing 10 Footers&quot;, testing the player even further with complex step patterns (such as a 40 second stream of crossovers at 290BPM). The term &quot;Flashing 10 Footer&quot; borrows from [[Beatmania IIDX]], in which the highest difficulty rating is seven stars, and the most difficult have seven flashing stars.

Most music in DDR has 3 or 4 separate step patterns with increasing difficulty and are called difficulty &quot;modes&quot;.  In 1st-5th Mix, the difficulty modes are known as &quot;Basic,&quot; &quot;Trick&quot; and &quot;Maniac.&quot;  Starting with Dance Dance Revolution 6th Mix: DDRMAX, these modes are called &quot;Light,&quot; &quot;Standard&quot; and &quot;Heavy.&quot;

Certain new music in DDR 7th Mix: DDRMAX 2 is only available in &quot;oni mode&quot; courses (explained later) and have only one set of dance steps.  This music becomes playable in regular game mode for DDR Extreme with the exact same steps and are labeled as &quot;Challenge&quot; steps.

In DDR Extreme, a &quot;Beginner&quot; step set is introduced to all music with &quot;Light,&quot; &quot;Standard&quot; and &quot;Heavy&quot; step modes.  These steps are very easy to step to so that beginning players can learn how to aux-paparazzi]] to make guests feel important. The event peaked in 2001 with thousands in attendance. In [[2002]], it was a more somber event with only several hundred guests and little of the excess of the late 1990s. In [[2003]], the awards were reduced to a virtual event because many of the nominees couldn't fly to San Francisco due primarily to corporate belt-tightening and fear of losing their jobs. The [[2005]] edition was held in New York City.

Historically the dot-com boom can be seen as similar to a number of other technology inspired booms of the past including [[Railway mania|railroads]] in the [[1840s]], radio in the [[1920s]], transistor electronics in the [[1950s]], computer time-sharing in the [[1960s]], and [[home computers]] and [[biotechnology]] in the early [[1980s]].

==Soaring stocks==
A [[stock market bubble]] in financial markets is a term applied to a self-perpetuating rise or boom in the share prices of stocks of a particular industry.  The term may be used with certainty only in retrospect when share prices have since crashed.  A bubble occurs when speculators note the fast increase in value and decide to buy in anticipation of further rises, rather than because the shares are undervalued. Typically many companies thus become grossly overvalued. When the bubble &quot;bursts&quot;, the share prices fall dramatically, and many companies go out of business.

The late [[1990s]] boom in technology dot-com company stocks is a good example of a bubble, which burst in late [[2000]] and through [[2001]].

The dot-com model was inherently flawed: a vast number of companies all had the same business plan of [[monopoly|monopolising]] their respective sectors through network effects, and it was clear that even if the plan was sound, there could only be at most one network-effects winner in each sector, and therefore that most companies with this business plan would fail. In fact, many sectors could not support even one company powered entirely by network effects. 

In spite of this, vast fortunes were made by a few company founders whose companies were bought out at an early stage in the dot-com stock market bubble. These early successes made the bubble even more [[buoyancy|buoyant]]. An unprecedented amount of personal investing occurred during the boom. Stories of people quitting their jobs to become full-time [[day trading|day traders]], while not representative, were common in the press.

==Free spending==
According to dot-com theory, an internet company's survival depended on expanding its customer base as rapidly as possible, even if it produced large annual losses. The phrase &quot;Get large or get lost&quot; was the wisdom of the day. At the height of the boom it was possible for a promising dot-com to make an [[initial public offering]] of its stock and raise a substantial amount of money even though it had never made a profit, or even any revenues in some cases. But then the matter of [[burn rate]] came into play as capital was expended in operating a company with no income and no viable [[business model]].

Public awareness campaigns were one way that dot-coms sought to grow their customer base. These included television ads, print ads, and targeting of professional sporting events. The January 2000 Super Bowl featured seventeen dot-com companies (most memorably [[pets.com]]) that each paid over $2 million for a 30-second spot. In January 2001, just three dot-coms bought advertising spots. Iwon.com gave away $10 million to a lucky contestant on an April 2000 show that aired on CBS. Many dot-coms named themselves with [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] nonsense words that they hoped would be memorable and not easily confused with a competitor.

Not surprisingly, the &quot;growth over profits&quot; mentality and the aura of &quot;new economy&quot; invincibility led some companies to engage in lavish internal spending, such as elaborate business facilities and luxury vacations for employees. Executives and employees who were paid with [[stock option]]s in lieu of cash became instant millionaires when the company made its initial public offering; many invested their new wealth into yet more dot-coms.

Cities all over the United States sought to become the &quot;next Silicon Valley&quot; by building network-enabled office space to attract internet entrepreneurs. Communication providers, convinced that the future economy would require ubiquitous [[broadband access]], went deeply into debt to improve their networks with high-speed equipment and [[fiber optic]] cables. A Worldcom executive famously remarked that internet traffic would double every hundred ''days'' for the foreseeable future. Companies that produced network equipment, such as [[Cisco Systems]], profited greatly from these projects.

Similarly, in [[Europe]] the vast amounts of cash the [[Mobile phone|mobile]] operators spent on [[3G]]-licences in [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and the [[United Kingdom]] for example led them into deep debt. The investments were blown out of proportion regardless of whether seen in the context of their current or projected future [[cash flow]], but this fact was not publicly acknowledged until as late as [[2001]] and [[2002]]. Due to the highly networked nature of the [[Information technology|IT]] industry this quickly led into problems for small companies that were dependent on contracts from operators.

==Thinning the herd==
Over 1999 and early 2000, the [[Federal Reserve]] had increased interest rates six times, and the runaway economy was beginning to lose speed.  The '''dot-com bubble''' burst, numerically, on [[March 10]], [[2000]], when the technology heavy [[NASDAQ Composite]] index [http://dynamic.nasdaq.com/dynamic/IndexChart.asp?symbol=IXIC&amp;desc=NASDAQ+Composite&amp;sec=nasdaq&amp;site=nasdaq&amp;months=84] peaked at 5048.62 (intra-day peak 5132.52), more than double its value just a year before. The NASDAQ fell slightly after that, but was attributed to correction; the actual reversal and subsequent [[bear market]] may have been triggered by the adverse [[findings of fact]] in the [[United States v. Microsoft]] case in the US. The findings, which declared [[Microsoft]] a [[monopoly]], were widely expected in the weeks before their release on [[April 3]].

[[Image:NASDAQ IXIC - dot-com bubble small.png|center|frame|The technology-heavy [[NASDAQ]] Composite index peaked in March 2000, reflecting the high point of the dot-com bubble.]]

Another reason may have been accelerated business spending in preparation for the [[Year 2000 problem|Y2K]] switchover.  Once New Year had passed without incident, businesses found themselves with all the equipment they needed for some time and business spending dried up.  This correlates quite closely to the peak of U.S. stock markets.  The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow Jones]] peaked in [[January 2000]] and the Nasdaq in [[March 2000]].  Hiring freezes, layoffs, and consolidations followed in several industries, especially in the dot-com.

By [[2001]], the bubble's deflation was running full speed. A majority of the dot-coms have now ceased trading, after having burnt through their [[venture capital]], often without ever making a gross [[profit]], thereby becoming ''[[dot-compost]]''.

==Aftermath==
On [[January 11]], [[2000]], [[Time Warner]], the world's largest media company, was acquired by [[America Online]], a favorite of dot-com investors and pioneer of dial-up internet access. Within two years, boardroom disagreements drove out both of the [[chief executive officer|CEO]]s who made the deal, and in [[October]] [[2003]] AOL Time Warner dropped &quot;AOL&quot; from its name. The acquisition thus became a symbol of the dot-coms' challenge to &quot;old economy&quot; companies and the old economy's ultimate survival. The revolutionary optimism of the boom faded, and analysts once again recognized the relevance of traditional business thinking.

Several communication companies, burdened with unredeemable debts from their expansion projects, sold their assets for cash or filed for [[bankruptcy]]. [[WorldCom]], the largest of these, was found to have used accounting devices to overstate its profits by billions of dollars. The company's stock crashed when these irregularities were revealed, and within days it filed the largest corporate bankruptcy in US history. Other examples include [[NorthPoint Communications]], [[Global Crossing]], [[JDS Uniphase]], [[XO Communications]], and [[Covad Communications]]. Demand for the new high-speed infrastructure never materialized, and it became [[dark fiber]]. Some analysts believe that there is so much dark fiber worldwide that only a small percentage of it will be &quot;lit&quot; in the decades to come.

One by one, dot-coms ran out of capital and were acquired or [[liquidation|liquidated]]; the domain names were picked up by old-economy competitors or domain name investors. Several companies were accused or convicted of [[fraud]] for misusing shareholders' money, and the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] fined top investment firms like [[Citigroup]] and [[Merrill Lynch]] millions of dollars for misleading investors. Various supporting industries, such as advertising and shipping, scaled back their operations as demand for their services fell. A few dot-com companies, such as [[Amazon.com]] and [[eBay]], survived the turmoil and appear to have a good chance of long-term survival.

Technology experts such as computer programmers who were laid off found a glutted job market. This was exacerbated by the business trend of [[international outsourcing]] and the recently allowed increase of skilled visa &quot;guest workers&quot; such as those participating in the controversial US [[H-1B visa]] program. University degree programs for computer-related careers saw a noticeable drop in new students. Anecdotes of unemployed programmers going back to school to become accountants or lawyers were common.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[finance]], a '''discounted cash flow''' or DCF is the value of a cash flow adjusted for the [[time value of money]]. The nominal values of two cash flows in different time periods  cannot be directly compared because the preference of most people for consumption sooner rather than later, and because of the [[opportunity cost]] of forgoing an interest earning investment. Establishing which interest rate or [[discount|discount rate]] to use can sometimes prove to be a very complicated task.

==Math==
The discounted cash flow is expressed as

&lt;math&gt;DCF = \left (\frac{1}{(1+d)^n}\right) * CF&lt;/math&gt;

future receipts;
* ''d'' is the discount rate, which is

==History==
Discounted cash flow calculations have been used in some form since money was first lent at interest in ancient times.  As a method of asset valuation it has often been opposed to accounting book value, which is based on the amount paid for the asset.  Following the stock market crash of 1929, discounted cash flow analysis gain popularity as a valuation method for stocks.  [[Irving Fisher]] in his 1930 book &quot;The Theory of Interest&quot; and [[John Burr Williams]]'s 1938 text '[[The Theory of Investment Value]]' first formally expressed the DCF method in modern economic terms.

The modern city preserves the 17th-century layout of four main streets radiating from the Diamond to four gateways - Bishop's Gate, Ferryquay Gate, Shipquay Gate and Butcher's Gate. Historic buildings within the walls include the 1633 Gothic [[St Columb's Cathedral|cathedral of St Columb]]. In the porch is an inscription:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'If stones could speake then London's prayse should sound Who built this church and cittie from the grounde.'
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Economy ==
The economy of Derry was based significantly on the textile industry until relatively recently. For many years women were the sole wage earners working in the shirt factories while the men predominantly in comparison had high levels of unemployment [http://www.recirca.com/backissues/c95/dwc.shtml]. This led to significant male emigration [http://www.bloodysundaytrust.org/eduhistory.htm]. In more recent times the textile industry jobs have increasingly moved to the far east, leaving Derry to bear an increased jobless total. The history of shirt making in Derry dates back as far as [[1831]] and is said to have been [http://www.geocities.com/historyofshirtmakinginderry/shirtmakinginderry.htm started] by William Scott and his family who first exported shirts to [[Glasgow]]. Within 50 years, shirt making in the city was the most prolific in the UK with garments being exported all over the world. In fact it was known so well that the industry even received a mention in ''[[Das Kapital]]'' by [[Karl Marx]] when discussing the [[factory]] system:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The shirt factory of Messrs. Tille at Londonderry, which employs 1000 operatives in the factory itself, and 9000 people spread up and down the country and working in their own houses.
[http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Marx/mrxCpAtoc.html see Part IV, Chapter XV]
(first published in 1867)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A long term foreign employer in the area is [[Du Pont]], who have been based at Maydown since [[1958]], this was its [http://heritage.dupont.com/touchpoints/tp_1958/depth.shtml first] ever [[European]] production facility. Originally [[Neoprene]] was manufactured at Maydown and susequently followed by [[Hypalon]]. More recently [[Lycra]] and [[Kevlar]]® production units were active [http://www.nics.gov.uk/irtu/research/synthetic-4.html]. Thanks to a healthy world-wide demand for Kevlar which is made at the plant, the faclity recently undertook a £40 million upgrade to expand its global Kevlar production. Du pont have stated that contributing factors to their continued commitment to Maydown are: &quot;low labor costs, excellent communications, and tariff-free, easy access to the U.K. mainland and European continent.&quot;

[[Image:Seagate building Derry 2005.jpg|right|200px|thumbnail|Seagate Production Facility, 1 Disc Drive, Springtown Industrial Estate, Derry.]]
In the last 15 years there has been a drive to increase inward investment in the town, more recently concentrating on digital industries. Currently the three largest private-sector employers are American firms [http://www.state.gov/s/p/rem/13319.htm].

Even though Derry provides cheap labour by standards in the West, [http://www.marxist.net/ireland/beyondframe.htm?ch8.htm critics] have noted that the grants offered by the Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board have helped land jobs for the area that will only last as long as the funding lasts. This was reflected by 1990 questions to The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Richard Needham) [http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm198990/cmhansrd/1990-03-01/Orals-1.html Column 372 &amp; 373]. It was noted that it cost £30,000 to create one job in an American firm in the north of Ireland.

Successes have included call centres and a large investment by [[Seagate]] who have operated a factory in the Springtown Industrial Estate in Derry since 1993, they currently sponsor the city [[film festival]], but more significantly they employ over 1000 people in the Springtown premises which produces more than half of Seagate's total requirement for [[hard drive]] read-write heads. 

A success for the [[IDB]] (for Northern Ireland) was [[Stream International]], who opened an outsourced technology call centre operation in the IDB's Ulster Science &amp; Technology Park in Derry in January 1995, it is now the third largest employer in Derry [http://www.stream.com/ourcompany/sites/emea_londonderry.asp].

A recent but controversial new employer in the area is [[Raytheon]], Raytheon Systems Limited, was established in 1999, in the Ulster Science &amp; Technology Park, Buncrana Road [http://www.raytheon.co.uk/about/londonderry.html]. Although local people welcomed the jobs boost many in the area object to the jobs being provided by a firm involved heavily in the [[arms trade]] [http://www.raytheon.co.uk/about/londonderry.html].

The most significant employers in the region are:

'''International:'''
* DuPont (US)
* Stream International (US)
* Seagate Technology (US)
* Perfecseal, Bemis (US)
* [[NTL]] (US)
* Arntz Belting (Germany)

Londonderry Port at Lisahally is the United Kingdom’s most westerly port and has capacity for 30,000 ton vessels. The port played a vital part for the Allies in WWII during the war's longest running campaign, The Battle of the Atlantic and eventually saw the surrender of the German UBoat fleet at Lisahally on May 8, 1945. In spite of Derry being the second city of Northern Ireland road and rail links to other cities are below par for its standing. Many business leaders claim that government investment in the city and infrastructure has been badly lacking. 

Some have stated that this is due to its outlaying border location whilst others have cited a [[sectarian]] bias against the west of the province due to its high proportion of Catholics [http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/derry/bac.htm] [http://www.irelandseye.com/aarticles/history/events/conflict/bttc4.shtm]. In any event, there is no motorway link with [[Belfast]] or [[Dublin]]. Additionally the rail link to Belfast has been downgraded over the years so that presently it is not a viable alternative to the roads for industry to rely on. Mr Garvan O'Doherty, local business man and board member of the Londonderry Port and Harbour Commission, stated in the [[Irish Times]], October 2005:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;It is vital that road, rail and air links are all maximised with particular emphasis on the two principal road axes - connections to Belfast and Dublin.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Much has been made of the City of Derry airport. However it should be noted that the citizens of Derry themselves directly subsidise its running from local council tax coffers.

Critics of investment decisions affecting Derry often point to the decision to build a new university building in nearby [[Coleraine]] rather than developing the University of Ulster campus that already existed in Derry - Magee. Another major government decision affecting Derry was the decision to create the new city of [[Craigavon]] outside Belfast, which again was detrimental to the development of Derry. Even in October 2005, there is perceived bias against Derry with a major civil service job contract going to Belfast rather than the comparitvely impoverished North West of the province. [[Mark Durkan]], the [[SDLP]] leader and [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for Foyle was quoted in the Belfast Telegraph as saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;The fact is there has been consistent under-investment in the North West and a reluctance on the part of the Civil Service to see or support anything west of the Bann, except when it comes to rate increases, then they treat us equally.&quot;
[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northwest_edition/story.jsp?story=666639]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many observers note that politics will need to play a part in the future development of the economy of Derry. Whether it is a future devolved Northern Ireland government or the British or Irish or European parliaments that will provide the impetus it is clear that cross border digital and physical infrastructure improvements are needed. In July 2005, the Irish Minister for Finance, [[Brian Cowan]] called for a joint task force to drive economic growth in the cross border region. This would have implications for Derry, Tyrone and Donegal across the border.

Given the afforability of housing in the city, the student population has boomed in recent years bringing a revival in the fortunes of [[Magee Campus|Magee]], the oldest campus within the [[University of Ulster]] established in [[1865]] as Magee College.

==The Rise of Dost Mohammad==

It was not until [[1826]] that the energetic [[Dost Mahommed Khan|Dost Mohammad]] was able to exert sufficient control over his brothers to take over the throne in [[Kabul]], where he proclaimed himself amir.

Dost Mohammad achieved prominence among his brothers through clever use of the support of his mother's [[Qizilbash]] tribesmen and his own youthful apprenticeship under his brother, [[Fateh Khan]]. Among the many problems he faced was repelling [[Sikh]] encroachment on the [[Pashtun]] areas east of the [[Khyber Pass]]. After working assiduously to establish control and stability in his domains around Kabul, the amir next chose to confront the Sikhs.

In 1834 Dost Mohammad defeated an invasion by the former ruler, [[Shuja Shah]], but his absence from Kabul gave the Sikhs the opportunity to expand westward. [[Ranjit Singh|Ranjit Singh's]] forces occupied [[Peshawar]], moving from there into territory ruled directly by Kabul. In 1836 Dost Mohammad's forces, under the command of his son [[Mohammad Akbar Khan]], defeated the Sikhs at [[Jamrud]], a post fifteen kilometers west of Peshawar. The Afghan leader did not follow up this triumph by retaking Peshawar, however, but instead contacted [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|Lord Auckland]], the new [[British Empire|British]] governor general in [[India]], for help in dealing with the Sikhs. With this letter, Dost Mohammad formally set the stage for British intervention in [[Afghanistan]]. At the heart of [[the Great Game]] lay the willingness of Britain and Russia to subdue, subvert, or subjugate the small independent states that lay between them.

== The Great Game ==
[[Image:Great Game cartoon from 1878.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Political cartoon depicting the Afghan Amir Sher Ali with his &quot;friends&quot; Britain &amp; Russia (1878)]]
''Main article :[[The Great Game]].''

The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] became the major power in the [[India]]n sub-continent after the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]]  and had begun to show interest in [[Afghanistan]] as early as their 1809 treaty with [[Shuja Shah]].  It was the threat of the expanding [[Russian Empire]] beginning to push for an advantage in the Afghanistan region that placed pressure on British India, in what became known as the &quot;Great Game&quot;.  The Great Game set in motion the confrontation of the British and Russian empires &amp;mdash; whose [[spheres of influence]] moved steadily closer to one another until they met in Afghanistan. It also involved Britain's repeated attempts to impose a puppet government in Kabul. The remainder of the nineteenth century saw greater European involvement in Afghanistan and her surrounding territories and heightened conflict among the ambitious local rulers as Afghanistan's fate played out globally.

The debacle of the Afghan civil war left a vacuum in the [[Hindu Kush]] area that concerned the British, who were well aware of the many times in history it had been employed as the invasion route to India. In the early decades of the nineteenth century, it became clear to the British that the major threat to their interests in India would not come from the fragmented Afghan empire, the [[Iran|Iranians]], or the [[France|French]], but from the [[Russian Empire|Russians]], who had already begun a steady advance southward from the [[Caucasus]].

At the same time, the Russians feared permanent British occupation in [[Central Asia]] as the British encroached northward, taking the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], [[Sindh]], and [[Kashmir]]. The British viewed Russia's absorption of the Caucasus, the [[Kirghiz]] and [[Turkmen]] lands, the [[Khanate of Khiva]], and the [[Emirate of Bukhara]] with equal suspicion as a threat to their interests in the Indian subcontinent.

In addition to this rivalry between Britain and Russia, there were two specific reasons for British concern over Russia's intentions. First was the Russian influence at the Iranian court, which prompted the Russians to support Iran in its attempt to take [[Herat]], historicalch are distinguished by the way that they are traded in market:

* '''Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives''' are contracts that are traded directly between two parties, without going through an exchange or other intermediary. Products such as [[swap (finance)|swaps]], [[forward rate agreement]]s, and [[exotic option]]s are almost always traded in this way. The OTC derivatives market is huge. According to the [[Bank for International Settlements]], the total outstanding notional amount is USD 248 trillion at the end of December 2004{{mn|afgh|1}}.

* '''Exchange-traded derivatives''' are those derivatives products that are traded via [[Derivatives exchange]]s. A derivatives exchange acts as an intermediary to all transactions, and takes [[Initial margin]] from both sides of the trade to act as a guarantee. The world's largest{{mn|foweek|2}} derivatives exchanges (by number of transactions) are the [[Korea Exchange]] (which lists [[KOSPI]] Index Futures &amp; Options), [[Eurex]] (which lists a wide range of European products such as interest rate &amp; index products), [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] and the [[Chicago Board of Trade]]

===Common contract types===
There are three major classes of derivatives:
* [[futures contract|Futures]]/[[forward contract|Forwards]], which are contracts to buy or sell an asset at a specified future date.
* [[Option]]s which are contracts that give the buyer the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell an asset at a specified future date.
* [[Swaps]], where the two parties agree to exchange cash flows

===Examples===
Some common examples of these derivatives are:

Some less common examples of underlyings are:
* [[Economic derivative]]s that pay off according to [[economic report]]s ([http://biz.yahoo.com/c/e.html]) as measured and reported by national [[statistical agencies]]
*[[Energy derivative]] that payoff according to a wide variety of indexed energy prices.  Usually classified as either physical or financial, where physical means the contract includes actual delivery of the underlying energy commodity (oil, gas, power, etc)
*[[Freight derivative]]
*[[Insurance derivative]]
*[[Weather derivatives]]

==Cash flow==
The payments between the parties may be determined by:
* the price of some other, independently traded asset in the future (e.g., a [[common stock]]);
* the level of an independently determined index (e.g., a stock market index or heating-degree-days);
* the occurrence of some well-specified event (e.g., a company [[defaulting]]);
* an [[interest rate]];
* an [[exchange rate]];
* or some other factor.

Some derivatives are the right to buy or sell the underlying security or commodity at some point in the future for a predetermined price. If the price of the underlying security or commodity moves into the right direction, the owner of the derivative makes money; otherwise, they lose money or the derivative becomes worthless. Depending on the terms of the contract, the potential gain or loss on a derivative can be much higher than if they had traded the underlying security or commodity directly.

==Valuation==
===Market price and fair value===
Two common measures of value are:

*[[Market price]], ie. the price at which traders are willing to buy or sell the contract
*[[Fair value]] or the theoretical price, ie. a rational and unbiased estimate of the contract's fundamental value

===Determining the market price===
For exchange traded derivatives, market price is usually transparent (often published in real-time by the exchange, based on all the current bids and offers placed on that particular contract at any one time).

Complications can arise with OTC or floor-traded contracts though, as trading is handled manually, making it difficult to automatically broadcast prices. In particular with OTC contracts, there is no central exchange to collate and disseminate prices.

===Determining fair value===
The fair value of a derivatives contract is often complex, partly because of the immense variation in contracts, and partly because there are often many different variables to consider.

Fair valuation of derivatives is a central topic of [[financial mathematics]]. Where &quot;fair&quot; refers to the absence of [[arbitrage]],
meaning that no riskless profits can be made by trading in assets. Crucial to the valuation of derivatives is also the [[stochastic]]s of the underlying assets, typically expressed as a [[stochastic process]].

A key equation for the theoretical [[valuation of options]] is the [[Black-Scholes formula]], that made it possible
to replicate a stock [[option]] by a continuous buying and selling strategy
in the plain stock. Other derived equations include the [[Binomial options model]], Kim and Garman-Kohlhagen models.

==Usages==
===Insurance and hedging===
One use of derivatives is as a tool to transfer [[risk]]. For example, farmers can sell [[futures contract]]s on a crop to a speculator before the harvest. The farmer offloads (or [[hedge (finance)|hedges]]) the risk that the price will rise or fall, and the speculator accepts the risk with the possibility of a large reward. The farmer knows for certain the revenue he will get for the crop that he will grow; the speculator will make a profit if the price rises, but also risks making a loss if the price falls.

It is not unknown for farmers to walk away smiling, when they have lost out in the derivatives market, as the result of a hedge.  In this case, they have profited from the real market from the sale of their crops.  Contrary to popular belief, financial markets are not always a [[Zero-sum|zero-sum]] game.  This is an example of a situation where both parties in a financial markets transaction benefit.

Another example is the company [[General Electric]]. This company uses derivatives to &quot;match funding&quot; ([http://www.ge.com/en/company/investor/webcast/webcast_05062005.htm GE webcast on derivatives]) to mitigate interest rate and currency risk, and to lock in material costs. The program is strictly for forecasted and highly anticipated needs, and not a means to generate non-operating revenues. 90% of all derivatives revenue produced by derivatives sellers is for this kind of cost, cash, [[accounts receivable]] and [[accounts payable]] planning. On 2005-06-05 the company restated earnings with as much as $0.05 quarterly EPS (over 10%) in Q3 2003 ([http://www.ge.com/en/company/investor/secreport/ge_10ka_2004.htm Revised 2004 10K (PDF, 787 KB)]).

===Speculation and arbitrage===

Of course, speculators may trade with other speculators as well as with hedgers. In most financial derivatives markets, the value of speculative trading is far higher than the value of true hedge trading. As well as outright speculation, derivatives traders may also look for [[arbitrage]] opportunities between different derivatives on identical or closely related underlying securities.

Other uses of derivatives are to gain an economic exposure to an underlying security in  situations where direct ownership of the underlying is too costly or is prohibited by legal or regulatory restrictions, or to create a synthetic [[Short selling|short]] position.

In addition to directional plays (i.e. simply betting on the direction of the underlying security), speculators can use derivatives to place bets on the [[Volatility|volatility]] of the underlying security.  This technique is commonly used when speculating with traded options.

Speculative trading in derivatives gained a great deal of notoriety in 1995 when [[Nick Leeson]], a trader at [[Barings Bank]], made poor and unauthorized investments in index futures. Through a combination of poor judgment on his part, lack of oversight by management, a naive regulatory environment and unfortunate outside events, Leeson incurred a 1.3 [[billion]] dollar loss that bankrupted the centuries old financial institution.

===Pricing and information sharing===
Futures markets are unusually efficient at gathering and processing information, and are often an extremely accurate predictor of events such as interest rate movements and oil price movements. [[DARPA]] also examined the idea of developing a futures market for world events, the [[Policy Analysis Market]], with the idea of predicting terrorism amongst other things. The idea was halted due to political uproar, as it was pointed out that terrorists could trade on the market and directly profit from their activities.

==Opinions==
Although there have been instances of massive losses, most notably by [[Long-Term Capital Management]], these have not had repercussions. [[Federal Reserve Board]] chairman [[Alan Greenspan]] commented in 2003 that he believed that the use of derivatives has softened the impact of the [[economic downturn]] at the beginning of the 21st century.

Because derivatives offer the possibility of large rewards, many individuals have the strong desire to invest in derivatives. Most financial planners caution against this, pointing out that an investor in derivatives often assumes a great deal of risk, and therefore investments in derivatives must be made with caution, especially for the small investor ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2817995.stm]). One should keep in mind that one purpose of derivatives is as a form of [[insurance]], to move risk from someone who cannot afford a major loss to someone who could absorb the loss, or is able to hedge against the risk by buying some other derivative.

[[Economist]]s generally believe that derivatives have a positive impact on the [[economic system]] by allowing the buying and selling of risk. However, many economists are worried that derivatives may cause an economic crisis at some point in the future. Since someone loses money while someone else gains money with a derivative, under normal circumstances, trading in derivatives should not adversely affect the economic system.

There is the danger, however, that someone would lose so much money that they would be unable to pay for their losses. This might cause chain reactions which could create an economic crisis. In 2002, legendary investor [[Warren Buffett]] commented in an interview with the ''[[New York Times]]'' that he had accumulated his wealth without the use of derivatives and that he regarded them as 'financial weapons of mass destruction', an allusion to the phrase '[[weapons of mass destruction]]' relating to physical weapons which had wide currency at the time.

==Glossary==
''From: [http://www.occ.treas.gov/deriv/deriv.htm Quarterly Derivatives Fact Sheet]''

*[[Bilateral Netting]]: A legally enforceable arrangement between a bank and a counterparty that creates a single legal obligation covering all included individual contracts. This means that a bank&amp;#8217;s obligation, in the event of the default or insolvency of one of the parties, would be the net sum of all positive and negative fair values of contracts included in the bilateral netting arrangement.

*[[Credit derivative]]: A contract which transfers [[credit risk]] from a protection buyer to a credit protection seller. Credit derivative products can take many forms, such as credit default options, credit limited notes and total return swaps.

*'''Derivative''': A financial contract whose value is derived from the performance of assets, interest rates, currency exchange rates, or indexes. Derivative transactions include a wide assortment of financial contracts including structured debt obligations and deposits, swaps, futures, options, caps, floors, collars, forwards and various combinations thereof.

*[[Exchange-traded derivative contracts]]: Standardized derivative contracts (e.g. [[futures contract]]s and [[options]]) that are transacted on an organized futures exchange.

*[[Gross negative fair value]]: The sum of the fair values of contracts where the bank owes money to its counterparties, without taking into account netting. This represents the maximum losses the bank&amp;#8217;s counterparties would incur if the bank defaults and there is no netting of contracts, and no bank collateral was held by the counterparties.

*[[Gross positive fair value]]: The sum total of the fair values of contracts where the bank is owed money by its counterparties, without taking into account netting. This represents the maximum losses a bank could incur if all its counterparties default and there is no netting of contracts, and the bank holds no counterparty collateral.

*[[High-risk mortgage security|High-risk mortgage securities]]: Securities where the price or expected average life is highly sensitive to interest rate changes, as determined by the [[FFIEC]] policy statement on high-risk mortgage securities.

*[[Notional amount]]: The nominal or [[face amount]] that is used to calculate payments made on swaps and other risk management products. This amount generally does not change hands and is thus referred to as notional.

*'''[[over-the-counter (finance)|Over-the-counter]] derivative contracts''' : Privately negotiated derivative contracts that are transacted off organized futures exchanges.

*[[Structured notes]]: Non-mortgage-backed [[debt securities]], whose cash flow characteristics depend on one or more indices and/or have embedded forwards or options.

*[[Total risk-based capital]]: The sum of [[tier 1]] plus [[tier 2]] capital. Tier 1 capital consists of [[common shareholders equity]], [[perpetual preferred shareholders equity]] with [[noncumulative dividends]], [[retained earnings]], and [[minority interest]]s in the equity accounts of [[consolidated subsidiaries]]. Tier 2 capital consists of [[subordinated (debt)|subordinated debt]], intermediate-term [[preferred stock]], cumulative and long-term preferred stock, and a portion of a bank&amp;#8217;s [[allowance for loan and lease losses]].

The '''Divine Right of Kings''' is a [[Europe]]an [[politics|political]] and [[religion|religious]] doctrine of [[political absolutism]]. Such doctrines are largely, though not exclusively, associated with the [[mediæval]] and ''[[ancien régime]]'' eras. It states that a [[monarch]] owed his rule to the will of [[God]], not to the will of his subjects, [[parliament]], the [[aristocrat|aristocracy]] or any other competing authority. This doctrine continued with the claim that any attempt to depose a monarch or to restrict his powers ran contrary to the will of God. 

Its symbolism remains in the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]]s of the British monarchs, in which they are [[anointed]] with [[Holy oil]]s by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], thereby [[Holy Orders|''ordaining'']] them to monarchy. It is further evidenced by efforts to trace the genealogy of European monarchs to King [[David]] of the [[Old Testament]], in the apparent belief that it legitimizes the rule of the present monarch (c.f. http://www.kingdavid.org/genealogy.html). The king or queen of the [[United Kingdom]] is the last monarch still to undergo such a ceremony, which in other countries has been replaced by an [[inauguration]] or other [[declaration]].   It is the reason why the [[British Royal Family]]'s [[motto]] is ''[[Dieu Et Mon Droit]]'' (God and my [birth] Right - i.e. I rule with God's blessing).

==The concept==
The concept of Divine Right of Kings is only one manifestation of a much broader concept of &quot;royal God-given rights&quot;, which simply says that &quot;the right to rule is anointed by God (or gods)&quot; which is found in other cultures. This concept was also found in the [[Aryan]] and [[Egyptian]] traditions.  Unlike the Chinese concept of the [[Mandate of Heaven]] which legitimized the overthrow of an oppressive or incompetent monarch, a European king could not lose the Divine Right by misrule, at least according to most authors. [[Thomas Aquinas]] accepted the overthrow of a king and even [[regicide]] when the laws of the king are untenably unjust, however, and towards the end of the Middle Ages many philosophers such as [[Nicholas of Cusa]] and [[Francisco Suárez|Francisco Suarez]] propounded similar theories.  In addition, the concept of [[Mandate of Heaven]] required that the emperor properly carry out the proper [[ritual]]s, consult his ministers, and made it extremely difficult to undo any acts carried out by an ancestor.

Japanese imperial theory based the legitimacy of the [[Emperor of Japan]] on his descent from [[Amaterasu]], however unlike the European case, this divinity did not usually translate into political power, unless the Emperor had (as [[Emperor Meiji]] did) the military might to back up his claim.

In the western world it came to be associated with [[Catholic|Roman Catholicism]] and other Christian faiths in the [[Reformation]] period. The notion of divine right of kings was certainly in existence in the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]]. However it was in the early modern era, under the ''[[ancien régime]]'', that the notion became extensively used as a primarily political mechanism, i.e. for increasing the power of kings within centralized monarchies relative to their nobles and subjects. It was given its most comprehensive formulations by the [[France|French]] [[bishop]] [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] and King [[James I of England]], but it owes much to the earlier writings of [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Paul of Tarsus]].

In the ''[[Epistle to the Romans]]'', chapter 13, Paul wrote that earthly rulers, even though they may not be Christians, have been appointed by God to their places of power for the purpose of punishing evildoers.  Some Biblical scholars believe that Paul was writing, in part, to reassure the Roman authorities who ruled his world that the Christian movement was not [[subversion (political)|subversive]].  The difficulty posed for later [[Christianity|Christians]] is that the [[New Testament]] contained no explicit plan for the government of a mostly Christian society.  It asuce the next unit is, versus how much it is expected to return in profit. When the marginal return of an action reaches zero, the action stops. Marginal utility is how much more happiness or use a person receives from a purchase in contrast with buying less. Marginal rewards are often subject to [[diminishing returns]]: Less reward is obtained from more production or consumption. For example, the 10th bar of chocolate that a person consumes does not taste as good as the first, and so brings less marginal utility.

Marginalism became increasingly important in economic theory in the late 19th century, and is a tool which is used to analyze how economic systems will react. Marginal cost of production divides [[cost]]s into &quot;fixed&quot; costs which must be paid regardless of how many of a commodity are produced, and &quot;variable costs&quot;. The marginal cost is the variable cost of the last unit. Marginalism states that when the profit from the next unit will be zero, that unit will not be produced.

The marginalist theory of price level runs counter to the classical theory of price being determined by the amount of labour congealed in a commodity.

=== Value ===
It could be argued that beneath an economic theory is a theory of [[value (economics)|value]]. Value can be defined as the underlying activity which economics describes and measures. It is what is &quot;really&quot; happening.

[[Image:Us-gold-certificate-1922.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Representative money]] like this [[1922]] [[United States|US]] $100 gold note could be exchanged by the bearer for its face value in [[gold]].]]

Adam Smith defined &quot;labour&quot; as the underlying source of value, and &quot;the [[labor theory of value]]&quot; underlies the work of [[Karl Marx]], [[David Ricardo]] and many other classical economists. The &quot;labour theory of value&quot; argues that a good or service is worth the labour that it takes to produce. For most, this value determines a commodity's price. This labour theory of price and the closely related [[cost-of-production theory of value]] dominates the work of most classical economists, but those theories are far from the only accepted basis for &quot;value&quot;. For example, [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] economists and [[Austrian School]] economists prefer the [[marginal theory of value]].

&quot;Market theory&quot; argues that there is no &quot;value&quot; separate from price, that the market incorporates all available information into price, and that so long as markets are open, that price and the value are one and the same. This theory rests on the idea of the &quot;rational economic actor&quot;. This was originally asserted by Mill.

Another set of theories rest on the idea that there is a basic external scarcity, and that &quot;value&quot; represents the relationship to that basic scarcity (or lack thereof). These theories include those based on economics being limited by energy or based on a &quot;gold standard&quot;.

All of these value theories are used in current economic work.

== Economic language and reasoning ==
Economics relies on rigorous styles of argument. Economic methodology has several interacting parts:

* Collection of economic data. These data consist of measurable values of price and changes in price, for measurable commodities. For example: the cost to hire a worker for a week, or the cost of a particular commodity, and how much is typically used.

* Formulation of [[model (economics)|models]] of economic relationships, for example, the relationship between the general level of prices and the general level of employment. This includes observable forms of economic activity, such as [[money]], consumption, preferences, buying, selling, and prices. Some of the models are simple [[accounting]] models, while others postulate specific kinds of economic behavior, such as utility or profit maximization. An example of a model that illustrates both of these aspects is the classical mathematical formulation of the [[Keynesian]] system involving the [[consumption function]] and the [[national income]] identity. This article will refer to such models as ''formal models'', although they are not formal in the sense of [[formal logic]].

* Production of economic statistics. Taking the data collected, and applying the model being used to produce a representation of economic activity. For example, the &quot;general price level&quot; is a theoretical idea common to macroeconomic models. The specific inflation rate involves taking measurable prices, and a model of how people consume, and calculating what the &quot;general price level&quot; is from the data within the model. For example, suppose that diesel fuel costs 1 euro a litre: To calculate the price level would require a model of how much diesel an average person uses, and what fraction of their income is devoted to this &amp;mdash;but it also requires having a model of how people use diesel, and what other goods they might substitute for it.

* Reasoning within economic models. This process of reasoning (see the articles on [[informal logic]], [[logical argument]], [[fallacy]]) sometimes involves advanced mathematics. For instance, an established (though possibly unexamined) tradition among economists is to reason about economic variables in two-dimensional graphs in which curves representing relations between the axis variables are parameterized by various indices. A good example of this type of reasoning is exhibited by [[Paul Krugman]]'s online essay, ''There's something about macro''. See also the article [[IS/LM model]]. One critical analysis of economic reasoning is studied in [[Paul Samuelson]]'s thesis, ''Foundations of Economic Analysis'': he identifies a class of assertions called ''operationally meaningful theorems'' which are those that can be meaningfully formulated within an economic model. As usual in science, the conclusions obtained by reasoning have a [[predictive power|predictive]] as well as confirmative (or dismissive) value. An example of the predictive value of economic theory is a prediction as to the effect of current deficits on interest rates 10 years into the future. An example of the confirmative value of economic theory would be confirmation (or dismissal) of theories concerning the relation between marginal tax rates and the deficit.

Formal modelling is motivated by general principles of consistency and completeness.

Formal modelling has been adapted to some extent by all branches of economics. It is not identical to what is often referred to as [[mathematical economics]]; this includes, but is not limited to, an attempt to set [[microeconomics]], in particular general equilibrium, on solid [[mathematics|mathematical]] foundations. Some reject mathematical economics: The [[Austrian School]] of economics believes that anything beyond simple logic is often unnecessary and inappropriate for economic analysis. In fact, the entire empirical-deductive framework sketched in this section may be rejected outright by that school. However, the framework sketched here accurately represents the current predominant view of economics.

== Development of economic thought ==
[[image:Adam_Smith.jpg|thumb|Adam Smith]]
''Main article: [[History of economic thought]]''.

The term ''[[economics]]'' was coined around [[1870]] and popularized by influential &quot;neoclassical&quot; economists such as [[Alfred Marshall]] &lt;!--the following is, at the very least, a link to a terribly titled article. Can someone please sort this out?--&gt;([[Welfare definition]]), as a substitute for the earlier term [[political economy]], which referred to &quot;the economy of polities&quot; &amp;ndash; competing [[state]]s. The term ''political economy'' was used through the 18th and 19th centuries, with [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]] and [[Karl Marx]] as its main thinkers and which today is frequently referred to as the &quot;classical&quot; economic theory. Both &quot;economy&quot; and &quot;economics&quot; are derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''oikos-'' for &quot;house&quot; or &quot;settlement&quot;, and ''nomos'' for &quot;laws&quot; or &quot;norms&quot;.

Economic thought may be roughly divided into three phases: Premodern ([[ancient Greece|Greek]], [[ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Arab]]), Early modern ([[mercantilist]], [[physiocrats]]) and Modern (since [[Adam Smith]] in the late [[18th century]]). Systematic economic theory has been developed mainly since the birth of the [[modern era]].

== Schools of economic thought ==
There have been different and competing schools of economic thought pertaining to capitalism from the late 18th century to the early day. Important schools of thought are [[Mercantilism]], [[Kameralism]], [[Physiocracy]], [[Manchester school]], [[Protectionism]], [[Fiscalism]], [[Monetarism]], [[Chicago School]], [[Classical economics]], [[Marxian economics]], [[Keynesian economics]], [[Post-Keynesian economics]], [[Neoclassical economics]], [[Institutional economics]], [[Austrian School]], [[Evolutionary economics]], [[Dependency theory]], [[World systems theory]], and [[New classical economics]].

=== Modern 'mainstream' economics ===
Most academic economics today begins with the premise that resources are scarce and that it is necessary to choose between competing alternatives. That is, economics deals with [[tradeoff|tradeoffs]]. With scarcity, choosing one alternative implies forgoing another alternative&amp;mdash;the [[opportunity cost]]. The opportunity cost creates an implicit price relationship between competing alternatives. In addition, in both market oriented and planned economies, scarcity is often explicitly quantified by [[price]] relationships.

Understanding choices by individuals and groups is central. Economists believe that incentives and desires play an important role in shaping [[decision making]]. Concepts from the [[utilitarianism|Utilitarian]] school of [[philosophy]] are used as analytical concepts within economics, though economists appreciate that society may not adopt utilitarian objectives. One example of this is the idea of a [[utility function]], which is assumed to represent how economic agents rank the choices given to them. Then the utility function ranks available choices from best to worst, and the agent gradually learns to choose the best-ranked choice in the [[feasible set]] of his alternatives.

Most economists also acknowledge the existence of [[market failure]] and many insights from [[Keynesian economics]]. They look to [[game theory]] and [[asymmetric information]] to solve problems on a microeconomic level. Many important insights on collective behavior (e.g. [[emergence]] of [[organization]]s) have been incorporated from [[institutional economics]] via [[new institutionalism]].

===Neoclassical economics  ===
Economists who believe that models based on [[utility maximisation]] are applicable to a wide range of activities, including the very long term and the non-economic, are often referred to as [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economists]].

On a microeconomic level, some economists extend economic analysis to all personal decisions. An alternative can be thought of as a [[vector space|vector]] where the entries are answers not only to questions like &quot;How many eggs should I buy?&quot;, but also &quot;How many hours should I spend with my kids?&quot;, and &quot;How long should I spend brushing my teeth?&quot;.

===Post-Keynesian economics===
An alternative school - one of the successors to the Keynesian tradition with a focus on [[macroeconomics]]. They concentrate on macroeconomic rigidities and adjustment processes, and research microfoundations for their models based on real-life practices rather than simple optimizing models. Generally associated with Cambridge, England and the work of Joan Robinson.

===New-Keynesian economics===
The other school associated with developments in the Keynesian fashion. These researchers tend to share with other [[Neoclassical]] economists the emphasis on models based on microfoundations and optimizing behavior but focus more narrowly on standard Keynesian themes such as price and wage rigidity. These are usually made to be endogenous features of these models, rather than simply assumed as in older style Keynesian ones. The Nobel prize winners [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[George Akerlof]] are generally thought of as New-Keynsians.

===Other alternatives===
There are many types of economist, and many of them are considerably outside the mainstream. [[Socialist economics]], [[green economics]], [[Austrian economics]], and ''Old [[Keynesian]]'' economics still have many voices in academia.

== Economics and other disciplines ==
There is some tension between economics and theories of [[ethics]], historically a branch of philosophy, which emphasizes how people ought to conduct ourselves and balances of [[rights]] and [[duties]]. Modern economics deals with this tension explicitly: According to some thinkers such as Mr. John Syko, a theory of economics is also, or implies also, a theory of [[moral reasoning]]. One way economists deal with this is to qualify discussions of [[economic choice]] by noting the qualifier [[ceteris paribus]] (&quot;all other things held constant...&quot;) referring to moral or social factors that are (for the sake of argument) held equivalent for all choices that one might make.

''For exploration of this issue, see the [[moral purchasing]] article.''

Another premise is that economics fits within a finite ecosystem where there are at least some abundant resources. For instance, when fuelling a fire, people are usually concerned with finding the wood, and not with finding the air to burn it with. Economics explicitly does not deal with free abundant inputs &amp;ndash; one criticism is that it often conflicts with [[Ecological_economics|ecology's]] view of what affects what. Human beings are, according to ecologists, merely one species participating in a vast [[energy economics|energy system]] on this planet &amp;ndash; economy is a subset of ecology that deals with just one species' habits and wants.

''See [[nature's services]] for the economic view of ecology and [[green economics]] for the view in which economics is a subset of ecology.''

A third premise is that economics suggests [[market form]]s and other means of distribution of scarce goods that affect not just &quot;desires and wants&quot; but also &quot;needs&quot; and &quot;habits&quot;. Much of so-called economic &quot;choice&quot; is involuntary, certainly given the [[conditioning]] that people have to expect certain [[quality of life]]. This leads to one of the most hotly debated areas in economic policy: namely, the effect and efficacy of welfare policies. [[Libertarians]] view this as a failure to respect economic reasoning. They argue that redistribution of wealth is morally and economically wrong. And [[socialists]] view it as a failure of economics to respect society. They argue that disparities of wealth should not have been allowed in the first place. This led to both [[19th century]] [[labour economics]] and [[20th century]] [[welfare economics]] before being subsumed into [[human development theory]].

The older term for economics, ''[[political economy]]'', is still often used ''instead of'' '''economics''', especially by certain economists such as [[Marxists]]. Use of this term often signals a basic disagreement with the terminology or paradigm of market economics. Political economy explicitly brings political considerations into economic analysis and is therefore openly [[normative]], although this can be said of many economic recommendations as well, despite claims to being [[positive]]. Some mainstream universities (such as the [[University of Toronto]] and many in the [[United Kingdom]]) have a &quot;political economy&quot; department rather than an &quot;economics&quot; department.

[[Information theory]] has been applied to economics since the work of [[Ronald Coase]] in the 1930s. However, with [[Herbert Simon]] and [[John von Neumann]] in the 1950s, it gathered a more specific [[formalism]] as part of [[game theory]]. This emphasizes that the decision-making process itself is costly.

Marxist economics generally denies the trade-off of time for money. In the Marxist view, concentrated control over the means of production is the basis for the allocation of resources among classes. Scarcity of any particular physical resource is subsidiary to the central question of power relationships embedded in the means of production.

The question of the environment is viewed, in the traditional economic framework, as being related to the externalization of costs. That is, market economics assumes that underpriced goods are overconsumed. Externalization of cost, in this view, will be corrected by pricing the overconsumed resources at their true social marginal cost. See [[Pigovian tax]].

'''Electronic paper''', or e-paper, is a [[technology]] that allows the text on a piece of [[paper]] to be re-written. The &quot;paper&quot; is actually made of [[organic electronics]] that use [[Conductor (material)|conductive]] [[plastics|plastic]] which contains tiny balls that respond to an electric charge, changing the page in much the same way that [[pixel]]s change on a [[Computer display|computer monitor]].

Electronic paper was developed in order to overcome some of the limitations of computer monitors. For example, the [[backlighting]] of [[Computer display|monitors]] is hard on the human eye, whereas electronic paper reflects light just like normal paper. It is easier to read at an angle than flat screen monitors. Because it is made of plastic, electronic paper has the potential to be flexible. It is light and potentially inexpensive.

Electronic paper was first developed in the [[1970s]] by [[Nick Sheridon]] at [[Xerox|Xerox's]] [[Palo Alto Research Center]]. The first electronic paper, called [[Gyricon]], consisted of tiny, statically charged [[ball]]s that were black on one side and white on the other. The &quot;[[text]]&quot; of the paper was altered by the presence of an [[electric field]], which turned the balls up or down.

In the [[1990s]] another type of electronic paper was invented by [[Joseph Jacobson]]. This used tiny microcapsules filled with electrically charged white [[molecules|particle]]s suspended in a colored [[Mineral oil|oil]]. In early versions, the underlying [[circuitry]] controls whether the white particles were at the top of the capsule (so it looked white to the viewer) or at the bottom of the capsule (so the viewer saw the color of the oil). This was essentially a reintroduction of the well-known [[Electrophoresis|electrophoretic]] display technology, but the use of microcapsules allowed the display to be used on flexible plastic sheets instead of glass.
There are many approaches to electronic paper, with many companies developing technology in this area. Other technologies being applied to electronic paper include modifications of [[liquid crystal display]]s, [[electrochromic display]]s, and the electronic equivalent of an [[Etch-A-Sketch]] at Kyushu Univerisity. One form or another of electronic paper is being developed by [[Gyricon]] (which was spun out of [[Xerox]]), Philips Electronics, Kent Displays (cholesteric displays), Ntera ([[electrochromic]] [[Nanochromic displays]]), and many others. One important feature needed is that the pixels be [[bistable]] so that the state of each pixel can be maintained without a constant supply of power.

In April, [[2004]], [[Sony]] announced the first commercially available electronic paper device, the [[Sony Librie EBR-1000EP|LIBRIe]], sold only in Japan. On January 6, 2006, Sony announced the [[Sony Reader]], a successor to the LIBRIé for the US market.

On July 14th and 15th 2005 Fujitsu showcased their jointly developed electronic paper at the Tokyo International Forum. It boasts low power consumption in that it does not require electricity except during screen image changes, making electronic paper especially suited for advertisements or information bulletins in public places for which paper is currently used.

It has been rumored that Leeds' (UK) Yorkshire Post will be one of the first newspapers to use this.

E Ink announced in October 2005 that it would begin shipping developer kits of 6 inch, 800x600 resolution electronic paper on November 1st, 2005.

Another electronic paper device to be introduced in April of 2006 is the iLiad produced by iRex Technologies BV (a spinoff from Royal Philips Electronics). It would be able to render content without DRM based restrictions, and supports PDF, XHTML, TXT and MP3 formats. It also has standard connectivity features for transferring content, namely USB stick/cable, Compact Flash, SD Memory Card, WiFi, and Ethernet access.

In December 2005 Xerox announced it was closing the Gyricon operation as of December 31, 2005.

Electronic paper should not be confused with [[digital paper]].

{{Planet Infobox/Earth}}
'''Earth''' is the third [[planet]] from the [[Sun]]. It is the largest of the [[solar system]]'s [[terrestrial planet]]s and the only place in the universe known to harbor [[life]]. Scientific evidence indicates that the Earth was formed around 4.57 [[billion]] (4.57{{e|9}}) [[year]]s ago (see [[Age of the Earth]]) and that its single [[natural satellite]], the [[Moon]], was orbiting it shortly thereafter, around 4.533 billion years ago.
 
==Lexicography==
The official name for the planet Earth, as set by the [[International Astronomical Union]], is ''Terra'',  after the [[Roman mythology|Roman goddess]] [[Terra (mythology)|Terra Mater]]. With this name, ''all'' the planets in our solar system known from ancient times are now named for [[Roman mythology|Roman gods or goddesses]]. ''Terra'' is also the [[Latin (language)|Latin]] word for &quot;earth&quot; (soil).

Terms that refer to the Earth can use the [[Latin (language)|Latin]] root ''terra-'', such as the word ''terrestrial''. There is also the alternative Latin root ''tellur-'', as used in words such as [[telluric]], tellurian, [[tellurion]] and [[Tellurium]], which derives the goddess Terra Mater's more ancient name Tellūs Mater. Scientific terms such as [[geography]], [[geocentric]] and [[geothermal]] use the [[Greek language|Greek]] prefix ''geo-'', derived from Terra Mater's [[Greek mythology|Greek]] counterpart [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]].

The English word &quot;earth&quot; has [[cognate]]s in many modern and ancient languages. Examples in modern tongues include ''aarde'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''Erde'' in [[German language|German]] and ''arde'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. The root also has cognates in extinct languages such as ''ertha'' in [[Old Saxon]] and ''ert'' (meaning &quot;ground&quot;) in [[Middle Irish]], derived from the [[Old English]] ''eor&amp;#0240;e''. Given [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]], we can find cognates of &quot;earth&quot; between ''terra'' and the modern [[Romance languages]], for instance ''tierra'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or ''terra'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

Several [[Semitic languages]] have words for &quot;earth&quot; similar to those in [[Indo-European languages]], although evidence of a link is not overwhelming. Arabic has ''aard''; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], ''irtsitu''; [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], ''araa''; [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]], ''erets'' (which appears in the [[Mesha Stele]]); and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], ארץ (''arets'', or ''erets'' when followed by a [[Hebrew grammar#Nouns|noun modifier]]).

===Symbol===
The [[astrology|astrological]] and [[astronomical symbol]] for Earth consists of a circled cross, the arms of the cross representing a [[meridian]] and the [[equator]] (&lt;big&gt;{{unicode|&amp;#x2295;}}&lt;/big&gt;). A variant puts the cross atop the circle (&lt;big&gt;{{unicode|&amp;#x2641;}}&lt;/big&gt;).

==History==
{{main|History of Earth}}
Based on the available evidence, scientists have been able to reconstruct detailed information about the planet's past. Earth is believed to have formed around 4.55&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years ago out of the [[solar nebula]], along with the Sun and other planets. The moon formed soon afterwards. Initially molten, the outer layer of the planet cooled, resulting in the solid crust. Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere; condensing water vapor, augmented by ice delivered by comets, [[Origin of the world's oceans|produced the oceans]]. The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years ago, and half a billion years later, the [[last universal common ancestor|last common ancestor of all life]] lived. The development of [[photosynthesis]] allowed the sun's energy to be harvested directly; the resultant [[oxygen]] accumulated in the atmosphere and gave rise to the [[ozone layer]]. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the [[endosymbiotic theory|development of complex cells]] called [[eukaryotes]]. Cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting in true multicellular organisms. With the ozone layer absorbing harmful [[ultraviolet radiation]], life colonized the surface of Earth. Continents formed and broke up as the surface of Earth continually reshaped itself. 65 million years ago, a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the [[dinosaur]]s and other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as the [[mammal]]s, then resembling shrews. Life diversified, and several million years ago, a small African ape gained the ability to stand upright. As [[brain]] size increased, these hominids developed the use of tools and language. The development of agriculture, and then civilization allowed humans to affect the Earth in a short timespan like no other life form had before, affecting both the nature and quantity of other life forms as well as global climate.

&lt;!-- This section has been moved to the article '''[[Structure of the Earth]]'''. A new 30-line summary section must be written from this main article to this &quot;Physical characteristics&quot; section. Help is welcome. --&gt;
The Earth consists of several [[atmospheric]], [[hydrologic]], and mainly [[geologic]] layers. Its components are the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], the [[Crust_%28geology%29|crust]], the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]], and its [[core]]. The [[biosphere]] is a tiny layer in this composition and is usually not considered part of the physical layers of the Earth.

The geologic component layers of the Earth are located at the following depths below surface:

* 0 to 60 km - [[Lithosphere]] (locally varies between 5 and 200 km)
** 0 to 35 km - [[Crust (geology)|Crust]] (locally varies between 5 and 70 km)
** 35 to 60 km - Uppermost part of mantle
* 35 to 2890 km - [[Mantle (geology)|Mantle]]
** 100 to 700 km - [[Asthenosphere]]
* 2890 to 5100 km - [[Outer core]]
* 5100 to 6378 km - [[Inner core]]

==Earth in the solar system==
It takes the Earth 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.091 seconds ([[sidereal day|1 sidereal day]]) to rotate around the [[axis]] connecting the [[north pole]] and the [[south pole]]. From Earth the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in the sky (except [[meteor]]s which are within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites) is the movement to the west at a rate of 15 &amp;deg;/h = 15'/min, i.e., a Sun or Moon diameter every two minutes.

Earth orbits the Sun every 365.2564 mean solar days ([[sidereal year|1 sidereal year]]). From Earth, this gives an apparent movement of the Sun with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1 &amp;deg;/day, i.e., a Sun or Moon diameter every 12 hours, eastward.

The orbital speed of the Earth averages about 30 km/s (108,000 km/h), which is enough to cover one Earth diameter (~12,700 km) in 7 minutes, and one distance to the Moon (384,000 km) in 4 hours.

Earth has one [[natural satellite]], the [[Moon]], which revolves with the Earth around a common [[barycenter]], from fixed star to fixed star, every 27.32 days. When combined with the Earth-Moon system's common revolution around the Sun, the period of the [[synodic month]], from new moon to new moon, is 29.53 days.

Viewed from Earth's north pole, the motion of Earth, its moon and their axial rotations are all [[counterclockwise]].

The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's [[axial tilt|axis is tilted]] some 23.5 degrees against the Earth-Sun plane (which causes the [[season]]s); and the Earth-Moon plane is tilted about 5 degrees against the Earth-Sun plane (otherwise there would be an eclipse every month).

The [[Hill sphere]] (sphere of influence) of the Earth is about 1.5 Gm (930,000 miles) in radius, within which one natural satellite (the [[Moon]]) comfortably orbits.

In an inertial reference frame, the Earth's axis undergoes a slow [[precession]]al motion with a period of some 25,800 years, as well as a [[nutation]] with a main period of 18.6 years. These motions are caused by the differential attraction of Sun and Moon on the Earth's equatorial bulge, due to its oblateness. In a reference frame attached to the solid body of the Earth, its rotation is also slightly irregular due to [[polar motion]]. The polar motion is quasi-periodic, containing an annual component and a component with a 14-month period called the [[Chandler wobble]]. Also, the rotational velocity varies, a phenomenon known as [[Day|length of day]] variation.

In modern times, Earth's [[perihelion]] is always about [[January 3]], and [[aphelion]] is about [[July 4]] (near the winter and summer [[solstice]]s, which are on about [[December 21]] and [[June 21]], respectively). For other eras, see [[precession]] and [[Milankovitch cycles]].

The Earth is sometimes referred to as the '''Third Planet from the Sun''' because, of the nine planets of our solar system, Earth is the third closest planet to the sun.

===The Moon===
[[Image:Earth-moon.jpg|thumb|left|''Earthrise'' as seen from the Moon on ''[[Apollo 8]]'', [[24 December]] [[1968]]. Due to [[tidal locking]], from any point on the Moon's surface, the Earth does not rise or set, but is always located in the same position in the sky.]]

The Moon, sometimes called 'Luna', is a relatively large terrestrial planet-like satellite, whose diameter is about one-quarter of the Earth's. With the exception of [[Pluto|Pluto's]] [[Charon (moon)|Charon]], it is the largest moon in the Solar system relative to the size of its planet. The [[natural satellite]]s orbiting other planets are called &quot;moons&quot;, after Earth's Moon.

The gravitational attraction between the Earth and Moon cause the [[tides]] on Earth. The same effect on the Moon has led to its [[tidal locking]]: Its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit the Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet.

As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the [[lunar phase]]s: The dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the [[terminator (solar)|solar terminator]].

The Moon may dramatically affect the development of life by taming the weather. Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's [[axial tilt]] is stabilised by tidal interactions with the Moon. Some theorists believe that, without this stabilization against the [[torque]]s applied by the Sun and planets to the Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, as it appears to be with [[Mars (planet)|Mars]]. If Earth's axis of rotation were to approach the [[ecliptic|plane of the ecliptic]], extremely severe [[weather]] could result, as this would make seasonal differences extreme. One pole would be pointed directly toward the Sun during ''summer'' and directly away during ''winter''. [[Planetary science|Planetary scientists]] who have studied the effect claim that this might kill all large animal and higher plant life. This remains a controversial subject, however, and further studies of Mars&amp;mdash;which shares Earth's [[sidereal day|rotation period]] and [[axial tilt]], but not its large moon or liquid core&amp;mdash;may provide additional insight.

The Moon is just far enough away to have, when seen from Earth, very nearly the same apparent angular size as the Sun (the Sun is 400 times larger, but the Moon is 400 times closer). This allows total [[eclipse]]s and annular eclipses to occur on Earth.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both&quot; /&gt;
[[Image:Earth-Moon.jpg|thumb|center|700px|Earth and Moon to scale.]]

The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the [[giant impact theory]], states that it was formed from the collision of a Mars-size [[protoplanet]] with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements, and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of the Earth's crust.

Earth also has at least one co-orbital [[asteroid]], [[3753 Cruithne]].

==Environment and]] organs responsible for formally adopting and carrying out policies elaborated by the party congress and Politburo was the [[Council of Ministers]], which had more than forty members and was in turn headed by a [[Presidium]] of sixteen. The Council of Ministers supervised and coordinated the activities of all other central bodies responsible for the economy, and it played a direct and specific role in important cases.

The State Planning Commission (sometimes called the Economic General Staff of the Council of Ministers) advised the Council of Ministers on possible alternative economic strategies and their implications, translated the general targets set by the council into planning directives and more specific plan targets for each of the ministries beneath it, coordinated short-, medium-, and long-range planning, and mediated interministerial disagreements.

The individual ministries had major responsibility for the detailed direction of the different sectors of the economy. The ministries were responsible within their separate spheres for detailed planning, resource allocation, development, implementation of innovations, and generally for the efficient achievement of their individual plans.

Directly below the ministries were the centrally directed [[trust]]s, or [[Kombinat]]e. Intended to be replacements for the Associations of Publicly Owned Enterprises--the largely administrative organizations that previously served as a link between the ministries and the individual enterprises--the Kombinate resulted from the merging of various industrial enterprises into large-scale entities in the late-1970s, based on interrelationships between their production activities.

The Kombinate included [[research]] enterprises, which the state incorporated into their structures to provide better focus for research efforts and speedier application of research results to production. A single, united management directed the entire production process in each Kombinat, from research to production and sales. The reform also attempted to foster closer ties between the activities of the Kombinate and the [[foreign trade]] enterprises by subordinating the latter to both the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the Kombinate. The goal of the Kombinat reform measure was to achieve greater efficiency and rationality by concentrating authority in the hands of midlevel leadership. The Kombinat management also provided significant input for the central planning process.

By the early [[1980s]], establishment of Kombinate for both centrally managed and district-managed enterprises was essentially complete. Particularly from [[1982]] to [[1984]], the government established various regulations and laws to define more precisely the parameters of these entities. These provisions tended to reinforce the primacy of central planning and to limit the autonomy of the Kombinate, apparently to a greater extent than originally planned. As of early [[1986]], there were 132 centrally managed Kombinate, with an average of 25,000 employees per Kombinat. District-managed Kombinate numbered 93, with an average of about 2,000 employees each.

At the base of the entire economic structure were the producing units. Although these varied in size and responsibility, the government gradually reduced their number and increased their size. The number of [[industrial enterprise]]s in [[1985]] was only slightly more than one-fifth that of [[1960]]. Their independence decreased significantly as the Kombinate became fully functional.

In addition to the basic structure of the industrial sector, a supplementary hierarchy of government organs reached down from the [[Council of Ministers]] and the [[State Planning Commission]] to territorial rather than functional subunits. Regional and local planning commissions and economic councils, subordinate to the State Planning Commission and the Council of Ministers, respectively, extended down to the local level. They considered such matters as the proper or optimal placement of industry, environmental protection, and housing.

The [[agriculture|agricultural]] sector of the economy had a somewhat different place in the system, although it too was thoroughly integrated. It was almost entirely [[collectivisation|collectivized]] except for private plots. The collective farms were formally self-governing. They were, however, subordinate to the Council of Ministers through the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Foodstuffs. A complex set of relationships also connected them with other [[cooperative]]s and related industries, such as food processing.

The fact that East Germany had a planned economy did not mean that a single, comprehensive plan was the basis of all economic activity. An interlocking web of plans having varying degrees of specificity, comprehensiveness, and duration was in operation at all times; any or all of these may have been modified during the continuous process of performance monitoring or as a result of new and unforeseen circumstances. The resultant system of plans was extremely complex, and maintaining internal consistency between the various plans was a considerable task.

Operationally, short-term planning was the most important for production and resource allocation. It covered one [[calendar year]] and encompassed the entire economy. The key targets set at the central level were overall rate of growth of the economy, volume and structure of the [[domestic product]] and its uses, utilization of raw materials and [[labour (economics)|labor]] and their distribution by sector and region, and volume and structure of [[export]]s and [[import]]s. Beginning with the [[1981]] plan, the state added assessment of the ration of raw material use against value and quantity of output to promote more efficient use of scarce resources.

Medium-range (five-year) planning used the same indicators, although with less specificity. Although the [[five-year plan]] was duly enacted into law, it is more properly seen as a series of guidelines rather than as a set of direct orders. It was typically published several months after the start of the five-year period it covered, after the first one-year plan had been enacted into law. More general than a one-year plan, the five-year plan was nevertheless specific enough to integrate the yearly plans into a longer time frame. Thus it provided continuity and direction.

In the early 1970s, long-term, comprehensive planning began. It too provided general guidance, but over a longer period (fifteen or twenty years), long enough to link the five-year plans in a coherent manner.

In the first phase of planning, the centrally determined objectives were divided and assigned to appropriate subordinate units. After internal consideration and discussion had occurred at each level and suppliers and buyers had completed negotiations, the separate parts were reaggregated into draft plans. In the final stage, which follows the acceptance of the total package by the State Planning Commission and the Council of Ministers, the finished plan was redivided among the ministries, and the relevant responsibilities were distributed once more to the producing units.

The production plan was supplemented by other mechanisms that control supplies and establish monetary accountability. One such mechanism was the System of Material Balances, which allocated materials, equipment, and consumer goods. It acted as a rationing system, ensuring each element of the economy access to the basic goods it needed to fulfill its obligations. Since most of the goods produced by the economy were covered by this control mechanism, producing units had difficulty obtaining needed items over and above their allocated levels.

Another control mechanism was the assignment of prices for all goods and services. These prices served as a basis for calculating expenses and receipts. Enterprises had every incentive to use these prices as guidelines in decision making. Doing so made plan fulfillment possible and earned bonus funds of various sorts for the enterprise. These bonuses were not allocated indiscriminately for gross output but were awarded for such accomplishments as the introduction of innovations or reduction of labor costs.

The system functioned smoothly only when its component parts were staffed with individuals whose values coincided with those of the regime or at least complemented regime values. Such a sharing took place in part through the integrative force of the party organs whose members occupied leading positions in the economic structure. Efforts were also made to promote a common sense of purpose through mass participation of almost all workers and farmers in organized discussion of economic planning, tasks, and performance. An East German journal reported, for example, that during preliminary discussion concerning the 1986 annual plan, 2.2 million employees in various enterprises and work brigades of the country at large contributed 735,377 suggestions and comments. Ultimate decision making, however, came from above.

The private sector of the economy was small but not entirely insignificant. In 1985 about 2.8 percent of the net national product came from private enterprises. The private sector included private farmers and gardeners; independent craftsmen, wholesalers, and retailers; and individuals employed in so-called free-lance activities (artist, writers, and others). Although self-employed, such individuals were strictly regulated. in 1985, for the first time in many years, the number of individuals working in the private sector increased slightly. According to East German statistics, in 1985 there were about 176,800 private entrepreneurs, an increase of about 500 over 1984. Certain private sector activities were quite important to the system. The SED leadership, for example, had been encouraging private initiative as part of the effort to upgrade consumer services.

In addition to those East Germans who were self-employed full time, there were others who engaged in private economic activity on the side. The best known and most important examples were families on collective farms who also cultivated private plots (which can be as large as 5,000 m²). Their contribution was significant; according to official sources, in 1985 the farmers privately owned about 8.2 percent of the hogs, 14.7 percent of the sheep, 32.8 percent of the horses, and 30 percent of the laying hens in the country. Professionals such as commercial artists and doctors also worked privately in their free time, subject to separate tax and other regulations. Their impact on the economic system, however, was negligible.

More difficult to assess, because of its covert and informal nature, was the significance of that part of the private sector called the &quot;second economy.&quot; As used here, the term includes all economic arrangements or activities that, owing to their informality or their illegality, took place beyond state control or surveillance. The subject has received considerable attention from Western economists, most of whom are convinced that it is important in CPEs. In the mid-1980s, however, evidence was difficult to obtain and tended to be anecdotal in nature.

One kind of informal economic activity included private arrangements to provide goods or services in return for payment. An elderly woman might have hired a neighbor boy to haul coal up to her apartment, or an employed woman might have paid a neighbour to do her washing. Closely related would be instances of hiring an acquaintance to repair a clock, tune up an automobile, or repair a toilet. Such arrangements take place in any society, and given the serious deficiencies in the East German service sector, they may have been more necessary than in the West. They were doubtlessly common, and because they were considered harmless, they were not the subject of any significant governmental concern.

There was another kind of private economic activity, however, that did concern the government: the stealing and selling of goods for profit by individuals who had ready access to them. For example, an individual might siphon gasoline from a public vehicle and sell it to a friend. No statistics are available on such practices. Surface impressions, however, suggest that they are not very common or significant, certainly not as significant as may be the case in other socialist states where they were reportedly quasi-institutionalized.

Another common activity that was troublesome if not disruptive was the practice of offering a sum of money beyond the selling price to individuals selling desirable goods, or giving something special as partial payment for products in short supply. Such ventures may have been no more than offering someone Trinkgeld (a tip), but they may have also involved Schmiergeld (money used to &quot;grease&quot; a transaction) or Beziehungen (special relationships). Opinions in East Germany varied as to how significant these practices were. But given the abundance of money in circulation and frequent shortages in luxury items and durable consumer goods, most people were perhaps occasionally tempted to provide a &quot;sweetener,&quot; particularly for such things as automobile parts or furniture.

These irregularities did not appear to constitute a major economic problem. However, the East German press occasionally reported prosecutions of particularly egregious cases of illegal &quot;second economy&quot; activity, involving what are called &quot;crimes against socialist property&quot; and other activities that are in &quot;conflict and contradiction with the interests and demands of society&quot; (as one report described the situation).

==Culture==
===Music===
For ideological reasons artists were expected to sing songs only in German at first, which changed with the end of the sixties. This seemed a logical constraint by the Party leaders but it was rather unpopular among young people. There was strict rules that regulated that all artistic activity ought to be censored for any open or implied anti-socialist tendencies. The band [[Renft]], for example, was prone to political misbehaviour, which eventually led to its split.

The [[Puhdys]] and [[Karat (Band)|Karat]] were some of the most popular mainstream bands, managing to hint at critical thoughts in their lyrics without being explicit. Like most mainstream acts, they appeared in popular youth magazines such as ''Neues Leben'' and ''Magazin''. Other popular rock bands were: [[Wir]], [[Dean Reed]].

Influences from the West were heard everywhere, because TV and radio that came from the ''Klassenfeind'' (enemy of the working class) could be received in many parts of the East, too (a notorious exception being [[Dresden]], with its geographically disadvantageous position in the [[Elbe]] valley, giving it the nickname of “Valley of the Clueless”). The Western influence led to the formation of more &quot;underground&quot; groups with a decisively western-oriented sound. A few of these bands were [[Die Skeptiker]], as well as [[Feeling B]].

Classical music was highly supported, so that there existed over 50 classical symphony orchestras in a country with a population about 16 million.

In fact that [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] was born in East German territory, his birthplace in [[Eisenach]] was turned into a museum of his life, which, among other things, included more than 300 instruments from Bach's life. In 1980 this museum was receiving more than 70,000 visitors annually.

In Leipzig, an enormous archive with recordings of all of Bach's music was compiled, along with many historical documents and letters both to and from him.

Every other year, school children from across East Germany gathered for a Bach competition held in East Berlin. Every four years an international Bach competition for keyboard and strings was held.

Also [[Goethe|Goethe's]], [[Schiller|Schiller's]] or [[Martin Luther]]'s birthplace turned into museums. In the GDR there existed over 300 of these folklore museums.

===Theater===
East German theater was in the beginning strongly dominated by [[Bertolt Brecht]], who brought back a lot of artists from antifascist resistance and reopened ''Theater am Schiffbauerdamm'' with his [[Berliner Ensemble]]. On the other side, some streams tried to establish pure workers theater, played by workers with plays about workers.

After Brecht died, there were a lot of conflicts beetween the artists and his family (around [[Helene Weigel]]) about the heritage of Brecht. [[Heinz Kahlau]], [[Slatan Dudow]], [[Erwin Geschonneck]], [[Erwin Strittmatter]], [[Peter Hacks]], [[Benno Besson]], [[Peter Palitzsch]] and [[Ekkehard Schall]] are counted among Bertolt Brecht's scholars and followers. 

In the 1950s the Swiss [[Benno Besson]] had success with &quot;The Dragon&quot; by [[Jewgenij Schwarz]], so that he travelled with [[Deutsches Theater]] all-around Europe and Asia (also in Japan). He became the Intendant at [[Volksbühne]] in the 1960s and worked often with [[Heiner Müller]].

Because of censorship a lot of artists left the GDR from 1975. A parallel development was that some artists went to small-city theaters, to create theater beyond [[Berlin]]. For example [[Peter Sodann]] founded the [[neues theater]] in [[Halle/Saale]] and [[Frank Castorf]] was at theater [[Anklam]].

Theater and Cabaret had a very important status in the GDR for the people and so it was a very active and movable scene, which was reason for its contention with the state. Benno Besson said once about that: ''&quot;At least they took us serious, we had a bearing.&quot;''

===Cinema===
In the GDR, the movie industry was very active. The head-group for film-productions was the [[DEFA]] [http://www.defa-stiftung.de], ''Deutsche Film AG'', which was subdivided in different local groups, for example ''Gruppe [[Berlin]]'', ''Gruppe [[Babelsberg]]'' or ''Gruppe [[Johannisthal]]'', where the local teams shot and produced films. Besides folksy movies, the movie-industry became known worldwide for its productions, especially children movies (&quot;[[Das kalte Herz]]&quot;, picturizations of fairy-tales according to [[Grimm]]-brothers and also modern productions like &quot;[[Das Schulgespenst]]&quot;).

Movies about persecution of Jews in Third Reich like &quot;[[Jacob the Liar|Jakob der Lügner]]&quot; and the resistance against fascism &quot;[[Fünf Patronenhülsen]]&quot; (both directed by [[Frank Beyer]]) became internationally famous.

Also movies about the problems in daily life like &quot;[[Die Legende von Paul und Paula]]&quot; (directed by [[Heiner Carow]]) or &quot;[[Solo Sunny]]&quot; (directed by [[Konrad Wolf]] and [[Wolfgang Kohlhaase]]) were very popular.

The film industry was remarkable for its production of westerns, in which the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] often took the role of displaced people, who fight for their rights, in opposite to the American western, in which they are often not mentioned or play the villains. [[Gojko Mitic|Gojko Mitić]] is the most famous actor in this part, often playing the righteous, kindhearted and charming chief (&quot;[[Die Söhne der großen Bärin]]&quot; directed by [[Josef Mach]]). He became honorary chief of the tribe of [[Sioux]], when he visited the [[United States of America]] in the 90s, and the television-team accompanying him showed the tribe one his movies. 
It was part of a temporal phenomenon of Europe producing alternative films about the colonization of America, look up also [[Spaghetti Western|Italowestern]] and the West German [[Winnetou]] films (adaptations of novels of [[Karl May]]).

Because of censorship a certain number of very remarkable movies were forbidden at this time and reissued after the [[Wende]] in [[1990]]. Examples are &quot;[[Spur der Steine]]&quot; (directed by [[Frank Beyer]]) and &quot;[[Der geteilte Himmel]]&quot; (directed by [[Konrad Wolf]]).

In cinemas of the GDR, not only own productions were shown. Besides the Czech, Polish a.s.o. productions also certain foreign movies were shown, but the numbers were limited because it did cost foreign exchange to buy the licences. Certainly movies representing or glorifying capitalistic ideology were not bought. So, for example &quot;[[Grease (film)|Grease]]&quot; was not shown, but &quot;[[One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest]]&quot; was. Comedies enjoyed great popularity, such as the Danish &quot;[[Olsen Gang]]&quot; or movies with the French comedian [[Louis de Funès]].

[[Category:1949 establishmentswith solid pilot testing.

Enterprise resource planning systems are often closely tied to [[supply chain management]] and [[logistics automation]] systems. Supply chain management software can extend the ERP system to include links with suppliers.  

To implement ERP systems, companies often seek the help of an ERP vendor or of third-party [[consultancy|consulting]] companies.  Consulting in ERP involves two levels, namely business consulting and technical consulting.  A business consultant studies an organization's current business processes and matches them to the corresponding processes in the ERP system, thus 'configuring' the ERP system to the organisation's needs.  Technical consulting often involves programming. Most ERP vendors allow modification of their software to suit the business needs of their customer. 

Customizing an ERP package can be very expensive and complicated, because many ERP packages are not designed to support customization, so most businesses implement the best practices embedded in the acquired ERP system. Some ERP packages are very generic in their reports and inquiries, such that customization is expected in every implementation.  It is important to recognize that for these packages, it makes more sense to buy [[third party]] reporting packages that interface well to particular ERP, than to reinvent what tens of thousands of other clients of that same ERP have needed to develop.

Today there are also web-based ERP systems. Companies would deploy web-based ERP because it requires no client side installation, and is cross-platform and maintained centrally. As long as you have an Internet connection, you can access web-based ERPs through typical web browsers.

==Advantages==
In the absence of an ERP system, a manufacturer in need of what it has to offer, may find itself with many software applications that do not talk to each other, do not effectively interface: design [[engineering]] how best to make the product; keeping track of the status of customer orders from acceptance thru fulfillment; managing interdependencies of complex [[Bill of Material]]s [[product]] [[structure]]s in the real world of evolving [[Engineering]] and [[Revision]] changes and improvements, and the need to make material substitutions, during temporary inventory shortages; 3-way match between [[Purchase order]]s (what was ordered), [[Inventory]] receipts (what arrived), and [[Cost]]ing (what the vendor invoiced); [[Accounting]] for all of this, including tracking [[Costs]] and [[Profits]] on a granular level. But the advantage of having an ERP is that all this, and more, is integrated.  

Change '''how''' a product is made, in the [[engineering]] details, and that is how it will now be made. '''Effectivity''' dates can be used to control when the switch over will occur from an old version to the next one, both the date that some ingredients go into effect, and date that some are discontinued.  Part of the change can include labeling to identify version #s.

[[Computer security]] is included within an ERP, to protect against both outsider crime, such as [[industrial espionage]] and insider crime, such as [[embezzlement]].  A data tampering scenario might involve a [[terrorism|terrorist]] altering a [[Bill of Materials]] so as to put [[poison]] in food products, or other sabotage.  ERP security helps to prevent abuse as well.

There are concepts of [[Front office]] (how the company interacts with customers), which includes [[CRM]] or [[Customer relationship management]]; [[Back end]] (internal workings of the company to fulfill customer needs), which includes [[quality control]], to make sure there are no problems not fixed, in the end products; [[Supply chain]] (interacting with suppliers and transportation infrastructure). All of these can be integrated through an ERP, although some systems have gaps in comprehensiveness and effectiveness. Without an ERP that integrates all these, it can be a nightmare for a manufacturer to manage...

==Disadvantages==
Many of the problems that companies have with ERPs are due to inadequate investment in continuing education for all relevant personnel, including those implementing and testing changes, and a lack of corporate policies that affect how the ERP data gets used and is kept accurate. 

Limitations and pitfalls to ERP include:
* Success depends on the skill and experience of the work force, including education in how to make the system work correctly. Many companies cut costs by cutting user training. Privately owned small enterprises are often undercapitalized, meaning their ERP system is often operated by personnel with inadequate education in ERP in general, such as [[APICS]] foundations, and in the particular ERP vendor package being used.
* Personnel turnover; companies can employ new managers lacking education in the company's ERP system, proposing changes in business practices that are out of synchronization with the best utilization of the company's selected ERP.
* ERP systems can be very expensive to install.
* ERP vendors can charge sums of money for annual license renewal that is unrelated to the size of the company using the ERP or its profitability.
* [[Technical support]] personnel often give replies to callers that are inappropriate for the caller's corporate structure. Computer security concerns arise, for example when telling a non-programmer how to change a database on the fly, at a company that requires an audit trail of changes so as to meet some regulatory standards.
* ERPs are often seen as too rigid, and difficult to adapt to the specific [[workflow]] and business process of some companies - this is cited as one of the main causes of their failure.
* Systems can be difficult to use.
* The system can suffer from the &quot;weakest link&quot; problem - an inefficiency in one department or at one of the partners may affect other participants.
* Many of the integrated links need high accuracy in other applications to work effectively. A company can achieve minimum standards, then over time &quot;dirty data&quot; will reduce the reliability of some applications.
* Once a system is established, switching costs are very high for any one of the partners (reducing flexibility and strategic control at the corporate level).
* The blurring of company boundaries can cause problems in accountability, lines of responsibility, and employee morale.
* Resistance in sharing sensitive internal information between departments can reduce the effectiveness of the software.
* There are frequent compatibility problems with the various legacy systems of the partners.
* The system may be over-engineered relative to the actual needs of the customer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Endocrinology''' is a branch of medicine dealing with disorders of
the [[endocrine system]] and its specific secretions called [[hormone]]s. 
Hormones are molecules that act as signals from one type of cells to another. Most hormones reach their targets via the blood, although as steroids are lipid soluble, they freely travel through all body compartments. Although every organ system secretes and responds to hormones (including the [[brain]], [[lungs]], [[heart]], [[intestine]], [[skin]], and the [[kidney]]), the clinical specialty of endocrinology focuses on the ''endocrine organs'', i.e. the organs whose primary function is hormone secretion.

An '''endocrinologist''' is a [[physician|doctor]] who specializes in treating such disorders, particularly disorders of the [[pituitary]], including growth disorders; diseases of the [[thyroid]] gland; of the [[adrenal]] glands; and of the [[ovary]] and [[testes]]; and [[diabetes]], a disorder of insulin secretion or sensitivity.

==Background==

All multicellular organisms need “coordinating systems to regulate and integrate the function of differentiating cells”. Two mechanisms perform this function in higher animals, the nervous system and the endocrine system. The endocrine system acts through the release (generally into the blood) of chemical agents, and is vital to the proper development and function of organisms. As Hadley (2000) notes, the integration of developmental events such as proliferation, growth, differentiation (including histogenesis and organogenesis) and the coordination of [[metabolism]], [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], excretion, movement, [[reproduction]] and sensory perception depend on “chemical cues, substances synthesised and secreted by the specialised cells within the animal”.

Endocrinology is concerned with the study of the biosynthesis, storage, chemistry and physiological function of [[hormones]], and also with the cells of the endocrine glands and tissues that secrete them. The study of endocrinology effectively began when Berthold (1849) noted that castrated cockerels failed to develop combs and wattles or exhibit overtly male behaviour. He found that replacement of testes back into the abdominal cavity of either the same bird or another castrated bird resulted in normal behavioural and morphological development, and concluded (rather erroneously) that the testes secreted a substance that &quot;conditioned&quot; the blood that, in turn, acted upon the body of the cockerel. In fact, one of two other things could have been true: that the testes modified or activated a constituent of the blood, or that the testes removed an inhibitory factor from the blood. It was not proven that the testes released a substance that engenders male characteristics until it was shown that the extract of testes could replace their function in castrated animals. Pure, crystalline [[testosterone]] was isolated in 1935 by David et al.

Although most of the relevant tissues and endocrine glands had been identified by early anatomists, a more humoural approach to understanding biological function and disease was favoured by classical thinkers such as [[Aristotle]], [[Hippocrates]], [[Lucretius]], [[Celsus]] and [[Galen]] according to Freeman et al (2001), and these theories held sway until the advent of germ theory, physiology and organ basis of pathology in the 19th Century.

==Hormones==

===Overview===
The endocrine system consists of several glands, in different parts of the body, that secrete hormones directly into the blood rather than into a duct system. Hormones have many different functions and modes of actions; one hormone may have several effects on different target organs and, conversely, one target organ may be affected by more than one hormone.

[[Image:Amine hormones, norepinephrine and triiodothryonine.jpg|thumb|300px|Amine hormones, norepinephrine and triiodothryonine]]
In 1902 Bayliss and Starling performed an experiment in which they observed that acid instilled into the [[duodenum]] caused the [[pancreas]] to begin secretion, even after they had removed all nervous connections between the two. The same response could be produced by injecting [[jejunal mucosa]], showing that some factor in the mucosa was responsible. They named this substance &quot;[[secretin]]&quot;, and coined the term &quot;hormone&quot; for chemicals that act in this way. They specified that, to be classified as a hormone, a chemical must be produced by an organ; be released (in small amounts) into the blood; and be transported by the blood to a distant organ to exert its specific function. This definition holds for most ‘classical’ hormones, but there are also [[paracrine]] mechanisms (chemical communication between cells within a tissue or organ), autocrine signals (a chemical that acts on the same cell) and intracrine signals (a chemical that acts within the same cell) (Nussey and Whitehead, 2001). A [[neuroendocrine]] signal is a ‘classical’ hormone that is released into the blood by a neurosecretory neuron (see article on [[Neuroendocrinology]]).

[[Image:Steroid hormones, cortisol and Vitamin D3.jpg|thumb|300px|Steroid hormones, cortisol and Vitamin D3]]
Hormones act by binding to specific receptors in the target organ. As Baulieu (1990) notes, a receptor has at least two basic constituents: a recognition site to which the hormone binds, and an effector site, which precipitates the modification of cellular function; between these is a &quot;transduction mechanism&quot; in which hormone binding induces allosteric modification that, in turn, produces the appropriate response.

Griffin and Ojeda (2000) identify three different classes of hormone based on their chemical composition:

===Amines===
Amines, such as [[norepinephrine]], [[epinephrine]] and [[dopamine]], are derived single amino acids, in this case tyrosine. [[Thyroid]] hormones like 3,5,3’-triiodothyronine (T3) and 3,5,3’,5’-tetraiodothyronine (thyroxine, T4) make up a subset of this class as they derive from the combination of two iodinated tyrosine amino acid residues.

===Peptide/Protein===
[[Peptide hormones]] and protein hormones are comprised of between three (in the case of [[thyrotropin-releasing hormone]] and over 200 (in the case of [[follicle-stimulating hormone]]) amino acid residues, and can have molecular weights as large as 30,000. All of the hormones secreted by the pituitary gland are peptide hormones, as are [[leptin]] from adipocytes, [[ghrelin]] from the stomach, and [[insulin]] from the [[pancreas]]..

===Steroid===
[[Steroid]] hormones are derivatives of [[cholesterol]] and are subdivided into those with an intact steroid nucleus (gonadal and adrenal steroids) and those with a broken steroid nucleus ([[Vitamin D]]). Steroid horomones include [[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]] from the [[ovary]], [[testosterone]] from the [[testes]], and [[cortisol]] and aldosterone from the adrenal gland.

==Work==
The medical specialty of endocrinology involves the diagnostic evaluation of a wide variety of symptoms and variations, as well as the long-term management of disorders of deficiency or excess of one or more hormones.

The diagnosis and treatment of endocrine diseases are guided by [[laboratory]] tests to a greater extent than for most specialties. Many diseases are investigated through ''excitation/stimulation'' or ''inhibition/suppression'' testing. This might involve injection with a stimulating agent to test the function of an endocrine organ. Blood is then sampled to assess the changes of the relevant hormones or metabolites. An endocrinologist needs extensive knowledge of [[clinical chemistry]] and [[biochemistry]] to understand the uses and limitations of the investigations.

A second important aspect of the practice of endocrinology is distinguishing human variation from disease. Atypical patterns of physical development and abnormal test results must be assessed as indicative of disease or not. [[Diagnostic imaging]] of endocrine organs may reveal &quot;spots,&quot; termed [[incidentaloma]]s, which do not represent disease.

Endocrinology involves caring for the person as well as the disease.  Most endocrine disorders are [[chronic disease]]s that need life-long care. The most common of these is [[diabetes mellitus]]. Care of diabetes and other chronic diseases necessitates understanding the patient at the personal and social level as well as the molecular, and the physician-patient relationship can be an important therapeutic process.

Apart from managing patients, many endocrinologists are involved in [[clinical science]] and [[medical research]], [[teaching]] and [[hospital management]].

==Training==
Endocrinologists are specialists of [[internal medicine]] or [[pediatrics]]. Reproductive endocrinologists primarily deal with problems of [[fertility]] and menstrual function. Most qualify as an [[internist]], [[pediatrician]], or [[gynecologist]] for a few years before specialising, depending on the local training system. In the U.S. and Canada, training for board certification in internal medicine, [[pediatrics]], or [[gynecology]] after medical school is referred to as residency. Further formal training to subspecialize in adult, [[pediatric endocrinology|pediatric]], or reproductive endocrinology is referred to as a 'fellowship'. Typical training for a North American endocrinologist involves 4 years of college, 4 years of medical school, 3 years of residency, and 3 years of fellowship.

The '''endocrine system''' is a control system of ductless [[gland]]s that secrete chemical messengers called [[hormone]]s that circulate within the body via the [[blood]]stream to affect distant [[organ (anatomy)|organs]].  Hormones act as &quot;messengers&quot;, and are carried by the bloodstream to different cells in the body, which interpret these messages and act on them.  The endocrine system does not include [[exocrine gland]]s such as [[salivary gland]]s, [[sweat gland]]s and glands within the [[gastrointestinal tract]].

The field of [[medicine]] that deals with disorders of endocrine glands is '''[[endocrinology]]''', a branch of the wider field of [[internal medicine]].

The '''economy of [[Ecuador]]''' is based on petroleum production, money transfers from nearly a million ecuadorian emigrants employed abroad, and exports of bananas, shrimp, and other primary agricultural products. In 2002, oil accounted for about one-third of public sector revenue and 40% of export earnings. Ecuador is the world's largest exporter of bananas ($936.5 million in 2002) and a major exporter of shrimp ($251 million in 2002). Exports of nontraditional products such as flowers ($291 million in 2002) and canned fish ($333 million in 2002) have grown in recent years. Industry is largely oriented to servicing the domestic market.

Deteriorating economic performance in 1997-98 culminated in a severe economic and financial crisis in 1999. The crisis was precipitated by a number of external shocks, including the El Nino weather phenomenon in 1997, a sharp drop in global oil prices in 1997-98, and international emerging market instability in 1997-98. These factors highlighted the Government of Ecuador's unsustainable economic policy mix of large fiscal deficits and expansionary money policy and resulted in an 7.3% contraction of GDP, annual year-on-year inflation of 52.2%, and a 65% devaluation of the national currency in 1999.

On January 9, 2000, the administration of President Jamil Mahuad announced its intention to adopt the U.S. dollar as the official currency of Ecuador to address the ongoing economic crisis. Subsequent protest led to the removal of Mahuad from office and the elevation of Vice President Gustavo Noboa to the presidency.

The Noboa government confirmed its commitment to dollarize as the centerpiece of its economic recovery strategy, successfully completing the transition from sucres to dollars in 2001. Following the completion of a one-year stand-by program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in December 2001, Ecuador successfully negotiated a new $205 million stand-by agreement with the IMF in March 2003.

Buoyed by higher oil prices, the Ecuadorian economy experienced a modest recovery in 2000-01, with GDP rising 2.3% in 2000 and 5.4% in 2001. GDP growth leveled off to 3.3% in 2002. Although final figures are not yet available, it is expected to fall further, to about 1.7%, for 2003. But GDP growth is estimated to recover to over 4% in 2004, due largely to expanded oil exports. Inflation fell from an annual rate of 96.1% in 2000 to an annual rate of 22.4% in 2001; although final figures are not yet available, it is expected to drop below 7% for 2003. Despite recent gains, 70% of the population lives below the poverty line, more than double the rate of 5 years ago.

The completion of the second Transandean Oil Pipeline (OCP in Spanish) in 2003 will enable Ecuador to expand oil exports. The OCP will double Ecuador’s oil transport capacity, but Ecuador will need to attract additional foreign investment to realize the full economic potential of the added capacity.

==Ecuador and the IMF==
[[Journalism|Journalist]] [[Greg Palast]], of the [[United Kingdom|British]] ''[[Observer]]'', alleges that the [[International Monetary Fund]] is attempting an [[economics|economic]] [[coup]] against the Ecuadoran [[government]]. He cites documents which he claims show the IMF is working to force the nation to grant [[BP]] rights to build and own an [[oil pipeline]] over the [[Andes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Ecuador]] always has placed great emphasis on multilateral approaches to international problems. Ecuador is a member of the [[United Nations]] (and most of its specialized agencies) and the [[Organization of American States]] and also is a member of many regional groups, including the [[Rio Group]], the [[Latin American Economic System]], the [[Latin American Energy Organization]], the [[Latin American Integration Association]], and the [[Andean Pact]].

Ecuador's [[History of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute|border dispute]] with [[Peru]], festering since the independence era, has been the nation's principal foreign policy issue. For more than 50 years, Ecuador maintained that the 1942 [[Rio Protocol of Peace, Friendship and Boundaries]] left several issues unresolved. For example, it asserted that geographic features in the area of the [[Cenepa River]] valley did not match the topographical descriptions in the Protocol, thus making demarcation of the boundary there &quot;inexecutable.&quot;

This long-running border dispute occasionally erupted into armed hostility along the undemarcated sections. The most serious conflict since the [[1941]] war occurred in January-February [[1995]], when thousands of soldiers from both sides fought an intense but localized war in the disputed territory in the upper Cenepa valley. A peace agreement brokered by the four Guarantors of the Rio Protocol ([[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], and the [[United States]]) in February 1995 led to the cessation of hostilities and the establishment of the [[Military Observers Mission to Ecuador-Peru]] (MOMEP) to monitor the zone. In [[1996]], Ecuador and Peru began a series of meetings intended to set the stage for substantive negotiations to resolve the dispute.

Those talks were successful. In January [[1998]], Ecuador and Peru initialed a historic agreement in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, which provided a framework to resolve the major outstanding issues between the two countries through four commissions. The commissions were to prepare a Treaty of Commerce and Navigation and a Comprehensive Agreement on Border Integration, to fix on the ground the common land boundary, and to establish a Binational Commission on Mutual Confidence Measures and Security. The commissions began work in February, with the intention of reaching a definitive agreement by May 30, 1998. The commissions on border integration and mutual confidence measures successfully concluded their work, and the commission working on a treaty of commerce and navigation produced a draft treaty text, but the commission on border demarcation failed to produce agreement by May 30. A flare-up in military tensions in the disputed region in August 1998 led to the creation of a temporary second MOMEP-patrolled demilitarized zone just south of the first demilitarized zone.

Presidents Mahuad and [[Fujimori]] established direct communication by meetings and phone calls in an effort to overcome the two countries' remaining differences. In October 1998, after asking for and receiving a boundary determination from the guarantors, the two presidents reached agreement. On October 26, 1998, at a ceremony in Brasilia, Presidents Fujimori and Mahuad and their foreign ministers signed a comprehensive settlement.

'''Disputes - international:'''
demarcation of the agreed-upon border with Peru was completed in May [[1999]]

'''Illicit drugs:'''
significant transit country for [[cocaine]] and derivatives of coca originating in [[Colombia]] and Peru; importer of precursor chemicals used in production of illicit narcotics; important [[money-laundering]] hub; increased activity on frontiers by [[illegal drugs trade|trafficking]] groups and Colombian insurgents

The '''Arab Republic of Egypt''', commonly known as '''Egypt''', (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: مصر, [[Romanization|romanized]] ''Misr'', in [[Egyptian Arabic]] ''Másr'', {{Audio|ar-Gumhuriyat_Misr_al-Arabiyah.ogg|listen}}), is a [[republic]] in [[North Africa]].  While most of the country is geographically located in [[Africa]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] east of the [[Suez Canal]] is in [[Asia]]. 

Covering an area of about 1,020,000 square kilometres (394,000&amp;nbsp;[[square mile|mi²]]), Egypt shares land [[border]]s with [[Libya]] to the west, [[Sudan]] to the south, and [[Israel]] and the [[Gaza Strip]] to the northeast and has coasts on the north and east by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Red Sea]], respectively.  

Egypt is the fifteenth most populous country in the world. The vast majority of its 77 million population (2005) live near the banks of the [[Nile River]] (about 40,000&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;15,450&amp;nbsp;mi²), where the only arable agricultural land is found. Large areas of land are part of the [[Sahara]] [[Desert]] and are sparsely inhabited. About half of the Egyptian people today are urban, living in the densely populated centers of greater [[Cairo]], the largest city in Africa, and [[Alexandria]].

Egypt is famous for its [[Ancient Egypt|ancient civilization]] and some of the world's most stunning ancient monuments, including the [[Giza pyramid complex|Giza Pyramids]], the [[Karnak]] Temple and the [[Valley of the Kings]] and the Great Sphinx; the southern city of [[Luxor]] contains a particularly large number of ancient artifacts. Today, Egypt is widely regarded as the main political and cultural centre of the [[Arab]] and Middle Eastern regions.

==Origin and history of the name==
''Misr'', the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and official name for modern Egypt, is of [[Semitic]] origin directly cognate with the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] מִצְרַיִם ''Mitzráyim'' meaning &quot;the two straits&quot;, and possibly means &quot;a country&quot; or &quot;a state.&quot; The ancient name for the country, ''kemet'', or &quot;black land,&quot; is derived from the fertile black soils deposited by the Nile floods, distinct from the 'red land' (''deshret'') of the desert. This name became ''keme'' in a later stage of [[Coptic language|Coptic]]. The English name &quot;Egypt&quot; came via the Latin word ''Aegyptus'' derived from the ancient Greek word Αίγυπτος ''Aiguptos'' (see also [[List of traditional Greek place names]]). This word may in turn be derived from the ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] phrase '' ḥwt-k3-ptḥ'' (&quot;Hwt ka Ptah&quot;) meaning &quot;home of the [[Egyptian soul|Ka (part of the soul)]] of Ptah,&quot; the name of a temple of the god [[Ptah]] at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. For details see the article ''[[Copt]]''.

==History==
{{Main articles|[[History of Egypt]] and [[Ancient Egypt]]}}

[[Image:sphinx.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], with the Pyramid of Khafre in the background are at the heart of Egypt's thriving tourism industry.]]The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood, coupled with semi-isolation provided by [[desert]]s to the east and west, allowed for the development of one of the world's great civilizations. A unified kingdom was founded circa 3200 [[anno domini|BC]] by King [[Narmer]], and a series of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last native dynasty, known as the Thirtieth Dynasty, fell to the [[Iran|Persia]]ns in 341 BC who dug the predecessor of the [[Suez canal]] and connected the [[Red Sea]] to the [[Mediterranean]]. Later, Egypt fell to the Greeks, Romans, [[Byzantines]] and Persians again.

It was the Muslim [[Arabs]] who introduced [[Islam]] and the [[Arabic language]] in the seventh century to the Egyptians, who gradually adopted both. Muslim rulers nominated by the [[Islamic Caliphate]] remained in control of Egypt for the next six centuries. A local military caste, the [[Mamluks]] took control about 1250 and continued to govern even after the conquest of Egypt by the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1517.

Following the completion of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869, Egypt became an important world transportation hub; however, the country also fell heavily into debt. Ostensibly to protect its investments, the [[United Kingdom]] seized control of Egypt's government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the [[Ottoman Empire]] continued until 1914.

Almost fully independent from the UK in 1922, the Egyptian Parliament drafted and implemented a new [[1923 Constitution of Egypt|constcontribution in cash given directly to the Salvadoran Government totaled $4.3 million. The U.S. Government has provided $37.7 million in assistance through USAID and the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Defense.

Following the 2001 earthquakes, the [[U.S. Embassy]] assumed a leading role in implementing U.S. sponsored assistance. The U.S. Government responded immediately to the emergency, with military helicopters active in initial rescue operations, delivering emergency supplies, rescue workers, and damage assessment teams to stricken communities all over the country. [[USAID]]s Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance had a team of experts working with Salvadoran relief authorities immediately after both quakes, and provided assistance totaling more than $14 million. In addition, the Department of Defense provided an initial response valued at more than $11 million. For long-term reconstruction, the international community offered a total aid package of $1.3 billion, over $110 million of it from the United States.

=='''Manufacturing'''==
El Salvador historically has been the most industrialized nation in Central America, though a decade of war eroded this position. In 1999, [[manufacturing]] accounted for 22% of GDP. The industrial sector has shifted since 1993 from a primarily domestic orientation to include free zone ([[maquiladora]]) manufacturing for export. Maquila exports have led the growth in the export sector and in the last 3 years have made an important contribution to the Salvadoran economy.

=='''Trade'''==
El Salvador's [[balance of payments]] continued to show a net surplus. Exports in 1999 grew 1.9% while imports grew 3%, narrowing El Salvador's trade deficit. As in the previous year, the large trade deficit was offset by foreign aid and [[family remittance]]s. Remittances are increasing at an annual rate of 6.5%, and an estimated $1.35 billion will enter the national economy during 1999. Private foreign capital continued to flow in, though mostly as short-term import financing and not at the levels of previous years. The Central American Common Market continued its dynamic reactivation process, now with most regional commerce duty-free. In September 1996, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras opened free trade talks with Mexico. Although tariff cuts that were expected in July 1996 were delayed until 1997, the Government of El Salvador is committed to a free and open economy. Total U.S. exports to El Salvador reached $2.1 billion in 1999, while El Salvador exported $1.6 billion to the United States. U.S. support for El Salvador's privatization of the [[electrical]] and [[telecommunications]] markets has markedly expanded opportunities for U.S. investment in the country. More than 300 U.S. companies have established either a permanent commercial presence in El Salvador or work through representative offices in the country. The Department of State maintains a Country Commercial Guide for U.S. businesses seeking detailed information on business opportunities in El Salvador.

=='''Agriculture and Land Reform'''==
Before 1980, a small economic elite owned most of the land in El Salvador and controlled a highly successful agricultural industry. About 70% of farmers were [[sharecropper]]s or [[laborer]]s on large [[plantation]]s. Many farm workers were under- or unemployed and [[impoverished]]. The civilian-military [[junta]], which came to power in 1979, instituted an ambitious land reform program to redress the inequities of the past, respond to the legitimate grievances of the rural poor, and promote more broadly based growth in the agricultural sector. The ultimate goal was to develop a rural middle class with a stake in a peaceful and prosperous future for El Salvador. At least 525,000 people--more than 12% of El Salvador's population at the time and perhaps 25% of the rural poor--benefited from agrarian reform, and more than 22% of El Salvador's total farmland was transferred to those who previously worked the land but did not own it. But when agrarian reform ended in 1990, about 150,000 landless families still had not benefited from the reform actions. The 1992 peace accords made provisions for land transfers to all qualified ex-combatants of both the [[FMLN]] and [[ESAF]], as well as to landless peasants living in former conflict areas. The United States undertook to provide $300 million for a national reconstruction plan. This included $60 million for land purchases and $17 million for agricultural credits. USAID remains actively involved in providing technical training, access to credit, and other financial services for many of the land beneficiaries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[El Salvador]] is a member of the [[United Nations]] and several of its specialized agencies, the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), the [[Central American Common Market]] (CACM), the [[Central American Parliament]] (PARLACEN), and the [[Central American Integration System]] (SICA). It actively participates in the [[Central American Security Commission]] (CASC), which seeks to promote regional arms control. El Salvador also is a member of the [[World Trade Organization]] and is pursuing regional free trade agreements. An active participant in the [[Summit of the Americas]] process, El Salvador chairs a [[working group]] on market access under the [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] initiative. El Salvador has joined its six Central American neighbors in signing the Alliance for Sustainable Development, known as the Conjunta Centroamerica-USA or [[CONCAUSA]] to promote sustainable economic development in the region.

El Salvador maintains diplomatic relations with the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) instead of the [[People's Republic of China]].

'''Disputes - international:'''

In July 1969, El Salvador and [[Honduras]] fought the 100-hour [[Football War]] over disputed border areas and friction resulting from the 300,000 Salvadorans who had emigrated to Honduras in search of land and employment. The catalyst was nationalistic feelings aroused by a series of soccer matches between the two countries. The two countries formally signed a peace treaty on [[October 30]], 1980, which put the border dispute before the [[International Court of Justice]]. In September 1992, the court issued a 400-page ruling, awarding much of the disputed land to Honduras. Although there have been tensions between citizens on both sides of the border, the two countries have worked to maintain stability and signed an agreement in November 1996 to establish a framework for negotiating the final disposition of citizens and property in the affected areas. El Salvador and Honduras share normal diplomatic and trade relations.

The [[Honduras]]-El Salvador Border Protocol ratified by Honduras in May 1999 established a framework for a long-delayed border demarcation, which is currently underway; with respect to the maritime boundary in the [[Golfo de Fonseca]], the [[ICJ]] referred to the line determined by the 1900 [[Honduras-Nicaragua Mixed Boundary Commission]] and advised that some tripartite resolution among El Salvador, Honduras and [[Nicaragua]] likely would be required.

The '''Republic of Equatorial Guinea''' is a nation in west [[central Africa]], and one of the smallest countries in continental [[Africa]]. It borders [[Cameroon]] on the north, [[Gabon]] on the south and east, and the [[Gulf of Guinea]] on the west, where the islands of [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] lie to its southwest. Formerly the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[colony]] of [[Spanish Guinea]], the country's territory (continentally known as [[Río Muni]]) includes a number of islands, including the sizable island of [[Bioko]] where the capital, [[Malabo]] (formerly Santa Isabel), is located. Its post-independence name is suggestive of its being situated near both the [[equator]] and the Gulf of Guinea. It is the only country in Africa where [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is an official language.

==History==
''Main article: [[History of Equatorial Guinea]]''

The first inhabitants of the region that is now Equatorial Guinea are believed to have been [[Pygmies]], of whom only isolated pockets remain in northern [[Rio Muni]]. [[Bantu]] migrations between the 17th and 19th centuries brought the coastal tribes and later the [[Beti-Pahuin#Fang|Fang]]. Elements of the latter may have generated the [[Bubi]], who emigrated to [[Bioko]] from [[Cameroon]] and Rio Muni in several waves and succeeded former neolithic populations. The [[Igbo people]] of [[Nigeria]] arrived in the 18th century. The [[Annobon]] population, native to [[Angola]], was introduced by the Portuguese via [[São Tomé Island]] ([[São Tomé and Príncipe]]).

The [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese explorer]], [[Fernão do Pó]], seeking a route to [[India]], is credited with having discovered the island of Bioko in [[1472]]. He called it ''Formosa'' (&quot;Beautiful&quot;), but it quickly took on the name of its European discoverer. The islands of Fernando Póo and Annobón were colonized by [[Portugal]] in [[1474]]. The Portuguese retained control until [[1778]], when the island, adjacent islets, and commercial rights to the mainland between the Niger and [[Ogoue]] Rivers were ceded to [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] in exchange for territory in the American continent ([[Treaty of El Pardo]], between Queen [[Maria II of Portugal]] and King [[Charles III of Spain]]). From [[1827]] to [[1843]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]] established a base on the island to combat the [[Slavery|slave trade]]. The mainland portion, Rio Muni, became a protectorate in [[1885]] and a colony in [[1900]]. Conflicting claims to the mainland were settled in 1900 by the [[Treaty of Paris]], and periodically, the mainland territories were united administratively under Spanish rule. Between [[1926]] and [[1959]] they were united as the colony of [[Spanish Guinea]].

==Politics==
''Main article: [[Politics of Equatorial Guinea]]''

Equatorial Guinea became officially independent from Spain on [[October 12]], [[1968]].  Since then, the country has had [[Heads of State of Equatorial Guinea|two leaders]]: [[Francisco Macías Nguema]], the former mayor of [[Mongomo]] under the Spanish colonial government, and his nephew [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo]], who staged a military [[coup d'état]], executed his uncle, and has ruled since 1979.

The 1982 constitution of Equatorial Guinea gives Obiang extensive powers, including naming and dismissing members of the cabinet, making laws by decree, dissolving the Chamber of Representatives, negotiating and ratifying treaties and calling legislative elections. Obiang retains his role as commander in chief of the armed forces and minister of defense, and he maintains close supervision of the military activity. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President and operates under powers designated by the President. The Prime Minister coordinates government activities in areas other than foreign affairs, national defense and security.

On [[December 15]], [[2002]] [http://allafrica.com/stories/200212160112.html], Equatorial Guinea's four main opposition parties withdrew from the country's presidential election. Obiang won an election widely considered fraudulent by members of the western press.

According to a March 2004 [[BBC]] profile [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3516588.stm], politics within the country are currently dominated by tensions between Obiang's son Teodorin, and other close relatives with powerful positions in the security forces. The tension may be rooted in power shift arising from the dramatic increase since [[1997]] in oil production.

A November 2004 report [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,11431299%255E2703,00.html] named [[Mark Thatcher]] as a financial backer of a March 2004 attempt to topple Obiang organized by [[Simon Mann]].  Various accounts also name Britain's [[MI6]], the [[CIA]], and Spain as having been tacit supporters of the coup attempt. [http://www.sundayherald.com/print44412]

==Economy==
''Main article: [[Economy of Equatorial Guinea]]''

Pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on [[cocoa]] production for hard currency earnings. In [[1959]] it had the highest [[per capita income]] of Africa.

The discovery of large oil reserves in [[1996]] and its subsequent exploitation have contributed to a dramatic increase in government revenue. [[As of 2004]] [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A1101-2004Sep6.html], Equatorial Guinea is the third-largest oil producer in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Its oil production has risen to 360,000 barrels/day, up from 220,000 only two years earlier.

Forestry, farming, and fishing are also major components of GDP. Subsistence farming predominates. The deterioration of the rural economy under successive brutal regimes has diminished any potential for agriculture-led growth. 

Despite a per capita GDP (PPP) of more than US$30,000 [http://imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2005/02/data/dbcoutm.cfm?SD=2004&amp;ED=2004&amp;R1=1&amp;R2=1&amp;CS=3&amp;SS=2&amp;OS=C&amp;DD=0&amp;OUT=1&amp;C=512-941-914-446-612-666-614-672-311-946-213-137-911-962-193-674-122-676-912-548-313-556-419-678-513-181-316-682-913-684-124-273-339-921-638-948-514-686-218-688-963-518-616-728-223-558-516-138-918-353-748-196-618-278-522-692-622-694-156-142-624-449-626-564-628-283-228-853-924-288-233-293-632-566-636-964-634-182-238-453-662-968-960-922-423-714-935-862-128-716-611-456-321-722-243-965-248-718-469-724-253-576-642-936-643-961-939-813-644-199-819-184-172-524-132-361-646-362-648-364-915-732-134-366-652-734-174-144-328-146-258-463-656-528-654-923-336-738-263-578-268-537-532-742-944-866-176-369-534-744-536-186-429-925-178-746-436-926-136-466-343-112-158-111-439-298-916-927-664-846-826-299-542-582-443-474-917-754-544-698&amp;S=PPPPC&amp;CMP=0&amp;x=18&amp;y=9 IMF] (CIA Factbook [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ek.html gives] $50,200) which is as of 2004 the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|sixth highest]] in the world, Equatorial Guinea ranks 121st out of 177 countries on the [[United Nations]] [[Human Development Index]].

In [[July 2004]], the U.S. Senate published an investigation into [[Riggs Bank]], a Washington-based bank into which most of Equatorial Guinea's oil revenues were paid until recently, and which also banked for Chile's Augusto Pinochet. The Senate report, as to Equatorial Guinea, showed that at least $35 million were siphoned off by Obiang, his family and senior officials of his regime. The president has denied any wrongdoing. While Riggs Bank in February 2005 paid $9 million as restitution for its banking for Chile's Augusto Pinochet, no restitution was made with regard to Equatorial Guinea, as reported in detail in [http://www.innercitypress.org/finwatch.html this Anti-Money Laundering Report from Inner City Press].

==Provinces==
[[Image:Equatorial Guinea provinces numbered.png|thumb|Provinces of Equatorial Guinea]]
''Main article: [[Provinces of Equatorial Guinea]]''

Equatorial Guinea is divided into seven [[province]]s:
#[[Annobón Province]] (provincial capital: [[Palé]])
#[[Bioko Norte Province]] ([[Malabo]])
#[[Bioko Sur Province]] ([[Luba, Equatorial Guinea|Luba]])
#[[Centro Sur Province]] ([[Evinayong]])
#[[Kié-Ntem Province]] ([[Ebebiyín]])
#[[Litoral Province (Equatot role in the economy and promote private sector development. Its role is a diminishing one, although many government interactions with the private sector are at times capricious. Beginning in early 1997, the government initiated efforts to attract significant private sector involvement through a Corporate Council on Africa visit and numerous ministerial efforts. In 1998, the government privatized distribution of petroleum products. There are now Total and Mobil stations in the country. The government has expressed interest in privatizing the outmoded electricity utility. A French company operates cellular telephone service in cooperation with a state enterprise. The government is anxious for greater U.S. investment, and President Obiang visited the U.S. three times between 1999 and 2001 to encourage greater U.S. corporate interest. Investment in agriculture, fishing, livestock, and tourism are among sectors the government would like targeted.

Equatorial Guinea's balance-of-payments situation has improved substantially since the mid-1990s because of new oil and gas production and favourable world energy prices. Exports totalled about francs CFA 915 billion in 2000 (1.25 G$US), up from CFA 437 billion (700 M$US) in 1999. Crude oil exports accounted for more than 90% of export earnings in 2000. Timber exports, by contrast, represented only about 5% of export revenues in 2000. Additional oil production coming on line in 2001, combined with methanol gas exports from the new CMS-Nomeco plant, should increase export earnings substantially.

Imports into Equatorial Guinea also are growing very quickly. Imports totalled francs CFA 380 billion (530 M$US), up from franc CFA 261 million (420 M$US) in 1999. Imports of equipment used for the oil and gas sector accounted for about three-quarters of imports in 2000. Imports of capital equipment for public investment projects reached francs CFA 30 billion in 2000, up 40% from 1999 levels.

Equatorial Guinea's foreign debt stock was approximately francs CFA 69 billion (100 M$US) in 2000, slightly less than the debt stock in 1999, according to BEAC data. Equatorial Guinea's debt service ratio fell from 20% of GDP in 1994 to only 1% in 2000. Foreign exchange reserves were increasing slightly, although they were relatively low in terms of import coverage. According to the terms of the franc CFA zone, some of these reserves are kept in an account with the French Ministry of Finance.

Equatorial Guinea in the 1980s and 1990s received foreign assistance from numerous bilateral and multilateral donors, including European countries, the [[United States]], and the [[World Bank]]. Many of these aid programs have ceased altogether or have diminished. [[Spain]], [[France]], and the [[European Union]] continue to provide some project assistance, as do [[China]] and [[Cuba]]. The government also has discussed working with World Bank assistance to develop government administrative capacity.

Equatorial Guinea operated under an [[IMF]]-negotiated [[Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility]] (ESAF) until 1996. Since then, there have been no formal agreements or arrangements. The International monetary Fund held Article IV consultations (periodic country evaluations) in 1996, 1997, and in August 1999. After the 1999 consultations, IMF directors stressed the need for Equatorial Guinea to establish greater fiscal discipline, accountability, and more transparent management of public sector resources, especially energy sector revenue. IMF officials also have emphasized the need for economic data. In 1999, the Equato-Guinean Government began attempting to meet IMF-imposed requirements,  maintaining contact with IMF and the World Bank representatives. However, the newfound oil wealth allowed the government to avoid improving fiscal discipline, transparency and accountability.

== Infrastructure ==
Infrastructure is generally old and in poor condition. Surface transport is extremely limited at present, with little more than 700 kilometres of paved roads. The African Development Bank is helping to improve the paved roads from Malabo to Luba and Riaba; the Chinese are undertaking a project to link Mongomo to Bata on the mainland, and the European Union is financing an inter-states road network linking Equatorial Guinea to Cameroon and Gabon. Road maintenance is often inadequate.

Electricity is available in Equatorial Guinea's larger towns thanks to three small overworked hydropower facilities and a number of aged generators. In 1999, national production was about 13 MWh. In Malabo, the American company, CMS-Nomeco, built a 10 megawatt electricity plant financed by the government, which came in line in mid-2000, and plans to double capacity are advancing. This plant provides improved service to the capital, although there are still occasional outages. On the mainland the largest city, Bata, still has regular blackouts.

Water is only available in the major towns and is not always reliable because of poor maintenance and mismanagement. Some villages and rural areas are equipped with generators and water pumps, usually owned by private individuals.

Parastatal Getesa, a joint venture with a minority ownership stake held by a French subsidiary of [[France Télécom]], provides telephone service in the major cities. The regular system is overextended, but France Télécom has introduced a popular GSM system, which is generally reliable in Malabo and Bata.

Equatorial Guinea has two of the deepest Atlantic seaports of the region, including the main business and commercial port city of Bata. The ports of both Malabo and Bata are severely overextended and require extensive rehabilitation and reconditioning. The British company, Incat, has an ongoing project with the government to renovate and expand Luba, the country's third-largest port which is located on Bioko Island. The government hopes Luba will become a major transportation hub for offshore oil and gas companies operating in the Gulf of Guinea. Luba is located some 50 kilometres from Malabo and had been virtually inactive except for minor fishing activities and occasional use to ease congestion in Malabo. A new jetty is also being built at km 5 on the way from Malabo to the airport. It is a project mainly supposed to service the oil industry, but can also relieve the congested Malabo Port due to its closeness.
The Oil Jetty at km 5 is supposed to open the end of March 2003. Riaba is the other port of any scale on Bioko but is less active. The continental ports of Mbini and Cogo have deteriorated as well and are now used primarily for timber activities.

There are only air connections between the two cities of Malabo and Bata. A few aging Soviet-built aircraft operated by several small carriers, one state-owned, and the others private, constitute the national aircraft fleet. The runway at Malabo (3,200 meters) is equipped with lights and can service equipment similar to DC 10s and Cl3Os. The one at Bata (2,400 meters) does not operate at night but can accommodate aircraft as large as B737s. Their primary users are the national airline (EGA) and a private company (GEASA). Two minor airstrips (800 meters) are located at Mongomo and Annobon. There are international connections out of Malabo to Madrid and Zurich in Europe and to Cotonou, Douala and Libreville in West Africa.

== Energy Developments ==
After a slow start, Equatorial Guinea has recently emerged as a major oil producer in the Gulf of Guinea, one of the most promising hydrocarbon regions in the world. The main oil fields, Zafiro and Alba, are both located offshore of Bioko island. In 1999 oil production was about five times its 1996 level; Zafiro field, operated by Exxon Mobil and Ocean Energy, produced about 100,000 barrel/day (16,000 m&amp;sup3;/day), and CMS Nomeco extracted approximately 6,700 barrel/day (1,000 m&amp;sup3;/day). Aggressive field development and promising exploration activities may raise production to nearly 300,000 barrel/day (48,000 m&amp;sup3;) within 2-3 years (slightly above the current estimated production of Gabon) according to the official sources.

In 1995 Mobil (now Exxon Mobil) discovered the large Zafiro field, with estimated reserves of 400 million barrels (64 million m&amp;sup3;). Production began in 1996. The company announced a 3-year U.S.$1bn rapid development program to boost output to 130,000 barrel/day (21,000 m&amp;sup3;) by early 2001. Progress was delayed due to a contractual dispute with the government and by unexpectedly difficult geology. The difference with the government was eventually resolved.

In 1998 a more liberal regulatory and profit-sharing arrangement for hydrocarbon exploration and production activities was introduced. It revised and updated the production-sharing contract, which, until then, had favoured Western operators heavily. As a result domestic oil receipt rose from 13% to 20% of oil export revenue. However, the government's share remains relatively poor by international standards.

In 1997 CMS Nomeco moved to expand its operation with a U.S.$300m methanol plant. The plant entered production in 2000 and help boost [[gas condensate|condensate]] output from Alba field.

In August 1999 the government closed bidding on a new petroleum licensing round for 53 unexplored deepwater blocks and seven shallow water blocks. The response was small due to combination of factors, including falling oil prices, restructuring within the oil industry, and uncertainty over and undemarcated maritime border with Nigeria (which was not resolved until 2000).

In late 1999 Triton Energy, a U.S. independent, discovered La Ceiba in block G in an entirely new area offshore the mainland of the country. Triton expects a U.S.$200m development program to enable La Ceiba and associated fields to produce 100,000 barrel/day (16,000 m&amp;sup3;/day) by late 2001, despite disappointments and technical problems at the beginning of the year.

With an upturn in oil prices, exploration intensified in 2000. In April 2000 U.S.-based Vanco Energy signed a production-sharing contract for the offshore block of Corisco Deep. In May 2000, Chevron was granted block L, offshore Rio Muni, and a further three production-sharing contracts (for blocks J, I, and H) were signed with Atlas petroleum, a Nigerian company.

In early 2001 the government announced plans to establish a national oil company, to allow Equatorial Guinea to take a greater stake in the sector and to facilitate the more rapid transfer of skills. However, critics fear that such a company may become a vehicle for opaque accounting and inertia of the sort that has hindered development in neighbouring countries including [[Angola]], [[Cameroon]], and [[Nigeria]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''[[military]] of [[Equatorial Guinea]]''' was reorganized in 1979. It consists of approximately 2,500 service members. The army has almost 1,400 soldiers, the police 400 paramilitary men, the navy 200 service members, and the air force about120 members. There is a [[Gendarmerie]], but the number of members is unknown. The Gendarmerie is a new branch of the service in which training and education is being supported by the French Military Cooperation in Equatorial Guinea. Overall the military is poorly trained and equipped. It has mostly small arms, rocket launched grenades, and mortars. Almost none of its soviet-style light-armored vehicles or trucks are operational.

In 1988, the [[United States]] donated a 68-foot patrol boat to the Equatorial Guinean navy to patrol its exclusive economic zone. The U.S. patrol boat &quot;Isla de Bioko&quot; is no longer operational. U.S. military-to-military engagement has been dormant since 1997 (the year of the last [[Joint Combined Exchange Training Exercise]]). Between 1984 and 1992, service members went regularly to the United States on the International Military Education Training program, after which funding for this program for Equatorial Guinea ceased. The government spent 6.5% of its annual budget on defense in 2000 and 4.5% of its budget on defense in 2001. It recently acquired some Chinese artillery pieces, some Ukrainian patrol boats, and some Ukrainian Helicopter Gunships. The number of paved airports in Equatorial Guinea can be counted on one hand, and as such the number of aeroplanes operated by the airforce is small [http://www.worldairforces.com/Countries/equatorial_guinea/eqg.html] [http://www.worldairforces.com/Countries/equatorial_guinea/EQGaircraft.html]. The Equatoguineans rely on foreigners to operate and maintain this equipment as they are not sufficiently trained to do so. 

Military appointments are all reviewed by [[Teodoro Obiang | President Obiang]], and few of the native militiamen come from outside of Obiang's [[Mongomo]] based Esangui clan. Obiang was a general when he overthrew his uncle, [[Francisco Macias Nguema]]. His decision to personally review each military appointment reflects his fears over a lack of loyalty in the military- but the practise of a dictator reviewing individual military positions is not peculiar to Obiang- [[Adolf Hitler]] personally reviewed the status of every [[mischling]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A transitional agreement, signed in October 1968, implemented a [[Spain|Spanish]] preindependence decision to assist [[Equatorial Guinea]] and provided for the temporary maintenance of Spanish forces there. A dispute with President Macias in 1969 led to a request that all Spanish troops immediately depart, and a large number of civilians left at the same time. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were never broken but were suspended by Spain in March 1977 in the wake of renewed disputes. After Macias' fall in 1979, President Obiang asked for Spanish assistance, and since then, Spain has regained influence in Equatorial Guinea's diplomatic relations. The two countries signed permanent agreements for economic and technical cooperation, private concessions, and trade relations. President Obiang made an official visit to Madrid in March 2001, and senior Spanish Foreign Ministry officials visited Malabo during 2001 as well. Spain maintained a bilateral assistance program in Equatorial Guinea. Some Equato-Guinean opposition elements are based in Spain to the annoyance of the government of Malabo.

Equatorial Guinea has cordial relations with neighboring Cameroon, although there was criticism in Cameroon in 2000 about perceived mistreatment of Cameroonians working in Equatorial Guinea. The majority Fang ethnic group of mainland Equatorial Guinea extends both north and south into the forests of [[Cameroon]] and [[Gabon]]. Cameroon exports some food products to Equatorial Guinea and imports oil from Equatorial Guinea for its refinery at nearby [[Limbe]].

Equatorial Guinea has warmer relations with [[Nigeria]], and the Nigerian President made an official visit to Malabo in 2001. The two countries have delineated their offshore borders, which will facilitate development of nearby gas fields. In addition, many Nigerians work in Equatorial Guinea, as do immigrants from Cameroon and some West African states.

Equatorial Guinea is member of the [[Central African Economic and Monetary]] Union (CEMAC), which includes Cameroon, [[Central African Republic]], [[Chad]], [[Congo (Brazzaville)]], and Gabon. It also is a member of the Franc zone. Parallel to the Equatoguinean rapprochement with its francophone neighbors, France's role has significantly increased following Equatorial Guinea's entry into the [[CFA Franc Zone]] and the [[BEAC]]. French technical advisers work in the finance and planning ministries, and agreements have been signed for infrastructure development projects.

In [[1995]], the [[United States|USA]] closed its embassy, ostensibly for budget reasons, though the ambassador of the time had been accused of witchcraft, and had criticised the human rights situation. In [[1996]], offshore oil began flowing, and, with several US oil companies present in the country, the US reopened the embassy in October [[2003]]. 

The government's official policy is one of nonalignment. In its search for assistance to meet the goal of national reconstruction, the Government of Equatorial Guinea has established diplomatic relations with numerous European and Third World Countries. Having achieved independence under UN sponsorship, Equatorial Guinea feels a special kinship with that organization. It became the 126th UN member on November 12, 1968. 

'''Disputes - international:'''
exclusive maritime economic zone boundary dispute with Cameroon is presently before the ICJ; maritime boundary dispute with Gabon because of disputed sovereignty over islands in Corisco Bay; maritime boundary dispute with Nigeria and Cameroon because of disputed jurisdiction over oil-rich areas in the Gulf of Guinea

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Economy of Ethiopia table}}

The '''economy of Ethiopia''' is based on [[agriculture]], which accounts for half of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), 90% of [[export]]s, and 80% of total employment.

The major agricultural export crop is [[coffee]], providing 65%-75% of [[Ethiopia]]'s foreign exchange earnings. Coffee is critical to the Ethiopian economy, and Ethiopia earned $267 million in 1999 by exporting 105,000 metric tons. According to current estimates, coffee contributes 10% of Ethiopia's GDP. More than 15 million people (25% of the population) derive their livelihood from the coffee sector.

Other exports include live animals, hides, [[gold]], [[legume|pulses]], oilseeds, and [[khat]] (or ''qat''), a leafy [[shrub]] which has psychotropic qualities when chewed. 

Ethiopia's agriculture is plagued by periodic [[drought]], [[soil degradation]] caused by [[overgrazing]], [[deforestation]], high population density, and poor infrastructure, making it difficult and expensive to get goods to market. Yet it is the country's most promising resource. A potential exists for self-sufficiency in grains and for export development in livestock, grains, vegetables, and fruits. As many as 4.6 million people need food assistance annually. 

[[Gold]], [[marble]], [[limestone]], and small amounts of [[tantalum]] are mined in Ethiopia. Other resources with potential for commercial development include large [[potash]] deposits, [[natural gas]], [[iron]] ore, and possibly [[petroleum]] and geothermal energy. Although Ethiopia has good hydroelectric resources, which power most of its manufacturing sector, it is totally dependent on imports for its oil. Prior to the outbreak of the 1998&amp;ndash;2000 Ethiopian&amp;ndash;[[Eritrea]]n [[war]], [[landlocked]] Ethiopia mainly relied on the [[port|seaports]] of [[Assab]] and [[Massawa]] in [[Eritrea]] for international trade. Ethiopia [[As of 2005|currently]] uses the ports of [[Djibouti]], connected to [[Addis Ababa, Ethiopia|Addis Ababa]] by rail, and to a lesser extent, [[Port Sudan]] in [[Sudan]].  In May 2005, the Ethiopian government began negotiations to use the port of [[Berbera]] in [[Somaliland]]. Of the 23,812 kilometres of Ethiopia's all-weather roads, 15% are asphalt. Mountainous terrain and the lack of good roads and sufficient vehicles make land transportation difficult. However, the government-owned airline is excellent. [[Ethiopian Airlines]] serves 38 domestic airfields and has 42 international destinations.

Dependent on a few vulnerable crops for its foreign exchange earnings and reliant on imported oil, Ethiopia lacks sufficient foreign exchange. The financially conservative government has taken measures to solve this problem, including stringent import controls and sharply reduced subsidies on retail gasoline prices. Nevertheless, the largely subsistence economy is incapable of supporting high military expenditures, drought relief, an ambitious development plan, and indispensable imports such as oil and, therefore, must depend on foreign assistance.

In December 1999, Ethiopia signed a $1.4 [[billion]] (1.4 G$) joint venture deal to develop a huge natural gas field in the [[Somali Region]]. The war with [[Eritrea]] has forced the government to spend scarce resources on the military and forced the government to scale back ambitious development plans. Foreign investment has declined significantly. Government taxes imposed in late 1999 to raise money for the war will depress an already weak economy. The war has forced the government to improve roads and other parts of the previously neglected infrastructure, but only certain regions of the nation have benefited.

The current government has embarked on a program of economic reform, including privatization of state enterprises and rationalization of government regulation. While the process is still ongoing, the reforms have begun to attract much-needed foreign investment.

The first [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] line in Ethiopia was constructed in the years [[1897]] - [[1899]] between the cities of [[Harar]] and the capital [[Addis Ababa]]. This was extended in [[1904]] by a line that ran from Addis Ababa through [[Tigray]] into [[Eritrea]] and to [[Massawa]]; and the next year by a line again from Addis Ababa to [[Gore]] in the province of [[Illubabor]] and [[Jimma]] in [[Kaffa]].

The first telephones were brought by [[Ras Makonnen]] from Italy in [[1890]], and connected between the Palace and the Imperial treasury; the sound of disembodied voices frightened the local priests, who thought it was the work of [[demon]]s. The Emperor [[Menelik II]] responded to their protests with disdain, and later used the telephone to give orders to his provincial governors.&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|1]]&lt;/sup&gt; Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] had begun the process of introducing [[radio]] transmitters to the country for civilian and military use in the years before the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian invasion]].&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|2]]&lt;/sup&gt;

*The Ethiopian [[Dial Plan|dial plan]] changed on [[September 17]], [[2005]]. City codes (''i.e.'', internal prefixes) changed from two digits to three (or, from outside Ethiopia, one digit to two). Phone numbers changed from six digits to seven. A web-based program which converts old telephone numbers to new numbers is available [http://www.ethioindex.com/convert/ here].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[Ethiopian National Defense Force]] (ENDF) has approximately 100,000 personnel, which makes it one of the largest [[military]] forces in [[Africa]]. This number is significantly smaller than the 250,000 plus troops that existed during the [[Derg]] regime that fell to the rebel forces in 1991. The [[United States]] was Ethiopia's major [[arms trade|arms supplier]] from the end of [[World War II|World War 2]] until [[1977]], when Ethiopia began receiving massive arms shipments from the [[Soviet Union]]. These shipments, including armored patrol boats, transport and jet fighter aircraft, helicopters, tanks, trucks, missiles, artillery, and small arms have incurred an unserviced Ethiopian debt to the former Soviet Union estimated at more than $3.5 billion. Since the early [[1990s]], the ENDF has been in transition from a rebel force to a professional military organization with the aid of the U.S. and other countries. Training in demining, humanitarian and peace-keeping operations, professional military education, and military justice are among the major programs sponsored by the U.S.

'''Military branches:'''
Ground Forces, Air Force, Police, Militia

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Ethiopia}}
[[Ethiopia]] was relatively isolated from major movements of world politics until the [[1895]] and [[1935]] [[Italy|Italian]] invasions. Since [[World War II]], it has played an active role in world and [[African]] affairs. Ethiopia was a [[charter member]] of the [[United Nations]] and took part in UN operations in [[Korea]] in [[1951]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] in [[1960]]. Former [[Emperor]] [[Haile Selassie]] was a founder of the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU). [[Addis Ababa]] is the host capital for the UN Economic Commission for Africa and the OAU. 

Although nominally a member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], after the [[1974]] revolution, Ethiopia moved into a close relationship with the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies and supported their international policies and positions until the change of government in [[1991]]. 

Today, Ethiopia has very good relations with the U.S. and the West, especially in responding to regional instability and, increasingly, through economic involvement. Ethiopia's relations with [[Eritrea]] are extremely close, reflecting the shared revolutionary struggle against the [[Derg]]. Continuing instability along Ethiopia's borders with [[Sudan]] and [[Somalia]] contributes to tension with the [[National Islamic Front]] regime in Sudan and several groups in Somalia.

==International Disputes==
===Somalia===
*Most of the southern half of the boundary with Somalia is a Provisional Administrative Line, not an international boundary
*maintains alliances with local clans in opposition to the Transitional National Government, which lost its mandate in August 2003, in [[Mogadishu]]
*&quot;[[Somaliland]]&quot; secessionists provide port facilities and trade ties to landlocked Ethiopia
*Territorial dispute with Somalia over the [[Ogaden]]

===Eritrea===
*Dispute over alignment of boundary with Eritrea led to armed conflict between 1998 - 2000, which was resolved by the 2002 independent boundary commission's delimitation decision. However, demarcation has been delayed, despite intense international intervention, by Ethiopian insistence that the decision ignored &quot;human geography,&quot; made technical errors in the delimitation, and incorrectly awarded [[Badme]] and other areas to Eritrea. Eritrea meanwhile insists on not deviating from the commission's decision

===Sudan===
*Efforts to demarcate the porous boundary with Sudan have been delayed by civil war 

==Illicit drugs==
*Transit hub for [[heroin]] originating in Southwest and Southeast Asia and destined for Europe and North America, as well as [[cocaine]] destined for markets in southern Africa.
*Cultivates [[qat]] (chat) for local use and regional export, principally to [[Djibouti]] and Somalia.
*Lack of a well-developed financial system limits the country's usefulness as a [[money-laundering]] center

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Euklid2.jpg|thumb|Euclid]]

'''Euclidean geometry''' is the familiar kind of [[geometry]] on the plane or in three dimensions. Mathematicians sometimes use the term to encompass higher-dimensional geometries with similar properties. Euclidean geometry is named after the [[Hellenistic]] mathematician [[Euclid]] of [[Egypt]]. Euclid's text ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' is an early systematic treatment of this kind of geometry.

''Euclidean geometry'' sometimes means [[plane geometry]].  Plane geometry is the topic of this article and is the kind of geometry usually taught in [[secondary school]].

Euclidean geometry in three dimensions is traditionally called [[solid geometry]].
For information on [[higher dimensions]] see [[Euclidean space]]. 

==Axiomatic approach==

The traditional presentation of Euclidean geometry is as an [[axiomatic system]], setting out to prove all the &quot;true statements&quot; as [[theorem]]s in geometry from a set containing a finite number of [[axiom]]s.

The five [[postulate]]s of the ''Elements'' are as follows:

# Any two [[point]]s can be joined by a [[straight line]]. 
# Any [[straight line segment]] can be extended indefinitely in a straight line. 
# Given any straight line segment, a [[circle]] can be drawn having the segment as [[radius]] and one endpoint as center. 
# All [[right angle]]s are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]]. 
# If two lines are drawn which intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the [[inner angle]]s on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough. 

[[Image:euclid-proof.jpg|thumb|448px|A proof from Euclid's elements. It is shown that, given the line segment ΑΒ, an equilateral triangle ΑΒΓ can be constructed.]]
The fifth postulate is called the [[parallel postulate]], which leads to the same geometry as the following statement (note that it is formulated for two-dimensional geometry):
:''Through a point not on a given straight line, one and only one line can be drawn that never meets the given line.''

The parallel postulate seems less obvious than the others and many geometers tried in vain to prove it from them. By 1763 at least 28 different proofs of the fifth postulate had been published, but all were found to be incorrect. {{ref|GEB}} In the [[19th century]] it was shown that this could not be done, by constructing alternative systems of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], in which where the parallel postulate is false, while the other axioms hold.
(If one simply drops the parallel postulate from the list of axioms then the result is the more general geometry called [[absolute geometry]]). One consequence of omitting the parallel postulate is that the three angles of a [[triangle]] do not necessarily add to 180°. In [[hyperbolic geometry]] the sum of the three angles are always less than 180° and can approach zero, while in [[elliptic geometry]] the sum is greater than 180°.

Relatively recently, it was realized that Euclid's five axioms are incomplete. For instance, one of his theorems is that any line segment is part of a triangle; he constructs this in the usual way, by drawing circles around both endpoints and taking their intersection as the third vertex. His axioms, however, do not guarantee that the circles actually intersect. Many revised systems of axioms were constructed, the most standard ones being [[Hilbert's axioms]], [[Birkhoff's axioms]], and [[Tarski's axioms]].

[[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]] used his axioms to show Euclidean geometry is a complete [[Decidability_%28logic%29|decidable theory]]; that is, every proposition of Euclihand free when talking to their customers. This invention was picked up by LM Ericsson and incorporated into Ericsson products, beginning with a telephone named ''[[Dachshund|The Dachshund]]''.

=== Share ownership ===

In [[1925]] Karl Fredric Wincrantz took control of the company by acquiring the majority of the shares in the company. The company was also renamed ''Telefon AB LM Ericsson''. At this time, [[Ivar Kreuger]] started showing interest in the company, being a major owner of Wincrantz holding companies.

In [[1928]] Ericsson began its long tradition of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; shares, where an &quot;A&quot; share comes with 1000 votes against a &quot;B&quot; share, so Wincrantz was actually only controlling a few &quot;A&quot; shares, giving him control of the company whilst not actually controlling a majority of the shares. By issuing a lot of &quot;B&quot; shares, much more money was fed to the company, while maintaining the ''status quo'' of power distribution.

In [[1930]] a second issue of &quot;B&quot;-shares took place, resulting in Kreuger taking over the company with a mixture of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; shares. He bought these shares with money lent from Ericsson, with [[collateral (finance)|security]] given in German state [[bond]]s. He then took a large loan for his own company [[Kreuger &amp; Toll]] from [[ITT]] (administered by [[Sosthenes Behn]]) giving large parts of Ericsson as security. When Behn wanted to cancel this deal in [[1932]], he discovered the fact that there was no money left in the company, just a large claim on the same Kreuger &amp; Toll that he had himself lent money to. Kreuger had effectively bought Ericsson with its own money. After Kreuger's suicide in [[1932]], ITT owned one third of Ericsson, but was forbidden to exercise this ownership because of a paragraph in the articles of association stating that no foreign investor was allowed to control more than 20% of the votes.

While Ericsson came close to filing for [[bankruptcy]] in [[1932]], this did not happen. Instead [[Marcus Wallenberg]] (jr) negotiated a deal with several Swedish banks to rebuild Ericsson financially. One of them, [[Stockholms Enskilda Bank]], together with other Swedish investment banks controlled by the [[Wallenberg family]], then gradually increased its possession of Ericsson &quot;A&quot; shares, with ITT still being the single largest owner. In [[1960]] the Wallenberg family finally struck a deal with ITT to buy their shares in Ericsson and the company has since then been controlled by the Wallenberg family, i.e. a part of the &quot;[[Wallenberg sphere]]&quot;.

=== Purchase of the Marconi brand and assets ===
In October 2005, Ericsson purchased the bulk of the business of the troubled British telecoms manufacturer [[Marconi Corporation plc|Marconi]], including the Marconi brand name, which dates back to the creation of the original [[Marconi Company]] by the &quot;father of radio&quot; [[Guglielmo Marconi]].

==Corporate governance==
Current members of the [[board of directors]] of Ericsson are: [[Monica Bergström]], [[Peter Bonfield]], [[Anna Guldstrand]], [[Jan Hedlund]], [[Ulf Johansson]], [[Per Lindh]], [[Sverker Martin-Löf]], [[Arne Löfving]], [[Arne Mårtensson]], [[Nancy McKinstry]], [[Torbjörn Nyman]], [[Eckhard Pfeiffer]], [[Carl-Henric Svanberg]], [[Michael Treschow]] and [[Marcus Wallenberg]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ethology''' is the scientific study of [[animal]] [[behavior]] considered as a branch of [[zoology]]. A [[scientist]] who practices ethology is called an '''ethologist'''.

== Origins of the name ==

The term &amp;#8220;ethology&amp;#8221; derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] language, as [[ethos]] (''&amp;#942;&amp;#952;&amp;#959;&amp;#962;'') is the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for &quot;[[custom]]&quot;. Other words that derive from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word &quot;ethos&quot; are: &quot;ethics&quot; and &quot;ethical.&quot; The term was first popularised in English by the American [[Myrmecologist]] [[William Morton Wheeler]] in [[1902]].  An earlier, slightly different sense of the term was proposed by [[John Stuart Mill]] in his [[1843]] &lt;cite&gt;System of Logic&lt;/cite&gt;.  He recommended the development of a new science, &quot;ethology,&quot; whose purpose would be the explanation of individual and national differences in character, on the basis of [[associationism|associationistic]] [[psychology]].  This use of the word was never adopted, however.

== Differences and similarities with comparative psychology ==

Ethology can be contrasted with [[comparative psychology]], which also studies animal behaviour, but construes its study as a branch of [[psychology]]. Thus where comparative psychology sees the study of animal behaviour in the context of what is known about human psychology, ethology sees the study of animal behaviour in the context of what is known about animal [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]].  Furthermore, early comparative psychologists concentrated on the study of learning, and thus tended to look at behaviour in artificial situations, whereas early ethologists concentrated on behaviour in natural situations, tending to describe it as instinctive.  The two approaches are complementary rather than competitive, but they do lead to different perspectives and sometimes to conflicts of opinion about matters of substance.   In addition, for most of the [[twentieth century]] comparative psychology developed most strongly in [[North America]], while ethology was stronger in [[Europe]], and this led to different emphases as well as somewhat different philosophical underpinnings in the two disciplines.  A practical difference is that comparative psychologists concentrated on gaining extensive knowledge of the behaviour of very few [[species]], while ethologists were more interested in gaining knowledge of behaviour in a wide range of species, not least in order to be able to make principled comparisons across [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] groups.  Ethologists have made much more use of a truly [[comparative method]] than comparative psychologists ever have.

== Darwinism and the beginnings of ethology ==

Because ethology is understood as a branch of [[biology]], ethologists have been particularly concerned with the [[evolution]] of behaviour and the understanding of behaviour in terms of the theory of [[natural selection]].  In one sense the first modern ethologist was [[Charles Darwin]], whose book &lt;cite&gt;The expression of the emotions in animals and men&lt;/cite&gt; influenced many ethologists.  However, he pursued his interest in behaviour by encouraging his protégé [[George Romanes]], who investigated animal learning and intelligence using an anthropomorphic method that did not gain scientific support.  The early ethologists, such as [[Oskar Heinroth]] and [[Julian Huxley]] instead concentrated on behaviours that can be called [[instinct]]ive, or natural, in that they occur in all members of a [[species]] under specified circumstances.  Their first step in studying the behaviour of a new species was to construct an '''ethogram''', a description of the main types of natural behaviour with their frequencies of occurrence.  This approach provided an objective, cumulative base of data about behaviour, which subsequent researchers could check and build on, and as a way of building a science of behaviour, it proved much more fruitful.

== The fixed action pattern and animal communication ==

An important step, associated with the name of [[Konrad Lorenz]] though probably due more to his teacher, Heinroth, was the identification of [[fixed action pattern]]s (FAPs). Lorenz popularized FAPs as instinctive responses that would occur reliably in the presence of identifiable stimuli (called '''sign stimuli''' or '''releasing stimuli''').  These FAPs could then be compared across species, and the similarities and differences between behaviour compared with the similarities and differences in [[morphology (biology)]] on which taxonomy was based.  An important and much quoted study of the [[Anatidae]] (ducks and geese) by Heinroth used this technique.  The ethologists noted that the stimuli that released FAPs were commonly features of the appearance or behaviour of other members of their own species, and they were able to show how important forms of [[animal communication]] could be mediated by a few simple FAPs.  The most sophisticated investigation of this kind was the study by [[Karl von Frisch]] of the so-called &amp;#8220;dance language&amp;#8221; underlying [[bee learning and communication|bee communication]].  Lorenz developed an interesting theory of the evolution of animal communication based on his observations of the nature of fixed action patterns and the circumstances in which animals emit them.

== Imprinting ==

A second important finding of Lorenz concerned the early learning of young [[nidifugous]] birds, a process he called [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]].  Lorenz observed that the young of birds such as [[goose|geese]] and [[chicken]]s spontaneously followed their mothers from almost the first day after they were hatched, and he discovered that this following response could be transferred to an arbitrary stimulus if the eggs were incubated artificially and the stimulus was presented during a '''critical period''' (now called a '''sensitive period''') that covered the few days after hatching.  The concept of imprinting has been widely adopted in [[developmental psychology]].

== Tinbergen's four questions for ethologists ==

Lorenz&amp;#8217;s collaborator, [[Niko Tinbergen]], argued that ethology always needed to pay attention to four kinds of explanation of any instance of behaviour:

* Function: how does the behaviour impact on the animal&amp;#8217;s chances of survival and reproduction?
* Causation: what are the stimuli that elicit the response, and how has it been modified by recent learning?
* Development: how does the behaviour change with age, and what early experiences are necessary for the behaviour to be shown?
* Evolutionary history: how does the behaviour compare with similar behaviour in related species, and how might it have arisen through the process of [[phylogeny]]?

== The flowering of ethology ==

Through the work of Lorenz and Tinbergen, ethology developed strongly in continental Europe in the years before [[World War II]].  After the war, Tinbergen moved to the [[University of Oxford]], and ethology became stronger in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], with the additional influence of William Thorpe, [[Robert Hinde]] and [[Patrick Bateson]] at the Sub-department of Animal Behaviour of the [[University of Cambridge]], located in the village of [[Madingley]].  In this period, too, ethology began to develop strongly in [[North America]].

Lorenz, Tinbergen, and von Frisch were jointly awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[1973]] for their work in developing ethology.

== Social ethology and recent developments ==

In [[1970]], the [[England|English]] ethologist [[John H. Crook]] published an important paper in which he distinguished '''comparative ethology''' from '''social ethology''', and argued that much of the ethology that had existed so far was really comparative ethology, looking at animals as individuals, whereas in the future, ethologists would need to concentrate on the behaviour of social groups of animals and the social structure within them.  This was prescient.  [[E. O. Wilson]]&amp;#8217;s book &amp;#8216;&amp;#8217;[[Sociobiology]]&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217; appeared in [[1975]], and since that time the study of behaviour has been much more concerned with social aspects.  It has also been driven by the stronger, but more sophisticated, Darwinism associated with Wilson and [[Richard Dawkins]].  The related development of [[behavioral ecology]] has also helped transform ethology.  At the same time a substantial rapprochement with comparative psychology has occurred, so the modern scientific study of behaviour offers a more or less seamless spectrum of approaches, from [[animal cognition]], more traditional [[comparative psychology]], ethology, [[sociobiology]] and [[behavioural ecology]].

== Notes ==

* There are often mismatches between human senses and those of the organisms they are observing. To compensate, ethologists often reach all the way back to [[epistemology]] to give them the tools to predict and avoid misinterpretation of data.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Light-wave.png|thumb|right|350px|Electromagnetic radiation can be conceptualized as a self propagating transverse oscillating wave of electric and magnetic fields. This diagram shows a plane polarised wave.]]

'''Electromagnetic radiation''' is a propagating [[wave]] in space with [[electricity|electric]] and [[magnetism|magnetic]] components. These components oscillate at right angles to each other and to the direction of propagation.

The term ''electromagnetic radiation'' is also used as a synonym for electromagnetic waves in general, even if they are not radiating or travelling in free space. This sense includes, for example, [[light]] travelling through an [[optical fiber]], or [[radio frequency|electrical energy]] travelling within a [[coaxial cable]].

Electromagnetic (EM) radiation carries [[energy]] and [[momentum]] which may be imparted when it interacts with [[matter]].

== Physics ==
=== Theory ===
'''Electromagnetic waves''' of  much lower frequency than visible light were predicted by [[Maxwell's equations]] and subsequently discovered by [[Heinrich Hertz]]. Maxwell [[Electromagnetic wave equation | derived]] a wave form of the electric and magnetic equations which made explicit the wave nature of the electric and magnetic fields. These equations displayed the symmetry of the fields. 

According to the theory, a time-varying [[electric field]] generates a [[magnetic field]] and vice versa. Thus, an oscillating electric field creates an oscillating magnetic field, which in turn creates an oscillating electric field, and so on. By this means an EM wave is produced which propagates through space.

=== Properties ===
Electric and magnetic fields exhibit the property of superposition. This means that the field due to a particular particle or time-varying electric or magnetic field adds to the fields due to other causes. (As magnetic and electric fields are vector fields, this is the [[vector (spatial)|vector]] addition of all the individual electric and magnetic field vectors.) As a result, EM radiation is influenced by various phenomena such as [[refraction]] and [[diffraction]]. For example, a travelling EM wave incident on a particular arrangement of [[atom]]s induces oscillation in the atoms and thus causes them to emit their own EM waves. These emissions interfere with the impinging wave and alter its form. 

In refraction, a wave moving from one medium to another of a different density changes its speed and direction when it enters the new medium. The ratio of the refractive indices of the media determines the extent of refraction. Refraction is the mechanism by which light disperses into a [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] when it is shone through a prism.

The [[physics]] of electromagnetic radiation is [[electrodynamics]], a subfield of [[electromagnetism]].

EM radiation exhibits both wave properties and particle properties at the same time (see [[wave-particle duality]]). These characteristics are mutually exclusive and appear separately in different circumstances: the wave characteristics appear when EM radiation is measured over relatively large timescales and over large distances, and the particle characteristics are evident when measuring small distances and timescales. These characteristics have been confirmed by a large number of experiments.

===Wave model===
An important aspect of the wave nature of light is [[frequency]]. The frequency of a wave is its rate of oscillation and is measured in [[hertz]], the [[SI]] unit of frequency, equal to one oscillation per [[second]]. Light usually comprises a spectrum of frequencies which sum to form the resultant wave. In addition, frequency affects properties like [[refraction]], in which different frequencies undergo a different level of refraction.

A wave has troughs and crests.  The [[wavelength]] is the distance from crest to crest.  Waves in the electromagnetic spectrum vary in size from very long radio waves the size of buildings, to very short gamma-rays smaller than the size of the nucleus of an atom. Frequency has an inverse relationship to the concept of wavelength. When waves travel from one medium to another, their frequency remains exactly the same - only their speed changes.  

Waves can also be described by their [[radiant energy]].

[[Interference]] is the superposition of two or more waves resulting in a new wave pattern.    The way that these coincide causes different types of interference.

=== Particle model===
In the particle model of EM radiation, EM radiation is [[quantum|quantized]] as particles called [[photon]]s. Quantisation of light represents the discrete packets of energy which constitute the radiation. The frequency of the radiation determines the magnitude of the energy of the particles. Moreover, these particles are emitted and absorbed by charged particles, so photons act as transporters of [[energy]].

A photon absorbed by an [[atom]] excites an [[electron]] and elevates it to a higher [[energy level]]. If the energy is great enough, so that the electron &quot;jumps&quot; to a high enough energy level, it may escape the positive pull of the nucleus and get liberated from the atom in a process called [[ionization]]. Conversely, an electron which descends to a lower energy level in an atom emits a photon of light equal to the energy difference. 
The energy levels of electrons in atoms are discrete. Therefore, each element has its own characteristic frequencies.

Together these effects explain the absorption spectra of [[light]]. The dark bands in the spectrum are due to the atoms in the intervening medium which absorb different frequencies of the light. The composition of the medium through which the light travels determines the nature of the absorption spectrum. For instance, in a distant star, dark bands in the light it emits are due to the atoms in the atmosphere of the star. These bands correspond to the allowed energy levels in the atoms. A similar phenomenon occurs for emission. As the electrons descend to lower energy levels, a spectrum which represents the jumps between the energy levels of the electrons is exhibited. This is manifested in the emission spectrum of [[nebula]]e. Today, scientists use this phenomenon to observe what elements a certain star is composed of. It is also used in the determination of the distance of a given star, using the so-called [[red shift]]

===Speed of propagation===
Any electric charge which accelerates, or any changing magnetic field, produces electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic information about the charge travels at the speed of light. Accurate treatment thus incorporates a concept known as [[retarded time]] (as opposed to advanced time, which is unphysical in light of [[causality]]), which  adds to the expressions for the electrodynamic [[electric field]] and [[magnetic field]]. These extra terms are responsible for electromagnetic radiation. When any wire (or other conducting object such as an [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]]) conducts [[alternating current]], electromagnetic radiation is propagated at the same frequency as the electric current. Depending on the circumstances, it may behave as a [[wave]] or as [[photon|particle]]s.  As a wave, it is characterized by a velocity (the [[speed of light]]), [[wavelength]], and [[frequency]].   When considered as particles, they are known as [[photon]]s, and each has an energy related to the frequency of the wave given by [[Max Planck|Planck's]] relation ''E = h&amp;nu;'', where ''E'' is the energy of tply choosing to stay outside the exchange rate mechanism, the Swedish government is provided a formal loophole avoiding the theoretical requirement of adopting the euro. Some of Sweden's major parties continue to believe that it would be in the national interest to join, but they have all pledged to abide by the results for the time being and show no interest in raising the issue again.

* the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[eurosceptics]] believe that the single currency is merely a stepping stone to the formation of a unified European superstate, and that removing Britain's ability to set its own interest rates will have detrimental effects on its economy. Others in the UK, usually joined by eurosceptics, advance several economic arguments against membership: the most cited one concerns the large unfunded pension liabilities of many continental European governments (unlike in the UK) which would, with a greying population, depress the currency in the future against the UKs interests. The contrary view is that, since intra-European exports make up to 50% of the UK's total, it eases the Single Market by removing currency risk, although financial derivatives are becoming more accessable to small UK businesses thereby allowing businesses to offset this risk. An interesting parallel can be seen in the 19th century discussions concerning the possibility of the UK joining the [[Latin Monetary Union]] [http://www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-924366-2.pdf].  The UK government has set [[five economic tests]] that must be passed before it can recommend that the UK join the euro; however, given the relatively subjective nature of these tests it seems unlikely that they would be held to be fulfilled whilst public opinion remains so strongly against participation. 

* [[Denmark]] negotiated a number of opt-out clauses from the [[Maastricht treaty]] after it had been rejected in a first referendum. In 2000, another referendum was held in Denmark regarding the euro; once more, the population decided to stay outside the [[eurozone]] for now. However, Danish politicians have suggested that debate on abolishing the four opt-out clauses may possibly be re-opened in 2006. In addition, Denmark has pegged its [[krone]] to the euro (&amp;euro;1 = DKr7.460,38 ± 2.25%) as the krone remains in the [[ERM]].

====Post-2004 EU members====

In [[2004]] the 10 new EU member states had a currency other than the euro, however those countries are required by their [[Treaty on the Accession of 10 new Member States|Accession Treaties]] to join the euro. 
Since some of them already comply with the [[convergence criteria]], these countries have already joined the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], ERM II and are set to join the euro ([[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|EMU III]]) as follows: 

*[[1 January]], [[2007]] for [[Estonia]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Lithuania]]. 
*[[1 January]], [[2008]] for [[Cyprus]], [[Latvia]] and [[Malta]] 
*[[1 January]], [[2009]] for [[Slovakia]]
*[[January|Mid-january]] [[2009]] for [[Bulgaria]]
*[[1 January]], [[2010]] for the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Hungary]]. 
*[[2011]] or later for [[Poland]] and [[Romania]]

([http://www.lb.lt/news/pg.dll?lng=EN&amp;did=1014 1]; [[Estonian euro coins|Estonia]], [[Lithuanian euro coins|Lithuania]], [[Slovak euro coins|Slovakia]] and [[Slovenian euro coins|Slovenia]] have already finalised the design for the country's coins' obverse side.[http://www.eestipank.info/pub/en/majandus/euroopaliit/euro/kavand/_1kava.html 1] [http://www.eestipank.info/pub/en/yldine/press/pressiteated/pt2004/_20041215.html 2]

[[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]] are not yet members of the EU, but being scheduled to enter on [[January 1]] [[2007]].

* The [[Bulgarian National Bank]] and the Bulgarian government have agreed on the introduction of the euro in mid-2009, when the [[Bulgarian National Bank]] is expected to become part of the EMU and will receive the right to issue Bulgarian euro coins. The early accession to the EMU is due to existing [[currency board]] agreement that was signed in 1997 to help put an end to the deep financial crisis and foreign debt reimbursement problems. The agreement effectively binds the Bulgarian lev to the euro (between 1997 and 1999, before the euro came into existence, the lev was bound to the German mark). As a consequence, [[Bulgaria]] has fulfilled the great majority of the EMU membership criteria.

* In [[Romania]], the [[National Bank of Romania|National Bank]] retained its monetary policy attributes throughout the financial crisis of the 1990s (which gradually ended). Hence, [[Romania]]'s accession to the EMU will take more time. It is likely that [[Romania]] will  join the eurozone in the 2010&amp;ndash;12 period, and strategies have been established to this end. To simplify future adjustments to [[Automatic  teller machine|ATMs]] at the adoption of the euro, when the Romanian new Leu was adopted in 2005 (at 10,000 old Lei to 1 new Leu) the new banknotes were issued to the same physical proportions as euro banknotes, the old leu notes being substantially longer in relation to their width.

====Public opinion after the European Constitution referenda==== 

Although the failure of the [[European Constitution]] to be ratified would have no direct impact on the status of the euro, some debate regarding the euro arose after the negative outcome of the French and Dutch referenda in mid 2005.

*A poll by Stern magazine released [[1 June]] [[2005]] found that 56% of Germans would favour a return to the mark. [http://www.stern.de/presse/vorab/?id=541124&amp;q=eichel%20category:presse]
*Members of the [[Northern League (Italy)|Northern League]] Italian nationalist political party have discussed calling a referendum to return Italy to the Lira. [http://washingtontimes.com/world/20050614-114629-8803r.htm]
*Members of the [[Movement for France]] political party have proposed holding a referendum to return France to the Franc. [http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=664902005]
*In contrast to Germany a poll in Austria on [[7 June]] [[2005]] showed the overwhelming support of the euro: 73 percent of the sample said they preferred to keep the common currency with only 21 percent in favour of returning to the old currency the schilling. [http://www.vienna.at/engine.aspx/page/vienna-article-detail-page/cn/vol-news-willie-20050607-011305/dc/tp:vol:oesterreich]

However, soon after these suggestions were made, the [[European Commission]] issued a statement denying any possibility of this, stating &quot;the euro is here to stay&quot;. &lt;!-- personal views on this go in Discussion page --&gt;

==Eurozone as an Optimal Currency Area?==

{{main|Optimal Currency Area - Eurozone}}

In economic theory the degree of fullfillment of the following four criteria indicate whether an area is optimal for a monetary union. These criteria are often called the [[Optimal Currency Area]] (OCA) criteria. Although these criteria are not exhaustive and far from absolute, they are generally accepted as a sufficient measure. There are three economic criteria (labour and capital mobility, product diversification, and openness) and one political criterion (fiscal transfers). All these criteria stand in relation to the ability to deal with asymmetric shocks (i.e. shocks that only hit one area). Symmetric shocks are less problematic in a currency area as the currency will depreciate or appreciate to the needed level for all areas (as this level is the same for all areas), while asymmetric shocks will create an exchange rate that is too high for one area and one that is too low for the other. This causes wage and price changes and unemployment problems.

*[[Robert A. Mundell]] formulated the idea that perfect [[capital]] and [[labour mobility]] would mitigate the adverse consequences of asymmetric shocks in a currency area. While capital is quite mobile in the eurozone, labour mobility is relatively low, especially when compared to the [[USA]] and [[Japan]].

*[[Peter Kenen]] formulated the idea that widely diversified production and export structures that are similar between the areas that form the currency area lower the effect and probability of asymmetric shocks. The eurozone scores quite well on this criterion, and monetary integration seems to further improve the diversification of production structures.

*[[Ronald McKinnon]] formulated the idea that areas which are very open to [[trade]] and trade heavily with each other form an optimum currency area. This is because the high trade intensity will lower the significance of the distinction between domestic and foreign [[goods]] as [[competition]] will equalize the [[prices]] of most goods, independently of [[exchange rate]]s. The eurozone members trade heavily with each other, and all evidence so far seems to indicate that the monetary union has at least doubled trade between members.

*The term [[fiscal]] transfers refer to the transfer of money between areas. This could decrease the adverse consequences of asymmetric shocks as the areas that are hit, would receive money. This would create a counter [[Business cycle|cyclical]] effect and thus lower the price and wage changes and unemployment wouldn't rise as much. In reality however there is a no-bail out clause in the [[Stability and Growth Pact]], meaning that fiscal transfers are not allowed.

In general, economic research state that is impossible to say whether eurozone members would benefit from a currency area, as two important criteria support a monetary union, while at the same time two important criteria oppose such an union.

==Effects of the single currency==

[[Image:La2-euro.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The euro Light Sculpture in [[Frankfurt]]]]
The introduction of a single currency for many separate countries presents a number of advantages and disadvantages for the participating nations. Opinions differ on the actual effects of the euro so far, as most of them will take years to understand. Theories and predictions abound.

===Removal of exchange rate risk===

One of the most important benefits of the euro will be lowered [[exchange rate]] risks, which will make it easier to invest across borders. The risks of changes in the value of respective currencies has always made it risky for companies or individuals to invest or even import/export outside their own currency zone. Profits could be quickly eliminated as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. As a result, most investors and importers/exporters have to either accept the risk or [[Hedging|&quot;hedge&quot;]] their bets, resulting in further costs on the financial markets. Consequently, it is less appealing to invest outside one’s own currency zone. The eurozone greatly increases the potentially &quot;exchange-risk free&quot; investment area. Since Europe’s economy is heavily dependent on intra-European exports, the benefits of this effect can hardly be overstated. This is particularly important for countries whose currencies have traditionally fluctuated a great deal such as the Mediterranean nations. 

At the same time, this is likely to increase foreign investment in countries with more liberal markets and reduce that in those with rigid markets. Some people worry that thus will see profits flowing away from particular member states to the detriment of their traditional social values. It might also result in the reduction of local decision makers in businesses.

===Removal of conversion fees===

A benefit is the removal of [[bank]] transaction charges that previously were a cost to both individuals and [[business]]es when exchanging from one national currency to another. Although not an enormous cost, multiplied thousands of times, the savings add up across the entire economy.

For electronic payments (e.g. [[credit cards]], [[debit cards]] and [[cash machine]] withdrawals), banks in the [[eurozone]] must now charge the same for intra-member cross-border transactions as they charge for domestic transactions. Banks in [[France]] have attempted to circumvent this regulation by charging for all bank transfers (domestic and cross-border) unless the transfer is instructed via [[online banking]] &amp;mdash; a method through which they do not offer cross-border payments. In this way, banks in [[France]] continue to charge more for cross-border transfers than for domestic transfers.{{fact}}

===Deeper financial markets===

Another significant advantage of switching to the euro is the creation of deeper financial markets. Financial markets on the continent are expected to be far more [[market liquidity|liquid]] and flexible than they were in the past. There will be more competition for, and availability of financial products across the union. This will reduce the financial servicing costs to businesses and possibly even individual consumers across the continent. The costs associated with public debt will also decrease. It is expected that the broader, deeper markets will lead to increased stock market [[capitalisation]] and investment. Larger, more internationally competitive financial and business institutions may arise.

===Price parity===

Another effect of the common European currency is that differences in prices&amp;mdash;in particular in price levels&amp;mdash;should decrease. Differences in prices can trigger [[arbitrage]], e.g. artificial trade in a commodity between countries purely to exploit the price differential, which will tend to equalise prices across the euro area. It is held that this is supposed to result in increased competition or consolidation of companies, which should help to contain inflation and which therefore will be beneficial to consumers. Similarly, price transparency across borders is said to benefit consumers find lower cost goods or services. There is no universally accepted scientific theory based on firm evidence that this is an inevitable consequence, but rather is more likely to come about, if and when it does, due to popular belief in this system.

===Competitive funding===

Competitive funding is also a benefit for many countries (and companies) that adopted the euro.  National and corporate [[bond]]s denominated in euro are significicantly more liquid and have lower interest rates than was historically the case when denominated in legacy currency.  Likewise, companies have greater freedom to borrow competitively from cross-border banks without incurring exchange rate risk.  This has forced the incumbent banks to reduce their rates to compete.  &lt;!-- Ireland provides an example of both.  I'm sure that a web search will find.  --&gt;

===Macroeconomic stability===

Improved macroeconomic stability is an important benefit of the euro for the entire continent. Much of Europe has been susceptible to economic problems such as [[inflation]] throughout the last 50 years. Inflation is a very damaging phenomenon from most of society’s perspective. It discourages investment, can cause social unrest, and causes problems for those on fixed incomes and for [[tax]]ation. However, many countries have been unable or unwilling to deal with serious inflationary pressures. They often have other priorities that compromise their ability to do so. Sometimes their economic clout is simply insufficient, sometimes their parliamentary seats are at risk if they do. However, there have been models, particularly in those with largely independent central banks, that have successfully countered inflation. One such bank was the [[Bundesbank]] in Germany; since the European Central Bank is modeled on the Bundesbank, is independent of the pressures of national governments. Since it has a mandate to keep inflationary pressures low, prices in Europe have been after the euro’s introduction. ([[Eurostat]] data confirms this, nevertheless many citizens perceive it not to be the case).  Unlike the [[Federal Reserve]] in the USA, it does not have a second objective to sustain growth and employment and consequently seems too conservative.  This is discussed further in article [[ECB]].  &lt;!-- Advice to editors: this article is already too long and this is only a summary, so if at all possible please develop the ECB article instead of this one --&gt;

===Less-specific monetary policy===

Some economists are concerned about the possible dangers of adopting a single currency for a large and diverse area. Because the eurozone has a single [[monetary policy]], and so a single [[interest rate]], set by the ECB, it cannot be fine-tuned for the economic situation in each individual country (however, prior to the introduction of the euro, exchange rates volatility had reduced substantially after the European currency crisis in the early 1990s). [[Public investment]] and [[fiscal policy]] in each country is thus the only way in which government-led economic stimulus can be introduced specific to each region or nation. This inflexible interest rate might stifle growth in some areas, while over-promoting it in others. The result could be extended periods of economic depression in some areas of the continent, disadvantaged by the central interest rate. Given such a situation resentment and friction within the community, and toward the bank, might well increase. Others point out that in today's globalised economy, individual countries do not really have power to effectively manage their monetary policy, as it creates other imbalances. This effect was already visible in the last European currency crises of 1992, when the Bundesbank was effectively coordinating monetary policy for the whole continent.

Some proponents of the euro point out that the eurozone is similar in size and population to the [[United States]], which has a single currency and a single monetary policy set by the [[Federal Reserve]]. However, the individual states that make up the USA have less [[regional autonomy]] and a more homogeneous economy than the nations of the EU. Of particular concern in accordance with this theory is the notion that the economies of the EU may not all be 'in sync'&amp;mdash; each may be at a different stage in the [[boom and bust]] cycle, or just be experiencing different inflationary pressures. [[Labour mobility]] is also much lower in the eurozone than across the United States, largely due to the vast differences in language and culture between European nations, and despite labour, capital and goods full mobility rules.

It can also be argued that a single currency works for the USA because the [[US dollar]] is a hegemonic currency.  Before the euro, eighty per cent of the world's currency reserves were held in US dollars.  This gives the US economy a huge subsidy in that reserve dollars are invested in US institutions or foreign institutions under US control. This subsidy helps cushion the effects of a possible strong dollar hurting certain regions of the USA.  

If the euro were to become either a hegemonic currency replacing the dollar or a co-hegemonic currency equal in reserve status to the dollar, some of the subsidy the USA gains would be transferred to the EU and help balance out some of the problems of the present heterogeneous economic structure still in place.

===A new reserve currency?===

The euro will probably become one of two, or perhaps three, major global [[reserve currency|reserve currencies]]. Currently, international currency exchange is dominated by the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] (USD). The U.S. dollar is used by banks world-wide as a stable reserve on which to ensure their liquidity and international transactions and investments are often made in U.S. dollars.

A currency is attractive for foreign transactions when it demonstrates a proven track record of stability, a well-developed financial market to dispose of the currency in, and proven acceptability to others. The euro will almost certainly be able to match these criteria at least as well as the U.S. dollar, so given some time to become accepted, it will likely begin to take its place alongside the dollar as one of the world’s major international currencies.

There are several benefits to reserve currencies of being such an internationally acceptable currency. If the euro were to become a reserve currency it would benefit member countries by lowering the service charges on their [[debt|debts]]. Since the currency would be so broadly acceptable it would make the premiums paid to debt holders lower, since the risk to the borrower is lower. It is estimated that the United States government currently saves 10-15 billion dollars a year on 2 trillion dollars of international debt because of this principle. The issuer of the reserve currency is freer to pursue macroeconomic policy adjustments to suit its own needs in terms of financing its debt, or influencing other countries. Reserve status would also lower the cost of many commodities for Europeans.

===The euro and oil===

The eurozone consumes more imported [[petroleum]] than the [[United States]].  This would mean that more euros than US dollars would flow into the [[OPEC]] nations, but oil is priced by those nations in US dollars only.  There have been frequent discussions at OPEC about pricing oil in euros, which would have various effects, among them, requiring nations to hold stores of euros to buy oil, rather than the US dollars that they hold now. [[Venezuela]] under [[Hugo Chávez]] has been a vocal proponent of this scheme, despite selling most of its own oil to the United States. Another proponent was [[Saddam Hussein]] of [[Iraq]], which holds the world's second largest oil reserves. Since 2000 Iraq had used the euro as oil export currency. In 2002, Iraq changed its US dollars into euro, a few months prior to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. If implemented by the [[OPEC]], the changeover to the euro would be a transfer of a '[[Float (money supply)|float]]' that presently subsidises the United States to subsidise the European Union instead. Another effect would be that the price of oil in the eurozone would more closely follow the world price. When oil prices skyrocketed to almost 50 USD/barrel in August 2004, the oil price in euros didn't change nearly as much because of the concurrent rise in the exchange rate of the euro to the US dollar (to an exchange rate of EUR 1.00 = USD 1.33 in December 2004). Similarly, should oil prices lower significantly, together with the USD/EUR exchange rate, the oil price in the eurozone would not fall as much. On the other hand, if the exchange rate and the oil price move in different directions, oil price changes are magnified. Pricing oil in euros would nullify this dependency of European oil prices on the USD/EUR exchange rate.

On [[March 20]], [[2006]], [[Iran]] is planning to open an [[International Oil Bourse]] (IOB, exchange) for the express purpose of trading oil priced in other currencies, including [[Petroeuro|euros]].

==Euro exchange rate==

===Flexible exchange rates===

One of the implications of the [[Mundell-Fleming Model]] is the fact that when an economy combines international capital mobility with monetary autonomy, it cannot at the same time maintain a fixed exchange rate (as increasing the [[money supply]] would result in a [[depreciation]] of the currency). In the years following the [[Single European Act]] the EU has liberalized its capital markets, and as the [[ECB]] has chosen for monetary autonomy, the [[exchange rate regime]] of the euro is flexible or [[Floating exchange rate|floating]]. In other words, the ECB does not use the exchange rate instrument and in general does not intervene on the foreign exchange rate markets. This explains why the exchange rate of the euro vis-à-vis other currencies is characterized by strong fluctuations. Most notable are the fluctuations of the euro vs. the [[US dollar]], another freely floating currency.

===Against other major currencies===

After the introduction of the euro, its exchange rate against other currencies, especially the [[US dollar]], declined heavily. At its introduction in 1999, the euro was traded at USD1.18; on [[26 October]] [[2000]], it fell to an all time low of $0.8228 per euro. It then began what at the time was thought to be a recovery; by the beginning of 2001 it had risen to nearly $0.96. It declined again, although less than previously, reaching a low of $0.8344 on [[6 July]] [[2001]] before commencing a steady appreciation. In the wake of U.S. corporate scandals, the two currencies reached parity on [[15 July]] [[2002]], and by the end of 2002 the euro had reached $1.04 as it climbed further.

On [[23 May]] [[2003]], the euro surpassed its initial ($1.18=€1.00) trading value for the first time. At the end of 2004, it had reached a peak of $1.3668 per euro (€0.7316 per $) as the US dollar fell against all major currencies. At that time, some analysts expected the dollar to continue to fall, a few even suggesting $1.60 per euro by the end of 2005, fuelled by the so called twin deficit of the US accounts. However, the dollar recovered in 2005, rising to $1.18 per euro (€0.85 per $) in July 2005 (and stable throughout the second half of 2005). The fast increase in US interest rates during 2005 had much to do with this trend.

===Currencies pegged to the euro===

{{main|Currencies related to the euro}}

There are a number of foreign currencies that were pegged to a European currency and are now currencies related to the euro:  the [[Cape Verdean escudo]], the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark]], the [[CFP franc]], the [[CFA franc]] and the [[Comorian franc]].
 
In total, the euro is the official currency in 15 states and territories outside the European Union. In addition, 22 states and territories have a national currency that are directly pegged to the euro including fourteen West African countries, three French Pacific territories, two African island countries and three Balkan countries.

===Drivers=== 

Part of the euro's strength in the period 2001-2004 was thought to be due to more attractive [[interest]] rates in Europe than in the United States. The US [[Federal Reserve]] had maintained lower rates than the [[European Central Bank|ECB]] for these years, despite key European economies, notably Germany, growing relatively slowly or not at all. This is attributed in part to the ECB's duty to check inflation across the eurozone, which in high-performing countries such as [[Republic of Ireland]] is above the ECB's target.  

However, although the interest rate differential formed part of the backdrop, the main ''a posteriori'' justification for the euro's continuing ascent against the dollar was the concern over the huge unsustainable US [[current account]] [[deficit]]s. The market has been awash with concerns about the US [[twin deficit]]s, which have been a key driver of dollar weakness. The US [[budget deficit]] is about $427 [[billion]], or 3.7% of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), while the current account&amp;mdash;the broadest trade measure since it adds investment flows&amp;mdash;hit a record $166.18bn shortfall in the second quarter of 2004.

A key factor is that a number of Asian currencies are rising less against the dollar than is the euro. In the case of China, the [[renminbi]] was until recently pegged against the dollar, whilst the Japanese [[yen]] is supported by intervention (and the threat of it) by the [[Bank of Japan]]. This means much of the pressure from a falling dollar is translated into a rising euro.

The euro's climb from its lows began shortly after it was introduced as a cash currency.  In the time between 1999 and 2002, [[euroscepticism|eurosceptics]] believed that the weak euro was a sign that the euro experiment was doomed to fail.  It may be that its weakness in this period was due to low confidence in a currency that did not exist in &quot;real&quot; form. While the overt conversion to notes and coins had not yet occurred, it remained possible that the project could fail. Once the euro became &quot;real&quot; in the sense of existing in the form of cash, confidence in the euro rose and the increasing perception that it was here to stay helped increase its value. This effect was probably significant in the euro's decline and recovery between 1999 and 2002, but other factors are more significant since then. 

Another factor in the early decline of the euro was that many investors and [[central banks]] sold large portions of their legacy (national) currency holdings once the irrevocable exchange rates were set, as the goal of holding multiple currencies is to dampen losses when one currency falls. Once the exchange rates between eurozone countries were pegged against each other, holdings in German [[German mark|marks]] and French [[French franc|francs]] (for example) became identical. There is also some reason to believe that significant sums of illegally held money were sold for dollars to avoid an official and public exchange for euros.{{citationneeded}}

===Consequences===

Despite the euro's rise in dollar-denominated value, as well as those of other major and minor currencies, the US trade deficits continue to rise.  Economic theory would suggest that a fall in the dollar and a rise in the euro should lead to an improvement in US exports and a decline in US imports, as the former becomes cheaper and the latter more expensive. However, this depends to some extent on how currency costs are passed down the supply chain. Furthermore, the declining dollar makes foreign investment in the US cheaper (although also reducing the return), so that continuing foreign investment may underpin the dollar to some extent.

The role of the dollar as the world's [[de facto]] reserve currency helps support both the dollar and the US budget deficit &amp;mdash; but it depends on the continued willingness of foreigners to finance both. Central banks and others finance the budget by acquiring newly-issued, dollar-denominated US government bonds, which they need to acquire dollars for. If at some point foreigners become unwilling to accept new bonds at the prevailing interest rate (perhaps because the falling dollar is reducing the bonds' value too much), the dollar will fall even more &amp;mdash; or the US will have to raise interest rates, which would reduce economic growth.

There is speculation that the strength of the euro relative to the dollar might encourage the use of the euro as an alternative [[reserve currency]]; [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Iraq]] switched its currency reserves from dollars to euros in 2000. Moves by central banks with major reserve currency holdings such as those of [[India]] or [[China]] to switch some of their reserves from dollars to euros, or even of [[OPEC]] countries to switch the currency they trade in from dollars to euros, will further reinforce the dollar's decline. In 2004, the [[Bank for International Settlements]] reported the proportion of bank deposits held in euros rising to 20%, from 12% in 2001, and it is continuously rising. The falling dollar also raises returns for US investors from investing in foreign stocks, encouraging a switch which further depresses the dollar. 

The rise in the euro should dampen eurozone exports, but there is little sign of this happening yet. The main reason is that the currencies of Euroland's major world-wide customers are also seeing their currencies rise relative to the dollar.  As the current account deficits continue to rise and the US plans no austerity measures to curb foreign imports and increase exports, the situation may cause the US dollar to lose its position as a hegemonic currency replaced by either the euro or the euro and a basket of currencies.

Several [[linguistic]] issues have arisen in relation to the spelling of the words ''euro'' and ''cent'' in the many languages of the member states of the European Union, as well as in relation to [[grammar]] and the formation of [[plurals]]. Immutable word formations have been encouraged by the European Commission in usage with official EU [[legislation]] (originally in order to ensure uniform presentation on the banknotes), but the &quot;unofficial&quot; practice concerning the mutability (or not) of the words differs between the member states and their languages. The subject has led to much debate and controversy.  &lt;!-- advice to editors: this paragraph is intended to be just a summary.  If you wish to add material, please consider using the &quot;Linguistic issues&quot; article to do so.  --&gt;

{{Politics of the European Union}}

The '''European Central Bank (ECB)''' ([[French language|French]]: '''Banque Centrale Europeénne''', [[German language|German]]: '''Europäische Zentralbank''') 

The ECB is one of the world's largest [[central bank]]s, being in charge of [[fiscal policy|fiscal]] and [[monetary policy]] for the [[European Union]]'s offical currency, the [[euro]], which is - to date - used by over 300 million Europeans in 12 [[EU]] countries. 

The ECB was established on [[June 1]], [[1998]]. The headquarters are located in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]]. 



==Structure &amp; Organisation==

The organisation of the ECB is modelled on that of the [[Germany|German]] [[Bundesbank]] and [[Landesbank]]en.

The ECB is governed by a board of directors, headed by a President, and a board of governors, consisting of the members of the board of directors and representatives of the local central banks within the ESCB.

=== Tasks ===

=== European System of Central Banks ===
The [[European System of Central Banks]] (ESCB) is comprised of the European Central Bank (ECB), and the local [[central bank]]s of the 25 member-states of the [[European Union]]. Only governors from national banks inside the eurozone take part and are responsible for the decision process.

===Executive Board of Directors ===

The Executive Board consists of six members which are elaborating the strategies for the bank's policy. Four of these six seats are reserved for the Eurozone's four big central banks of France, Germany, Italy and Spain.

=== President of the European Central Bank ===

''Main Article: [[List of Presidents of the European Central Bank]]''

In [[1999]] [[Wim Duisenberg]], the former president of [[De Nederlandsche Bank]], and former finance minister of the Netherlands became the first president of the ECB. 

In November [[2003]] [[Jean-Claude Trichet]] followed and is still president today.

==Goals and Instruments==

The ECB hold reserves of over € 4.0 billion of which just over 30% are gold reserves of the [[Bundesbank]] and ca 20% from the [[Banque de France]].

==Economic Culture==
[[Image:La2-euro.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Night view of the [[Euro]] sculpture.]]
There are two main lines of criticism within the ECB. 

===Independence===
Critics focus on the independence of the institution.  The ECB was established as a [[central bank]] designed to operate independently of political intervention.  Its objectives and powers were politically established, but the decisions as to how those powers should best be used to achieve the objectives was left in the hands of the ECB itself. 

However, as many national banks in the EU are outside the eurozone and independent (the [[Danmarks Nationalbank]] or the [[Bank of England]] for instance), this argument could also apply to them.

Some see this independence as undemocratic and therefore criticise the decision making process and objectives of the ECB, asserting that the economic goals of the ECB are ''hard-wired'' to be secretive and independent from most citizens of the European Union, and to be isolated from [[feedback]] mechanisms regarding the influence of the money economy on [[human rights violation]]s or the natural [[natural environment|environment]]. 

The ECB does not publish or invite comments on its proposed decisions.  After publication of its actions and decisions, ECB web pages do not solicit direct comments by citizens.  It is thought that details of internal meetings are not made public in order not to reveal internal splits in the board of governors.

European citizens may influence the policy decisions of the ECB very indirectly via the formal, national [[democracy|democratic]] electoral process. However, even if changes in economic assumptions are expressed via formal [[democracy|democratic]] means, elected politicians have very little power to transmit these changes to the ECB.

Still, the ECB is accountable to the [[European Parliament]] and the council of ministers. It appoints the ECB president and vice-president and other members of the ECB's executive board. The nominees must be approved by Parliament first, and then by the council of ministers before they can assume their roles in the institution. 

Also, it is required by law for the ECB president to present an annual report to the plenary sitting of Parliament. Furthermore, the ECB president and other members of the executive board are present in the Parliament's monetary affairs committee who meet regularly. These meetings take place four times a year, but can be more frequent if any side would want to.

It is important to add that it is generally accepted by economists that the independence of the Central Bank is the best way to avoid selfish manipulation of the macroecomy for political purposes.

===Inflation targets===
Some critics feel that the objectives given to the ECB are inappropriate. The ECB sets interest rates in order to control inflation, but does not take into account objectives such as employment and [[exchange rate]] stability. Some feel this as a too narrow set of objectives, leading to decisions on interest rate that are inappropriate given the wider needs of the economy. 

Many British economists have stated that the ECB should adopt a symmetrical target rate, much like the one that the [[Bank of England]] follows.

The unusually low interest rates set by the ECB have been criticized as being inappropriate for regions of Europe with property bubbles. These low interest rates are a factor of the [[Irish Property Bubble]]. Although it must be said that it has an economic reason, to avoid [[recession]] in many important countries of the eurozone ([[France]], [[Germany]] and [[Italy]] mainly) that would slow the growth of the rest of the European countries.

==Trivia==

The current ECB building in Downtown Frankfurt is only its temporary home. The ECB ran a large international architecture competition in [[1999]] for a new tower in Frankfurt, Eastend. At present the winning design scheme of Vienna based architects [[Coop Himmelbau]] is under construction. ([http://www.ecb.int/ecb/premises/html/image29.en.html/ Winning design by Coop Himmelb(l)au for the ECB's new headquarters in Frankfurt/Main])

On [[January 5]], [[2003]], a man stole a small [[Glider|motor glider]] and flew it over downtown Frankfurt, circling [[skyscraper]]s and threatening to crash into the ECB. He landed safely after about two hours and was arrested. The man, a 31-year-old mentally disturbed German student named [[Franz Strambach]], told a television station he wanted to call attention to [[Judith Resnik]], a U.S. [[astronaut]] killed in the [[1986]] [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|explosion]] of the [[space shuttle]] ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[atomic physics]], an '''electron shell''', also know as a '''main energy level''', is a group of [[atomic orbital]]s with the same value of the [[principal quantum number]] ''n''. Electron shells are made up of one or more '''electron subshells''', or '''sublevels''', which have two or more orbitals with the same angular momentum quantum number ''l''. Electron shells make up the [[electron configuration]] of an [[atom]]. It can be shown that the number of [[electron]]s that can reside in a shell is equal to &lt;math&gt;2n^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The existence of electron shells was first observed experimentally in [[Charles Barkla]]'s and [[Henry Moseley]]'s [[X-ray]] absorption studies. Barkla labelled them with the letters ''K'', ''L'', ''M'', etc. (The origin of this terminology was alphabetic. K and L were originally called B and A, but were later renamed to leave room for hypothetical spectral lines that were never discovered.) These letters were later found to correspond to the ''n''-values 1, 2, 3, etc. They are used in the spectroscopic [[Siegbahn notation]]. 

The name for electron shells originates from the [[Bohr model]], in which groups of electrons were believed to orbit the nucleus at certain distances, so that their orbits formed &quot;shells&quot;.

=== Subshells ===

'''Electron subshells''' are identifie by some to mark the high point in the history of English-language encyclopedias.

A &amp; C Black moved to [[London]] in 1895. The ''Britannica'' later became associated with ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, and was sold in [[1901]].  The tenth edition of eleven volumes including map and index volumes was issued in effect as a large supplement to the ninth edition. The [[United States|American]] [[Horace Everett Hooper]] was publisher from [[1897]] to [[1922]]. From [[1909]], and for the eleventh edition, the publication became associated with the [[University of Cambridge]], in [[England]].

The substantially rewritten eleventh edition of [[1910]]&amp;ndash;[[1911]] is also a classic edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, but reflected the new goals of its new owners.  The edition balances scholarly accuracy and scope with a readability intended to gain a wider audience and increased sales, using less lengthy but still thorough articles.  Sometimes called the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]], this edition is available in the [[public domain]].  The 11th edition was the first edition to be published substantially at one time,  instead of volume by volume.  The complete text is [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/ online free] and has been used as the basis for many historical articles in Wikipedia. 

The [[trademark]] and publication rights were sold after the 11th edition to [[Sears Roebuck]] and it moved to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]]. The 12th and 13th editions each took the form of a three volume supplement or update, meant to be used in conjunction with the 11th edition.  The 14th edition of 1929 marked a major shift, with fewer volumes and shorter articles, meant to be more accessible as a reference to a wider range of readers.

Sears Roebuck offered the rights to the ''Britannica'' as a gift to the [[University of Chicago]] in 1941. [[William Benton]] figured as publisher from [[1943]] to his death in [[1973]], followed by his widow [[Helen Hemingway Benton]] until her own death in [[1974]].

In [[January 1996|January]] [[1996]], the ''Britannica'' was purchased by billionaire [[Switzerland|Swiss]] financier [[Jacob Safra]].

In [[October 2002|October]] [[2002]], ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' editor [[A.J. Jacobs]] set out to read all 33,000 pages of the ''Britannica''. He chronicled this quest for knowledge in the [[2004]] book ''The Know-It-All'' (see References below for full citation).

==CD-ROM edition and Britannica Online==
[[Image:Britannica.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Encyclopaedia Britannica 2005 Deluxe Edition [[CD-ROM]]]]
In the [[1980s]], [[Microsoft]] approached Britannica to collaborate on a [[CD-ROM]] encyclopedia. Britannica, feeling that they had control of the market and showing strong profits (sales of the complete ''Britannica'' were priced between US$1,500 and US$2,200), turned Microsoft down. Britannica's senior management viewed their product as a luxury brand with an impeccable reputation handed down from generation to generation. They did not believe that a CD-ROM could adequately compete or supplement their business. In turn, Microsoft used content from ''[[Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Encyclopedia]]'' to create what is now known as ''[[Encarta]]''. 

In [[1990]], Britannica's sales reached all-time high of US$650 million. But ''Encarta'', released in [[1993]], became a staple software with every computer purchase and Britannica's market share plummeted. Britannica countered by offering a [[CD-ROM]] version of their product, although a CD-ROM could not generate US$500 to US$600 in sales commissions as the print version did. Britannica decided on charging $995 for customers looking to purchase only the CD-ROM while at the same time bundling a free disc with the print version. Britannica hoped that including the CD-ROM would entice buyers to stay with the brand.

In [[1994]], Britannica launched an online version with subscriptions for sale for US$2000. By [[1996]], the cost of the CD-ROM had dropped to US$200. Sales had plummeted to US$325 million - about half their 1990 levels. Only 55,000 hard copy versions were sold in [[1994]], compared with 117,000 in [[1990]], and sales later fell to 20,000&lt;ref&gt;&quot;&lt;cite&gt;Sales plummeted from 100,000 a year to just 20,000.&lt;/cite&gt;&quot; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/40033.stm Encyclopaedia Britannica changes to survive]&lt;/ref&gt;. By the end of [[1996]], Britannica was in serious trouble and was purchased by Swiss financier [[Jacob Safra]] for a fraction of its book value - a mere US$135 million.  Since then Safra has introduced massive price-cutting measures in an effort to compete with ''Encarta'', even offering the entire reference free of charge for a time (around 18 months, from [[October 1999|October]] [[1999]] to [[March 2001|March]] [[2001]]) on the [[internet]].

Today, one of the biggest challenges to the ''Britannica'' is the ease with which people can find information online. Many people simply prefer to find information with the help of a search engine. A particular challenge to ''Britannica'' is the emergence of [[Wikipedia]] which has a size advantage over ''Britannica'' (1,000,000 articles compared to 120,000, and 340 million words compared to 55 million) and is free. However, despite its large size, Wikipedia does not deal with many of the topics contained within ''Britannica,'' and vice-versa. 
Other edges ''Britannica'' has over Wikipedia stem as a result of the former being a professionally-edited publication. In [[December 2005|December]] 2005, the scientific review ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published the result of a study of errors in science articles in the two encyclopedias. They found ''Britannica'' to average almost three serious errors per article. By comparison, Wikipedia contained close to four errors per article. Many ''Nature'' reviewers also commented that they found Wikipedia articles to be more difficult to read. Further, the study also found that there were many more factual untruths and misleading statements in Wikipedia of a less-important nature -- 162 versus 123 in ''Britannica''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/2005/051212/full/438900a.html news @ nature.com - special report]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current version==
[[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]] now owns a trademark on the word &quot;Britannica&quot;. As of [[2004]], the most complete version of ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' contains about 120,000 articles, with 55 million words, and a comprehensive index, the first of its kind for a major encyclopedia. It is published in paper form (31,550 pages in 32 volumes containing 65,000 articles, list price US$1400), online (120,000 articles, brief summaries of articles can be viewed for free, and the full text is available for US$11.95 per month or US$69.95 per year for individual subscribers), and on [[CD-ROM]] (more than 80,000 articles, US$30) or [[DVD|DVD-ROM]] (more than 100,000 articles, US$50). The single-volume ''Britannica Concise Encyclopedia'', consisting of 28,000 articles, is sold as a reference to the ''Encyclopædia Brittannica''. Britannica annually publishes a &quot;Book of the Year&quot; chronicling the year's events, also available online.

The current version of ''Britannica'' was written by over 4,000 contributors, including noted scholars such as [[Milton Friedman]], [[Carl Sagan]], and [[Michael DeBakey]]. Under the influence of the director of planning, [[Mortimer Adler]], the 15th edition, first published in 1974 and frequently reissued since, was published not as one alphabetical sequence of volumes as previously but in three parts that covered topics in different degrees of depth: a one-volume [[Propædia]] that provides a structured hierarchy to all the information in the set, a 10-volume [[Micropædia]] which contains short articles, a 19-volume [[Macropædia]] for longer articles. A two-volume index was added in 1985. Thirty-five percent of the content of the encyclopedia has been re-written within the last two years.

[[Dale Hoiberg]], a [[sinology|sinologist]], is the publication's current editor-in-chief. Among his predecessors were [[Hugh Chisholm]] ([[1903]]–[[1913]], [[1920]]–[[1924]]), [[James Louis Garvin]] ([[1926]]–[[1932]]), [[Franklin Henry Hooper]] ([[1932]]–[[1938]]), [[Walter Yust]] ([[1938]]–[[1960]]), [[Harry S. Ashmore]] ([[1960]]–[[1963]]), [[Warren E. Preece]] ([[1964]]–[[1975]]), and [[Robert McHenry]] ([[1992]]–[[1997]]). [[Ted Pappas]] is the current executive editor. Earlier holders of that position were [[John V. Dodge]] ([[1950]]–[[1964]]) and [[Philip W. Goetz]]. [[Don Yannias]], former [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of the company when it was in financial difficulties, serves on Britannica's [[Board of Directors]].

Among the members of an international editorial council planning a new (16th) edition are such notable figures as biologist [[David Baltimore]], cognitive scientist [[Donald Norman]], economist [[Amartya Sen]], philosopher [[Thomas Nagel]], and former Ecuadorian president [[Rosalía Arteaga]].

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ''Supplement to the fourth, fifth, and sixth editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. With preliminary dissertations on the history of the sciences.''

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;8th to 14th editions included a separate index volume.

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;9th ed. featured articles by notables of the day, such as [[James Clerk Maxwell|James Maxwell]] on [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]], and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (who became Lord Kelvin) on [[heat]].

&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;10th ed. included a maps volume and a cumulative index volume for the 9th and 10th edition volumes: ''the new volumes, constituting, in combination with the existing volumes of the 9th ed., the 10th ed. ... and also supplying a new, distinctive, and independent library of reference dealing with recent events and developments''

&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;''Vols. 30-32 ... the New volumes constituting, in combination with the twenty-nine volumes of the eleventh edition, the twelfth edition''

&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;This supplement replaced the previous supplement:  ''The three new supplementary volumes constituting, with the volumes of the latest standard edition, the thirteenth edition.''

&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; This edition was the first to be kept up to date by continual (usually annual) revision.

&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; The 15th edition (introduced as &quot;Britannica 3&quot;) was published as multiple sets: the 10-volume ''Micropædia'' (containing short articles and served as an index), the 19-volume ''Macropædia'', plus the ''Propædia'' (see text). 

&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;In 1985 the system was modified by removing the index function from the ''Micropædia'' and adding a separate two-volume index; the ''Macropædia'' articles were further consolidated into fewer, larger ones (for example, the previously separate articles about the 50 U.S. states were all included into the &quot;United States of America&quot; article), with some medium-length articles moved to the ''Micropædia''.

The first CD-ROM edition was issued in 1994. At that time also an online version was offered for paid subscription. In 1999 this was offered for free, and no revised print versions appeared. The experiment was ended, however, in 2001 and a new printed set was issued in 2002.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''endometrium''' is the inner uterine membrane in [[mammal]]s which is developed in preparation for the [[implantation]] of a [[fertilized]] egg upon its arrival into the [[uterus]].  It grows to be rich in glands and [[blood vessel]]s, which are eventually to be connected to by the [[pregnancy]], forming the [[placenta]] through which the [[embryo]], as it becomes a [[fetus]] and eventually gestates fully, receives [[oxygen]] and is nourished.

The endometrial lining undergoes cyclic regeneration. Most mammals are subject to an [[estrous cycle]] while humans and the great apes display the [[menstrual cycle]]. In either situation the endometrium proliferates initially under the influence of [[estrogen]]. Once [[ovulation]] occurs, in addition to estrogen the ovary will also start to produce [[progesterone]] and thereby change the '''proliferative''' pattern of the endometrium to a '''secretory''' lining. In time the secretory lining provides a hospitable environment to one or more fertilized eggs. If no fertilized egg is detected, the progesterone level drops and the endometrial lining is either reabsorbed (estrous cycle) or shed (menstrual cycle). In the latter, the process of shedding involves the breaking down of the lining, tearing small connective blood vessels, and the loss of the tissue and blood which had constituted it through the [[vagina]], over a series of days. This may be accompanied by some uterine contractions to help expel the '''menstrual''' endometrium. In case of implantation, however, the endometrial lining does not get absorbed or shed, but remains as '''[[decidua]]''', provides support and protection for the gestation, and becomes part of the placenta. 

If there is inadequate stimulation of the lining due to lack of hormones, the endometrium remains thin and inactive. In humans this will result in [[amenorrhea]]. The lining after the [[menopause]] is often described to be '''atrophic'''. In contrast, endometrium that is chronically exposed to estrogens, but not to progesterone, may become '''hyperplastic'''.

In humans, the cycle of building and shedding the endometrial lining is 28 days long on average, though it varies among individuals. The endometrium develops at different rates in different mammals. Its formation is sometimes affected by seasons, climate, stress and other factors. The endometrium itself produces certain [[hormone]]s at different points in the cycle affecting other portions of the [[reproductive system]].

More about the patterns of endometrial growth in different mammals can be found in the article about the [[estrous cycle]].
==Other==
Growth of the endometrium into the muscle layer of the uterus ([[myometrium]]) is seen in [[adenomyosis]].

Growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus is a pathological condition known as [[endometriosis]]. 

[[Endometrial cancer]] is the most common [[cancer]] of the human female genital tract.

'''Electronic music''' is a term for [[music]] created using [[electronics|electronic]] devices. As [http://www.ieee.org/organizations/eab/faqs1.htm defined] by the IEEE standards body, electronic devices are low-power systems and use components such as transistors and integrated circuits. Working from this definition, distinction can be made between instruments that produce sound through electromechanical means as opposed to instruments that produce sound using electronic components. Examples of an electromechanical instrument are the [[teleharmonium]], [[Hammond B3]], and the [[electric guitar]], whereas examples of an electronic instrument are a [[Theremin]], [[synthesizer]], and a computer.

== History ==

===Late 19th century early 20th century===

Before electronic music, there was a growing desire for composers to use emerging technologies for musical purposes. Several instruments were created that employed electromechanical designs and they paved the way for the later emergence of electronic instruments. An electromechanical instrument called the [[Teleharmonium]] (or Telharmonium) was developed by [[Thaddeus Cahill]] in [[1897]]. Simple inconvenience hindered the adoption of the Teleharmonium: the instrument weighed seven tons and was the size of a boxcar. The first electronic instrument is often viewed to be thexisting reporting and control relationships do not suffice, one can move towards a flat, accountable, and flexible [[organizational structure]], which may or may not aid coordination.
#Failure to obtain senior management commitment. This often results in a failure to gain sufficient corporate resources to accomplish a task. It may help to get top management involved right from the start.
#Failure to obtain employee commitment. If planners do not explain their strategy well to employees, or fail to give employees the whole picture, then training and setting up incentives for workers to embrace the strategy may assist.
#Under-estimation of time requirements. Setting up an e-commerce venture can take considerable time and money, and failure to understand the timing and sequencing of tasks can lead to significant cost overruns. Basic project planning, [[critical path]], [[critical chain]], or [[PERT]] analysis may mitigate such failings. [[Profit]]ability may have to wait for the achievement of [[market share]].
#Failure to follow a [[plan]]. Poor follow-through after the initial planning, and insufficient tracking of progress against a plan can result in problems. One may mitigate such problems with standard tools: benchmarking, milestones, variance tracking, and penalties and rewards for variances.
#Becoming the victim of [[organized crime]].  Many syndicates have caught on to the potential of the Internet as a new revenue stream.  Two main methods are as follows: (1) Using [[identity theft]] techniques like [[phishing]] to order expensive goods and bill them to some innocent person, then liquidating the goods for quick cash; (2) [[Extortion]] by using a network of compromised &quot;zombie&quot; computers to engage in [[Denial-of-service attack|distributed denial of service attacks]] against the target Web site until it starts paying protection money.

==Product suitability==
Certain products/services appear more suitable for online sales; others remain more suitable for offline sales. Many successful purely virtual companies deal with digital products, including information storage, retrieval, and modification, music, movies, education, communication, software, photography, and financial transactions. Examples of this type of company include: [[Google]], [[eBay]] and [[Paypal]]. 

Virtual marketers can sell some non-digital products and services successfully. Such products generally have a high value-to-weight ratio, they may involve embarrassing purchases, they may typically go to people in remote locations, and they may have shut-ins as their typical purchasers. Items which can fit through a standard [[letterbox]] - such as music CDs, DVDs and books - are particularly suitable for a virtual marketer, and indeed [[Amazon.com]], one of the few enduring [[dot-com]] companies, has historically concentrated on this field.

Products such as spare parts, both for consumer items like washing machines and for industrial equipment like centrifugal pumps, also seem good candidates for selling online. Retailers often need to order spare parts specially, since they  typically do not stock them at consumer outlets -- in such cases, e-commerce solutions in spares do not compete with retail stores, only with other ordering systems. A factor for success in this niche can consist of providing customers with exact, reliable information about which part number their particular version of a product needs, for example by providing parts lists keyed by serial number. 

Purchases of [[pornography]] and of other [[sex]]-related products and services fulfil the requirements of both virtuality (or if non-virtual, generally high-value) and potential embarrassment; unsurprisingly, provision of such services has become the most profitable segment of e-commerce.

Products unsuitable for e-commerce include products that have a low value-to-weight ratio, products that have a smell, taste, or touch component, products that need trial fittings - most notably clothing - and products where colour integrity appears important. Nonetheless, [[Tesco.com]] has had success delivering groceries in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], albeit that many of its goods are of a generic quality, and clothing sold through the internet is big business in the U.S.

==Acceptance of e-commerce==
[[Consumer]]s have accepted the e-commerce business model less readily than its proponents originally expected. Even in product categories suitable for e-commerce, electronic shopping has developed only slowly. Several reasons might account for the slow uptake, including:
* Concerns about [[security]].  Many people will not use [[credit card]]s over the Internet due to concerns about theft and [[credit card fraud]]. 
* Lack of instant gratification with most e-purchases (non-digital purchases). Much of a consumer's reward for purchasing a product lies in the instant gratification of using and displaying that product. This reward does not exist when one's purchase does not arrive for days or weeks.  
* The problem of access to web commerce, particularly for poor households and for developing countries. Low [[diffusion (business) | penetration rates]] of Internet access in some [[sector]]s greatly reduces the potential for e-commerce. 
* The social aspect of [[shopping]]. Some people enjoy talking to sales staff, to other shoppers, or to their cohorts: this social reward side of [[retail therapy]] does not exist to the same extent in [[Online Shop|online shopping]].

[[image:Euler's formula.png|thumb|right|360px]]

'''Euler's formula''', named after [[Leonhard Euler]] (pronounced ''oiler''), is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] formula in the subfield of [[complex analysis]] that shows a deep relationship between the [[trigonometric functions]] and the [[exponential function|complex exponential function]].  ([[Euler's identity]] is a special case of the Euler formula).

Euler's formula states that, for any [[real number]] ''x'',

: &lt;math&gt;e^{ix} = \cos x + i\sin x \!&lt;/math&gt;

where

:''&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[e (mathematical constant)|base of the natural logarithm]]

:''&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[imaginary unit]]

:&lt;math&gt;\sin&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\cos&lt;/math&gt; are  [[trigonometric function]]s.


[[Richard Feynman]] called Euler's formula &quot;our jewel&quot; and &quot;the most remarkable formula in mathematics&quot; (Feynman, p. 22-10).


==History==

Euler's formula was proved (in an obscured form) for the first time by [[Roger Cotes]] in [[1714]], then rediscovered and popularized by Euler in [[1748]].  Neither of these men saw the geometrical interpretation of the formula: the view of complex numbers as points in the plane arose only some 50 years later (see [[Caspar Wessel]]).

== Applications in complex number theory ==

This formula can be interpreted as saying that the function ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''ix''&lt;/sup&gt; traces out the unit circle in the [[complex number|complex number plane]] as ''x'' ranges through the real numbers.  Here, ''x'' is the [[angle]] that a line connecting the origin with a point on the unit circle makes with the positive real axis, measured counter clockwise and in radians. The formula is valid only if sin and cos take their arguments in radians rather than in degrees. 

The proof is based on the [[Taylor series]] expansions of the [[exponential function]] ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''z''&lt;/sup&gt; (where ''z'' is a complex number) and of sin ''x''  and cos ''x'' for real numbers ''x'' (see below). In fact, the same proof shows that Euler's formula is even valid for all ''complex'' numbers ''x''.

Euler's formula can be used to represent complex numbers in [[coordinates (elementary mathematics)|polar coordinates]].  For any complex number ''z'', we have the following relationships:

:&lt;math&gt; z = x + iy = Ae^{i\phi} \!&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt; x = \mathrm{Re}\{z\} \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y = \mathrm{Im}\{z\} \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; A = |z| \!&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; \phi = \angle z \!&lt;/math&gt;

The formula also provides a definition for the [[natural logarithm]] of complex arguments:

:&lt;math&gt;\ln(z) = \ln(Ae^{i\phi}) = \ln(A) + \ln(e^{i\phi}) = \ln(A) + i\phi \!&lt;/math&gt;  

for ''z''&amp;ne;0. Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Re} \{ \ln(z) \} = \ln(A) = \ln(|z|) \!&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Im} \{ \ln(z) \} = \phi = \angle z \!&lt;/math&gt;

By using the exponential laws 
: &lt;math&gt;e^{a + b} = e^a \cdot e^{b}&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;(e^a)^b = e^{a b} \,&lt;/math&gt;
(which are valid for all complex numbers ''a'' and ''b''), one can also readily derive several [[trigonometric identity|trigonometric identities]] as well as [[de Moivres formula|de Moivre's formula]].

==Relationship to trigonometry==

Euler's formula provides a powerful connection between [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[trigonometry]], and provides an interpretation of the sine and cosine functions as weighted sums of the exponential function:

: &lt;math&gt;\cos x = {e^{ix} + e^{-ix} \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\sin x = {e^{ix} - e^{-ix} \over 2i}&lt;/math&gt;

The two equations above can be derived by adding or subtracting Euler's formulas:
: &lt;math&gt;e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x \;&lt;/math&gt;  
: &lt;math&gt;e^{-ix} = \cos x - i \sin x \;&lt;/math&gt;
and solving for either cosine or sine.

These formulas can even serve as the definition of the trigonometric functions for complex arguments ''x''.  For example, letting ''x'' = ''iy'', we have:

:&lt;math&gt; \cos(iy) =  {e^{-y} + e^{y} \over 2} = \cosh(y) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \sin(iy) =  {e^{-y} - e^{y} \over 2i} = i \sinh(y) &lt;/math&gt;

==Relationship to the hyperbolic functions==
A second version of Euler's formula involves [[hyperbolic functions]], but it is a simple repetition of an identity used with real numbers.

: &lt;math&gt;e^{ix} = \cosh(i x) + \sinh(i x) \;&lt;/math&gt;

The formulae above can be used to relate the [[hyperbolic sine]] and [[hyperbolic cosine]] functions to the usual trigonometric functions and can likewise be proven using Taylor Series. 

: &lt;math&gt;\cos x = \cosh(i x) \;&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;i \sin x = \sinh(i x) \;&lt;/math&gt;

==Other applications==
In [[differential equations]], the function ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''ix''&lt;/sup&gt; is often used to simplify derivations, even if the final answer is a real function involving sine and cosine.  [[Euler's identity]] is an easy consequence of Euler's formula.

In [[electrical engineering]] and other fields, signals that vary periodically over time are often described as a combination of sine and cosine functions (see [[Fourier analysis]]), and these are more conveniently expressed as the real part of exponential functions with [[imaginary number|imaginary]] exponents, using Euler's formula.

==Proofs==

===Using Taylor series===
Here is a proof of Euler's formula using [[Taylor series]] expansions
as well as basic facts about the powers of ''i'':

: &lt;math&gt;i^0=1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;i^1=i \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;i^2=-1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;i^3=-i \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;i^4=1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;i^5=i \,&lt;/math&gt;

and so on. The functions ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, cos(''x'') and sin(''x'') (assuming ''x'' is [[real number|real]]) can be written as:

: &lt;math&gt; e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \cos x = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \frac{x^6}{6!} + \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \sin x = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

and for complex ''z'' we ''define'' each of these function by the above series, replacing ''x'' with ''iz''. This is possible because the radius of convergence of each series is infinite. We then find that

: &lt;math&gt;e^{iz} = 1 + iz + \frac{(iz)^2}{2!} + \frac{(iz)^3}{3!} + \frac{(iz)^4}{4!} + \frac{(iz)^5}{5!} + \frac{(iz)^6}{6!} + \frac{(iz)^7}{7!} + \frac{(iz)^8}{8!} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;= 1 + iz - \frac{z^2}{2!} - \frac{iz^3}{3!} + \frac{z^4}{4!} + \frac{iz^5}{5!} - \frac{z^6}{6!} - \frac{iz^7}{7!} + \frac{z^8}{8!} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;= \left( 1 - \frac{z^2}{2!} + \frac{z^4}{4!} - \frac{z^6}{6!} + \frac{z^8}{8!} + \cdots \right) + i\left( z - \frac{z^3}{3!} + \frac{z^5}{5!} - \frac{z^7}{7!} + \cdots \right) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;= \cos (z) + i\sin (z) \,&lt;/math&gt;

The rearrangement of terms is justified because each series is absolutely convergent. Taking ''z'' = ''x'' to be a real number gives the original identity as Euler discovered it.

[[Q.E.D.]]

===Using calculus===
Define the complex number &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;z=\cos x + i\sin x \,&lt;/math&gt; (ignoring the modulus term, as this cancels later)
Differentiating &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dz}{dx}=-\sin x + i\cos x&lt;/math&gt;
Using the fact that ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = -1:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dz}{dx}=i^2\sin x + i\cos x=i(\cos x + i\sin x)=iz&lt;/math&gt;
Separating variables and integrating both sides:
:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{z}\,dz=\int i\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ln z=ix + C\,&lt;/math&gt;
where 

:&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the constant of integration. 

To finish the proof we have to argue that &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is zero. This is easily done by substituting &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\ln z = C\,&lt;/math&gt;
But &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is just equal to:
:&lt;math&gt;z = \cos x + i\sin x = \cos 0 + i \sin 0 = 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
thus
:&lt;math&gt;\ln 1 = C \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
So now we just exponentiate
:&lt;math&gt;\ln z = ix \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e^{\ln z} = e^{ix} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z = e^{ix} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e^{ix} = \cos x + i\sin x \,&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Eductor-[[jet]] [[pumps]]''' are useful for draining areas which may contain [[volatile]] fluids (which could ignite if exposed to the workings of a standard electric or [[internal combustion]] powered pump) or high levels of debris (which could damage screws or blades in conventional pump designs).  

A source of pressurized fluid (eg, a firehose) is connected to a chamber which is open on one end, and leads to an exhaust hose on the other end.  The pressurized fluid is forced through [[nozzle]]s (called eductor jets) mounted axially on the inside of the pump chamber, pointed in the direction of the exhaust hose.  The passage of the pressurized fluid through the chamber and into the exhaust hose creates a suction on the open end of the chamber ([[Venturi]] effect), such that any fluid the pump chamber has been submerged in will be drawn into the chamber and thence into the exhaust hose along with the fluid from the eductor jet nozzles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Manet-Nadar.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Édouard Manet (portrait by [[Nadar]])]]
'''Édouard Manet''' ([[January 23]], [[1832]] &amp;ndash; [[April 30]], [[1883]]) was a [[France|French]] painter.  One of the first [[19th century]] artists to approach modern-life subjects, his art bridged the gap between [[realism (arts)|Realism]] and [[Impressionism|Impressionism]]. 


== Early life ==

Édouard Manet was born in [[Paris]]. His mother, Eugénie-Desirée Fournier, was the goddaughter of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] crown prince, Charles Bernadotte from whom the current Swedish monarchs are descended, and his father, Auguste Manet, was a French judge. His father wanted him to also pursue a career in law, but he wanted a career in the arts. His uncle, Charles Fournier, encouraged him to pursue painting and often took young Manet to the [[Louvre]]. 

From [[1850]] to [[1856]], after failing the examination to join the navy, Manet studied under academic painter [[Thomas Couture]]. In his spare time he copied the [[Old Master|old masters]] in the Louvre.  He visited [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]], during which time he absorbed the influences of the Dutch painter [[Frans Hals]], and the Spanish artists [[Diego Velázquez]] and [[Francisco Goya|Francisco José de Goya]]. 

Manet, in imitation of the then current style of [[realism (arts)|realism]] initiated by [[Gustave Courbet]], painted everyday subjects like beggars, cafés, bullfights, and other events and scenery. He produced very few religious, mythological, or historical paintings.

== Music in the Tuileries ==

[[Image:Edouard Manet 036.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Music in the Tuileries]]

Manet painted a picture of people he knew enjoying themselves in the Tuileries Gardens. ''Music in the Tuileries'' was a painting of the sort of lifestyle which he enjoyed; music, conversation, dancing and fun. While the picture has been regarded as not very well finished by some, the atmosphere created gives the viewer a sense of what it would be like in the Tuileries gardens at the time; the music which would be playing, the conversation and the sounds of glasses clinking. The senses are very much a part of this work. The work includes a self-portrait. The painting shows people he knew personally; artists, authors and musicians. He based the work on a series of sketches which he did when he visited the Tuileries gardens and did sketches of people relaxing and playing.

''This article covers the general information on the topic. For information about the EMU of the [[European Union]] see [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|here]].''

An '''economic and monetary union''' is a [[single market]] with a common currency. It is to be distinguished from a mere [[currency union]] (e.g. the [[Latin Monetary Union]] in the 1800s), which does not involve a single market. 

This is the fifth stage of [[economic integration]].

EMU is established through a currency-related [[trade pact]].

== List of Economic and Monetary Unions ==

===Current===
* The [[Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union]] has been in place since [[1921]], though has largely been subsumed by [[Benelux]] and the [[Eurozone]].

* The largest economic and monetary union at present is the [[Eurozone]].  The Eurozone consists of the [[European Union]] [[European Union member states|member states]] that have completed the third stage of the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|EMU]] and have adopted the [[Euro]] plus some [[Eurozone#Nations with formal agreements with the EU|non-EU members]].

===Proposed===
* Economic and monetary union of the [[Caribbean Community]]
* Economic and monetary union of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS)
* Economic and monetary union of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] (GCC), due in 2010
* Economic and monetary union of the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), due in 2016
* Economic and monetary union of the [[South American Community of Nations]] (CSN), due in 2019
* Economic and monetary union of the [[African Economic Community]] (AEC), due in 2028

'''European Environment Agency''' (EEA), agency of the [[European Union]] devoted to establishing a monitoring network for the monitoring of the European environment. It is governed by a Management Board composed of representatives of the governments of member states, a [[European Commission]] representative and two scientists appointed by the [[European Parliament]], assisted by a committee of scientists.

It was established by EEC Regulation 1210/1990, as amended by EEC Regulation 933/1999; and became operational in [[1994]]. It is headquartered in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].

As a EU body, member states of the European Union are automatically members; however the Council Regulation establishing it provided that other states may become members of it by means of agreements concluded between them and the [[European Community]]. 

[[As of 2004]] it has 31 members. It was the first EU body to open its membership to the 13 candidate countries (pre-[[enlargement of the EU|2004 enlargement]]). As of 2004 membership is:
* 25 EU member states
* EEA members ([[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Liechtenstein]])
* Candidate countries: [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], [[Turkey]].
Negotiations on membership are in progress with [[Switzerland]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Erlang''' is a general-purpose [[concurrent programming language]] and
[[runtime]] system.  The sequential subset of Erlang is a [[functional language]], with [[strict evaluation]], [[single assignment]], and [[dynamic typing]]. It was designed in the company [[Ericsson]] to support
distributed, fault-tolerant, soft-[[real-time]], non-stop applications.  It supports [[hot swapping]] so code can be changed without stopping a system.  Erlang was originally a proprietary language within Ericsson, but was released as [[open source]] in 1998.  The Ericsson implementation is primarily interpreted, but also includes a compiler called HiPE (not supported on all platforms).

Creating and managing processes is trivial in Erlang, whereas [[threads]] are considered a complicated and error prone topic in most languages.

Erlang is named after [[Agner Krarup Erlang|A. K. Erlang]]. It is sometimes thought that its name is an abbreviation of '''ER'''icsson '''LANG'''uage, owing to its heavy use inside Ericsson. According to Bjarne Däcker who headed the Computer Science Lab at the time, this duality is intentional.

==Functional language==

Code looks like this:

 '''-module'''(fact).
 '''-export'''([fac/1]).
 
 fac(0) -&gt; 1;
 fac(N) '''when''' N &gt; 0 -&gt; N * fac(N-1).

Below is an implementation of a [[Quicksort]] algorithm.

 ''%% quicksort:qsort(List)''
 ''%% Sort a list of items''
 '''-module'''(quicksort).
 '''-export'''([qsort/1]).
 
 qsort([]) -&gt; [];
 qsort([Pivot|Rest]) -&gt;
     qsort([ X || X &lt;- Rest, X &lt; Pivot]) ++ [Pivot] ++ qsort([ Y || Y &lt;- Rest, Y &gt;= Pivot]).

The above example recursively calls the function &lt;code&gt;qsort&lt;/code&gt; until there is no more to be sorted. The expression &lt;code&gt;[ X || X &lt;- Rest, X &lt; Pivot]&lt;/code&gt; can be read as &quot;Choose all &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; is a member of &lt;code&gt;Rest&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; is less than &lt;code&gt;Pivot&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, resulting in a very easy way of handling Lists. Since you can evaluate any boolean expression between two different datatypes, the evaluation is straightforward: for example, &lt;code&gt;1 &lt; a&lt;/code&gt; will return &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.

However, a compare function can be used if the order on which Erlang bases its return value (&lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;) needs to be changed. For example, if we would want an ordered list where &lt;code&gt;a &lt; 1&lt;/code&gt; evaluates &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.

The following code would sort lists according to length:

 '''-module'''(listsort).
 '''-export'''([by_length/1]).
 
 by_length(Lists) -&gt;
     F = fun(A,B) when is_list(A), is_list(B) -&gt;
             length(A) &lt; length(B)
         end,
     qsort(Lists, F).
 
  qsort([], _) -&gt; [];
  qsort([Pivot|Rest], Smaller) -&gt;
      qsort([ X || X &lt;- Rest, Smaller(X, Pivot)], Smaller)
      ++ [Pivot] ++
      qsort([ Y || Y &lt;- Rest, not(Smaller(Y, Pivot))], Smaller).

==Concurrency and distribution oriented language==
The main strength of Erlang is support for [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]]. It has small but powerful set of primitives to create processes and communicate between them.  The process model is based on [[C.A.R. Hoare]]'s [[Communicating Sequential Processes]]. Processes are primary means to structure the application and very large number of them can be created without performance degradation (a benchmark with 20 millions processes was tried [http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.functional/msg/33b7a62afb727a4f?dmode=source]).

There is also built-in support for distributed processes. Processes may be created on remote nodes,
and communication with them is transparent (i.e. the communication with remote processes is done
exactly as the communication with local processes).

Code examples:
  Pid = '''spawn'''(Mod, Func, Args)       ''% execute function Func as new process''
  Pid = '''spawn'''(Node, Mod, Func, Args) ''% execute function Func in remote node Node''

  Pid ! a_message      ''% send message to the process (asynchronously)''

  '''receive'''       ''% receive message sent to this process''
    a_message -&gt; do_something
  '''end'''.

Concurrency supports primary method of error-handling in Erlang.  When a process crashes, it neatly exits and sends a message to the controlling process who can take action. This way of error handling may increase maintainability and reduce complexity of code.

==Distribution==
Erlang was released by Ericsson as open-source to ensure its independence from a single vendor and to increase awareness of the language. Distribution of the language together with libraries and real-time distributed database (''Mnesia'') is known as the ''[[Open Telecom Platform]]'', or OTP. Ericsson and a few other companies offer commercial support for Erlang.

Since taking the open-source path in [[1998]], it became used by several companies world-wide, including [[Nortel Networks|Nortel]] and [[T-Mobile]]. However, it hasn't yet become a wide-spread mainstream programming language.

[[As of 2005]], Erlang is under active development with regular releases. It is available for several [[Unix-like]] operating systems and [[Microsoft Windows]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Euphoria''' is an interpreted [[programming language]] conceived and created by Robert Craig of Rapid Deployment Software.

==Introduction==
Developed as a personal project to invent a programming language from scratch, Euphoria's first incarnation was created by Robert Craig on an Atari Mega-ST.
The current release is version 2.5 (March 8, 2005) for Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and MS-DOS.

It was developed with the following '''design goals''' in mind:

#'''Simplicity''' - To be easier to learn and use than [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], with more-consistent high-level constructs. Uses flat-form 32-bit memory to avoid complicated memory management and size/addressing limits.
#'''Power''' - To provide low-level capabilities needed to access the OS and BIOS for professional development, but be more structured and less terse than a low-level language, making low-level programming less dangerous.
#'''Safety''' - Extensive debugging support and run-time error-handling; automatic subscript checking, type-checking, and memory handling.
#'''Flexibility''' - User-defined type support, with variables as loosely or strictly typed as desired. Object-oriented programming can be accomplished by defining objects as types (subsets of the sequence, which is a general-purpose collection).
#'''Ease of Development''' - Interpreted, with automatic memory management and [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]].
#'''Speed''' - To be fast enough to rival [[compiled language]]s for usefulness, despite being an [[interpreted language]]

The name &quot;Euphoria&quot; itself is an acronym for &quot;End-User Programming with Hierarchical Objects for Robust Interpreted Applications&quot;, although there is some suspicion that this is in fact a [[backronym]].

The first world-visible incarnation of the language was for the 32-bit [[DOS]] platform and was released in July of 1993. The original Atari version, to date, has not been released.

Current versions support 32-bit DOS, [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], and [[FreeBSD]]. There is also a translator to convert Euphoria code into [[C programming language|C]] for compilation to native [[machine code]] and what is known as the Binder, which binds the Euphoria source code to the interpreter to make an executable instead of machine compiling.

With the release of version 2.5 the Euphoria interpreter was split into two sections: the front-end parser and the back-end interpreter. The front-end is now written in Euphoria instead of C and was released as open source. The front-end is also used with the Euphoria-to-C translator and the Binder.

==What is it used for==
Euphoria was primarily used by hobbyists for utility and [[computer game]] programming, but has proven useful for fairly diverse purposes. The primary strength seems to be the ease of handling dynamic collections of data of various types, most useful when dealing with string processing and image processing, which can be quite difficult in many languages. It has been used in [[artificial intelligence]] experiments, the study of [[mathematics]], for teaching programming, and to implement fonts involving thousands of characters. Also, Euphoria has been proven to be useful as a language to do [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]] programing in.

Euphoria source code can be &quot;bound&quot; to the Euphoria run-time code 
to produce a stand-alone program for distribution. The code may also 
be &quot;shrouded&quot; to prevent others from viewing, copying, or changing the 
source.

You can also use the Euphoria-to-C translator to convert your Euphoria source code into [[C programming language|C]] source code and then compile it into [[machine language]]. Using this technique, you can create stand-alone programs as well as [[Library (computer science)#Dynamic linking|Windows DLL]] files.

==Data types==
Euphoria has just two ''basic'' data types:
;atom : These are numbers, implemented as either 31-bit [[integer]] or 64-bit [[IEEE floating-point standard|IEEE floating-point]], depending on the current value. Euphoria dynamically changes the implementation to the most efficient one for the data item's current value.
;sequence : [[Array|Vector]]s which can have zero or more elements; each element is either an '''atom''' or a '''sequence'''. The number of elements in a sequence is not fixed; the coder can add or remove elements as required during run-time. Euphoria automatically handles the allocation and deallocation of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]], and the [[garbage collection (computer science)|automatic garbage collection]] for you. Individual elements are referenced using an index value enclosed in square brackets. The first element in a sequence has an index of one [1]. Elements inside embedded sequences are referenced by additional bracked index values, thus X[3][2] refers to the second element contained in the sequence that is the third element of X.

Additionally, Euphoria has two ''specialized'' data types:
;integer : A special form of '''atom''', restricted to 31-bit [[integer]] values in the range -1073741824 to 1073741823. '''Integer''' data types are more efficient than the '''atom''' data types, but cannot contain the same range of values. Characters are stored as integers, eg coding [[ASCII]]-'A' is exactly the same as coding 65.
;object : A generic datatype that can contain any of the above, and can be changed during run-time. This means that if you have an object called X that is assigned the value 3.172, then later on you can assign it the value &quot;ABC&quot;. Note that in fact, each element of a '''sequence''' is actually an '''object'''.

There is no character [[string (computer science)|string]] data type, as these are represented by a '''sequence''' of '''integer''' values. However, because literal strings are so commonly used in programming, Euphoria interprets double-quote enclosed characters as a sequence of integers. Thus
 &lt;code&gt;&quot;ABC&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
is seen as if the coder had written:
 &lt;code&gt;{'A', 'B', 'C'}&lt;/code&gt;
which is the same as:
 &lt;code&gt;{65,66,67}&lt;/code&gt;

==Hello World==
  puts(1,&quot;Hello World!\n&quot;)

==Examples==
'''Note:''' Code comments start with a double dash &quot;--&quot; and go through the end of line. There are no multi-line comments.

As brief examples, the following code

 global function delete_item( object old, sequence group )
    integer pos
              -- Code begins --
    pos = find( old, group )
    if pos &gt; 0 then
        group = group[1..pos - 1] &amp; group[pos + 1..length( group )]
    end if
    return group
 end function

looks for an old item in a group of items. If found, it removes it by concatenating all the elements prior to it with all the elements after it. The result is then returned. Note that elements in sequences are 1-based indexed. This means that the first element has an index of 1. 

Simplicity is apparent in that the code clearly delineates its constructs with words. Instead of braces, semicolons, and question marks, you see phrases like 'if..then', 'end if', and 'end function'.

Flexibility is present; the item 'old' could be strings, numbers, images, or whole collections of data themselves. A different function for each data type isn't needed, nor does the programmer have to check the data types. This function will work with any sequence of data of any type, and requires no external libraries.

 global function replace_item( object old, object new, sequence group )
    integer pos
              -- Code begins --
    pos = find( old, group )
    if pos &gt; 0 then
        group[pos] = new
    end if
    return group
 end function

Safety is present due to the fact that there are no pointers involved and subscripts are automatically checked. Thus the function cannot access memory out-of-bounds, and cannot go beyond the end of the sequence or before the beginning of it to corrupt the memory. There is no need to explicitly allocate or deallocate memory, and no chance of a leak.

The line

 &lt;code&gt;group = group[1..pos - 1] &amp; group[pos + 1..length( group )]&lt;/code&gt;

shows some of the '''sequence''' handling facilities. A '''sequence''' can contain a collection of any types, and this can be sliced (to take a subset of the data in a '''sequence''') and concatenated in expressions, with no need for special functions.

Version 2.5 introduces the new '$' symbol, which is used for &quot;length(sequence).&quot; So, the above example could be written in 2.5 as follows:

 &lt;code&gt;group = group[1..pos - 1] &amp; group[pos + 1..$]&lt;/code&gt;

==Parameter passing==
Another fent contracts, or other such favorable arrangements with government(s) (see ''[[crony capitalism]]'' and ''[[corporate welfare]]''). The market entrepreneur operates without special favors from government.

==Typical characteristics of entrepreneurship==

* There is a [[leader]], the entrepreneur, who is the driving force behind economic events.
* Inside the mind of this entrepreneur is a vision of a future state that is preferred to the present state.
* Through a semiconscious process of intuition and insight, rooted in experience, the entrepreneur develops this vision and a strategy of how to implement it.
* This vision is promoted diligently and passionately by the entrepreneur. The job for many provides a feeling of being &quot;alive&quot; or the satisfaction of serving society.
* The strategy is deliberate and the overall vision is clear, however details may be malleable, incomplete, and emergent.
* Entrepreneurial strategies tend to go along with simple centralised organisational structures that respond quickly to the entrepreneur's directives.
* Entrepreneurial strategies tend to be used in niche markets that have not been noticed by the large industry leaders.

The above list presents several ideas as to why someone becomes an entrepreneur, some of which belong to the so-called ''psychological theories'' of entrepreneurship, which basically suggests that there are a number of psychological traits possessed by ''the entrepreneur'' which allow him or her to undertake such a task. Other points of the list belong to the ''neoclassical equilibrium theories'', that assume that markets are made up of maximising agents (see [[economics]]) and that there are no unnoticed business opportunities and that only the people who ''choose'' to become entrepreneurs do so - not because the opportunities themselves haven't been noticed by anyone else. The third school of thought is the ''Austrian theories''-school that claims business opportunities arise due to the fact that not everyone has the same amount of information and thus are not equipped to &quot;see&quot; the opportunities. For more about entrepreneurial opportunities from an academic standpoint, see for example the works of Scott A. Shane and Jonathan T. Eckhardt.

==Community entrepreneurship==

Community entrepreneurship is entrepreneurial education. Educational systems must be as concerned with family and community health as they are with individual students in classrooms and the health of the educational system itself. 

Too often entrepreneurship is seen as the process of finding capable individuals and providing nourishment (venture capital and know-how). Yet we know that some communities are far more successful than others in entrepreneurship and that such communities are also thriving economically even during times of economic downturn (Florida, 2002). We know that there are social entrepreneurs who invent new cultural systems, from the John Muir's work which led to the U.S. Park System to Florence Nightingale's fight for better patient conditions led to the field of nursing. Community entrepreneurship is about applying entrepreneurial principles to the process of creating a community that is highly supportive of entrepreneurship itself, both within classroom walls and without. We need new social entrepreneurs to invent those designs.

Community entrepreneurship seeks answers to related questions and seeks further related questions. 

What are the characteristics of communities that best support entrepreneurship? What measurements can we take to better make comparisons? What needs to be done to better address these factors in public school crriculum? How does the need for entrepreneurial inventiveness and creativity get supported with inventive and creative attitudes and skills in the schools? How much of the gifted and talented curriculum agenda is directly related to the needs and skills of entrepreneurs? How does the growth of creativity in the classroom lead to the growth of a creative (entrepreneurial) class? Given the strong digital foundation of the modern economy, how do computer literacy skills contribute? How is the heterarachical decentralized nature of Internet enterprise changing the nature of economic activity? What aspects of this digital economy need digital entrepreneurial skills? How should school curriculum weave computer literacy, creativity and entrepreneurship across the grade levels?

The '''evolutionary tree''' of living things is currently supposed to run something along the lines of that listed below. Most of the tree was based on ideas from [[cladistics]]; where more than two groups are shown in a single branch, there is disagreement about how they diverged.  Hypothetically [[taxonomy]] would follow the tree whenever possible, but in many places it does not at present.

The description as a &quot;tree&quot; results from earlier ideas of life as a progression from lower to higher forms. Although such views are discredited now, the imagery is too well established to be readily lost.

'''Erin Brockovich-Ellis''' (born [[June 22]] [[1960]]) is a woman who, despite the lack of a formal law school education, in 1993 was instrumental in  constructing a case against the [[United States dollar|US$]] 30 billion [[Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company]] (PG&amp;E), of [[California]], alleging contamination of drinking water with [[hexavalent chromium]] in the southern California town of [[Hinkley, California|Hinkley]]. At the center of the case is a facility called the Hinkley Compressor Station, part of a natural gas pipeline connecting to the San Francisco Bay Area and constructed in 1952. The case was settled in 1996 for $333 million, the largest settlement ever paid in a [[class action lawsuit]] in [[United States|U.S.]] history.

Continuing to work with the [[Thousand Oaks, California]]-based lawyer [[Ed Masry]], she went on to participate in other anti-pollution lawsuits. One accuses [[Whitman Corp.]] of chromium contamination in [[Willits, California]], and another with 1200 plaintiffs alleges contamination near PG&amp;E's Kettleman Hills Compressor Station in [[Kings County, California|Kings County]]. (The facility is located along the same pipeline as the Hinkley site.) 

After experiencing problems with mold contamination in her own home in the [[Conejo Valley]], Brockovich became a prominent activist and educator in this area as well.  Today, Brockovich is a noted speaker in demand all over the U.S.

Brockovich was born '''Erin L.E. Pattee''' and raised in [[Lawrence, Kansas]], and attended [[Kansas State University]] in [[Manhattan, Kansas]]. She has lived in California since 1982.

Her story is the topic of a feature film, ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]'', with [[Julia Roberts]] starring as Erin Brockovich. The film became very sucessful, and was nominated for many [[Academy Award]]s including the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. Also, [[Julia Roberts]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her portrayal of Erin Brockovich.

'''''Event Horizon''''' is a [[1997]] [[science fiction]] and [[horror film]].  It was directed by [[Paul W. S. Anderson]], written by [[Philip Eisner]], and stars [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Sam Neill]], and [[Joely Richardson]].

== Plot summary ==
{{spoiler}}
In the year [[2047]], a rescue crew (on board the ship ''Lewis and Clark'') investigates the miraculous re-appearance of the spaceship (the ''Event Horizon'') that was supposedly destroyed in a disaster seven years earlier.  As they embark on this mission, they are informed by the ship's designer of the true story behind this &quot;accident.&quot;  It had in fact not exploded, as was reported, but had been a [[top secret]] ship designed to travel faster than the [[speed of light]].  It had a gravity drive on board which created an artificial [[black hole]] that &quot;folded space time&quot; thus creating a temporary gateway to any other point in the universe, instantaneously.  To test the new gravity drive, the ship was sent to a designated jump-point with the goal of reaching [[Proxima Centauri]] (a star relatively close to the [[Sol|Sun]]) and had then vanished.  When they board the ship, they discover the truth about its disappearance and come to realize that it had brought back something absolutely horrifying from where it had been for those last seven years.

It turns out that the ship did indeed succeed in opening a gateway in [[space-time]] by using the gravity drive.  However, when it made the jump, it passed outside the known universe and into another dimension; a &quot;dimension of pure chaos, pure [[evil]].&quot;  This dimension is seen as analogous to the Judeo-Christian [[Hell]].  On inspection, the ship's log shows the original crew engaging the gravity drive and moments later, committing an [[orgy]] of [[torture]], [[cannibalism]], [[rape]], and depravity.  The captain of the original crew, who has by now torn out his own eyes, leaves an intially misinterpreted warning in [[Latin]] which, at first glance, appears to be ''Liberate me'' (&quot;Save me&quot;).  A clearer translation later reveals it to be ''Liberate tutamen ex inferis'' (&quot;Save yourself from Hell&quot;), evidence that he (at least) believed the ship had gone to Hell, literally.

==Rescue Mission==

In [[2047]], faint signals from the lost ''Event Horizon'' were picked up on [[Earth]], the ship had ended up on a low orbit around the planet [[Neptune]].  The rescue crew is assembled for a 9 month (56 day journey in sleep [[stasis]]) trip into deep space. 
[[Image:Eventstasis.jpg|thumb|left|215px|56 days to reach Neptune]]

When they reach Neptune’s high turbulent atmosphere, the ''Lewis &amp; Clark'''s detectors find no trace of human life onboard the floating ''Event Horizon'', instead it mysteriously seemed abandoned with strange life readings everywhere at the same time.  Assuming that the life scan is malfunctioning, they decide to try to find the crew by going onboard.  At the time the crew boards into the ship, there is zero gravity and cool temperatures.  After docking, Justin ([[Jack Noseworthy]]), the engineer, reaches the oval gravity drive (the heart of the ''Event Horizon'').  The gravity drive begins to activate, as if sensing his presence, and curiously, he sees a black liquid mirror in the gravity drive and touches it.  Suddenly, he is sucked into the mirror and a large [[shockwave]] flows throughout the ship, causing damage to the ''Lewis &amp; Clark'' which needs repair before it can make the return trip.  Cooper ([[Richard T. Jones]]) finally manages to pull Justin out of the liquid, but he was unconscious.  With the ''Lewis &amp; Clark'' heavily damaged, Captain Miller ([[Laurence Fishburne]]) has no choice but to lead the entire crew into the ''Event Horizon'' itself.  Although they succesfully reactivate [[life support]], heat, [[artificial gravity]], etc., the crew is now in danger themselves as they only have 20 hours worth of usable oxygen onboard the ''Event Horizon''.

Once onboard the ''Event Horizon'', the rescuers almost immediately begin to experience macabre visions exposing their inner demons and personal guilt.  Captain Miller (Fishburne) sees images of the comrade he was forced to leave behind in a fire; another person sees images of her son, whose legs are covered in sores.  Dr. William Weir ([[Sam Neill]]), the man who designed the ship, sees images of his deceased wife Claire who committed suicide, something which makes him feel intensely guilty (there is some indication that Weir's constant absence in their home due to his work contributed to her decision to cut her wrists and kill herself).  She urges him to &quot;join us&quot; so he can be reunited with her.  Upon exploring more of the ship, they find the bloody remains of some of the previous crew.  It eventually becomes clear that wherever the ship has been, it has brought back a presence with it which is methodically trying to drive these new arrivals [[insane]] by using their own personal torments against them.  The aim of this appears to be to compel them to re-engage the gravity drive and &quot;go back&quot; to Hell. 

[[Image:Eventdeadwife.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Dr. Weir's wife commits suicide]]

When Miller tells Weir that he plans to destroy the ship, the evil presence onboard delves into Weir's mind and manages to turn him completely and utterly demented.  The ship cruelly forces Weir to re-live Claire's horrific suicide, which finally drives him over the edge.  He, like the deceased captain before him, rips his eyes out and proudly announces &quot;where we're goingding flocks would be widely recognized as having complete expertise in the use and training of sheep dogs and the care of sheep. Another example from [[computer science]] is that an [[expert system]] may be taught by a human and thereafter considered an expert often outperforming human beings at particular tasks. In [[law]], an [[expert witness]] must be recognized by [[Logical argument|argument]] and [[authority]].

The term is widely used informally, with people being described as 'experts' in order to bolster the relative value of their opinion, when no [[objective]] criteria for their expertise is available. The term [[crank (person)|crank]] is likewise used to disparage opinions. [[Academic elitism]] arises when 'experts' become convinced that only they understand their field of study (or anything at all).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The economic outlook of '''[[Afghanistan]]'s Economy''' has improved significantly since [[2002]] due to the infusion of over $2 billion in international assistance, dramatic improvements in agricultural production, and the end of a four-year drought in most of the country. However, Afghanistan remains extremely poor, landlocked, and highly dependent on foreign aid, farming, and trade with neighboring countries. It is probable that it will take the remainder of the decade, continuing donor aid and attention to raise Afghanistan's living standards up from its current status among the lowest in the world. Much of the population continues to suffer from shortages of housing, clean water, electricity, medical care, and jobs, but the Afghan government and international donors have remained committed to improving access to these basic necessities by prioritizing infrastructure development, education, housing development, jobs programs, and economic reform over the year of [[2005]]. The replacement of the [[opium]] trade - which can account for one-third of the country's GDP - is one of several potential spoilers for the economy over the long term.

==Economic History== 
Historically, there has been a dearth of information and reliable statistics about Afghanistan's economy. The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] invasion and ensuing civil war destroyed much of the underdeveloped country's limited infrastructure and disrupted normal patterns of economic activity. Gross domestic product has fallen substantially since the [[1980s]] because of loss of labor and capital and disruption of trade and transport. Continuing internal strife hampered both domestic efforts at reconstruction as well as international aid efforts.

According to the [[International Monetary Fund]], the Afghan economy grew 20% in the [[fiscal year]] ending in March [[2004]], after expanding 30% in the previous 12 months. The growth is attributed to international aid and to the end of [[drought]]s. An estimated US$4.4 billion of aid entered the nation in 2004, about equal to the its [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. A GDP of US$4 billion in fiscal year [[2003]] was recalculated by the IMF to US$6.5 billion, after adding proceeds from [[opium]] products.

==Agriculture==
The Afghan economy continues to be overwhelmingly agricultural, despite the fact that only 12% of its total land area is arable and less than 6% currently is cultivated. Agricultural production is constrained by an almost total dependence on erratic winter snows and spring rains for water; irrigation is primitive. Relatively little use is made of machines, chemical fertilizer, or pesticides.

Grain production is Afghanistan's traditional agricultural mainstay. Overall agricultural production dramatically declined following 3 years of drought as well as the sustained fighting, instability in rural areas, and deteriorated infrastructure. Soviet efforts to disrupt production in resistance-dominated areas also contributed to this decline as did the disruption to transportation resulting from ongoing conflict.

The war against the Soviet Union and the ensuing civil war also led to migration to the cities and refugee flight to Pakistan and Iran, further disrupting normal agricultural production. Recent studies indicate that agricultural production and livestock numbers are only sufficient to feed about half of Afghanistan's population. Shortages are exacerbated by the country's already limited transportation network, which has deteriorated further due to damage and neglect resulting from war and the absence of an effective central government.

Opium became a source of cash for some Afghans, especially following the breakdown in central authority after the Soviet withdrawal. Opium-derived revenues constituted a major source of income for the two main factions. The [[Taliban]] earned roughly $40 million per year on opium taxes alone. Opium is easy to produce and transport and offers a quick source of income for impoverished Afghans. Afghanistan has been the world's largest producer of opium for most of the past decade. In [[2000]], the Taliban banned opium poppy cultivation in part to attract foreign aid and, allegedly, to control the opium market with large existing stockpiles that earned substantially large price increases. While cultivation of opium poppy was virtually eliminated in Taliban-controlled areas, drug trafficking has continued unabated. Later, in 2001, the Taliban reportedly announced that poppy cultivation could resume. Much of Afghanistan's opium production is refined into [[heroin]] and is either consumed by a growing regional addict population or exported, primarily to Western [[Europe]]. The current [[Afghanistan Interim Authority]] had began to enact major counter-narcotics policies and programs.

==Economic Stats (Illegal trade)==
According to research by the Afghan government and the [[United Nations]], presented [[December 11]], [[2005]], two million people (about 9% of the population) are engaged in [[illegal drug trade|illegal]] [[opium poppy|poppy]] cultivation, but the farmers receive less than 20% of the profit. Afghanistan produces 80% of the world’s opium. 

==Trade and Industry==
Trade accounts for a small portion of documented Afghan economy, and there are no reliable statistics relating to trade flows. In 1996, exports, not including opium, were estimated at $80 million and imports estimated at $150 million. Since the Soviet withdrawal and the collapse of the Soviet Union, other limited trade relationships are emerging with Central Asian states, Pakistan, Iran, the EU, and Japan. Afghanistan trades little with the United States. Afghanistan does not enjoy U.S. most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status, which was revoked in 1986.

Afghanistan is endowed with a wealth of natural resources, including extensive deposits of [[natural gas]], [[petroleum]], [[coal]], [[copper]], [[chromite]], [[talc]], [[barites]], [[sulfur]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[iron ore]], [[salt]], and precious and semiprecious stones. In the 1970s the Soviets estimated Afghanistan had as much as 142 km&amp;sup3; (5 trillion cubic feet) of natural gas, 15 million m&amp;sup3; (95 million barrels) of oil and condensate reserves, and 400 million tons of coal. Unfortunately, the country's continuing conflict, remote and rugged terrain, and inadequate transportation network usually have made mining these resources difficult, and there have been few serious attempts to further explore or exploit them.

The most important resource has been natural gas, first tapped in 1967. At their peak during the 1980s, natural gas sales accounted for $300 million a year in export revenues (56% of the total). Ninety percent of these exports went to the Soviet Union to pay for imports and debts. However, during the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989, Afghanistan's natural gas fields were capped to prevent sabotage by the [[mujahidin]]. Restoration of gas production has been hampered by internal strife and the disruption of traditional trading relationships following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Gas production has dropped from a high of 8,200,000 m&amp;sup3; (290 million cubic feet) per day in the 1980s to a current low of about 600,000 m&amp;sup3; (22 million cubic feet) in 2001.

Trade in goods smuggled into Pakistan once constituted a major source of revenue for Afghan regimes, including the Taliban, and also figured as an important element in the Afghan economy. Many of the goods smuggled into Pakistan originally entered Afghanistan from Pakistan, where they fell under the Afghan Trade and Transit Agreement (ATTA), which permitted goods bound for Afghanistan to transit Pakistan free of duty. When Pakistan clamped down in 2000 on the types of goods permitted duty-free transit, routing of goods through Iran from the Gulf increased significantly. Shipments of smuggled goods were subjected to fees and duties paid to the Afghan Government. The trade also provided jobs to tens of thousands of Afghans on both sides of the Durand Line, which forms the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Pakistan's closing its Afghan border in September 2001 presumably drastically curtailed this traffic.

==Economic Development and Recovery==
Afghanistan embarked on a modest economic development program in the 1930s. The government founded banks; introduced paper money; established a university; expanded primary, secondary, and technical schools; and sent students abroad for education. In 1956, the Afghan Government promulgated the first in a long series of ambitious development plans. By the late 1970s, these had achieved only mixed results due to flaws in the planning process as well as inadequate funding and a shortage of the skilled managers and technicians needed for implementation.

These constraints on development have been exacerbated by the flight of educated Afghans and the disruption and instability stemming from the Soviet occupation and ensuing civil war. Today, economic recovery and long-term development will depend on establishing an effective and stable political system and an end to more than 22 years of conflict.

The UN and the international donor community continue to provide considerable humanitarian relief. Since its inception in 1988, the umbrella UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan (UNOCHA) has channelled more than $1 billion in multilateral assistance to Afghan refugees and vulnerable persons inside Afghanistan. The U.S., the European Union (EU), and Japan are the leading contributors to this relief effort. One of its key tasks is to eliminate from priority areas--such as villages, arable fields, and roads--some of the 5 to 7 million land mines and 750,000 pieces of [[unexploded ordnance]], sown mainly during the Soviet occupation, which continue to litter the Afghan landscape. Afghanistan is the most heavily mined country in the world; mine-related injuries number up to 300 per month. Without successful mine clearance, refugee repatriation, political stability, and economic reconstruction will be severely constrained.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{dablink|For other meanings, see [[Elf (disambiguation)]]}}

[[Image:Small elf.JPG|350px|thumb|right|A small forest elf (''älva'') rescuing an egg, from ''Solägget'' (1932), by [[Elsa Beskow]]]]An '''elf''' is a [[mythical creature]] of [[Norse mythology]] which survived in northern [[Europe]]an [[folklore]]. Originally a race of minor [[gods]] of nature and fertility, elves are often pictured as youthful-seeming men and women of great beauty living in [[forest]]s and other natural places, underground, or in wells and springs. They have been portrayed to be long-lived or [[immortality|immortal]] and  they have [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] powers attributed to them. Following the success of [[J. R. R. Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s epic ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''—wherein a wise, angelic people named ''elves'' play a significant role—they have become [[Stock character|staple characters]] of modern [[fantasy]].

''Elf'' can be [[plural]]ized both as ''elves'' and ''elfs''. Something associated with elves or the qualities of elves is described by the [[adjective]]s ''elfin'', ''elven'', ''elfish'', or ''elvish''. They are also called: 

* [[Germany]]: ''Elfen'', ''Elben'' and ''Alben''
* [[Great Britain]]: ''addler'' (obsolete)
* [[Iceland]]:  ''álfar'', ''álfafólk'' and ''huldufólk'' (hidden people)
* [[Netherlands]]: ''Elfen'', ''Alfen''
* [[Scandinavia]]: ''elvere'' or ''ellefolk'' in [[Denmark]], ''alver'' or ''elvefolk'' in [[Norway]], and ''alfer'', ''alver'' or ''älvor'' in [[Sweden]]

Although there has been debate, the words ''elf'', ''[[alf|álf]]'' and their relatives almost certainly come from the same [[Indo-European]] root *''albh'' as the Latin ''albus'' (white).{{mn|Hall 2004|H-1}}

==Characteristics of traditional elves==

===Elves in Norse mythology===

The earliest preserved description of elves comes from [[Norse mythology]]. In [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] they are called ''álfar'' ([[singular]], [[nominative case]]: ''álfr''), and although no older or contemporary descriptions exist, the appearance of beings etymologically related to ''álfar'' in various later folklore strongly suggests that the belief in elves were common among all the [[Germanic tribes]], and not limited solely to the ancient [[Scandinavia]]ns.

Elves make various appearances in Norse mythology. Although the concept itself is never clearly defined in our sources, elves appear to have been understood as powerful and beautiful human-sized beings. They are commonly referred to collectively as semi-divine beings associated with fertility as well as the cult of the ancestors. As such, elves appear similar to the [[Animism|animistic]] belief in [[Spiritual being|spirits]] of nature and of the deceased, common to nearly all human religions; something that, on a side note, is true also for the Old Norse belief in ''[[fylgja|fylgjur]]'' and ''[[vörðr|vörðar]]'' (&quot;follower&quot; and &quot;warden&quot; spirits, respectively). Arguably, ''elves'' are the Germanic equivalent to the [[nymph]]s of [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]], as well as the [[wili|vili]] and [[Rusalka|rusalki]] of [[Slavic mythology]].
[[Image:Freyr_art.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The god [[Freyr]], the lord of the light-elves]]
The Icelandic mythographer and historian [[Snorri Sturluson]] seems to have referred to [[dwarves]] (''[[Norse dwarves|dvergar]]'') as &quot;dark-elves&quot; (''[[dökkálfar]]'') or &quot;black-elves&quot; (''[[svartálfar]]''); whether this usage reflects wider medieval Scandinavian belief is uncertain.{{mn|Hall 2004|H-2}} Elves who are not dark-elves are referred to by Snorri as &quot;light-elves&quot; (''[[ljósálfar]]''); this usage has often been connected with elves' etymological connection with whiteness. Snorri describes their differences like so:

:''There are many magnificent dwellings. One is there called [[Alfheim]]. There dwell the folk that are called light-elves; but the dark-elves dwell down in the earth, and they are unlike the light-elves in appearance, but much more so in deeds. The light-elves are fairer than the sun to look upon, but the dark-elves are blacker than pitch.''{{mn|Younger Edda|YE-1}}

Evidence for elves in Norse mythology outside Snorri's work, and in earlier evidence, comes from [[Skaldic poetry]], the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' and [[legendary saga]]s. Here elves are linked with the [[Æsir]], particularly through the common phrase &quot;Æsir and the elves&quot;, which presumably means &quot;all the gods&quot;.{{mn|Hall 2004|H-3}} The elves have been compared or identified with the [[Vanir]] (fertility gods) by some scholars (e.g. Hall 2004, pp. 43-46). However, in the ''[[Alvíssmál]]'' (&quot;The Sayings of All-Wise&quot;), the elves are considered distinct from both the Vanir and the [[Æsir]], as revealed by a series of comparative names in which Æsir, Vanir, and elves are given their own versions for various words in a reflection of their individual racial preferences. Possibly, the words designate a difference in status between the major fertility gods (the Vanir) and the minor ones (the elves). ''[[Grímnismál]]'' relates that the Van [[Freyr]] was the lord of ''[[Álfheim]]r'' (meaning &quot;elf-world&quot;), the home of the light-elves. ''[[Lokasenna]]'' relates that a large group of Æsir and elves had assembled at [[Ægir]]'s court for a banquet. Several minor forces, the servants of gods, are presented such as [[Byggvir]] and [[Beyla]], who belonged to Freyr, the lord of the elves, and they were probably elves, since they were not counted among the gods. Two other mentioned servants were [[Fimafeng]] (who was murdered by [[Loki]]) and [[Eldir]].

Some speculate that Vanir and elves belong to an earlier [[Nordic Bronze Age]] religion of [[Scandinavia]], and were later replaced by the Æsir as main gods. Others (most notably [[Georges Dumézil]]) argue that the Vanir were the gods of the common Norsemen, and the Æsir those of the priest and warrior castes (see also [[Nerthus]]).

A poem from around [[1020]], the ''[[Austrfaravísur]]'' ('Eastern-journey verses') of [[Sigvatr Þorðarson]], mentions that, as a Christian, he was refused board in a heathen household, in [[Sweden]], because an ''[[Blót#Elven blót|álfablót]]'' (&quot;elves' sacrifice&quot;) was being conducted there. However, we have no further reliable information as to what an ''álfablót'' involved,{{mn|Hall 2004|H-4}} but like other [[blót]]s it probably included the offering of foods, and later [[Scandinavian folklore]] retained a tradition of sacrificing treats to the elves (see below). From the time of year (close to the [[autumnal equinox]]) and the elves' association with fertility and the ancestors, we might assume that it had to do with the ancestor cult and the life force of the family.
[[Image:Völund.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The smith hero [[Weyland|Völundr]], the ruler of the dökkálfar(dark-elves)]]
In addition to this, ''[[Kormáks saga]]'' accounts for how a sacrifice to elves was apparently believed able to heal a severe battle wound:

:''Þorvarð healed but slowly; and when he could get on his feet he went to see Þorðís, and asked her what was best to help his healing.''
:''&quot;A hill there is,&quot; answered she, &quot;not far away from here, where elves have their haunt. Now get you the bull that Kormák killed, and redden the outer side of the hill with its blood, and make a feast for the elves with its flesh. Then thou wilt be healed.&quot;''{{mn|Kormáks saga|Ko-1}}

The Scandinavian elves were of human size. Full-sized famous men could be elevated to the rank of elves after death, such as the peley]] ([http://www.robertkeeley.com homepage])

'''Enron Corporation''' is an energy company based in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]]. Prior to its [[bankruptcy]] in late [[2001]], Enron employed around 21,000 people and was one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas, and [[telecommunications|communications]] companies, with claimed revenues of $101 billion in 2000. [[Fortune magazine]] named Enron &quot;America's Most Innovative Company&quot; for six consecutive years. It became most famous at the end of 2001 when it was revealed that it was sustained mostly by institutionalized, systematic, and well-planned [[accounting scandals|accounting fraud]]. Its [[Europe]]an operations filed for bankruptcy on [[November 30]], [[2001]], and it sought [[Chapter 11]] protection in the U.S. two days later, on [[December 2]]. It still exists, operating a handful of key assets, and making preparations for the sale or spin off of remaining businesses. Enron emerged from bankruptcy in November of 2004 after one of the biggest and most complex cases in US history. It has since entered the common consciousness as a symbol of willful corporate fraud and corruption.

==Growth==
Enron was founded in 1930 as [[Northern Natural Gas Company]], a consortium of Northern American Power and Light Company, Lone Star Gas Company, and United Lights and Railways Corporation. The consortium ownership was gradually dissolved between 1941 and 1947 through a public stock offering. In 1979, Northern Natural Gas was restructured under the ownership of a new holding company, InterNorth Inc., which replaced Northern Natural Gas on the New York Stock Exchange. 

In 1985, [[InterNorth]] acquired competitor [[Houston Natural Gas]] Company in a transaction engineered by HNG CEO [[Kenneth Lay]]. Although InterNorth was the purchaser, Lay emerged as CEO and promptly renamed InterNorth as Enron Corporation, with headquarters in Houston rather than InterNorth/Northern Natural Gas's base in Omaha. Initially, the company was to be named Enteron, chosen for the positive connotations of &quot;enter&quot; and &quot;on&quot;, but when it was pointed out that the term meant &quot;[[intestine]]&quot;, it was quickly shortened. 

Enron was originally involved in the transmission and distribution of electricity and gas throughout the United States and the development, construction, and operation of [[power plant]]s, [[pipeline]]s, and other infrastructure worldwide. In 1998 it moved into the [[water sector]], creating the [[Azurix]] Corporation, which it part-floated on the NYSE in June 1999. Azurix failed to break into the water utility market, with its only major concession, in [[Buenos Aires]] Province, a large-scale money loser. In [[April 2001]] Enron announced its intention to break up Azurix and sell its assets.

Enron grew wealthy, it claimed, through its pioneering [[marketing]] and [[promotion]] of power and [[communication|communications]] [[bandwidth]] [[commodities]] and related [[derivative (finance)|derivative]]s as tradable [[financial instruments]], including exotic items such as [[weather derivatives]]. As a result, Enron was named &quot;America's Most Innovative Company&quot; by ''[[Fortune magazine]]'' for six consecutive years, from 1996 to 2001. It was on the ''Fortune'''s &quot;100 Best Companies to Work for in America&quot; list in 2000, and was legendary even among the elite workers of the financial world for the opulence of its offices. However, as was later discovered, many of these recorded profits were inflated or even wholly fraudulent and totally nonexistant, by the use of sophisticated and arcane financial transactions between Enron and related companies formed to take unprofitable entities off the company's books.

==EnronOnline==
:{{main|EnronOnline}}

In November 1999, Enron launched EnronOnline. EnronOnline was the first web-based transaction system that allowed buyers and sellers to buy, sell, and trade commodity products globally. It allowed users to do business only with Enron, which was seen as a particular weakness. Due to the giant cash needs of Enron Online and the company wasting money in other areas such as broadband, Azurix, [[Enron Energy Services]], and shutting down the original pipeline service which generated cash flow, Enron virtually drained itself of cash. The Enron Global Finance department had to keep working up more and more creative financing moves to keep the company up and running.

==Decline==
Enron's global reputation was undermined, however, by persistent rumours of [[bribery]] and political pressure to secure contracts in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], in [[Africa]], and in the [[Philippines]]. Especially controversial was its $3 billion contract with the [[Maharashtra State Electricity Board]] in [[India]], where it is alleged that Enron officials used political connections within the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] and [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administrations to exert pressure on the board. On [[January 9]], [[2002]], the [[United States Department of Justice]] announced it was going to pursue a criminal investigation of Enron and [[Congress of the United States|Congressional]] hearings began on [[January 24]].

After a series of [[Accounting scandals|scandals]] involving irregular accounting procedures bordering on fraud involving Enron and its accounting firm [[Arthur Andersen]], it stood at the verge of undergoing the largest bankruptcy in history by mid-November 2001. A [[white knight (business)|white knight]] rescue attempt by a similar, smaller energy company, [[Dynegy]], was not viable.

During 2001, Enron shares fell from over US $90.00 to US$0.30. As Enron was considered a [[blue chip]] stock, this was an unprecedented and disastrous event in the financial world. Enron's plunge occurred after it was revealed that much of its profits and revenue were the result of deals with [[Special Purpose Entity|special purpose entities]] ([[limited partnership]]s which it controlled). The result of this was that many of the losses that Enron suffered were not reported in its [[financial statements]].

==Insider Trading==
===Beginning===
[[Insider trading]], trading of a [[security (finance)]] based on material non-public information about a company, at Enron Corporation is not just a thing of the late 1990s or early 2000s. Enron has had trouble with insider trading dating back even to the 1980s. The first documented example of insider trading at Enron occurred in 1987. Two [[auditors]], David Woytek and John Beard, discovered [[bank]] records showing that millions of dollars had been moved from Enron into the personal accounts of Louis Borget and Thomas Mastroeni. 

Both Louis Borget and Thomas Mastroeni were rumored to consort with rulers of [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait]], gaining inside information on the workings of [[OPEC]]. This insider information had led to more profitable trading of oil [[commodities]], until the cash flows from Enron into personal accounts were discovered by Woytek and Beard. Both auditors were told by [[Chief Executive Officer]] [[Kenneth Lay ]] to continue their investigation and make sure every penny was returned to the rightful account; however, no immediate action was taken against the perpetrators. 

Woytek and Beard would eventually gather enough information to prove that Borget and Mastroeni were participating in insider trading and stealing from the company. This information included bank statements that showed cash flows that were not recorded in the company's records along with copies of altered statements that Borget had filed with the company. However, despite all of the evidence that the two auditors had collected, they were told to drop the investigation by Enron's [[president]], Mick Seidl, and the [[Chief Financial Officer]], Keith Kern. Unfortunately for Woytek and Beard, Borget had brought in tens of millions of dollars to the company. Enron had given both Woytek and Beard the impression that the annual profits that Borget brought in to the corporation were more important than maintaining legal practices.

===The Recent Insider Trading===
If the Enron traders were indeed participating in insider trading during the 1980s, they apparently did not learn their lesson from nearly being caught by David Woytek and John Beard. To the auditors, it seemed that Enron would become caught up in the race for higher profits and would pursue them even if it meant using illegal practices.

Enron had created [[offshore entities]], a unit which may be used for planning and avoidance of [[tax|taxes]], raising the profitability of a business. This provided ownership and management with full freedom of [[currency]] movement, and full anonymity, that would hide losses that the company was taking. These entities made Enron look more profitable than it actually was, and created a dangerous spiral in which each quarter, corporate officers would have to perform more and more contorted financial wizardry to create the illusion of billions in profits while the company was actually bleeding cash. This practice drove up the [[stock]] price to new levels at which point the executives began to work on insider information and trade millions of dollars worth of Enron stock. The executives and insiders at Enron knew about the offshore accounts that were hiding losses for the company, however, the investors knew nothing of this. Chief Financial Officer [[Andrew Fastow]] led the team which created the off-books companies, and manipulated the deals to provide himself, his family and his friends with hundreds of millions of dollars in guaranteed revenue, at the expense of the corporation he worked for and its stockholders.

In August of 2000, Enron's stock price hit its highest value of $90. It was at this point in time that Enron's executives, who possessed the inside information of the hidden losses, began to sell their stock. At the same time, the general public and Enron's [[investors]] were told to buy the stock, as the sky was the limit. Enron's executives told the investors that the stock would continue to climb until it reached possibly into the $130 to $140 range, while secretly unloading their shares as they knew the opposite to be true. 

As executives were selling off their shares of stock, the price continued to drop. As the price dropped, investors were told to continue buying stock or hold steady if they already owned Enron because the stock price would rebound in the near future. Kenneth Lay's strategy for responding to Enron's continuing problems was in his appearance. As he did many times, Lay would issue a statement or make an appearance to calm investors and assure them that Enron was headed in the right direction. 

By [[August 15]], [[2001]], Enron's stock price had fallen to $42 compared to its high of $90 just a year prior. Many of the investors trusted what Lay was telling them and still believed that Enron would rule the market. The investors continued to buy or hold onto their stock and lost more money every day. As October closed, the stock had fallen to $15 per share and many investors saw this as a great opportunity to buy Enron stock because of what Kenneth Lay had been telling them in the [[media]]. Just under a month later, on [[November 28]], the stock price would slip below one dollar as the public was finally made aware of the millions of dollars in losses that Enron had been hiding. 

Enron CEO Kenneth Lay has been accused of selling over $70 million worth of stock at this time, which he used to repay cash advances on line of [[credit (finance)|credit]]. He sold another $20 million worth of stock in the open market. Also, Lay's wife, Linda, has been accused of selling 500,000 shares of Enron stock totaling $1.2 million on [[November 28]], [[2001]]. The money earned from this sale did not go to the family but rather to [[charitable organizations]], which had already received pledges of contributions from the foundation. Records show that Mrs. Lay placed the sale order sometime between 10:00 and 10:20 AM, while the news of Enron's problems went public about 10:30 that morning. 

Former Enron executive Paula Rieker has been charged with criminal insider trading. Rieker obtained the 18,380 Enron shares for $15.51 a share. She sold that stock for $49.77 a share in July 2001, a week before the public was told what she already knew about the $102 million loss.

===Aftermath===
Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling, both former Enron chief executive officers, went on [[trial (law)|trial]] for their part in the Enron scandal in January 2006. Former [[chief accounting officer]] Richard Causey were on trial along with Lay and Skilling. The 53-count, 65-page [[indictment]] covers a broad range of financial crimes, including [[bank fraud]], making false statements to banks and auditors, [[securities fraud]], [[wire fraud]], [[money laundering]], money laundering conspiracy and insider trading. U.S. [[United States federal judge|District Judge]] Sim Lake has previously denied motions by the defendants to hold separate trials and to move the case out of Houston, where the defendants argued the negative publicity surrounding Enron's demise would make it impossible to get a fair trial. 

Mr. Lay pleaded not guilty to the eleven criminal charges. Lay has stated that he is innocent and that he was misled by those around him. The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) is seeking more than $90 million from Lay in addition to civil fines. The SEC would like to see that Mr. Lay is barred from ever serving as a director or an officer for a [[publicly held company]].

The case surrounding Mrs. Linda Lay is a difficult one. Mrs. Lay sold roughly 500,000 shares of Enron thirty minutes to ten minutes before the information that Enron was collapsing went public on [[November 28]], [[2001]]. This was information that Enron executives had known for over a year. This timeline of events presents a very good case for the prosecution. 

However, there are two specific points that make the case against Mrs. Lay a difficult one. The largest hurdle for the prosecution is that the Lays did not profit from the sale of this stock. It instead went to their family foundation and in the months following, the proceeds were given away to charity. The second hurdle is that even if Mr. Lay had come home and told his wife about Enron's troubles, this communication is a marital confidence and its disclosure cannot be forced. This would mean the government would have to find a third party witness to testify that Mrs. Lay did have insider knowledge at the time of the sale. 

Former managing director of [[investor relations]] for Enron Paula Rieker plead guilty in [[federal court]] to a criminal insider trading charge. The one [[felony]] charge against Rieker carries a maximum penalty of ten years in prison and a $1 million fine. Rieker agreed to never again serve as an officer or director of a public company. If a federal court approves the settlement, Rieker will pay the SEC $499,333, the profit from the sale of 18,380 share of Enron stock. Rieker has been a valuable witness for the government as she prepared earnings releases and conference calls with Enron analysts.

On [[December 28]], [[2005]], former [[chief accounting officer|CAO]] [[Richard Causey]] pleaded guilty to securities fraud. He will have to serve 7 years in prison and pay $1.25 million to the US Government. Causey has the possibility of only serving 5 years in prison if he cooperates and testifies against former Chairmen and CEO, [[Kenneth Lay]] and former CEO and COO, [[Jeffrey Skilling]].

On [[January 13]], [[2006]] lobbyist [[William &quot;Art&quot; Roberts]] pleaded guilty to impersonating Senate staff members during the investigation.

Roberts was hired by a German bank in June 2004 to get a letter from a Senate subcommittee stating the bank had done their [[due dilligence]] investigating the Enron collapse, as part of the bank's defense in a suit filed against it by a London bank. [http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&amp;sid=aKHHN.3en36I&amp;refer=us]

==Fallout==
The long-term implications of Enron's collapse are somewhat unclear, but there is considerable political fallout both in the US and in the UK relating to the money Enron gave to political figures (around US$6 million since 1990). The fallout from the scandal quickly extended beyond Enron and all those formerly associated with it. The trial of [[Arthur Andersen]] on charges of [[obstruction of justice]] related to Enron also helped to expose its accounting fraud at [[WorldCom]]. The subsequent bankruptcy of that telecommunications firm quickly set off a wave of other [[accounting scandals]]. This wave engulfed many companies, exposing high-level corruption, accounting errors, and [[insider trading]]. Though at the time of its collapse, Enron was the largest bankruptcy in history, since then it has been eclipsed by the collapse of [[WorldCom]].

Former Enron CFO [[Andrew Fastow]], the [[mastermind]] behind Enron's complex network of [[Offshoring|offshore]] partnerships and questionable accounting practices, was [[indict]]ed on [[November 1]], [[2002]], by a federal [[grand jury]] in Houston on 78 counts including [[fraud]], [[money laundering]], and [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]]. He and his wife [[Lea Fastow]], former assistant treasurer, accepted a [[plea agreement]] on [[January 14]], [[2004]]. Andrew Fastow will serve a ten-year prison sentence and forfeit US $23.8 million, while Lea Fastow will serve a five-month prison sentence and a year of supervised release, including five months of house arrest; in return, both will provide testimony against other Enron corporate officers.

Ben Glisan Jr., a former Enron [[treasurer]], was the first man to be sent to [[prison]] in the Enron scandal. He pled guilty to one count of [[conspiracy]] to commit security and [[wire fraud]].

[[John Forney]], a former energy trader who invented various strategies such as the &quot;[[Death Star (Business)|Death Star]]&quot;, was indicted in December 2002, on 11 counts of conspiracy and [[wire fraud]]. His trial was scheduled for [[October 12]], [[2004]]. His supervisors, [[Timothy Belden]] and [[Jeffrey Richter]], have both pled guilty to conspiring to commit wire fraud and currently are aiding prosecutors in investigating this scandal.  

[[Jeffrey Skilling]] was arrested on [[February 11]], [[2004]], by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].
[[Kenneth Lay]] was indicted by a federal [[grand jury]] on [[July 7]], [[2004]] for his involvement in the scandal. He pled not guilty in court on [[July 9]]. Both men are scheduled for [[The trial of Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling|trial]] in January 2006.

Enron's collapse also led to the creation of the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]], signed into law on [[July 30]], [[2002]]. It is considered the most significant change to federal [[securities law]]s since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|FDR's]] [[New Deal]] in the [[1930s]].

The status of the [[pension]] plans that were promised to Enron's employees has been in question since the collapse of Enron.  The [[Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation]] is attempting to cover some and possibly all of the promised benefits.

===Trials===
* [[Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States]]
* [[Enron Broadband trial]]
* [[The trial of Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling|Lay and Skilling trial]]

==Pensions==
Thousands of Enron employees and investors lost their life savings, children's college funds, and [[pensions]] when Enron collapsed. A [[lawsuit]] on the behalf of a group of Enron's shareholders has been filed against Enron executives and directors. This lawsuit accuses twenty-nine of these executives and directors of insider trading and misleading the public. 

Because the 401(k) plan is a defined contribution plan, there was no [[PBGC]] insurance and employees lost their money that was invested in Enron stock.  They could only sue anyone who is considered a [[fiduciary]] for breach of their duty of care based on [[ERISA]] Section 404.

==Restructuring==
Following the 2001 bankruptcy filing, Enron has been attempting to restructure in order to compensate as many creditors as possible. Enron's innovative core energy trading business was sold early in the bankruptcy proceedings to Merrill Lynch and Company. A last-ditch survival attempt was made in 2001 through a planned merger with arch-rival Dynegy Corporation. Dynegy backed out during merger talks, acquiring control of Enron's original, predecessor company - Northern Natural Gas - in the process. Enron is currently pursuing legal action against Dynegy over the takeover of Northern Natural Gas, which has since been sold by Dynegy to MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company. 

Enron's final bankruptcy plan provides for the creation of three new businesses to be spun off from Enron as independent, debt-free companies. The reorganization process commenced in 2003, with the formation of two new Enron subsidiaries, CrossCountry Energy L.L.C., and [[Prisma Energy International Inc.]] 

CrossCountry Energy, formed from Enron's domestic gas pipeline assets, was immediately placed on the market for creditor compensation. On [[September 1]], [[2004]], Enron announced an agreement to sell CrossCountry Energy to CCE Holdings L.L.C. (a joint venture between Southern Union Company and a unit of General Electric) for $2.45 billion. The money will be used for debt repayment, and represents a substantial increase over the previous offer made by NuCoastal L.L.C. earlier in 2004. 

Prisma Energy International, formed out of Enron's remaining overseas assets, will emerge from bankruptcy as a main-line descendant of Enron through a stock offering to Enron creditors. Currently, many of Prisma's assets remain under direct Enron ownership with Prisma operating in a management capacity. 

The third company, [[Portland General Electric]] (PGE), was founded in 1889, and ranks as Oregon's largest utility. PGE was acquired by Enron during the 1990's, and will emerge from bankruptcy as an independent company through a private stock offering to Enron creditors.

All remaining assets not related to CrossCountry, Prisma, or Portland General will be liquidated. [[As of 2006]], CrossCountry is now under CCE Holdings ownership, while the Portland General and Prisma deals remain to be consummated. Enron emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2004 but will likely be wound down once the recovery plan is carried out. Enron's remaining assets are grouped under two main subsidiary companies- Prisma Energy International and Portland General Electric, both of which will likely be spun off.

==Various==
The baseball stadium Enron Field in [[Houston, Texas]], named after the company, was renamed to ''[[Houston Astros|Astros]] Field'' to avoid negative publicity. The park's name was later changed to ''[[Minute Maid Park]]''. The [[Houston Astros]] had to pay Enron $5 million to get out of the deal.

[[David Tonsall]], a former Enron employee, became a rapper under the name [[N Run]], which is a play on the name &quot;Enron&quot; and also stands for &quot;never run.&quot; He released his CD ''Corporate America'' on [[December 3]], [[2003]].

&quot;The Women of Enron&quot; were the subject of a pictorial in the August 2002 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine.

A 2005 movie, ''[[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room]]'', based on the 2003 bestseller of the same name by [[Bethany McLean]] and [[Peter Elkind]], documents the Enron story. [http://www.alternet.org/movies/21840/] [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413845/]

As a result of their investigation the [[FERC]] made a large portion of Enron's email database available to the public. This database comprises roughly 500,000 email messages and has become a standard dataset in email research.[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/]

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:washingtonnationalcathedral.jpg|thumb|250px| [[National Cathedral|The Cathedral Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul]] in [[Washington DC]] is the [[National Cathedral]] of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America.]]
The '''Episcopal Church''' or the '''Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America''' is the American [[national church]] of the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Anglican communion|Communion]]. It includes 108 [[Dioceses of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|dioceses]] in the [[United States]], the [[US Virgin Islands]], [[Haiti]], [[Taiwan]], [[Colombia]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Honduras]], and has an extra-provincial relationship with the dioceses of [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Venezuela]]. 

In the United States the Church has a membership of approximately 2.3 million, and has counted among its members more than a quarter of all [[President of the United States|presidents of the United States]] (see: [[List of U.S. Presidential religious affiliations]]).

The full legal name of the national church corporate body is &lt;b&gt;The Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America&lt;/b&gt;, but this name is rarely used. It is sometimes known as the '''Episcopal Church in the USA''', abbreviated '''ECUSA'''.

The church has its national offices in [[New York City]] but its leader, the [[List of Presiding Bishops in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Presiding Bishop]], is installed ceremonially at [[Washington National Cathedral]]. Its governing body, the general convention, has no fixed home today, meeting at a different site each time it convenes. The incumbent Presiding Bishop is the Most Rev. [[Frank Tracy Griswold]] III.

Like many other Anglican churches, it has entered into [[full communion]] with Lutherans, in this case with the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]].

==History==
===Colonies and Revolution: 1607-1789===
[[Image:Episcopal_Church_USA_Shield.png|thumb|right|175px|Shield of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America]]
The first [[congregation (worship)|congregation]] of what would become the Episcopal Church in the United States was founded in [[Jamestown]], [[Virginia]], in 1607 as part of the [[Church of England]].  From there, the church spread throughout the American colonies. 

The Church of England became the established church in [[Virginia]] in 1609, in the lower part of [[New York]] in 1693; in [[Maryland]] in 1702, in [[South Carolina]] in 1706, and in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1758. This was a matter of local taxes being given to the [[vestry]] for church use. Virginia attempted to make requirements about attendance, but with a severe shortage of clergy, they were not enforced. These vestries were part of the Church of England, whose clergy reported to the Bishop of London (from 1635) through appointed &quot;commissaries&quot; especially  [[James Blair (clergyman)|James Blair]], who served 1685-1743. After 1702 the &quot;[[Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts]]&quot; (SPG) began missionary activity throughout the colonies.  The ministers were few, the [[glebe|glebes]] small, the salaries inadequate, and the people quite uninterested in religion, as the vestry became in effect a kind of local government. One historian has explained the workings of the [[parish]] [Olmstead p 45]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The parish was a local unit concerned with such matters as the conduct and support of the parish church, the supervision of morals, and the care of the poor. Its officers, who made up the vestry, were ordinarily influential and wealthy property holders chosen by a majority of the parishioners. They appointed the parish ministers, made local assessments, and investigated cases of moral offense for referral to the county court, the next higher judicatory. They also selected the church wardens, who audited the parish accounts and prosecuted morals cases. For several decades the system worked in a democratic fashion, but by the 1660's, the vestries had generally become self-perpetuating units made up of well-to-do landowners. This condition was sharply resented by the small farmers and servants.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, with the support of the Bishop of London, wanted a bishop for the colonies. Strong opposition arose in the South, where a bishop would threaten the privileges of the lay vestry. Opponents conjured up visions of &quot;episcopal palaces, or pontifical revenues, of spiritual courts, and all the pomp, grandeur, luxury and regalia of an American Lambeth.&quot; (New York Gazette or Weekly Post Boy, March 14, 1768.) John Adams later explained, &quot;the apprehension of Episcopacy&quot; contributed to the American Revolution, capturing the attention &quot;not only of the inquiring mind, but of the common people. . . . The objection was not merely to the office of a bishop, though even that was dreaded, but to the authority of parliament, on which it must be founded.&quot;  (Bonomi, 200) On the eve of Revolution a large fraction of prominent merchants and royal appointees were Anglicans--and were [[Loyalists]]. About 27% of Anglican ministers nationwide supported independence, especially in Virginia. Almost 40% --approaching 90% in New York and New England--were loyalists. Out of 55 Anglican clergy in New York and New England, only three were Patriots, two of those being from Massachusetts. In Maryland, of the 54 clergy in 1775, only 16 remained to take oaths of allegiance to the new government.  (McConnell 2003)  William Smith made the connection explicit in a [[1762]] report to the Bishop of London. &quot;The Church is the firmest Basis of Monarchy and the English Constitution,&quot; he declared. But if dissenters of &quot;more Republican . . . Principles [with] little affinity to the established Religion and manners&quot; of England ever gained the upper hand, the colonists might begin to think of &quot;Independency and separate Government.&quot; Thus &quot;in a Political as well as religious view,&quot; Smith stated emphatically, the church should be strengthened by an American bishop and the appointment of &quot;prudent Governors who are friends of our Establishment.&quot;  (Bonomi 201) 

By [[1775]], about 300 independent congregations were reported throughout the colonies. The church was disestablished in all the states during the [[American Revolution]]. The Episcopal Church was formally separated from the Church of England in 1789 so that clergy would not be required to accept the supremacy of the [[British monarch]]. When the clergy of [[Connecticut]] elected [[Samuel Seabury]] as their [[bishop]], he sought consecration in [[England]]. The [[Oath of Supremacy]] proved too difficult a problem, so he went to [[Scotland]]; the non-juring Scottish bishops there consecrated him in [[Aberdeen]] on [[November 14]], [[1784]], making him the first Episcopal bishop outside the [[British Isles]].  The American bishops thus descend in the [[historic episcopate|Apostolic succession]] through the non-juring bishops of Scotland, and to this day the nine crosses which symbolise ECUSA's nine original dioceses in its arms form a [[Saint Andrew's Cross]], commemorating the Scottish link.  The Church originally took the name of the ''&quot;Protestant Episcopal&quot; Church in the United States of America'' so as to distinguish itself from the other major episcopal Church present in the states at the time, the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

===The Church in the American Republic (1789-present)===

As the United States grew, new dioceses were established, as well as the [[Convocation of American Churches in Europe]].

==Church Polity==
The basic unit of governance in the Episcopal Church is the [[diocese]].  The ordained leader of the diocese is a [[bishop]]. Groups of dioceses constitute provinces but unlike in other Anglican Churches the provinces of the Episcopal Church do not have an [[archbishop]] with jurisdiction over the other bishops in his or her province.  Other ordained leaders include priests (or presbyters) and deacons.  Laity participate fully in the life and governance of the Church. 

The Church holds its [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|General Convention]] every three years. The General Convention is bicameral. There is the House of Bishops and the House of Deputies, which is made up of priests, deacons, and lay persons.  Each diocese elects four clergy and four laypeople as deputies. The head of the House of Bishops is the [[Presiding Bishop]] of the Episcopal Church. The current presiding bishop is The Most Reverend [[Frank Tracy Griswold]], whose term ends in 2006. The head of the House of Deputies is the president who is either a lay person or priest. The last General Convention was held in [[2003]]. The next one will be held in 2006, in [[Columbus, Ohio]].

===Provinces===
The Episcopal Church in the United States has nine ecclesiastical provinces, numbered as follows (Divided by State, not Diocese). 

#[[New England]]
#[[New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Haiti]], [[United States Virgin Islands]], and [[Convocation of American Churches in Europe]]
#[[Delaware]], [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], [[Maryland]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]]
#[[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Florida]], [[Kentucky]], eastern [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]]
#[[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Michigan]], eastern [[Missouri]], [[Ohio]], [[Wisconsin]]
#[[Colorado]], [[Iowa]], [[Minnesota]], [[Montana]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Wyoming]]
#[[Arkansas]], [[Kansas]], western [[Louisiana]], western [[Missouri]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], 
#[[Alaska]], [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Hawaii|Hawai‘i]], [[Idaho]], [[Oregon]], [[Nevada]], [[Utah]], [[Taiwan]], [[Washington]]
#[[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Honduras]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Venezuela]]

Each province is subdivided into dioceses. However, the senior bishop of a province is not an archbishop nor are there any archbishops in the Episcopal Church in the United States. See:
[[Dioceses of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America]]

===Congregations===
Each diocese is composed of [[congregation (worship)|congregations]] of various kinds: [[cathedral|cathedrals]], [[parish|parishes]], [[mission]]s and [[chapel]]s.

A [[cathedral]] acts as the [[motherchurch|mother church]] of the diocese, and is often the home of a parish as well. The cathedral of each diocese is the seat of the bishop of that diocese. Most, but not all dioceses have a cathedral. A few have two cathedrals or a cathedral and a ''pro-cathedral''. Others designate a conference or retreat centre chapel as a cathedral. Usually a cathedral is led by a priest called a [[dean (religion)|dean]]. A cathedral's lay governing body is known as a chapter, although some cathedrals have a [[vestry]] as well.

Most congregations are parishes. A parish is a self-sustaining congregation, not financially supported by the diocese. The ordained leader of a parish is a priest, usually called a [[rector]].  The two primary lay leaders of each congregation are the [[churchwarden|wardens]], sometimes referred to as senior and junior.  In addition to the rector and wardens, there are additional lay persons elected to support the mission and ministry of the congregation.  The rector, the wardens, and these laity comprise what is known as the vestry.  The number of these additional laity vary depending on the size of the congregation.

A mission is a congregation supported in part by the diocese. It is governed similarly to a parish but is more directly responsible to its diocese and bishop. A mission is led by a clergyperson usually called a [[vicar]]. Instead of a vestry, a mission's lay leadership is called either a mission committee or a bishop's committee.

A chapel may be connected to another institution, such as a school or hospital or it may be a congregation that is active for only part of the year. The latter are usually found in resort areas and are often called &quot;summer chapels&quot;. The clergyperson in charge of a chapel is usually known as a [[chaplain]], but a summer chapel may instead have a vicar.

==Beliefs and Practices==
===Overview===
The Episcopal Church is considered often a middle-road between the [[Protestant]] Church and the [[Roman Catholic Church]].  The liturgy, or the practice of the people in worship, resembles the [[Roman Catholic Church]], distinguished by the use of the [[Book of Common Prayer]] (see below).  Within the Episcopal Church there are varying degrees of liturgical practice.  Often a congregation or particular service is commonaly called &quot;low church&quot; or &quot;high church&quot;.  In theory, a &quot;high church&quot; congregation would embellish the basic worship with more specialized ritual. In contrast, a &quot;low church&quot; would have less embellishment, or may incorporate other embellishments such as praise and worship music.  Though most Episcopalians refer to their churches by these lables, often there is overlapping.  Within the Episcopal Church one finds praise and worship music, Anglican chant, liturgical dance, charismatic hand postures, robed clergy, and clergy in street clothing. As varied as services can be, the central binding aspect is the Book of Common Prayer or supplemental liturgies.

The Episcopal Church holds to the [[Nicene Creed]] as the main statement of faith, however the Church finds the [[Apostle's Creed]] sufficient in Ecumenical matters.  

====Saints====
The concept of &quot;Saint&quot; in the Episcopal Church is highly influenced by the Catholic tradition.  The level of veneration given to Saints is, in general, much more Protestant.  In general, Episcopalians do not pray to or invoke Saints as intercessors.  The Saints are used as examples in history of good Christian men and women instead.  With that understanding, one sees a wider variety of people thought of as &quot;Saints&quot; in the Episcopal Church, such as [[Martin Luther King]] or [[Samuel Seabury]].  In addition, the Church holds that all members are Saints of God, and hold the potential to be an example to others.  The Episcopal Church has a book called &quot;Lesser Feasts and Fasts&quot; which containes feast days for the various men and women the Church wishes to honor.

====Liberal and Conservative====
The theologies of various doctrines are often varied within the Episcopal Church.  There are traditional standings held by the Church, yet theologians with more liberal interpretations.  The Episcopal Church prides itself in allowing a place for both sides to be included.  In general, however, members of the Episcopal Church are moderate to liberal on most social issues, and mainline to liberal on some theological issues.

===The Book of Common Prayer===
'''[[Image:Bcp79.jpg|thumbnail|right|1979 ''Book of Common Prayer'']]'''&lt;!--an open book might be a better picture than a closed one, and perhaps the red binding found in church editions would be better than the black one found on personal editions?--&gt;
The Episcopal Church publishes its own [[Book of Common Prayer]] (BCP), containing most of the worship services (or &quot;liturgies&quot;) used in the Episcopal Church. Because of its wide-spread use in the church, the BCP is both a reflection of and a source of theology for Episcopalians.  The current edition dates from [[1979]] and represents more than just a revision of earlier books. It is marked by an attempt to return to practices of the early church, full lay participation in all services, and the recovery of the [[Eucharist]] as the principal service of the church. 

Previous American BCPs were issued in [[1789]], [[1892]], and [[1928]]. (A proposed BCP was issued in [[1786]] but not adopted.) The BCP is in the [[public domain]]; however, any new revt &quot;ExxonMobil handed hundreds of millions of dollars to the corrupt regime of President [[José Eduardo dos Santos]] in the late 1990s&quot;. [http://www.forbes.com/forbes/free_forbes/2003/0428/084.html]

In 2003, the [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] reported that ExxonMobil engaged in illegal trade with [[Sudan]] and along with dozens of other companies had to settle with the United States government for US$50,000 [http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/04/14/enemy.trading/index.html].
[[Image:Parody-of-esso-logo.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Parody of Esso logo produced for the Stop E$$O campaign]]
ExxonMobil is regarded by many [[environmentalism|environmental activists]] as an example of utter corporate irresponsibility and disregard for environmental concerns by US-based corporations. The company has been a target for a number of political campaigns, including the [[Stop Esso campaign]], held by [[Greenpeace]], [[Friends of the Earth]] and [[People and Planet]], and aimed at [[boycott]]ing Esso. These organisations commonly parody the company's brandname as &quot;E$$O&quot;, an example of [[alternative political spellings|alternative political spelling]], to indicate their belief that the company is only interested in short-term profit, and is willing to use its financial power to buy influence. A new environmental movement in the form of [[Exxpose Exxon]] has emerged to highlight ExxonMobil's stances on global warming, alternative energies, as well as lack of reparations yet awarded to the native americans affected by the [[Exxon Valdez]] oil spill in Alaska. Unlike other major oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell and BP, Exxon is one of the few that has actively fought the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and disputed scientific opinion on global [[climate change]]. [[Exxon-Mobil]] is highly criticized for funding climate change research, decried by environmentalists as &quot;junk science,&quot; such as the work of the Oregon Institute for Science and Medicine, a grand sounding institution having only a handful of employees and volunteers [http://www.oism.org/]. ExxonMobil has also been a leading campaigner in the yet-unsuccessful bid to open the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] to oil drilling, a move that environmentalists say will destroy the region's fragile ecology.

Greenpeace has been campaigning against Esso for many years and its main reasons for doing so include ExxonMobil's position on the issue of climate change. Greenpeace claims that ExxonMobil has flatly refused to believe that the burning of fossil fuels has any negative effect on the environment or climate change as a whole, despite these theories being accepted by most of the scientific community. 

[[Kellogg Company|Kelloggs]] sued Exxon based on a claim that the Tiger mascot looked like [[Tony the Tiger]].

==Diversity==
ExxonMobil received a 14% rating from the [[Human Rights Campaign]]'s Corporate Equality Index in 2004. The company had previously lost points because after the merger it failed to adopt some of the [[LGBT]]-friendly policies previously put into place at Mobil.  Moreover, sexual orientation was taken off the list of protected classes in the ExxonMobil non-discrimination policy following Mobil's merger with Exxon, and when the issue was put to a vote of shareholders, a supermajority of shareholders (more than 70%) rejected proposals to reinstate sexual orientation as a specific type of prohibited discrimination.

Domestic partner benefits were ended following Mobil's merger with Exxon. Mobil employees who already had DP benefits were allowed to keep them, but other employees could not add their DPs to the benefit plans after the merger.  ExxonMobil does offer DP benefits in countries where [[same-sex marriage]] is legal.

==Corporate governance==
The current Chairman of the Board and CEO of Exxon Mobil Corporation is [[Rex Tillerson]].  Tillerson assumed the top position on [[January 1]], [[2006]] on the retirement of long-time chairman and CEO, [[Lee Raymond]].  

===[[Board of directors]]=== 

Current Exxon Mobil board members are:
*[[Michael Boskin]]
*[[William W. George]]
*[[James R. Houghton]]
*[[William R. Howell]]
*[[Reatha King]]
*[[Philip Lippincott]]
*[[Henry McKinnell, Jr.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Exxon Valdez oil spill''' was the most devastating environmental disaster to occur at sea in history. Its remote location (accessible only by helicopter and boat) made government and industry response efforts difficult, and severely taxed existing plans for response. The region is a [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] for [[salmon]], [[sea otter]]s, [[seal (mammal)|seal]]s, and sea [[bird]]s.

[[Image:OilSheenFromValdezSpill.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|During the first few days of the spill, heavy sheens of oil, such as the sheen visible in this photograph, covered large areas of the surface of Prince William Sound.]]

==Early stages of the spill==
On [[March 23]], [[1989]], the oil [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]] ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' departed from the [[Valdez oil terminal]] in [[Valdez, Alaska]] (on its 28th voyage), heading south through [[Prince William Sound]], with a full load of [[petroleum|oil]]. Captain [[Joseph Hazelwood]] radioed to the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] station that he would be changing course in order to avoid some ''growlers'', small [[iceberg]]s which had drifted into the sound from the [[Columbia Glacier]]. The captain received permission to move into '''the northbound lane'''. Before retiring to his cabin, Captain Hazelwood instructed his third mate Gregory Cousins to &quot;start coming back into the lanes&quot; once the ship was abeam [[Busby Island]]  Light (some 2 minutes ahead). 

Although Cousins did give the instructions to the [[helmsman]] to steer the vessel to the right, the vessel was not turning sharply enough and at 12:04 a.m. on [[March 24]], the vessel hit [[Bligh Reef]]. It is not known whether Cousins gave the orders too late or the helmsman did not follow instructions properly.

About 30 million US [[gallon]]s of [[crude oil]] were spilled, affecting 1,900 km of [[coast]]line. (The initial estimate of the amount of oil spilled was 10.8 million gallons. At the time this figure was calculated, it was not known that most of the fluid pumped from the ruptured tanker was seawater that had displaced the cargo of oil. Later estmates provide a conservative value of 30 million gallons. Regardless, the media has continued to report the incorrect figure.[http://www.soundtruth.info/sidebar1.htm])

==Cleanup measures==
A trial burn was conducted during the early stages of the spill, in a region of the spill isolated from the rest by a fire-resistant boom. The test was relatively successful, but because of unfavorable weather no additional burning was attempted in this cleanup effort. Mechanical cleanup was started shortly afterward using booms and skimmers, but the skimmers were not readily available during the first 24 hours following the spill and thick oil and [[kelp]] tended to clog the equipment. Transferring oil from temporary storage vessels into more permanent containers was also difficult because of the oil's weight and thickness. In addition, a trial application of dispersants was performed. The use of dispersants proved to be controversial. Less than 4,000 US gallons (15,000 L) of dispersant were available in Valdez, Alaska, and no application equipment or aircraft. A private company applied dispersants on March 24 with a helicopter and dispersant bucket. Because there was not enough wave action to mix the dispersant with the oil in the water, their use was discontinued.

==Aftermath==
[[Image:OilPoolFromValdezSpill.jpeg|thumb|250px|right|Beginning 3 days after the vessel grounded, a storm pushed large quantities of fresh oil onto the rocky shores of many of the beaches in the Knight Island chain. In this photograph, pooled oil is shown stranded in the rocks.]]

In the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez incident [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Oil Pollution Act of 1990]], including a clause banning the ''Exxon Valdez'' from Alaskan waters. Exxon spent some 2 billion dollars cleaning up the spill, and a further 1 billion to settle civil and criminal charges related to the case. (Exxon recovered a significant portion of these monies via insurance claims and tax writeoffs.) An award of $287 million for actual damage and $5 billion for [[punitive damage]]s was awarded by an [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] jury in [[1994]].  Exxon appealed against the ruling and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]] ordered the original judge [[Russel Holland]] to reduce the amount.  On [[December 6]], [[2002]] the judge announced that he had reduced the damages to $4 billion, which he concluded was justified by the facts of the case and not grossly excessive.  Exxon's company position is that no punitive damages are justified because the spill was an accident. However in court it was argued that allowing a &quot;known drunk&quot; to captain the ship was reprehensible.  Exxon sent it back to court, to be considered in regard to a recent supreme court ruling in a similar case, resulting in Judge Holland actually upping the punitive damages to $4.5 billion, plus interest. Exxon is again appealing, some seventeen years after the incident. The case currently sits in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th Circuit appelate court]], and oral arguments have been scheduled for January 27, 2006. The Exxon Valdez damages assessment is notably important in that it was the first which assessed the [[existence value]] of the environmental resource in question, an assessment which was done through the use of [[contingent valuation]] techniques.

The tanker was towed to [[San Diego]], arriving on [[July 10]] and repairs began in [[July 30]], [[1989]]. Around 1,600 tons of steel was removed and replaced. In June [[1990]] the tanker, renamed ''SeaRiver Mediterranean'' left harbor after $30 million of repairs.  The ship was banned from Valdez by a new regulation that prohibited vessels that had caused oil spills of more than 1 million US gallons (3,800 m&amp;sup3;).  In April [[1998]] the company argued in a legal action against government that the ship should be allowed back to Valdez, since the regulation was unfairly directed at Exxon alone (no other ships meet this criterion.)

==Environmental impact==
Both the long and short-term effects of the oil spill have been studied comprehensively. Thousands of animals died immediately; the best estimates include 250,000 sea birds, 2,800 sea otters, 300 harbor seals, 250 bald eagles, up to 22 orcas, and billions of salmon and herring eggs. Despite a thorough cleanup, and little visual evidence apparent even only one year later, the effects of the spill continue to be felt today. In the long term, reductions in population have been seen in various ocean animals, including stunted growth in pink salmon populations. Sea otters and ducks also showed higher death rates in following years, partly because they ingested contaminated creatures. The animals also were exposed to oil when they dug up their prey in dirty soil. Researchers said some shoreline habitats, such as contaminated mussel beds, could take up to 30 years to recover. While it will take years for a solid long term study, some interim effects have already been noted;

*Rockweed - The Rockweed is once again growing on boulders where the spill occurred. 
*Salmon - Pink Salmon Harvests have varied in the years since the spill. 

==Social impact==
In additional to the environmental effects of the spill, the disruption to the lives of the people affected is noteworthy. Native American groups in the area were impacted, and the fishing industry also experienced serious changes as a result. For example, commercial fishing was closed for the remainder of 1989, so many fishermen went elsewhere to work. Unfortunately for the local industry, many seafood markets also turned elsewhere to purchase product, and some never returned. In the years following the spill, a very high percentage of the fishermen and associated companies declared bankruptcy. The promise of a punitive damages award from Exxon was not realized in the difficult years that followed the spill, and caused much frustration. For example, the mayor of [[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]], a nearby fishing community, committed suicide, and requested that his ashes be scattered on [[Bligh Reef]], where the Exxon Valdez grounded.

:'''''Edward Tudor''' redirects here; for another (though unlikely) Edward Tudor, see a putative younger son of [[Henry VII of England]], who, if existed, would be the uncle of this Edward''

'''Edward VI''' ([[12 October]] [[1537]] &amp;ndash; [[6 July]] [[1553]]) was [[Kingdom of England|King of England]] and [[King of Ireland]] from [[28 January]] [[1547]] until his death. Edward, the third monarch of the [[Tudor dynasty]], was England's first [[Protestantism|Protestant]] ruler. Although his father and predecessor, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], had broken the link between the English church and Rome, it was during Edward's reign that the decisive move was made from Catholicism to a form of [[Protestantism]] which came to be known as [[Anglicanism]]. 

==Early life==
Edward was born at the [[Palace of Placentia]] in [[Greenwich, London]].  He was the son of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] by his wife, [[Jane Seymour]], who died twelve days afterwards from [[puerperal fever]].  It is sometimes asserted that Jane sacrificed her life by the performance of a [[Caesarean section]], but such assertions are without basis. Edward automatically became [[Duke of Cornwall]] upon his birth; he was, however, never created [[Prince of Wales]], as was (and still is) customary for the heir-apparent to the Throne.

Henry VIII was extremely pleased by the birth of a male heir. He had left his two previous wives, [[Catherine of Aragon]] (mother of [[Mary I of England| Mary]]) and [[Anne Boleyn]] (mother of  [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]), because of their failure to produce male heirs.  Both marriages had been [[annulment|annulled]], and Anne Boleyn was also executed; Mary and Elizabeth were deemed [[illegitimacy|illegitimate]].  Despite their illegitimacy, however, they were reinserted into the [[order of succession|line of succession]] after Edward VI in [[1544]]. 

Edward VI was an extremely sickly child. It has been theorised that he suffered from [[congenital syphilis]] or from [[tuberculosis]]. His frailty led Henry VIII to quickly seek to remarry; the King's last three marriages, however, did not produce any children. Edward's physical difficulties did not impede his education; on the contrary, the young prince was a very bright child, already able to speak [[Latin]] at the age of seven. He later learned to speak [[French language|French]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]; by the age of thirteen, he found himself translating books into the latter language. His principal tutors were [[John Cheke|Sir John Cheke]], [[Leonard Cox]], and [[Jean Belmain]]. He was quite fond of his stepmother Catherine Parr. He wrote three letters to her, one in French, English and Latin. The rest of the letters he wrote were in latin to his sisters. He had strong feelings for his sister Mary.

''Alternatively, given that Jane Seymour passed away days after Edward VI's birth, it is natural that Henry VIII would seek remarriage, which act does not, therefore, necessarily substantiate claims that Edward VI was a sickly child.  Indeed, Henry VIII only married Anne of Cleves on 6 January, 1540, over 2 years after Jane Seymour perished. In fact, Edward's journals mention no illness at all apart from a bout of measles in 1552, and the pulmonary tuberculosis which killed him. The policies of the Duke of Northumberland also indicate that he was building a foundation on which Edward was expected to build when he reached his majority, rather than expecting Edward to die young.

==Under Somerset==
{{House of Tudor}}
Henry VIII died on [[28 January]] [[1547]]. His [[will (law)|will]] named sixteen [[executor]]s, who were to act as a Council of [[Regent|Regency]] until Edward VI achieved majority at the age of eighteen (although it was agreed by the Council in 1552 that Edward would reach his majority at 16). These executors were to be supplemented by twelve assistants, who would only participate when the others deemed it fit. The executors were all inclined towards religious reformation, whose most prominent opponents, [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]], [[Stephen Gardiner]] (the [[Bishop of Winchester]]) and [[Thomas Thirlby]] (the [[Bishop of Westmin ISBN 0-7509-2616-3

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[United States]]' federal '''Earned Income Tax Credit''' (EITC) is a [[refundable tax credit]] that reduces or eliminates the taxes that low-income working people pay (such as [[payroll tax|payroll taxes]]) and also frequently operates as a wage subsidy for low-income workers. Enacted in 1975, the then very small EITC was expanded in 1986, 1990, 1993, and 2001.  Today, the EITC is one of the largest anti-poverty tools in the United States.  

Other countries with EITCs include Britain, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Finland, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Denmark. In some cases, these are small (the maximum EITC in Finland is 290 Euros), but others are even larger than the US EITC (the UK EITC is worth up to 6150 Euros). 

== Structure ==
The EITC in the United States is characterized by a unique three-stage structure that consists of a phase-in range in which the credit increases as earnings increase, a plateau range in which the maximum credit has been reached and further earnings do not affect it, and a phase-out range in which the credit decreases as earnings increase.  Currently, for a family with two dependent children, the credit is equal to 40 percent of the first $10,750 earned, plateaus at a maximum credit of $4,400, begins to phase-out when earnings increase beyond approximately $15,000, and reaches zero when earnings pass approximately $35,000.  For a family with one dependent child, the structure is similar but has a phase-in rate of 34 percent and a maximum credit of $2,604.  For those filing without dependents, there is a small credit of 7.65 percent of earnings with a maximum of $380.  All dollar amounts are now indexed to inflation.

In addition to the federal EITC, 11 states have their own refundable EITCs.  These state plans mimic the federal EITC’s structure on a smaller scale, as individuals receive a state credit equal to a fixed percentage – between 15 and 30 percent depending on the state – of what they received from the IRS.  Furthermore, small local EITC’s have been enacted in New York City, Montgomery County in Maryland, and San Francisco.  

== Impact ==
The EITC is the largest [[poverty]] reduction program in the country.  Almost 21 million families received more than 36 billion dollars in refunds through the EITC in 2004.  These EITC dollars had a significant impact on the lives and communities of the nation&amp;rsquo;s lowest paid working people, lifting more than 5 million of these families above the federal poverty line. Since the poverty line can be a watermark for eligibility for state and federal benefits, taxpayers receiving the EITC are less eligible for [[entitlements]], and so the EITC reduces entitlement spending.

Economists suggest that every increased dollar received by low and moderate-income families has a [[multiplier]] effect of between 1.5 to 2 times the original amount, in terms of its impact on the local economy and how much money is spent in and around the communities where these families live.  Using the conservative estimate that for every $1 in EITC funds received, $1.50 ends up being spent locally, would mean that low income neighborhoods are effectively gaining as much as $18.4 billion. 

Research shows that the EITC has also boosted [[labor force participation]], particularly by low-educated single mothers. However, there is also evidence that this increase in labor supply has led to a [http://econrsss.anu.edu.au/~aleigh/pdf/EITC%20incidence.pdf fall in hourly wages] among those eligible for the credit.

== Uncollected tax credits ==

Millions of families who are eligible for the tax credit do not receive it, leaving billions of additional tax credit dollars uncollected.  Research by the [[General Accounting Office]] (GAO) and [[IRS]] indicates that between 15% and 25% of [[household|households]] who are entitled to the EITC do not claim their credit, or between 3.5 million and 7 million households.

The average EITC amount received per family in 2002 was $1,766. Using this figure and a 15% unclaimed rate would mean that low-wage workers and their families lost out on more than $6.5 billion, or more than $12 billion if the unclaimed rate is 25%.

{{Software-development-process}}

'''Extreme Programming''' (XP) is a [[software engineering]] [[methodology]] for the development of software projects. It prescribes a set of day-to-day [[Extreme_Programming#Practices|practices]] for developers and managers; the practices are meant to embody and encourage particular [[Extreme_Programming#Values|values]]. Proponents believe that the exercise of these practices, which are software engineering best practices taken to &quot;extreme&quot; levels, leads to a development process with the qualities prized by [http://agilemanifesto.org/ Agile Manifesto] signatories. This makes Extreme Programming the most prominent of several [[agile software development]] methodologies used to create software. Agile methodologies prioritize adaptability to changing requirements over the project predictability valued by more traditional methodologies. Some elements of the Extreme Programming methodology are [[Extreme Programming#Controversial aspects|controversial]].

== History ==
Extreme Programming was created by [[Kent Beck]], [[Ward Cunningham]], and [[Ron Jeffries]] during their work on the [[Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System]] (C3) project. Kent Beck became the C3 [[project leader]] in March 1996 and began to refine the development methodology used on the project. Kent Beck wrote a book on the methodology and in October 1999, ''Extreme Programming Explained'' was published. Chrysler cancelled the C3 project in February 2000, but the methodology had caught on in the [[software engineering]] field. [[As of 2006]], a number of software development projects continue to use Extreme Programming as their methodology.

=== Origins ===
Software development in the [[1990s]] was shaped by two major influences. Internally, [[object-oriented programming]] replaced [[procedural programming]] as the programming paradigm favored in the industry. Externally, the [[dot-com|dot-com boom]] emphasized speed to market and company growth as competitive business factors. Rapidly changing requirements demanded shorter [[Product life cycle management|product life-cycles]], and were often incompatible with traditional methods of software development.

The Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation project was started in order to determine the best way to use object technologies, using the payroll systems at Chrysler as the object of research, with [[Smalltalk]] as the language and [[GemStone]] as the persistence layer. They brought in [[Kent Beck]], a prominent Smalltalk practitioner, to do [[performance tuning]] on the system, but his role expanded as he noted several issues they were having with their development process. He took this opportunity to propose and implement some changes in their practices based on his work with his frequent collaborator, [[Ward Cunningham]].

:''The first time I was asked to lead a team, I asked them to do a little bit of the things I thought were sensible, like testing and reviews. The second time there was a lot more on the line. I thought, &quot;Damn the torpedoes, at least this will make a good article,&quot; [and] asked the team to crank up all the knobs to 10 on the things I thought were essential and leave out everything else.'' &amp;mdash;[http://www.informit.com/articles/article.asp?p=20972&amp;rl=1 Kent Beck]

Beck invited [[Ron Jeffries]] to the project to help develop and refine these methods. Jeffries thereafter acted as a kind of coach to instill the practices as habits in the C3 team.

Information about the principles and practices behind XP was disseminated to the wider world through discussions on the original [[Wiki|WikiWiki]], Cunningham's [[WikiWikiWeb]]. Various contributors discussed and expanded upon the ideas, and some spin-off methodologies resulted (see [[agile software development]]).

Beck edited a series of books on XP, beginning with his own ''[[Extreme Programming Explained]]'', spreading his ideas to a much larger yet very receptive audience. Authors in the series went through various aspects attending XP and its practices, even a book critical of the practices.

=== Current state ===
XP created quite a buzz in the late 1990s and early 2000s, seeing adoption in a number of environments radically different from its origins.

The high discipline required by the original practices often went by the wayside, causing certain practices to be deprecated or left undone on individual sites. Agile development practices have not stood still, and XP is still evolving, assimilating more lessons from experiences in the field. In the second edition of ''Extreme Programming Explained'', Beck added more values and practices and differentiated between primary and corollary practices.

== Goal of XP ==
''Extreme Programming Explained'' describes Extreme Programming as being:

* An attempt to reconcile humanity and productivity
* A mechanism for social change
* A path to improvement
* A style of development
* A software development discipline

The main aim of XP is to lower the cost of change. In traditional system development methods (like [[Structured Systems Analysis and Design Methodology|SSADM]]) the requirements for the system are determined at the beginning of the development project and often fixed from that point on. This means that the cost of changing the requirements at a later stage (a common feature of software engineering projects) will be high.

XP sets out to lower the cost of change by introducing basic values, principles and practices. By applying XP, a system development project should be more flexible with respect to changes.

== XP values ==
Extreme Programming initially recognized just four values but a new value was added in the second edition of ''Extreme Programming Explained''.  The five values are:

*[[Communication]]
*[[Simplicity]]
*[[Feedback]]
*[[Courage]]
*[[Respect]] (the latest value)

Building software systems requires '''communicating''' system requirements to the developers of the system.  In formal software development methodologies, this task is accomplished through documentation. Extreme Programming techniques can be viewed as methods for rapidly building and disseminating institutional knowledge among members of a development team.  The goal is to give all developers a shared view of the system which matches the view held by the users of the system.  To this end, Extreme Programming favors simple designs, metaphor, collaboration of users and programmers, frequent verbal communication and feedback.

Extreme Programming encourages starting with the '''simplest''' solution and [[refactoring]] to better ones. The difference between this approach and more conventional system development methods is the focus on designing and coding for the needs of today instead of those of tomorrow, next week, or next month. Proponents of XP acknowledge the disadvantage that this can sometimes entail more effort tomorrow to change the system; their claim is that this is more than compensated for by the advantage of not investing in possible future requirements that may change before they become relevant. Coding and designing for uncertain future requirements implies the risk of spending resources on something that might not be needed. Related to the &quot;communication&quot; value, simplicity in design and coding should improve the (quality of) communication. A simple design with very simple code can be easily understood by every programmer in the team.

Within Extreme Programming, '''feedback''' relates to different dimensions of the system development:
*Feedback from the system: by writing [[unit test]]s the programmers have direct feedback from the state of the system after implementing changes.
*Feedback from the customer: The functional tests (aka [[acceptance tests]]) are written by the customer and the testers. They will get concrete feedback about the current state of their system. This review is planned once in every two or three weeks so the customer can easily steer the development.
*Feedback from the team: When customers come up with new requirements in the planning game the team directly gives an estimation of the time that it will take to implement.

Feedback is closely related to communication and simplicity. Flaws in the system are easily communicated by writing a unit test that proves a certain piece of code will break. The direct feedback from the system tells programmers to recode this part. A customer is able to test the system periodically according to the functional requirements (aka [[user story|user stories]]). To quote [[Kent Beck]], &quot;Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming, feedback is the treatment.&quot;

Several practices embody '''courage'''. One is the commandment to always design and code for today and not for tomorrow. This is an effort to avoid getting bogged down in design and requiring a lot of effort to implement anything else. Courage enables developers to feel comfortable with [[refactoring]] their code when necessary. This means reviewing the existing system and modifying it so that future changes can be implemented more easily. Another example of courage is knowing when to throw code away. Every programmer has experienced getting stuck on a complex problem in their own design and code after working on it all day, then coming back the next day with a clear and fresh view and rapidly solving the problem in half an hour.

The '''respect''' value manifests in several ways. In Extreme Programming, team members respect each other because programmers never commit changes that break compilation, that make existing unit tests fail, or that otherwise delay the work of their peers. Members respect their work by always striving for high quality and seeking for the best design for the solution at hand through refactoring.

== Principles ==
The principles that form the basis of XP are based on the values just described and are intended to foster decisions in a system development project. The principles are intended to be more concrete than the values and more easily translated to guidance in a practical situation.

'''Feedback''' is most useful if it is done rapidly. The time between an action and its feedback is critical to learning and making changes. In Extreme Programming, unlike traditional system development methods, contact with the customer occurs in small iterations. The customer has clear insight into the system that is being developed. He or she can give progress feedback and steer the development as needed.

Unit tests also contribute to the rapid feedback principle. When writing code, the unit test provides direct feedback as to how the system reacts to the changes one has made. If, for instance, the changes affect a part of the system that is not in the scope of the programmer who made them, that programmer will not notice the flaw. There is a large chance that this bug will appear when the system is in production.

'''Assuming simplicity''' is about treating every problem as if it can be solved &quot;extremely simply&quot;. Traditional system development methods say to plan for the future and to code for reusability. Extreme programming rejects these ideas.

The advocates of Extreme Programming say that making big changes all at once does not work. Extreme Programming applies '''incremental changes''': for example, a system might have small releases every three weeks. By making many little steps the customer has more control over the development process and the system that is being developed.

The principle of '''embracing change''' is about not working against changes but embracing them. For instance, if at one of the iterative meetings it appears that the customer's requirements have changed dramatically, programmers are to embrace this and plan the new requirements for the next iteration.

== Activities ==
XP describes four basic activities that are performed within the software development process.

=== Coding ===
The advocates of XP argue that the only truly important product of the system development process is code (a concept to which they give a somewhat broader definition than might be given by others). Without [[coding]] you have nothing.

Coding can be drawing diagrams that will generate code, scripting a web-based system or programming an object-oriented C# program that needs to be compiled.

Coding can also be used to figure out the most suitable solution. For instance, XP would advocate that faced with several alternatives for a programming problem, one should simply code all solutions and determine with automated tests (discussed in the next section) what solution is most suitable.

Coding can also help to communicate thoughts about programming problems. A programmer dealing with a complex programming problem and finding it hard to explain the solution to fellow programmers might code it and use the code to demonstrate what he or she means. Code, say the exponents of this position, is always clear and concise and cannot be interpreted in more than one way. Other programmers can give feedback on this code by also coding their thoughts.

=== Testing ===
One cannot be certain of anything unless one has tested it. [[Software testing|Testing]] is not a perceived, primary need for the customer. A lot of software is shipped without proper testing and still works (more or less).
In software development, XP says this means that one cannot be certain that a function works unless one tests it. This raises the question of defining what one can be uncertain about.

*You can be uncertain whether what you coded is what you meant. To test this uncertainty, XP uses [[Unit test|Unit Tests]]. These are automated tests that test the code. The programmer will try to write as many tests he or she can think of that might break the code he or she is writing; if all tests run successfully then the coding is complete.

*You can be uncertain whether what you meant is what you should have meant. To test this uncertainty, XP uses acceptance tests based on the requirements given by the customer in the exploration phase of release planning.

=== Listening ===
Programmers don't necessarily know anything about the business side of the system under development. The function of the system is determined by the business side. For the programmers to find what the functionality of the system should be, they have to [[listen]] to business.

Programmers have to listen &quot;in the large&quot;: they have to listen to what the customer needs. Also, they have to try to understand the business problem, and to give the customer feedback about his or her problem, to improve the customer's own understanding of his or her problem.

Communication between the customer and programmer is further addressed in The Planning Game (see below).

=== Designing ===
From the point of view of simplicity, one could say that system development doesn't need more than coding, testing and listening. If those activities are performed well, the result should always be a system that works. In practice, this will not work. One can come a far way without [[design]]ing but at a given time one will get stuck. The system becomes too complex and the dependencies within the system cease to be clear.

One can avoid this by creating a design structure that organizes the logic in the system. Good design will avoid lots of dependencies within a system; this means that changing one part of the system will not affect other parts of the system.

== Practices ==
{{details|Extreme Programming Practices}}

Extreme Programming has 12 practices, grouped into four areas, derived from the [[best practices]] of [[software engineering]]:

'''Fine scale feedback'''
* [[Pair Programming]]
* Planning Game
* [[Test-driven development|Test Driven Development]]
* Whole Team

'''Continuous process'''
* Continuous Integration
* Design Improvement
* Small Releases

'''Shared understanding'''
* Coding Standard
* Collective Code Ownership
* Simple Design
* System Metaphor

'''Programmer welfare'''
* Sustainable Pace

== Controversial aspects ==
The most controversial aspect of Extreme Programming is the [[change management]] aspect of the process. More formal software development processes require [[change request]]s to be analyzed and approved by a [[change control board]]. In Extreme Programming, the on-site customer makes changes informally, often by verbally informing the development team. Proponents of Extreme Programming claim this makes the process flexible, and saves the cost of formal overhead. Critics of Extreme Programming claim this can lead to costly [[rework]] and project [[scope creep]].

Other controversial aspects of Extreme Programming include:

* Requirements are expressed as automated acceptance tests rather than specification documents.
* Requirements are defined incrementally, rather than trying to get them all in advance.
* Software developers are required to work in pairs.
* There is no [[Big Design Up Front]]. Most of the [[design activity]] takes place on the fly and incrementally, starting with &quot;the simplest thing that could possibly work&quot; and adding complexity only when it's required by failing tests. Critics fear this would result in more re-design effort than only re-designing when requirements change.
* A [[customer representative]] is attached to the [[project]]. This role can become a single-point-of-failure for the project and some people have found it to be a source of stress.

It used to be thought that Extre0 barrels per day; to date no exploitable site has been identified. An agreement between [[Argentina]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1995 seeks to defuse licensing and sovereignty conflicts that would dampen foreign interest in exploiting potential oil reserves.

'''By plane'''
 
FIGAS plane on the airstrip at Sea Lion IslandTraveling between islands in the Falklands is generally done using the Falkland Islands Government Air Service (FIGAS). The planes are Britten Norman Islander aircraft, capable of carrying eight passengers plus pilot. Be aware, however, that passenger load may be reduced depending on the condition of the airstrips being visited; outside of Stanley, all airstrips in the Falklands are either dirt strips or grassy fields. Be prepared for slight delays while livestock is cleared from airstrips prior to takeoff/landing! 

Flights leave twice daily from the airstrip just outside of Stanley and travel to a variety of locations throughout the country. Baggage is limited to 14 kg per person (strictly enforced), with a charge of £0.60 per additional kilogram, space permitting. Note that unless the plane is flying to an island with a very poor landing strip there are almost never space constraints that would prevent traveling with a few extra kilos of baggage. 

Reservations are required for travel and should be booked at least 24 hours in advance. Booking reservations can be done either by calling the airport (Tel: 27219). Flight schedules are announced the night before departure and are also available via a fax service; most lodges will post the schedule as soon as it is announced. 

Fares vary by destination, but sample fares from November 2004 were: 

*Stanley to Sea Lion Island: £47.67 
*Sea Lion Island to Saunders Island: £54.16 
*Saunders Island to Pebble Island: £21.12 
*Pebble Island to Stanley: £53.57 

'''By boat'''

While it is theoretically possible to get around the Falklands by boat, as of October 2004 there was no regular service available to tourists traveling in small groups (contrary to reports in guide books, the Golden Fleece does not taxi passengers around the islands). For large groups it may be possible to charter a boat in advance, thus providing a great way to visit some of the less-traveled islands (be aware that per-passenger landing fees are charged on many of the islands; contact the island's owner before visiting). 

Large cruise ships are the most common means for people to visit the Falklands, and most will make several landings at various islands. Note that aside from Stanley all landings from cruise ships are done using zodiacs, and in many cases the lack of docking areas will require a quick wade from the zodiac onto shore. 

'''By taxi'''

Within Stanley there are two taxi services that can be hired for travel throughout the town and surrounding areas, including the Mt. Pleasant airport. 

'''By Landrover'''

Landrover rental may be possible from Stanley. Contact either the Falkland Islands Company or Stanley Services for information. Roads in Stanley are paved, but elsewhere road conditions range from well-maintained dirt roads to boggy mud streams. Unless your travels specifically require having your own vehicle, renting a Landrover is neither necessary nor a particularly good idea.

The '''Falkland Islands''' are an overseas territory of the [[United Kingdom]] and as such rely on the UK for guarantee of their security. The other UK territories in the [[South Atlantic]], [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]], fall under the protection of the [[British forces]] on the Falklands (known as '''Falkland Islands Defence Forces''', '''British Forces Falkland Islands''' or the '''Falklands Garrison'''), which includes commitments from the [[British Army]], [[Royal Air Force]] and [[Royal Navy]].

The maintenance of only a token military force before the [[Falklands War]] allowed [[Argentina]] to start that conflict by easily capturing the islands. Following the reclamation of the territory in [[1982]], the UK invested heavily in the defence of the islands, the centre-piece of which is the new airfield at [[RAF Mount Pleasant]], 25 miles west of the previous base at [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]]. The base was opened in [[1985]].

==Royal Air Force==

RAF Mount Pleasant, built following the surrender of Argentine invasion forces, is capable of accepting trans-Atlantic aircraft such as the [[Lockheed]] [[Lockheed L-1011|Tristar]]. The Tristar was purchased mainly for the UK-Falklands route, until their [[entry into service]] leased [[Boeing 747|747s]] and [[Boeing 767|767s]] performed air transport. 

The RAF's [[RAF Tornado F3|Tornado F3s]] provide air defence for the islands and surrounding territories. The four aircraft, and the crews that fly them, are rotated with UK based assets. The aircraft are housed in non-hardened shelters, sixteen of which were built for surge operations in time of tension or hostility.

The [[VC10]] provides air transport and aerial refueling for the fighters. When a fighter is launched it almost immediately followed by the VC10 as changeable weather conditions might make diversion to another airfield necessary. The C-130K provides resupply missions through the use of air-drops and also carries out maritime patrol. The latter is an important mission to the Falkland Islands government as the Hercules verifies that all fishing vessels are licensed; at £1,000 per licence per season this is an extremely lucrative source of income.

The [[helicopter]]s of 78 Sqn provide air transport missions. The [[Sea King]]s and the [[Chinook]] also carry out short and medium range [[search and rescue]] missions respectively.

===Organisation===

*[[No. 1435 Flight RAF|No. 1435 Flight]] &amp;ndash; 4 [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado F3]]s
*[[No. 1312 Flight RAF|No. 1312 Flight]] &amp;ndash; 1 [[Vickers VC10]], 1 [[C-130 Hercules|Hercules C3]]
*[[No. 78 Squadron RAF|No. 78 Squadron]] &amp;ndash; 2 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] HAR.3s, 1 [[CH-47 Chinook|Chinook]] [[RAF Chinook|HC.2]]

==Royal Navy==

The [[Royal Navy]] maintain a presence in the area with a [[frigate]] or [[destroyer]] in the South Atlantic and a patrol ship permanently close to the islands. In addition an Ice Patrol Ship, [[HMS Endurance (A171)|HMS ''Endurance'']], is on station close to [[Antarctica]] for 6 months of the year. 

The warship carries out the [[Standing Royal Navy deployments|South Atlantic Patrol Task]] mission which &quot;provides a maritime presence to protect the UK's interests in the region&quot;. Currently the [[Type 42 destroyer]] [[HMS Southampton (D90)|HMS ''Southampton'']] performs the South Atlantic Patrol Task having taken over from [[HMS Cardiff (D108)|HMS ''Cardiff'']] when she was decommissioned in August [[2005]]. 

The Falkland Islands Patrol ship is a [[Castle class patrol vessel|Castle class]] vessel. Currently [[HMS Dumbarton Castle (P265)|HMS ''Dumbarton Castle'']] patrols the waters of the Falkland Islands having taken over from a 3 year deployment by [[HMS Leeds Castle (P258)|HMS ''Leeds Castle'']] when she returned to the UK to be decommissioned at the same time as Cardiff. In 2007 [[HMS Clyde (2007)|''HMS Clyde'']] will relieve [[HMS Dumbarton Castle (P265)|HMS Dumbarton Castle]] and [[HMS Leeds Castle (P258)|HMS Leeds Castle]], currently under construction by VT Group shipbuilders in Portsmouth, it is planned that she will stay permanently in the South Atlantic until 2012.

The Royal Navy also has submarines that it can deploy to the area, though such deployments are secret.

== Army ==

The [[British Army]] maintains a small garrison on the Falkland Islands based at Mount Pleasant. The total deployment is about 500 personnel made up of a Company Group, an Engineer Squadron, a Signals Unit, a Logistics Group and Supporting Services.[http://www.army.mod.uk/aroundtheworld/flk/index.htm]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Pre-Norse history==
The early details of '''[[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] history''' are rather nebulous. It is possible that [[Saint Brendan]], an Irish [[monk]] (a [[Papar]]) sailed past the islands during his [[North Atlantic]] voyage in the [[6th century]]. He saw an 'Island of Sheep' and a 'Paradise of Birds', which some say could be the Faroes with its dense bird population and sheep. 

In the late 600s to early 700s the islands were visited by monks from [[Ireland]], possibly looking for converts or solitude. Little is known about them, except that they used the Faroes (and [[Iceland]]) as a [[hermitage]]. As these monks were [[celibate]] and lived in all-male communities, their populations had to be replenished from the [[British Isles]].

== Pre-14th century ==
Little is known about Faroese history up until the [[14th century]]. The main historical source for this period is the [[13th century]] work [[Færeyinga Saga]] (Saga of the Faroese), and it is disputed as to how much of this work is historical fact.

[[Færeyinga Saga]] only exists today as copies in other sagas. In particular three manuscripts called [[Ólafs Saga Tryggvasonar]], [[Flateyjarbók]] and one registered as [[AM 62 fol]].

According to [[Flateyjarbók]] [[Grímr Kamban]] settled in Faroe when [[Harald I of Norway|Harald Hårfagre]] was king of Norway (([[872]] – [[930]]). But this version does not correspond with the writings of [[Dicuil]], an Irish monk in the [[Frankish Kingdom]] who wrote about the countries in the north. [[Ólafs Saga Tryggvasonar]], however, does. According to that manuscript [[Færeyinga Saga]] start like this:

''There was a man named Grímr Kamban; he first settled in Faroe. But in the days of Harold Fairhair many men fled before the king’s overbearing. Some settled in Faroe and began to dwell there, and others sought to other waste lands.''

According to this many men did indeed flee from [[Harald I of Norway|Harald Hårfagre]]. But the text suggests that Grímr Kamban settled in the Faroes some time before. Maybe even hundreds of years. The firstname ''Grímr'' is norse. But the lastname ''Kamban'' is Irish. He may have been of mixed norse and Irish origin and come from a settlement in the [[Great Britain|British isles]]. If many men settled in the Faroes in the reign of Harald Hårfagre, people must have known about the Faroes. And therefore someone may have settled or visited there some time before.

According to Færeyinga Saga there was an ancient institution on the headland [[Tinganes]] in [[Tórshavn]] on the island of [[Streymoy]]. This was an ''Alþing'' or Althing (All-council.) This was the place where laws were made and disputes solved. All free men had the right to meet in the Alþing. It was a parliament and law court for all, thus the name. Historians estimate the Alþing to have been established from 800 to 900.

The islands were converted to [[Christianity]] around the year [[1000]], with a church based at [[Kirkjubøur]], southern [[Streymoy]] with 33 bishops. The Faroes became a part of the Kingdom of Norway in [[1035]].

Early in the [[11th century]] Sigmund or [[Sigmundur Brestisson]], whose family had flourished in the southern islands but had been almost exterminated by invaders from the northern, was sent from Norway, whither he had escaped, to take possession of the islands for [[Olaf Tryggvason]], king of Norway. He introduced Christianity, and, though he was subsequently murdered, Norwegian supremacy was upheld and continued until 1380, when the islands became part of the double monarchy Denmark/Norway. The islands were still a possession of the norwegian crown since the crowns had not been joined. In [[1380]] the Alþting was renamed the [[Løgting]], though it was by now little more than a law court.

== Foreign commercial interest: 14th century to Second World War ==


The 14th century saw the start of what would prove to be a long era of foreign enroachment in the Faroese economy. At this time trading regulations were set up so that all Faroese commerce had to pass through [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]], Norway in order to collect customs tax. Meanwhile, the [[Hanseatic League]] was gaining in power, threatening Scandinavian commerce. Though Norway tried to halt this process it was forced to relent after the [[Black Death]] decimated its population.

[[England|English]] adventurers gave great trouble to the inhabitants in the [[16th century]], and the name of [[Magnus Heinason]], a native of [[Streymoy]], who was sent by [[Frederick II of Denmark and Norway|Frederick II]] to clear the seas, is still celebrated in many songs and stories. 

In [[1535]] [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]] tried to wrest power from King [[Christian II]]. Several of the powerful German companies backed Christian II, but he eventually lost power. The new King Christian III gave the German trader [[Thomas Köppen]] exclusive trading rates in the [[Faroes]]. These rights were subject to the following conditions: only good quality goods were to be supplied by the Faroese and were to be made in numbers proportionate to the rest of the market; the goods were to be brought at their market value; and the traders were to deal fairly and honestly with the Faroese. 

Christian III also introduced [[Lutheran Protestantism]] to the Faroes, to replace [[Catholicism]]. This process took five years to complete, in which time Danish was used instead of [[Latin]] and church property was transferred to the state. The bishopric at Kirkjubøur, south of [[Torshavn|Tórshavn]], where remains of the cathedral may be seen, was also abolished.

After Köppen, others took over the trading monopoly, though the economy suffered as a result of the war between Denmark and Sweden. During this period of the monopoly most Faroese goods ([[wool]] products, fish, meat) were taken to the [[Netherlands]] where they were sold at pre-determined prices. However, the guidelines of the trading agreement were often ignored or corrupted. This caused delays and shortages in Faroese supplies. Subsequently they produced poorer quality goods, and received poorer quality goods themselves. With the trading monopoly nearing collapse smuggling and piracy were rife. Denmark tried to solve the problem by giving the Faroes to [[Christoffer von Gabel]] (and later on his son, Frederick) as a personal feudal estate. However, von Gabel was harsh and repressive, breeding much resentment from the Faroese. This caused Denmark, in the [[17th century]], to take the islands and trading monopoly back themselves. However, they too struggled to keep the economy going, and many merchants were running at a loss. Finally, on the 1st January [[1856]] the trading monopoly was abolished.

[[Denmark]] retained possession of the [[Faroes]] at the [[Peace of Kiel]] in [[1814]], but lost [[Norway]].

In [[1816]] the [[Løgting]] (the Faroese parliament) was officially abolished and replaced by a Danish judiciary. Danish was introduced as the main language, whilst Faroese was discouraged. In [[1849]] a new constitution came into power in Denmark. This new constitution was announced in the Faroes in 1850, giving the Faroese two seats in the [[Rigsdag]] (Danish parliament). However, the Faroese managed to re-establish the [[Løgting]] as a county council with an advisory role in 1952, with many people hoping to eventually achieve independence. The late 1800's saw increasing support for the home rule/independence movement, though not all people supported it. Meanwhile, the Faroese economy was growing with the introduction of large-scale fishing. The Faroese were allowed access to the large Danish waters in the North Atlantic. Living standards subsequently improved and there was a population increase. Faroese became a standardised written language in [[1890]].

During the [[World War II|Second World War]] Denmark was invaded and occupied by [[Nazi Germany]]. The [[Great Britain|British]] subsequently took control of the Faroes to stop the same thing happening to the Faroes and thus losing important shipping lines. The [[Løgting]] was set up as a legislative body, with a Danish prefect retaining executive power. The Faroese [[Merkið|flag]] was recognized by British authorities. Some people tried to declare complete independence in this period.

== Post-WWII: Home Rule ==
A high degree of self-governance was attained in [[1948]] with the passing of the Act of Faroese Home Rule. Faroese was now an official language, though Danish is still taught as a second language in schools. The Faroese [[Merkið|flag]] was also officially recognised by Danish authorities.

In [[1973]] Denmark joined the [[European Community]] (now European Union). The Faroes refused to join, mainly over the issue of fishing limits.

The 1980's saw an increase in support for Faroese independence. Unemployment was very low, and the Faroese were enjoying one of the world's highest standards of living. The Faroese economy though was almost entirely reliant on fishing. The early 1990's saw a dramatic slump in fish stocks, which were being overfished with new high-tech equipment. During the same period the government was also enagaged in massive overspending, associated with the [[Big 80s]]. National debt was now at 9.4 billion Danish krones (DKK). Finally, in October [[1992]], the Faroese national bank (Sjóvinnurbankin) called in receivers and were forced into asking Denmark for a broad financial bailout. The initial sum was 500 million DKK, though this enetually grew to 1.8 billion DKK (this was in addition to the annual grant of 1 billion DKK). Austerity measures were introduced: public spending was cut, there was a [[tax]] and [[VAT]] increase and public employees were given a 10% wage-cut. Much of the fishing industry was put into recievership, with talk of cutting down on the number of fish-farms and ships.

It was during this period  that many Faroese (6%) decided to emigrate, mainly to Denmark. Unemployment rose, up to as much as 20% in [[Tórshavn]], with it being higher in the outlying islands.
In [[1993]] the Sjóvinnurbankin merged with the Faroes second largest bank, Føroya Banki. A third was declared bankrupt and folded. Meanwhile, there was a growing international boycott of Faroese produce over the [[grindadráp]] (whaling) issue. The independence movement dissolved on the one hand while Denmark found itself left with the Faroe Islands' unpaid bills on the other. 

The measures largely worked. Unemployment peaked in January [[1994]] at 26%, since which it fell (10% in mid-[[1996]], 5% in April [[2000]]). The fishing industry was not curtailed as much as was being considered, so it survived largely intact. Fish stocks also rose, with the annual catch being 100,000 in 1994, to 150,000 in [[1995]]. In [[1998]] it was 375,000. Emigration also fell to 1% in 1995, and there was a small population increase in 1996. Oil has been discovered nearby as well. By the early 2000's, weakness in the Faroese economy had been eliminated and, accordingly, many minds turned once again to the possibility of independence from Denmark. However, a planned referendum on a roadmap towards independence in [[2001]] was called off following Danish Prime Minister [[Poul Nyrup Rasmussen]] saying that Danish money grants would be phased out within four years if there was a 'yes' vote.

The Faroese ethnic group is of primarily norse viking descent or irish.

The [[Faroe Islands]] are an [[island]] group off the coast of Northern [[Europe]], between the [[Norwegian Sea]] and the north [[Atlantic Ocean]], about one-half of the way from [[Iceland]] to [[Norway]]. Its coordinates are 
{{coor d|62|N|7|W|}}. It is 1,399 square kilometres in area, and includes no major lakes or rivers. There are 1,117 kilometres of coastline, and no land boundaries with any other country. 

The Faroe Islands generally have cool summers and mild winters, with a usually overcast sky and frequent [[fog]] and heavy [[wind]]s. Although at a high latitude, due to the [[Gulf Stream]], their climate is ameliorated. The islands are rugged and rocky with some low peaks; the coasts are mostly bordered by cliffs. The Faroes are notable for having the highest sea cliffs in Europe, and some of the highest in the world otherwise. The lowest point is at [[sea level]], and the highest is at [[Slættaratindur]], which is 882 metres above sea level. The landscape made roadbuiling difficult, and only recently has this been remedied by building tunnels.

Many of the Faroese islands tend to be long and thin. Their appearance on a map has been likened by some to sliced bread. 

[[Natural resource]]s include [[fish]], [[whale]]s and [[hydropower]].

'''Politics of the [[Faroe Islands]]''' takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[dependency]], whereby the [[Prime Minister of the Faroe Islands]] is the [[head of government]], and of a pluriform multi-party system. The [[Faroe Islands]] are part of the Kingdom of [[Denmark]], but have been self-governing since [[1948]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the [[Løgting]]. 
The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature and the responsibility of Denmark. 
There are currently 36 municipalities.

The high commissioner is appointed by the [[Queen of Denmark]]. Following legislative elections, the leader of the party that wins the most seats is usually elected prime minister by the Faroese Parliament. He leads the Landsstyri elected by the [[Faroese Parliament]].

==Legislative branch==
The '''[[Løgting|Faroese Parliament]]''' (''Løgtingið in [[Faroese_language|Faroese]]'') has up to 32 MP's(member of parliament), elected for a four year term by [[proportional representation]].

Election of 2 seats to the Danish Parliament was last held on [[8 February]] [[2005]]: Republican Party 1, People's Party 1.

== Political parties and elections ==
{{elect|List of political parties in the Faroe Islands|Elections in the Faroe Islands}}
The Faroe Islands have a [[multi-party]] system (disputing on independence and unionism as well as left and right), with numerous [[political parties|parties]] in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and [[political parties|parties]] must work with each other to form [[coalition government]]s.The Faroese Parliament ([[Løgting]]) has 27 - 32 seats. Members are elected by popular vote on a proportional basis from the seven constituencies to serve four-year terms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Economy - overview:'''
After the severe economic troubles of the early 1990's, brought on by a drop in the vital [[fish]] catch, the [[Faroe Islands]] have come back in the last few years, with unemployment down to 5% in mid-1998. Nevertheless, the almost total dependence on fishing means the economy remains extremely vulnerable. The Faroese hope to broaden their economic base by building new fish-processing plants. [[Petroleum]] finds close to the Faroese area give hope for deposits in the immediate area, which may lay the basis to sustained economic prosperity. The Faroese are supported by a substantial annual subsidy from [[Denmark]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== History ==
The general history of the [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] transportation-system can be summed up into 4 general periods: 
*In the first period stretching from the feudal era into the beginning of the 20th century transportation was made mainly by a combination of rowboats and walking/carrying - including horse-transport in certain places and upper social classes.
*In the second period, starting in the late 19th century the ferry-connections start to emerge. First through private initiatives and in the 20th century increasingly transforming into public transport further supplemented by the emerging automobilism, especially during and between the two world wars. After World War II a large part of the Faroe Islands was reachable through a combination of ferries and automobiles - frequently private buses and taxis.
*The third period included a modernization of the ferries, introducing the car-ferries, making it possible to drive between the large centres of the country. Soon it would be possible to drive all the way from the capital of [[Tórshavn]] to [[Vágur]] and [[Tvøroyri]] in the south, to [[Fuglafjørður]] and [[Klaksvík]] in the north and to the airport at [[Sørvágur]] in the west, that was established by the British during the 2nd world war. During this second period the road network was further extended and supplemented by tunnels to distant valleys and firths such as [[Hvalba]], [[Sandvík]] and [[Norðdepil]] in the 1960s. Thus the third period stretches from the 2nd world war to around 1970.
*The fourth period starts a completely new development. In the 1973 the first solid connections between two islands was established between [[Norðskála]] on [[Eysturoy]] and [[Nesvík]] on [[Streymoy]]. In 1976 the new tunnel between [[Norðskála]] and the rest of [[Eysturoy]] was established, and together with the bridge this meant that the two largest islands were suddenly connected into what is now referred to as &quot;Meginlandið&quot; - (the Mainland). In 1975 the &quot;bridge&quot; between [[Viðoy]] and [[Borðoy]] was established, and in 1986 the &quot;bridge&quot; between [[Borðoy]] and [[Kunoy]] was established, and in 1992 the capital [[Tórshavn]] was granted a 1st class connection to the northern parts of the country, creating the infrastructural prepositions for a new mobile society on the Mainland. The newest developments of the Faroese transportation network are the sub-sea tunnels. In 2002 the tunnel between [[Streymoy]] and [[Vágar]] - the last is the airport-island - was finished, and in 2006 the tunnel between [[Eysturoy]] and [[Borðoy]] will be finished. In 2006 more than 85% of the Faroese population will be mutually reachable by automobile.

The main problem of the Faroe Islands is therefore not the internal transportation-network, but rather the external transport-possibilities. There are practically no other travel- or freight-possibilities but ships and airplanes. This means that export of domestically produced commodities is very expensive harming the development of a commodity-based economy.

== [[Railway]]s ==
There are no railways on the Faroe Islands, due to the difficult landscape and the relatively short distances. Instead roads have become the main [[transport]] artery of the society.

Although free education through the university level also is available, only about one child in four receives a higher education in the highly competitive system. In the mid-1970s, the educational system was reformed with the goal of equalizing educational opportunities. Beginning at age seven, all Finnish children are required to attend a comprehensive school (peruskoulu) of nine grade levels (six primary and three secondary). After this, they may elect to continue along an academic (lukio) or vocational (ammattikoulu) line, although it is not mandatory to continue studying after that point. About 60% select the academic line. The number of openings in higher educational institutions is less than the demand. The education is based in Finnish or Swedish language. It is also now possible to study in English from primary up to University. 

Finland generally welcomes foreign investment. Areas of particular interest for investors are specialized high-tech companies and investments. The good infrastructure in Finland has enhanced Finland's position as a gateway to [[Russia]].

According to [[Transparency International]], Finland has the lowest level of [[political corruption|corruption]] in all the countries [[index_of_perception_of_corruption|studied in their survey]].

Finland is experiencing rapidly increasing integration with Western Europe: Finland was one of the 11 countries joining ([[Greece]] joined later) the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]] (EMU) on [[1 January]] [[1999]]. The national currency markka (FIM) in circulation was withdrawn and replaced by euro (EUR) in the beginning of 2002.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''transport system of [[Finland]]''' is developed. [[As of 2005]], the country's network of main roads has a total length of 13 258 km, and is mainly centred on the capital city of [[Helsinki]]. The total length of all public roads is 78 186 km, of which 50 616 km are paved. The [[motorway]] network is still to a great extent under development, and currently totals 653 km. There are 5 865 km of [[railway]]s in the country. Helsinki has an urban rail network, and [[light rail]] systems are currently being planned in [[Turku]] and [[Tampere]]. Finland has 148 airports, the largest being [[Helsinki-Vantaa Airport]], and a considerable number of large ports.

The government ministry responsible for transport in the [[Ministry of Transport and Communications (Finland)|Ministry of Transport and Communications]].

== Roads ==
[[Road]] transport in Finland is the most popular method of transportation, particularly in rural areas where the railway network does not extend to. There are around 78 000 km of public roads, most of which are paved. The main road network comprises over 13 000 km of road, mostly in the south of the country and along the west coast. 63% of all traffic on public roads takes place on main roads, which are divided into class I (''valtatie'') and class II (''kantatie'') main roads. [[Motorway]]s have been constructed in the country since the [[1970s]], but they are still reasonably rare, as the country's motorway network is still very much under construction. There are 653 km of motorways, and only one route has been finished as a full-length motorway.

Speed limits change depending on the time of the year; the maximum speed limit on motorways is 120 km/h (75 mph) in the summer and 100 km/h (62 mph) in the winter. The main roads usually have speed limits of either 100 km/h or 80 km/h (50 mph). Speed limits in urban areas range between 30 km/h (19 mph) and 60 km/h (37 mph). Finland, like most other European countries, has [[Side of the road (traffic)|right-hand traffic]].

There are no [[toll road]]s in Finland.

[[As of 2004]], there are 2 727 160 [[car]]s in Finland, giving a total of 521 cars per a thousand inhabitants. Thus, the average citizen is less likely to own a car in Finland than in other European countries. This is despite the fact that Finland has one of the highest average [[Gross Domestic Product|GDPs]] in Europe, and probably results to the high quality of public transport in the country.

=== Coaches and buses ===
[[Coach]]es are mainly operated by private companies and provide services widely across the country. There is a large network of [[ExpressBus]] services with connections to all major cities and the most important rural areas. Coach stations are operated by [[Matkahuolto]].

Local bus services inside cities and towns are often tightly regulated by the councils. Many councils also have their own bus operators, such as [[Helsinki City Transport]], which operate some bus lines on a commercial basis in competition with privately owned providers. Regional bus lines are generally less strictly regulated, leading to [[cartel]] situations like [[TLO]] in the [[Turku]] region, but strong regional regulating bodies like the [[Helsinki Metropolitan Area Council]] (YTV) exist as well.

== Railways ==
The Finnish [[railway]] network consists of a total of 5,865 km of railways. Passenger trains are operated by the state-owned [[VR Group]]. They serve all the major cities and many rural areas, though railway connections are available to fewer places than bus connections. Most passenger train services originate or terminate at [[Helsinki Central railway station]], and a large proportion of the passenger rail network radiates out of Helsinki.

High-speed [[Pendolino]] services are operated from Helsinki to other major cities, mainly to [[Tampere]] and [[Turku]]. Modern [[InterCity]] services complement the Pendolino network, and the cheaper and older long and short distance trains operate in areas with less passengers.

The Helsinki metropolitan area has three [[urban rail]] systems: a [[Helsinki tram|tramway system]], [[Helsinki Metro]], and the [[VR lähiliikenne]] commuter rail system. [[Light rail]] systems are currently being planned for [[Turku]] and [[Tampere]], two of the country's other major urban centres.

== Air transport ==
There are 148 airports, 76 of which have paved runways. By far the largest airport is [[Helsinki-Vantaa Airport]]. Other international airports include [[Turku Airport]] and [[Tampere-Pirkkala Airport]]. The larger airports are managed by the state-owned [[Finavia]] agency (formerly the Finnish Civil Aviation Administration), while the smaller ones are usually managed by municipal authorities.

The '''Finnish Defence Forces''' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''Puolustusvoimat''; [[Swedish  language|Swedish]] ''Försvarsmakten'') consist of 34,700 people in uniform (27,300 army, 3,000 navy, and 4,400 air force). [[Finland]]'s defence budget equals about 1.4% of the [[Gross_domestic_product|GDP]]. A universal male [[conscription]] is in place, under which all men above 18 years of age serve from 6 to 12 months, although service for [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] is not mandatory and inhabitants of [[Åland]] have a different system in place. Also a 13-month-long [[conscientious objector|non-military service]] is possible. As of 1995, women were permitted to serve on a voluntary basis. The defence is based on a large trained reserve. Finland can mobilize 490,000 trained military personnel in a crisis situation.

The Finnish Defence Forces are under the command of the Chief of Defence, who is directly subordinate to the [[President of Finland|President of the Republic]] in matters related to the military command. At the moment (February 2006) the Chief of Defence is Admiral [[Juhani Kaskeala]].

Military doctrine: Self-defensive; independent defence of all of domestic territory; [[NATO]] Partnership for Peace affiliate; committed to pan-European (incl. Russia) treaty of trust-enhancing cooperation, such as providing access for international observers during major exercises.  

In 2005 the Finnish defence ministry announced a cost-cutting plan. The [[Helsinki Air Defence Regiment]] in [[Hyrylä]] and the [[Savo Brigade]] in [[Mikkeli]] will be disbanded in [[2007]]. At the same time Kotka Coastal Command will be disbanded and its duties will be taken over by other units.

==Military branches==
*[[Finnish Army]] (Maavoimat)
*[[Finnish Navy]] (Merivoimat)
*[[Finnish Air Force]] (Ilmavoimat)

The [[Finnish Frontier Guard|Frontier Guard]] (Rajavartiolaitos) is under the Ministry of the Interior but can be incorporated into the Defence Forces when required by defence readiness.

The rank of ''sotamies'' is not actually given to new recruits anymore, although it was used earlier. The lowest rank is given according to specialization; in the infantry the rank is ''jääkäri'' ([[Jäger (military)|Jaeger]]), artillery has ''tykkimies'' (artilleryman), communications has ''viestimies'' (signaller), [[Guard Jaeger Regiment]] has ''kaartinjääkäri'', and so on. Generally file and rank may be referred to as ''sotamiehet''.

Obsolete ranks include: ''ylivääpeli/överfältväbel'' (a rank between Chief Warrant Officer and Warrant Officer), ''kornetti'' (Second Lieutenant in the [[cavalry]]), ''ratsumestari'' (a cavalry Captain), ''prikaati&lt;u&gt;n&lt;/u&gt;kenraali'' (old form for ''prikaatikenraali'') and ''lentomestari''.

:Semi-obsolete ranks include those of warrant officers (''vääpeli'', ''sotilasmestari''), as since training of full-time employed NCOs ended in 2001, and those who have recently graduated from the NCO academy usually hold the rank of a Second Lieutenant or a Lieutenant. Those who hold the ranks of ''vääpeli'' or ''sotilasmestari'' are soon to be retired or have been promoted to Second Lieutenant or a Lieutenant to do away with the obsolete ranks. 2001 onwards, the [[National Defence College]] train all new commissioned officers . These obsolete ranks are still used for NCOs in the reserve. The highest attainable rank for conscripts at the end of their mandatory service are lance corporal (file and rank), sergeant (NCOs) and second lieutenant/vänrikki (automatic promotion for officer ''&quot;students&quot;'', in practise the most senior NCO conscripts).

[[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]] is the only person to have held the title of ''Sotamarsalkka/Fältmarskalk'' ([[Field Marshal]]) and later ''Suomen marsalkka/Marskalk av Finland'' ([[Marshal of Finland]]). Note that both ''Sotamarsalkka'' and ''Suomen marsalkka'' were officially not military ranks, but rather honorary titles. In practice ''Sotamarsalkka'' was treated as a rank, and it had a distinctive rank insignia. As ''Suomen marsalkka'' Mannerheim continued to wear the insignia of ''sotamarsalkka''.

== History ==
The autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] had its of [[Military of the Grand Duchy of Finland|standing army]] and its own system of [[conscription]]. The [[Guard of Finland]] fought alongside the [[Imperial Russia|imperial]] army in several of Russias wars.  [[Russification of Finland|Russification]] efforts after [[1899]] resulted in dodging of the draft and later in the abolishment of conscription.

During [[World War I]] Finnish volunteers secretly joined the [[German Empire|Imperial German]] army to receive military traning. These [[Finnish Jäger troops]] arrived in February [[1918]] in the white capital city of [[Vaasa]] and formed the core of the White Army in the [[Finnish Civil War]].

The [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian revolutions]] had caused the creation of [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red]] and [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guard]]s in Finland. On [[January 25]], [[1918]] the [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guard]] were declared to be the official troops of the white government. This marks the formation of the armed forces of the independent Finland.

After the [[Finnish Civil War]] the armed forces were organised according to the German system. In February [[1919]] the White Guard separated from the armed forces and became an independent organisation. 

===Restrictions on armaments===
The [[Paris Peace Treaty]] after the [[Continuation War]] limited the strength of the Finnish Army to 34,400 men, the Navy to 4,500 men and the maximum displacement of ships in the navy to 10,000 tonnes. The Air Force was limited to 3,000 men and 60 planes. Also certain weapons such as [[guided missile]]s, [[submarine]]s, proximity [[Naval mine|mine]]s, [[torpedo boat]]s, [[bomber]]s with internal bomb racks and any weapons of [[Germany|German]] origin were forbidden. Later &quot;defensive&quot; missiles were allowed. All of the restrictions, except for the ban on [[nuclear weapons]], were unilaterally lifted by president [[Mauno Koivisto]] after the [[breakup of the Soviet Union]].

==UN peacekeeping operations==
Finland has taken part in [[UN peacekeeping]] operations since [[1956]], resulting in total of 43,000 Finnish peacekeepers during that time. In 2003 over a thousand Finnish peacekeepers were involved in UN operations. According to the Finnish law the maximum simultaneous strength of the peacekeeping forces is 2000 soldiers.

Since 1996 the [[Pori brigade]] has trained a special jaeger [[battalion]], the Finnish Rapid Deployment Force (FRDF), which can take part in crisis management operations at short notice.

It is subject to laws like the [[Freedom of Information Act]] and the [[Privacy Act]] which cover Federal agencies and not private entities. However, its decisions do not have to be ratified by the [[President of the United States|President]] or anyone else in the [[executive (government)|executive]] or [[legislative]] branches of government, it does not receive funding from Congress, and the terms of the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms. Once a member of the Board of Governors is appointed by the president, he or she is relatively independent (although the law provides for the possibility of removal by the President &quot;for cause&quot; under 12 U.S.C. section 242).

In ''Lewis v. United States'', 680 F.2d 1239 (9th Cir. 1982), the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] stated that the &quot;Federal reserve banks are not federal instrumentalities for purposes of a Federal Torts Claims Act, but are independent, privately owned and locally controlled corporations.&quot; The opinion also stated that &quot;the Reserve Banks have properly been held to be federal instrumentalities for some purposes.&quot;

===Influence of Government===
Central bank independence from political control is a crucial concept in both economic theory and practice. The problem arises as central banks strive to maintain a credible commitment to price stability, when the markets know that there is political pressure to keep interest rates low. Low interest rates tend to keep unemployment below trend, encourage economic growth, and allow for cheap credit and loans. Unfortunately, such a policy is not sustainable without accelerating inflation in the long term. Thus, a central bank believed to be under political control cannot make a credible commitment to fight inflation, as the markets know that sitting politicians will lobby to keep rates low. This point was one of the major research topics of economist [[Edward C. Prescott]]'s career. It is in this limited sense that the Federal Reserve System is independent. The members of the FOMC are not elected and do not answer to politicians in making their interest rate decisions.

The Federal Reserve is financially independent because it runs a surplus, due in part to its ownership of [[government bond]]s. In fact, it returns billions of dollars to the government each year.  However, the Fed is still subject to oversight by the Congress, which periodically reviews its activities and can alter its responsibilities by [[statute]]. To further communication with Congress, the Fed delivers a [[Monetary Policy Report to the Congress|report]] to both houses semiannually.  Its independence from the [[executive branch]] was strengthened by the [[1951 Accord]].  In general, the Federal Reserve must work within the framework of the overall objectives of economic and financial policy established by the government.

==Fractional-Reserve Banking==
{{main|fractional-reserve banking}}
In its role of setting reserve requirements for the country's banking system, the Fed regulates what is known as [[fractional-reserve banking]].  This is the common practice by banks of retaining only a fraction of their deposits to satisfy demands for withdrawals, lending the remainder at interest to obtain income that can be used to pay interest to depositors and provide profits for the banks' owners.  Some people also use the term to refer to [[fiat money]], which is money that is not backed by a tangible asset such as [[gold]].

Fractional reserves are very easily abused and rules for these will necessarily favour certain activities in the economy very systematically over others.  The United States' rules and oversight are within limits and guidelines set by the [[Bank for International Settlements]], a peer agency to the [[IMF]] and the [[World Bank]] that was originally set up as one of the [[Bretton Woods]] set of institutions.  More recently the [[WTO]] has been regarded also as such a peer.  

==Criticisms of the Fed==
[[Image:Alan Greenspan.jpg|thumb| Critics charge that a [[cult of personality]] surrounds [[Alan Greenspan]] ]]
A large and varied group of criticisms are often directed against the Federal Reserve. Some of these criticisms relate to [[inflation]] and [[fractional reserve banking]] more generally, and an in-depth treatment of these issues may be found in their respective articles. There are also specific issues relating to the chairmanship of [[Alan Greenspan]], specifically, that the Fed’s credibility is based on a [[cult of personality]] around him and his successors, this line of argument is also more thoroughly addressed in his article. Nonetheless, critics still point to a number of specific criticisms about the methods and actions of the Fed; these are treated below.

=== Historical Criticisms ===
Criticisms of the Fed are not new, and some historical criticisms are reflective of current concerns. Specifically, [[Austrian School]] economists criticize the Fed’s expansionary monetary policy in the 1920’s, allowing misallocations of capital resources and supporting a massive stock price bubble. Others argue that the Fed then deepened the resulting [[Great Depression]] by contracting the money supply at the very moment that markets needed liquidity. These criticisms resemble concerns that the current Fed over-emphasizes consumer spending, and has thus not been aggressive enough in reducing U.S. dependence on oil and energy-intensive capital goods, and allowing household debt to accumulate to excessively large levels.

=== Economic Indicators ===
Some critics argue that the Fed’s concentration on GDP or other aggregate indicators risks ignoring important changes in regional economies, and is an unsuitable proxy as an indicator of well-being. 

For example, critics argue that the Fed’s focus on reducing national inflation made it unable to adequately respond to the economic problems in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Specifically, the Fed continued to tighten interest rates immediately after the Hurricane, which some see as evidence that the Fed has ignored the large losses in that devastated region. They argue that the Fed’s concern with aggregate national inflation measures, and the inflationary aspects of the large reconstruction effort (especially the potential for larger government budget deficits), made it unable to deal properly with the highly unusual but particularly devastating situation.

Another criticism is that the Fed places too much emphasis on GDP as a measure of well-being. Critics point to programs in the UK and Canada, such as the [[Genuine Progress Indicator]], which are intended to be a better indicator of both the benefits and costs of economic growth. Even more conservative commentators believe [[Net Domestic Product]] is a far better indicator than GDP of [[economic growth]], as GDP hides uneconomic growth and can lead to improper decisions.

However, this idea remains controversial. The Fed is notoriously tight-lipped about the measures and metrics which are used to make its decisions (see Opacity, directly below), and there is no support in the released transcripts (available for meetings up until 1999) for the notion that the Fed is overly focused on GDP and inflation alone. Rather, the transcripts indicate that the Fed watches a very wide basket of indicators, and that the members of the FOMC are certainly aware of the limitations of the GDP measure.

=== Opacity ===
Another criticism of the Federal Reserve is that it is shrouded in secrecy. Meetings are held behind closed doors, and the transcripts are released with a lag of five years. Even expert policy analysts are unsure as to the logic behind Fed decisions. Critics argue that such opacity leads to greater market volatility, as the markets must guess, often with only limited information, about how the Fed is likely to change policy in the future. The jargon-laden fence-sitting opaque style of Fed communication is often called &quot;Fed speak.&quot;
(see e.g. 
[http://www.federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/SPEECHES/2004/200401032/default.htm]
[http://www.netfunny.com/rhf/jokes/95q2/greenspan.html]
[http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/06/fed-speak-from-atlanta-president-guynn.html])

Furthermore, the lag in the release of FOMC transcripts, as well as the extremely limited and carefully worded minutes and statement, leads to the public being unaware of the issues of major concern to the Fed, and leaves it with an inadequate understanding of the logic and rationale behind the decisions. Some argue that this is a concerted attempt to keep Congress and the public at arm’s length, but this criticism has not gained much widespread acceptance.

===Free banking===
Some advocate that the Fed should not exist, and that interest rates and money supply should be left to the free market. Advocates of [[free banking]] argue that there is no better judge of the proper interest rate and money supply than the market.

'''Fluorine''' (from L. ''fluere'', meaning &quot;to flow&quot;), is the [[chemical element]] in the [[periodic table]] that has the symbol '''F''' and [[atomic number]] 9. Atomic fluorine is [[univalent]] and is the most chemically reactive and [[electronegative]] of all the elements. In its pure form, it is a [[poison]]ous, pale, [[yellow]]-[[green]] gas, with chemical formula F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Like other [[halogen]]s, molecular fluorine is highly dangerous; it causes severe chemical burns on contact with skin.

== Notable characteristics ==
Pure fluorine (F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a corrosive pale yellow [[gas]] that is a powerful [[oxidation|oxidizing]] agent.  It is the most reactive and electronegative of all the elements, and readily forms compounds with most other elements. Fluorine even combines with the [[noble gas]]es [[krypton]], [[xenon]], and [[radon]]. Even in dark, cool conditions, fluorine reacts explosively with [[hydrogen]]. It is so reactive that [[glass]], [[metal]]s, and even [[water]], as well as other substances, burn with a bright flame in a jet of fluorine gas. It is far too reactive to be found in elemental form and has such an affinity for most elements, including [[silicon]], that it can neither be prepared nor should be kept in glass vessels. In moist air it reacts with water to form the equally dangerous [[hydrofluoric acid]].

In aqueous solution, fluorine commonly occurs as the fluoride ion F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.  Other forms are fluoro-[[complex (chemistry)|complex]]es, such as [FeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[Fluoride]]s are compounds that combine fluoride with some positively charged counterpart. They often consist of [[ion]]s. Fluorine compounds with metals are among the most stable of salts.

== Applications ==
Atomic fluorine and molecular fluorine are used for [[plasma etching]] in [[semiconductor]] manufacturing, [[flat panel display]] production and [[MEMS]] fabrication. 
Other uses:
* [[Hydrofluoric acid]] (chemical formula [[hydrogen|H]]F) is used to etch glass in light bulbs and other products.
* Fluorine is indirectly used in the production of low friction [[plastic]]s such as [[Teflon]],  and in [[halon]]s such as [[Freon]].
* Along with some of its compounds, fluorine is used in the production of pure [[uranium]] from [[uranium hexafluoride]] and in the synthesis of numerous commercial fluorochemicals, including vitally important pharmaceuticals, agrochemical compounds, lubricants, and textiles.
* [[Hydrochlorofluorocarbon|Fluorochlorohydrocarbon]]s are used extensively in [[air conditioning]] and in [[refrigeration]]. [[Chlorofluorocarbon]]s have been banned for these applications because they contribute to the [[ozone hole]]. 
* [[Sulfur hexafluoride]] is an extremely inert and nontoxic gas, and a member of a class of compounds that are potent [[greenhouse gas]]es.
* Many important agents for general anaesthesia such as [[sevoflurane]], [[desflurane]], and [[isoflurane]] are [[fluorohydrocarbon]] derivatives.
* [[Sodium]] hexafluoro[[Aluminium|aluminate]] ([[cryolite]]), is used in the electrolysis of aluminium.
* [[Sodium fluoride]] has been used as an insecticide, especially against cockroaches.
* Some other [[fluoride]]s are often added to [[toothpaste]] and, somewhat controversially, to municipal water supplies to prevent dental cavities.
* Fluorides have been used in the past to help molten metal flow, hence the name.
* &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F, a radioactive isotope that emits [[positron|positrons]], is often used in [[positron emission tomography]] because of its half-life of 110 minutes.

Some researchers including US space scientists in the early 1960s have studied elemental fluorine gas as a possible [[rocket fuel|rocket propellant]] due to its exceptionally high [[specific impulse]]. Experiments failed since fluorine was so hard to handle.

== History ==
Fluorine in the form of [[fluorite|fluorspar]] (also called [[fluorite]]) ([[calcium fluoride]]) was described in [[1529]] by [[Georg Agricola|Georgius Agricola]] for its use as a [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]], which is a substance that is used to promote the fusion of [[metal]]s or [[mineral]]s. In [[1670]] [[Schwandhard]] found that glass was etched when it was exposed to [[fluorspar]] that was treated with [[acid]]. [[Karl Scheele]] and many later researchers, including [[Humphry Davy]], [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac|Gay-Lussac]], [[Antoine Lavoisier]], and [[Louis Jacques Thenard|Louis Thenard]] all would experiment with hydrofluoric acid, easily obtained by treating calcium fluoride ([[fluorite|fluorspar]]) with concentrated sulfuric acid.

It was eventually realized that hydrofluoric acid contained a previously unknown element. This element was not isolated for many years after this due to its extreme reactivity - it is separated from its compounds only with difficulty and then it immediately attacks the remaining materials of the compound. Finally, in [[1886]], fluorine was isolated by [[Henri Moissan]] after almost 74 years of continuous effort. It was an effort which cost several researchers their health or even their lives, and for Moissan, it earned him the 1906 Nobel Prize in chemistry.

The first large scale production of fluorine was needed fores (especially [[Toyota]], [[Honda]], and [[Hyundai]]) deliver better value in terms of fuel economy, reliability, and build quality. These perceptions are reflected in the used car market by higher values for these foreign models. For owners who frequently trade in and for those who lease their vehicles, the resale values are reflected in substantial cost differences with domestic vehicles costing more in overall costs.  However, Ford hopes to reverse this trend, with the introduction of the new 2006 [[Ford Fusion (North American)|Ford Fusion]], [[Mercury Milan]], and [[Lincoln Zephyr]] midsize cars, which are expected to compete well in this segment.

===&quot;The Way Forward&quot;===
:''{{mainarticle|[[The Way Forward]]}}''
Ford responded to the circumstances that lead to the bond downgrade by creating a plan to reduce the company's fixed capital costs while maintaining a special focus on cars and car-based crossover vehicles.  Over time, it hopes to make more of its product line profitable instead of relying on a limited portion of the products for profit.  Making good profits across the product line requires that the company reduce the costs of development and production, while introducing new products that connect with consumers.

In the latter half of 2005, Chairman Bill Ford asked newly-appointed Ford Americas Division President [[Mark Fields (businessman)|Mark Fields]] to develop a plan to return the company to profitability.  Fields previewed the Plan, dubbed &quot;The Way Forward&quot;, at the [[December 7]], [[2005]] board meeting of the company; and it was unveiled to the public on [[January 23]], [[2006]].  &quot;[http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=22465 The Way Forward]&quot; includes [http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=22464 resizing the company] to match current market realities, dropping some unprofitable and inefficient models, consolidating production lines, and shutting down seven vehicle assembly plants and seven parts factories.  Among these are plants in [[St. Louis Assembly]] (near [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]), [[Atlanta Assembly]] (near [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]), [[Batavia Transmission]] ([[Batavia, Ohio]]), [[Windsor Casting]] ([[Windsor, Ontario]], [[Canada]]), and [[Wixom Assembly]] ([[Wixom, Michigan]]).  Up to 30,000 hourly and salaried jobs (28% of the total workforce) in North America over the next six years are expected to be eliminated {{ref|23Jan-washpost}}, which is comparable to similar cutbacks previously announced at [[General Motors]].  These cutbacks are consistent with Ford's roughly 25% decline in U.S. automotive market share since the mid-late 1990s.

Ford's realignment also included the sale of its wholly-owned [[subsidiary]], [[The Hertz Corporation|Hertz Rent-a-Car]] to a [[private equity]] group for $15 billion in cash and debt acquisition.  The sale was completed on [[December 22]] [[2005]].  A [[joint venture]] with [[Mahindra and Mahindra Limited]] of [[India]] ended with the sale of Ford's 15 percent stake in 2005.

== Brands and marques ==
[[Image:2000 Ford Taurus.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Ford Taurus]], one of Ford's most recognizable North American models.]]
Today, Ford Motor Company manufactures automobiles under the  [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]] and [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] [[Brand management|brand]] names. In 1958, Ford introduced a new [[marque]], the [[Edsel]], but [[List of commercial failures|poor sales]] led to its discontinuation in 1960. Later, in 1985, the [[Merkur]] brand was introduced; it met a similar fate in 1989.

Ford has major manufacturing [[List of Ford factories|operations]] in [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[China]], and several other countries, including [[South Africa]] where, following divestment during [[apartheid]], it once again has a wholly-owned subsidiary. Ford also has a cooperative agreement with Russian automaker [[GAZ]].

Since 1989, Ford has acquired [[List of British car manufacturers#United Kingdom|British nameplates]] [[Aston Martin]], [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]], [[Daimler|Daimler (div. of Jaguar)]], and [[Land Rover]], and [[Volvo Cars]] from [[Sweden]], as well as a controlling share (33.4%) of [[Mazda]] of Japan, with which it operates an American [[joint venture]] plant in Flat Rock, Michigan called [[Auto Alliance]]. It has spun off its parts division under the name [[Visteon]]. Its prestige brands, with the exception of Lincoln, are managed through its [[Premier Automotive Group]].

Ford's non-manufacturing operations include organizations such as automotive finance operation [[Ford Motor Credit Company]]. Ford also sponsors numerous events and sports facilities around the nation, most noteably [[Ford Center]] in downtown [[Oklahoma City]] and [[Ford Field]] in downtown [[Detroit]]. It is also noteable that both facilities share design aesthetics in addition to their common name and similar downtown location!

== Global markets ==
Initially, Ford models sold outside the U.S. were essentially versions of those sold on the home market, but later on, models specific to Europe were developed and sold.  Attempts to globalize the model line have often failed, with Europe's [[Ford Mondeo]] selling poorly in the United States, while U.S. models such as the [[Ford Taurus]] have fared poorly in [[Japan]] and Australia, even when produced in [[right hand drive]]. The small European model [[Ford Ka|Ka]], a hit in its home market, did not catch on in Japan, as it was not available as an automatic. The Mondeo was dropped by [[Ford Australia]], because the segment of the market in which it competes had been in steady decline, with buyers preferring the larger local model, the [[Ford Falcon|Falcon]]. One recent exception is the [[Ford Focus|Focus]] &amp;mdash; The European model has sold strongly on both sides of the [[Atlantic]].

===Europe===
[[Image:ford.cortina.red.750pix.jpg|thumb|250px|1970 [[Ford Cortina]] Mark 2]]
At first, Ford in Germany and the United Kingdom built different models from one another until the late 1960s, with the [[Ford Escort]] and then the [[Ford Capri]] being common to both companies. Later on, the [[Ford Taunus]] and [[Ford Cortina]] became identical, produced in [[left hand drive]] and right hand drive respectively. Rationalisation of model ranges meant that production of many models in the UK switched to elsewhere in Europe, including [[Belgium]] and [[Spain]] as well as Germany. The [[Ford Sierra]] replaced the Taunus and Cortina in 1982, drawing criticism for its radical aerodynamic styling, which was soon given nicknames such as &quot;Jellymould&quot; and &quot;The Salesman's Spaceship&quot;.

Increasingly, Ford Motor Company has looked to Ford of Europe for its &quot;world cars,&quot; such as the Mondeo, [[Ford Focus|Focus]], and [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]], although sales of European-sourced Fords in the U.S. have been disappointing. In [[Asia]], models from Europe are not as competitively priced as Japanese-built rivals, nor are they perceived as reliable. The Focus has been one exception to this, which has become America's best selling compact car since its launch in 2000.

In 2001, Ford ended car production in the UK. It was the first time in more than eighty years that Ford cars had not been made in Britain, although production of the [[Ford Transit|Transit]] van continues at the company's Southampton facility, engines at [[Bridgend]] and [[Dagenham]], and transmissions at [[Halewood]]. Development of European Ford is broadly split between [[Dunton]] in Essex (powertrain, Fiesta/Ka and commercial vehicles) and [[Cologne]] (body, chassis, electrical, Focus, Mondeo) in Germany. Ford also produced the [[Thames Trader|Thames]] range of commercial vehicles although the use of this brand name was discontinued circa 1965. It owns the Jaguar, Land Rover, and Aston Martin car plants in Britain which are still operational.  Ford's Halewood Assembly Plant was converted to Jaguar production.  

Elsewhere in continental Europe, Ford assembles the [[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]] range in [[Genk]] ([[Belgium]]), Fiesta in [[Valencia]] ([[Spain]]) and [[Cologne]] ([[Germany]]), Ka in Valencia and Focus in Valencia, [[Saarlouis]] (Germany) and [[St. Petersberg]] ([[Russia]]). Transit production is in [[Kocaeli]] ([[Turkey]]), [[Southampton]] (UK), and Transit Connect in [[Kocaeli]].

Ford also owns a joint venture production plant in [[Turkey]]. Ford-Otosan, established in the 1970s, manufactures the [[Transit Connect]] compact panel van as well as the &quot;Jumbo&quot; and long wheelbase versions of the full-size Transit. This new production facility was set up near [[Kocaeli]] in 2002, and its opening marked the end of Transit assembly in Genk. Another joint venture plant near [[Setubal]] in [[Portugal]], set up in collaboration with [[Volkswagen]], assembles the [[Ford Galaxy|Galaxy]] people carrier as well as its sister ship, the [[VW Sharan]].

===Asia Pacific===
[[Image:Ford Falcon XR6 Turbo.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Ford XR6 Turbo Falcon]]
In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the popular [[Ford Falcon]] is considered the typical (if not particularly economical) family car, though it is considerably larger than the Mondeo sold in Europe. Between 1960 and 1972, the Falcon was based on a U.S. Ford of that name, but since then has been entirely  designed and manufactured locally. Like its [[General Motors]] rival, the [[Holden Commodore]], the 4.0 liter Falcon retains rear wheel drive. High performance variants of the Falcon running locally-built engines produce up to 390bhp. A [[ute]] (short for &quot;utility,&quot; known in the US as [[pickup truck]]) version is also available with a similar range of drivetrains.  In addition, Ford Australia sells highly-tuned Falcon sedans and utes through its performance car division, [[Ford Performance Vehicles]].  These cars produce over 400bhp and are built in small numbers to increase their value as collectors' cars.

In both Australia and New Zealand, the Commodore and Falcon outsell all other cars. In Australia they comprise over 20% of the new car market.

Ford's presence in Asia has traditionally been much smaller. However, with the acquisition of a stake in Japanese manufacturer [[Mazda]] in 1979, Ford began selling Mazda's Familia and Capella (also known as the [[Mazda 323|323]] and [[Mazda 626|626]]) as the [[Ford Laser]] and [[Ford Telstar|Telstar]]. The Laser was one of the most successful models sold by Ford in Australia, and outsold the Mazda 323, despite being almost identical to it. The Laser was also built in Mexico and sold in the U.S. as the Mercury Tracer, while the 1989 American Ford Escort was based on the Laser/Mazda 323. The smaller [[Mazda 121]] was also sold in the U.S. and Asia as the Ford Festiva.

Through its relationship with Mazda, Ford also acquired a stake in [[South Korea]]n manufacturer [[Kia]], which later built the [[Ford Aspire]] for export to the United States, but later sold the company to [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]]. Ironically, Hyundai also manufactured the Ford Cortina until the 1980s. Ford also has a joint venture with Lio Ho in [[Taiwan]], which assembled Ford models locally since the 1970s.

Ford came to [[India]] in 1998 with its [[Ford Escort]] model, which was later replaced by locally produced [[Ford Ikon]] in 2001. It has since added Fusion, Fiesta, Mondeo and Endeavour to its product line.

===South America===
In [[South America]], Ford has had to face protectionist government measures in each country, with the result that it built different models in different countries, without particular regard to rationalisation or economy of scale inherent to producing and sharing similar vehicles between the nations.  In many cases, new vehicles in a country were based on those of the other manufacturers it had entered into production agreements with, or whose factories it had acquired. For example, the [[Ford Corcel|Corcel]] and [[Ford Del Rey|Del Rey]] in Brazil were originally based on [[Renault]] vehicles.  

In the 1980s, Ford merged its operations in Brazil and Argentina with those of [[Volkswagen]] to form a company called [[Autolatina]], with which it shared models.  Sales figures and profitability were disappointing, and Autolatina was dissolved in the 1990s. With the advent of [[Mercosur]], the regional common market, Ford was finally able to rationalise its product line-ups in those countries. Consequently, the [[Ford Fiesta]] is only built in [[Brazil]], and the [[Ford Focus]] only built in Argentina, with each plant exporting in large volumes to the neighbouring country. Models like the [[Ford Mondeo]] from Europe could now be imported completely built up. Ford in Brazil produces a pick-up truck version of the Fiesta, which is also produced in South Africa as the [[Ford Bantam]] in [[Side of the road (traffic)#Steering wheel placement|right hand drive]] versions.

===Africa and Middle East===
In [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], Ford's market presence has traditionally been strongest in [[South Africa]] and neighbouring countries, with only trucks being sold elsewhere on the continent. Ford in South Africa began by importing kits from Canada to be assembled at its Port Elizabeth facility. Later Ford sourced its models from the UK and Australia, with local versions of the Ford Cortina including the XR6, with a 3.0 V6 engine, and a Cortina 'bakkie' or pick-up, which was exported to the UK. In the mid-1980s Ford merged with a rival company, owned by [[Anglo American plc|Anglo American]], to form the South African Motor Corporation (Samcor). 

Following international condemnation of [[apartheid]], Ford divested from South Africa in 1988, and sold its stake in Samcor, although it licensed the use of its brand name to the company. Samcor began to assemble Mazdas as well, which affected its product line-up, which saw the European Fords like the Escort and Sierra replaced by the [[Mazda]]-based Laser and [[Telstar]]. Ford bought a 45 per cent stake in [[Samcor]] following the demise of apartheid in 1994, and this later became, once again, a wholly owned subsidiary, the Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa. Ford now sells a local sedan version of the Fiesta (also built in India and Mexico), and the Focus and Mondeo Europe. The Falcon model from Australia was also sold in South Africa, but was dropped in 2003.

Ford's market presence in the [[Middle East]] has traditionally been even smaller, partly due to previous [[Arab]] boycotts of companies dealing with [[Israel]]. Ford and Lincoln vehicles are currently marketed in ten countries in the region. [http://www.ford.com/en/company/about/countrySites/default.htm] [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], and the [[UAE]] are the biggest markets. [http://www.autoemirates.com/SpecialReports/0216Industry-Leaders.asp] Ford's distributor in Saudi Arabia announced in February 2003 that it had sold 100,000 Ford and Lincoln vehicles since commencing sales in November 1986. Half of the Ford/Lincoln vehicles sold in that country were [[Ford Crown Victoria]]s. [http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=14319] In 2004, Ford sold 30,000 units in the region, falling far short of [[General Motors]]' 88,852 units and [[Nissan Motors]]' 75,000 units. [http://www.autoemirates.com/SpecialReports/0216Industry-Leaders.asp]

==Alternate fuel vehicles==
[[Image:Ford escape hybrid.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[Ford Escape Hybrid]]]]
Bill Ford was one of the first top industry executives to make regular use of an [[battery electric vehicle]], a [[Ford Ranger EV]], while the company contracted with the [[United States Postal Service]] to deliver electric postal vans based on the Ranger EV platform. Many Ford vehicles now sport an emblem &amp;mdash; a green leaf springing from a curving road-like twig &amp;mdash; symbolic of the new &quot;green&quot; commitment to preserve the environment and reduce resource consumption, while delivering safe, economical, and effective products to the motoring public.  Vehicles with this emblem are generally [[alternative fuel]] or [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s.  The alternative fuel vehicles, such as some versions of the [[Crown Victoria]] especially in fleet and taxi service, operate on [[compressed natural gas]] - or [[CNG]].  Some CNG vehicles have duel fuel tanks - one for gasoline, the other for CNG - the same engine can operate on either fuel via a selector switch.  Flexible fuel vehicles are designed to operate automatically on a wide range of available fuel mixtures - from pure gasoline, to [[ethanol]]-gasoline blends such as [[E85]] (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline).  Part of the challenge of successful marketing alternative and flexible fuel vehicles, is the general lack of establishment of sufficient [[infrastructure]] (fueling stations), which would be essential for these vehicles to be attractive to a wide range of consumers.

Ford was third to market with a [[hybrid car]] &amp;mdash; the [[Ford Escape Hybrid]], and the first to market with a Hybrid SUV / Crossover.  The Hybrid Escape will also be the first hybrid vehicle to market with a Flexible Fuel capability to run on [[E85]] ethanol-gasoline mixture [http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=22474].  The company is on track to selling 250,000 hybrids a year by [[2010]].

Ford hybrids:
* 2004&amp;ndash; [[Ford Escape Hybrid]]
* 2006&amp;ndash; [[Mercury Mariner]]
* 2008&amp;ndash; [[Ford Fusion]]/[[Mercury Milan]]
* 2009&amp;ndash; [[Ford Five Hundred]]/[[Mercury Montego]]

'''Formula One'''

Ford was heavily involved in [[Formula One]] for many years, and supplied engines to a large number of constructors from 1967 until 2004. These engines were designed and manufactured by [[Cosworth]], the racing division of which was owned by Ford from 1998 to 2004. Ford entered Formula One as a constructor in 2000 under the [[Jaguar Racing]] name, after buying out the [[Stewart Grand Prix]] team it had become increasingly involved in. The team achieved little success, and after a turbulent four seasons, Ford pulled out of F1 after the [[2004 Formula One season|2004 season]], selling both Jaguar Racing (which became [[Red Bull Racing]]) and Cosworth.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/default.stm]

===Rally===
Ford has also been active many years in the [[World Rally Championship]], and has used various versions of the [[Ford Focus WRC]] since 1999 to much success.  Ford has a very long history in rally racing, having previously run the [[Ford RS200]] and many versions of the [[Ford Escort]] to great success.

===Sports cars===
Ford sports cars have always been visible in the world of endurance racing.  Most notably the [[GT40]] won the prestigious 24 hours of LeMans many times in the 1960s and still stands today as one of the all-time greatest racing cars.

===Touring cars===
Ford has campaigned touring cars such as the [[Ford Focus|Focus]], [[Ford Falcon|Falcon]], and [[Ford Contour|Contour]]/[[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]] and the [[Ford Sierra|Sierra]] [[Cosworth]] in many different series throughout the years.  Notably the Mondeo finished 1,2,3 in  the [[BTCC]] in 2000.

The classical theory, further developed, remains useful to the present day as a basis of [[microeconomics]]. Some more means that deal with factors of production are as follows:  
*'''Entrepreneurs''' are people who organize other productive resources to make goods and services.  The economists regard entrepreneurs as a specialist form of labor input.  The success and/or failure of a business often depends on the quality of entrepreneurship.
*'''Capital''' has many meanings including the finance raised to operate a business.  Normally though, capital means investment in goods that can produce other goods in the future.  It can also be referred to as machines, roads, factories, schools, and office buildings in which humans produced in order to produce other goods and services.  Investment is important if the economy is to achieve economic growth in the future.
*'''Human Capital''' is the quality of labor resources which can be improved through investments, education, and training.
*'''Fixed Capital''' this includes machinery, work plants, equipment, new technology, factories, buildings, and goods that are designed to increase the productive potential of the economy for future years.
*'''Working Capital''' this includes the stocks of finished and semi-finished goods that we be economically consumed in the near future or will be made into a finished consumer good in the near future.

===Classical view as the base of microeconomic theory===
Although it did not deal substantially with complex issues of a sophisticated modern economy, the classical theory remains useful to the present day as the basis of [[microeconomics]], however many distinctions one cares to make or macro-theory or [[political economy]] one chooses to apply to trade them off or set their valuations in society at large.

[[land (economics)|Land]] has become [[natural capital]], imitative aspects of [[labour (economics)|Labor]] have become [[instructional capital]], creative or inspirational aspects or &quot;Enterprise&quot; have become [[individual capital]] (in some analyses), and [[social capital]] has become increasingly important.  The classical relationship of [[financial capital]] and [[infrastructural capital]] is still recognized as central, but there is a wider debate on [[means of production]] and various [[means of protection]], or &quot;property rights&quot;, to secure their reliable use.

When disputes arise regarding these fine distinctions, most economists will fall back to the

'''Fort Wayne''' is a [[city]] and the [[county seat]] of [[Allen County, Indiana|Allen County]] in northeastern [[Indiana]], [[United States|USA]].  As of the [[2004]] update of the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]], the city had a total population of 219,351 and a metropolitan population of 502,141.  It is named after a U.S. military fort established in [[1794]] by Gen. [[&quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne]] where the [[St. Joseph River (Maumee River)|St. Joseph River]] and [[St. Marys River (Indiana)|St. Marys River]] join to form the [[Maumee River]].

==History==
Historically the site was known as [[Kekionga]], the traditional capital of the [[Miami tribe|Miami nation]]. In the [[1680s]], [[France|French]] traders established a trading post at the location because it was the main portage between the [[Great Lakes (North America)|Great Lakes]] via the Maumee River and the [[Mississippi River]] via the nearby Little River branch of the [[Wabash River]]. 

The French built the first fort on the site, [[Fort Miamis]], in 1697 as part of a group of forts built between [[Quebec]], [[Canada]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. Forts Miamis was replaced by Fort St. Philippe in 1722. 

Increasing tension between France and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|United Kingdom]] developed over the territory. In [[1760]], after defeat by British forces in the [[French and Indian War]], the area was ceded to the [[British Empire]]. The fort was renamed &quot;Fort Miami.&quot;

In [[1763]], various Native American nations rebelled against British rule and retook the fort as part of [[Pontiac's Rebellion]]. The Miami regained control of Kekionga, a rule that lasted for more than 30 years.

On [[October 22]], [[1794]], under the command of General [[Anthony Wayne]], the [[United States]] army captured the Wabash-Erie portage from the Miami and built a new fort near the three rivers. Fort Wayne was named for the general.

Eventually, the portage was replaced by the [[Wabash and Erie Canal]] in [[1833]]. Fort Wayne's significance as a waterway portage lost national prominence as the [[railroad]] system developed in the United States. For nearly a century it was an important railroad center between New York and Chicago.

On [[February 22]], [[1840]], the growing city incorporated as the City of Fort Wayne.

Most of the population growth occurred in the 19th century with immigration from Germany and Ireland. The large numbers of Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches reflect this. German-language newspapers were published into the 20th century.

Interesting Fact: Some inhabitants of Fort Wayne over the years have casually joked about how General [[Anthony Wayne]] only stayed in Fort Wayne for 4 days before departing.

[[Image:Fort-wayne-indiana-courthouse.jpg|thumb|300px|Allen County courthouse.]]

== Law and government ==
Fort Wayne has an elected [[mayor]], [[city clerk|clerk]] and [[city council]]-style of government.

===Executive - mayor===
Fort Wayne's mayor is [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] [[Graham Richard]], who has served in the post since January 2000. He was elected to a second term in 2003. 

*See, [[List of Fort Wayne, Indiana mayors]]

===City clerk===
[[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] [[Sandra Kennedy]] has been Fort Wayne's city clerk since 1983.

===Representatives - common council===
The Fort Wayne Common Council is a nine-member legislative group that serve four-year terms. Six of the members represent specific districts; three are elected city-wide as at-large council members. The council elected on [[November 4]], [[2003]] will serve until [[December 31]], [[2007]]:
*John N. Crawford: At-Large, [[United States Republican Party|Republican]]
*Samuel J. Talarico, Jr: At-Large, [[United States Republican Party|Republican]]
*John Shoaff: At-Large, [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]]
*Tom Smith: 1st District, [[United States Republican Party|Republican]]
*Donald J. Schmidt: 2nd District, [[United States Republican Party|Republican]]
*Tom Didier: 3rd District, [[United States Republican Party|Republican]]
*Thomas E. Hayhurst: 4th District, [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]]
*Tim Pape: 5th District, [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]]
*Glynn A. Hines: 6th District, [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]]

==Geography==
Modern Fort Wayne is set in a productive agricultural area, but has always been an important transportation hub. Founded at the confluence of three rivers, the city was the summit of the [[Wabash_and_Erie_Canal|Wabash-Erie Canal]]. Fort Wayne also sits at the high point between two [[Watersheds of Indiana|Indiana watersheds]]; hence its nickname, &quot;Summit City.&quot;

Current Fort Wayne straddles [[Interstate 69]], and is served by [[Norfolk Southern]], [[Conrail]] and [[CSX]] [[rail transport|rail lines]] as well as [[Fort Wayne International Airport]] and Smith Field regional airport.

===Physical geography===
For a regional &quot;summit,&quot; Fort Wayne is fairly flat. There are some local wetlands and gravel pits. West of the St. Joseph's River and St. Mary's River is part of the Tipton Till Plain, with deep dark brown soil. Land east of there is the former [[Black Swamp]], a soil heavy with clay that forms deep cracks in August and must be plowed in the fall because it's too wet in the spring. 

===Major parks===
Fort Wayne's first park, the 0.2 acre (800&amp;nbsp;m&amp;sup2;) Old Fort Park, was established in [[1863]]. The newest park, the 170 acre (690,000&amp;nbsp;m&amp;sup2;) Salomon Farm Park, was established in [[1995]]. As of 2005, the city had 87 parks covering 2,199.55 acres (8.9&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2;).

* Buckner Farm Park 
* [[Foellinger-Freimann Botanical Conservatory]]
* Foster Park 
* Franke Park, the city's largest at 316.4 acres (1.3 km²), home to the [[Fort Wayne Children's Zoo]] 
* Freimann Square 
* Historic Old Fort 
* Hurshtown Reservoir 
* Japanese Garden 
* [[Johnny Appleseed Park]], including the gravesite of [[Johnny Appleseed]] 
* Lakeside Park 
* Lindenwood Nature Preserve
* McMillen Park 
* [[Little Turtle]] Memorial 
* Shoaff Park

==Economy==
In the mid-[[20th century]], Fort Wayne was a major manufacturing center of the northeastern United States. Major employers included [[General Electric]] (which was a merger of many electric companies including Fort Wayne's Jenny Electric), [[International Harvester]] (left Fort Wayne in [[1983]]), and Tokheim gasoline pumps (sold in [[2003]]). Phelps Dodge, Rea Wire, and Essex Wire comprised the largest concentration of [[copper]] and [[enamel wire]] manufacturing in the world. In the latter half of the 20th century, shifts in manufacturing patterns led to the reduction of the number of manufacturing plants and jobs, and Fort Wayne could be counted among the relatively stagnant &quot;[[rust belt]]&quot; cities of the northeast.

In recent decades growth based on a more diverse economy has resumed. [[General Motors]] opened the Truck and Bus Assembly operation in the [[1980s]].  Fort Wayne employs many in the transportation and logistics sector, with Sirva, the [[Norfolk_Southern_Railway]], along with its subsidiaries [http://www.triplecrownsvc.com/ Triple Crown Services] (supplying intermodal services) and [http://www.trnswrks.com/ TransWorks] (supplying carrier and shipper transportation tools), and Kitty Hawk Air Cargo combining for more than 2,500 local jobs.  [[National defense]] is also an increasingly important component of the local economy, with [[ITT]] and [[Raytheon]] employing more than 1,000 people each.  

Mid-Size businesses have also shown growth throughout the Fort Wayne area. Insurance companies such as K&amp;K Insurance, Brotherhood Mutual Insurance Company, and Insurance &amp; Risk Management, one of Indiana’s largest private insurance companies, have their headquarters in the Fort Wayne area. The finance sector has grown in recent years as well, having accounting firms such as Baden Gage and Schroeder and the bank headquarters of Star Financial Group. Recently the city had lost almost 1,000 jobs due to the sale of Waterfield Mortgage Company.

A secure area at the [[Fort Wayne International Airport]] (formerly known as Baer Field) houses the [[Indiana Air National Guard]]'s 122nd Fighter Wing, which flies the [[F-16]] fighter.

While the homegrown [[Lincoln National Corporation]] has changed names and relocated its headquarters to [[Philadelphia]], Lincoln Financial still employs about 1,500 professionals in the city and contributes millions of dollars annually to local charities and civic causes.

Because of his stress on the role of consumer demand in initiating economic progress, Bastiat is seen as a forerunner of the [[Austrian School]].

One of Bastiat's most important contributions to the field of economics was his admonition to the effect that good economic decisions can only be made by taking into account the &quot;full picture.&quot;  That is, economic truths should be arrived at by observing not only the immediate consequences (''i.e.,'' benefits or liabilities) of an economic decision, but also by examining the long-term consequences.  Additionally, one must examine the decision's effect not only on a single group of people (say candlemakers) or a single industry (say candles), but on all people and all industries in the society as a whole.  As Bastiat famously put it: an economist must take into account &quot;both what is seen and what is not seen.&quot;  Bastiat's &quot;rule&quot; was later expounded by [[Henry Hazlitt]] in his work ''[[Economics in One Lesson]],'' in which Hazlitt borrowed Bastiat's trenchant &quot;[[parable of the broken window|Broken Window Fallacy]]&quot; and went on to demonstrate how it applies to a wide variety of economic falsehoods. {{Libertarianism}}

== Works ==
Bastiat was the author of many works on economics and political economy, generally characterized by their clear organization, forceful argument and acerbic wit.  Among his most well known works is ''[[Economic Fallacies]],'' which contains many trenchant attacks on [[statism|statist]] (''i.e.'' &quot;progressive&quot;) policies.  Bastiat wrote it while living in [[England]] in an attempt to advise the shapers of the French Republic on pitfalls to avoid.  

Contained within ''Economic Fallacies'' is the famous [[satire|satirical]] episode best known as the &quot;[[Candlemakers' petition]]&quot; [http://silentpc.org/university/Candlemaker.pdf pdf] which presents itself as a demand from the candlemakers' guild to the French government, asking the government to block out [[Sun|the Sun]] to prevent its unfair competition with their products.  Much like [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' or [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s anti-slavery works, Bastiat's argument cleverly highlights the basic flaws in state-support of industry by demonstrating its absurdity when carried to a logical extreme.  

Bastiat's most famous work, however, is undoubtedly [http://www.ozarkia.net/bill/anarchism/library/thelaw.html The Law], originally published as a pamphlet in [[1850]].  It deals with the issues underlying the development of a just and free system of laws, and how such laws should be applied in a free society.

Sadly, Bastiat and his works are no longer well-known in the anglophone world, and are becoming difficult to find in English translation.

== Selected quotations ==
* &quot;If the natural tendencies of mankind are so bad that it is not safe to permit people to be free, how is it that the tendencies of these organizers are always good? Do not the legislators and their appointed agents also belong to the human race? Or do they believe that they themselves are made of a finer clay than the rest of mankind?&quot;&amp;mdash;from ''The Law''

* &quot;When under the pretext of fraternity, the legal code imposes mutual sacrifices on the citizens, human nature is not thereby abrogated. Everyone will then direct his efforts toward contributing little to, and taking much from, the common fund of sacrifices. Now, is it the most unfortunate who gains from this struggle? Certainly not, but rather the most influential and calculating.&quot;&amp;mdash;from ''The Law''

* &quot;Life, faculties, production—in other words, individuality, liberty, property—this is man. And in spite of the cunning of artful political leaders, these three gifts from God precede all human legislation, and are superior to it. Life, liberty, and property do not exist because men have made laws. On the contrary, it was the fact that life, liberty, and property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first place.&quot;&amp;mdash;from ''The Law''

* &quot;But how is this legal plunder to be identified? Quite simply. See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them, and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime.&quot;&amp;mdash;from ''The Law''

* &quot;Government is the great fiction through which everybody endeavors to live at the expense of everybody else.&quot;&amp;mdash;from ''Government''

* &quot;Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all.  We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.&quot;&amp;mdash;from ''The Law''

* &quot;It seems to me that this is theoretically right, for whatever the question under discussion—whether religious, philosophical, political, or economic; whether it concerns prosperity, morality, equality, right, justice, progress, responsibility, cooperation, property, labor, trade, capital, wages, taxes, population, finance, or government&amp;mdash;at whatever point on the scientific horizon I begin my researches, I invariably reach this one conclusion: The solution to the problems of human relationships is to be found in liberty.&quot;&amp;mdash;from ''The Law''

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For the falsification of documents, see [[Forgery]].''
'''Falsifiability''' is an important concept in the [[philosophy of science]] that amounts to the principle that a [[proposition]] or [[theory]] cannot be considered scientific if it does not admit the possibility of being shown false.

''Falsifiable'' does not mean ''false''. For a proposition to be falsifiable, it must be at least in principle possible to make an [[observation]] that would show the proposition to be false, even if that observation had not been made. For example, the proposition &quot;All crows are black&quot; would be falsified by observing one white crow.  A falsifiable theory must make a statement concerning what is, or will be, forbidden.

[[Falsificationism|Falsificationists]] claim that any theory that is not falsifiable is unscientific. [[Psychoanalytic]] theory, for example, is held up by the proponents of [[Karl Popper|Popper's]] philosophy as an example of an [[ideology]] rather than a [[science]]. A patient regarded by his psychoanalyst as &quot;[[in denial]]&quot; about his [[sexual orientation]] may be viewed as confirming he is homosexual simply by denying that he is; and if he has sex with women, he may be accused of trying to buttress his denials. In other words, there is no way the patient could convincingly demonstrate his heterosexuality to the analyst. This is an example of what Popper called a &quot;[[closed circle]]&quot;. The proposition that the patient is homosexual is not falsifiable. This has found its way into several [[Dystopia|dystopian]] novels.

== Naïve falsification ==
Falsifiability was first developed by [[Karl Popper]] in the [[1930s]]. Popper noticed that two types of statements are of particular value to [[scientists]]. The first are statements of observations, such as 'this is a white swan'. [[logic|Logicians]] call these statements [[existential quantification|singular existential statements]], since they assert the existence of some particular thing. They can be parsed in the form: ''There is an x which is a swan and x is white''.

The second type of statement of interest to scientists categorizes all instances of something, for example 'All swans are white'. Logicians call these statements [[universal quantification|universal]]. They are usually parsed in the form: ''For all x, if x is a swan then x is white''.

[[Scientific law]]s are commonly supposed to be of the second type. Perhaps the most difficult question in the [[scientific method|methodology of science]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? How can one validly infer a universal statement from any number of existential statements?

[[Induction (philosophy)|Inductivist]] methodology supposed that one can somehow move from a series of singular existential statements to a universal statement. That is, that one can move from 'this is a white swan', 'that is a white swan', and so on, to a universal statement such as 'all swans are white'.  This method is clearly ''logically'' invalid, since it is always possible that there may be a non-white swan that has somehow avoided observation. Yet some philosophers of science claim that science is based on such an inductive method. 

Popper held that science could not be grounded on such an invalid inference. He proposed falsification as a solution to the [[problem of induction]]. Popper noticed that although a singular existential statement such as 'there is a white swan' cannot be used to affirm a universal statement, it can be used to show that one is false: the singular existential observation of a black swan serves to show that the universal statement 'all swans are white' is false - in logic this is called [[modus tollens]]. 'There is a black swan' implies 'there is a non-white swan' which in turn implies 'there is something which is a swan and which is not white', hence 'all swans are white' is false, because that is the same as 'there is ''nothing'' which is a swan and which is not white'.
[[Image:Mute.swan.slimb.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|A white [[mute swan]], common to [[Eurasia]] and [[North America]].]]

Although the logic of naïve falsification is valid, it is rather limited. Popper drew attention to these limitations in ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'', in response to anticipated criticism from [[Pierre Duhem|Duhem]] and [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]]. [[W. V. Quine]] is also well-known for his observation in his influential essay, &quot;[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]&quot; (which is reprinted in ''From a Logical Point of View''), that nearly any statement can be made to fit with the data, so long as one makes the requisite &quot;compensatory adjustments&quot;. In order to logically falsify a [[universal]], one must find a true falsifying singular statement. But Popper pointed out that it is always possible to ''change'' the universal statement or the existential statement so that falsification does not occur. On hearing that a [[black swan]] has been observed in Australia, one might introduce the [[ad hoc]] hypothesis, 'all swans are white except those found in Australia'; or one might adopt another, more cynical view about some observers, 'Australian ornithologists are incompetent'. As Popper put it, a ''decision'' is required on the part of the scientist to accept or reject the statements that go to make up a theory or that might falsify it. At some point, the weight of the ad hoc hypotheses and disregarded falsifying observations will become so great that it becomes unreasonable to support the base theory any longer, and a decision will be made to reject it.

== Falsificationism ==
In place of naïve falsification, Popper envisioned science as evolving by the successive rejection of falsified theories, rather than falsified statements.  Falsified theories are to be replaced by theories which can account for the phenomena which falsified the prior theory, that is, with greater explanatory power. Thus, [[Aristotle|Aristotelian mechanics]] explained observations of objects in everyday situations, but was falsified by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]&amp;#8217;s experiments, and was itself replaced by Newtonian mechanics which accounted for the phenomena noted by Galileo (and others).  [[Newtonian mechanics]]' reach included the observed motion of the planets and the mechanics of gases. Or at least most of them; the size of the precession of the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] wasn't predicted by Newtonian mechanics, but was by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]]. The Youngian wave theory of light (i.e., waves carried by the [[luminiferous ether]]) replaced Newton's (and many of the Classical Greeks') particles of light but in its turn was falsified by the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], whose results were eventually understood as incompatible with an ether and was superseded by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s electrodynamics and Einstein's [[special relativity]], which did account for the new phenomena. At each stage, experimental observation made a theory untenable (i.e., falsified it) and a new theory was found which had greater 'explanatory power' (i.e., could account for the previously unexplained phenomena), and as a result ''provided greater opportunity for its own falsification''.

Naïve falsificationism is an unsuccessful attempt to prescribe a rationally unavoidable method for science. Falsificationism proper, on the other hand, is a prescription of a way in which scientists ought to behave as a matter of choice.

== Popper's swan argument ==
[[Image:Black.swans.slimb.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|Two [[black swan]]s, native to [[Australia]].]]

One notices a white swan, from this one can conclude:

:At least one swan is white.

From this, one may wish to infer that:

:All swans are white.

However, to prove this, one must find all the swans in the world and verify that they are white. 

As it turns out, not all swans are white.  By finding a [[black swan]], one has falsified the statement ''all swans are white''; it is not true.

== Formal logical arguments ==
The falsification of theories occurs through [[modus tollens]], via some observation. Suppose some theory ''T'' implies an observation ''O'':

:&lt;math&gt;T \rightarrow O&lt;/math&gt;

An observation conflicting with O, however, is made:

:&lt;math&gt;\neg O&lt;/math&gt;

So by Modus Tollens, 

:&lt;math&gt;\neg T&lt;/math&gt;

==The criterion of demarcation==
Popper proposed falsification as a way of determining if a theory is scientific or not. If a theory is falsifiable, then it is scientific; if it is not falsifiable, then it is not science. Popper uses this [[Demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]] to draw a sharp line between scientific and unscientific theories. Some have taken this principle to an extreme to cast doubt on the [[scientific]] validity of many disciplines (such as [[macroevolution]] and [[Cosmology]]).  Falsifiability was one of the criteria used by Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] to determine that '[[creation science]]' was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[public school]]s.

In the [[philosophy of science]], verificationism (also known as [[the verifiability theory of meaning]]) held that a statement must be in principle empirically verifiable in order to be both meaningful and scientific.  This was an essential feature of the [[logical empiricism]] of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]] that featured such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and [[Hans Reichenbach]]. After Popper, verifiability came to be replaced by ''falsifiability'' as the criterion of demarcation. In other words, in order to be scientific, a statement had to be, in principle, falsifiable. Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, and had accordingly given a single solution to both of them, namely verificationism. In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that a theory might well be meaningful without being scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness may not necessarily coincide with a criterion of demarcation. His own falsificationism, thus, is not only an alternative to verificationism, it is also an acknowledgment of the conceptual distinction that previous theories had ignored.

Falsifiability is a property of statements and theories, and is itself neutral. As a demarcation criterion, it seeks to take this property and make it a base for affirming the superiority of falsifiable theories over non-falsifiable ones as a part of science, in effect setting up a political position that might be called ''falsificationism''.  Much that would be considered meaningful and useful, however, is not falsifiable. Certainly non-falsifiable statements have a role in scientific theories themselves. The Popperian criterion provides a definition of science that excludes much that is of value; it does not provide a way to distinguish meaningful statements from meaningless ones.

It is nevertheless very useful to know if a statement or theory is falsifiable, if for no other reason than that it provides us with an understanding of the ways in which one might assess the theory. One might at the least be saved from attempting to falsify a non-falsifiable theory, or come to see an unfalsifiable theory as unsupportable.

==Criticism==
[[Thomas Kuhn]]&amp;#8217;s influential book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' argued that scientists work within a conceptual [[paradigm]] that determines the way in which they view the world. Scientists will go to great length to defend their paradigm against falsification, by the addition of ad hoc hypotheses to existing theories. Changing one's 'paradigm' is not easy, and only through some pain and angst does science (at the level of the individual scientist) change paradigms.  

Some falsificationists saw Kuhn&amp;#8217;s work as a vindication, since it showed that science progressed by rejecting inadequate theories. More commonly, it has been seen as showing that sociological factors, rather than adherence to a strict, logically obligatory method, play the determining role in deciding which scientific theory is accepted. This was seen as a profound threat to those who seek to show that science has a special authority in virtue of the methods that it employs.

[[Imre Lakatos]] attempted to explain Kuhn&amp;#8217;s work in falsificationist terms by arguing that science progresses by the falsification of ''research programs'' rather than the more specific [[universal quantification|universal statements]] of naïve falsification. In Lakatos' approach, a scientist works within a research program that corresponds roughly with Kuhn's 'paradigm'. Whereas Popper rejected the use of ad hoc hypotheses as unscientific, Lakatos accepted their place in the development of new theories.

Lakatos also brought the notion of falsifiability to bear on the discipline of mathematics in [[Proofs and Refutations]]. The long-standing debate over [[Mathematics#Is_mathematics_a_science.3F|whether mathematics is a science]] depends in part on the question of whether proofs are fundamentally different from experiments. Lakatos argued that mathematical proofs and definitions evolve through criticism and counterexample in a manner very similar to how a scientific theory evolves in response to experiments.

[[Paul Feyerabend]] examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all.  He went beyond Lakatos&amp;#8217; argument for ad hoc hypothesis, to say that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method. Rather, he claimed, ironically, that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.

Following from Feyerabend, the whole &quot;Popper project&quot; to define science around one particular methodology&amp;mdash;which accepts nothing except itself&amp;mdash;is a perverse example of what he supposedly decried: a closed circle argument. The Popperian criterion itself is not falsifiable.

Moreover, it makes Popper effectively a philosophical [[nominalist]], which has nothing to do with empirical sciences at all. 

Although Popper's claim of the singular characteristic of falsifiability does provide a way to replace invalid inductive thinking ([[empiricism]]) with deductive, falsifiable reasoning, it appeared to Feyerabend  that doing so is neither necessary for, nor conducive to, scientific progress.

=== Case Studies ===
Multiple universes from the [[Anthropic Principle]] and the existence of intelligent life (see [[SETI]]) beyond Earth are potentially non-falsifiable ideas. They are &quot;true-ifiable&quot; because they are potentially detectable. Lack of detection does not mean other universes or non-human intelligent life does not exist&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In February 1849, [[Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Bastiat|Frédéric Bastiat]] wrote an essay [http://bastiat.org/fr/capital_et_rente.html Capital et Rente] (available in English as [http://bastiat.org/en/capital_and_interest.html Capital and Interest]). It had quite some success in the working class and caused some turmoil within socialist ranks. F. Chevé, writer in the socialist magazine ''La Voix du Peuple'' (the Voice of the People), wrote an open letter to Bastiat in his magazine to question his essay. Bastiat replied, and Chevé decided to publish the reply, with a counter-reply by [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]]. The debate went on between Bastiat and Proudhon, until on his 6th and last letter, Proudhon declared the debate closed and Bastiat dead. Bastiat wrote a last reply, but it was not published by ''La Voix du Peuple''; instead, they published the 13 first letters of the debate as a book ''Intérêt et Principal.'' Bastiat published the 14 letters as ''Gratuité du Crédit,'' a 242-page book, included in volume 5 of his complete works.

Some of Proudhon's letters (translated to English, including neither the last one, nor any of the replies by Bastiat) can be found [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/proudhon/interestletter1.html in the Anarchist Archives]. Letters by Bastiat can hardly be found anywhere. The [http://bastiat.org/fr/lettre2.html second letter] of the debate is on [http://Bastiat.org Bastiat.org] (in French). Another related essay by Bastiat, which contains arguments to reply to the last among letters by Proudhon published above, is [http://bastiat.org/fr/maudit_argent.html Maudit Argent] (available in English as [http://www.mises.org/journals/qjae/pdf/qjae5_3_7.pdf What is Money?]).

At the [http://bastiat.net/en/Bastiat2001 Bastiat'2001] conference, Alain Laurent spoke about Bastiat's supposed influence on Proudhon and his belief that Bastiat's ideas slowly percolated into latter works by Proudhon.

      <comment>moved [[Snap (American football)]] to [[Snap (football)]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''snap''' (colloquially called a &quot;hike&quot;, &quot;snapback&quot;, or &quot;pass from center&quot;) starts each [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]] [[play from scrimmage]]. The ball begins on the ground with its long axis parallel to the sidelines of the field, its ends marking each team's [[line of scrimmage]] in American football; in Canadian football line of scrimmage of the team without the ball is 1 yard their side of the ball.  The snap must be a quick and continuous movement of the ball by one or both hands of the snapper (&quot;centre&quot; in Canadian football), and the ball must leave the snapper's hands. The various rules codes have additional requirements, all of which have the effect of requiring the ball to go backwards to a player behind the line of scrimmage (i.e. in the &quot;backfield&quot;).  The ball may be handed, thrown, or even rolled, and its trajectory and the ball during that passage are called &quot;the snap&quot;. The snapper is almost always the [[center_(football)|center]]. The ball is almost always sent between the snapper's/center's/centre's legs, but only in Canadian football is that required.  Additional rules apply regarding the positioning and stance of the snapper as one of several &quot;line&quot; players in anticipation of the snap.

The team entitled to snap the ball will usually know in advance the moment when the snap is to occur as one of their players calls out signals, which usually include a loud sound such as &quot;hut&quot; voiced one or more times, the number of which they know; they are thus said to know the &quot;snap count&quot;. (A team of deaf players may get the snap timing via the beating of a bass drum near the field.)  Therefore they have a considerable advantage over their opponents. The snapper is not, however, allowed to make motions simulating part of the snap action; therefore their opponents can be confident the first motion of the ball or the snapper's hands is the beginning of the snap.

For a handed snap, the snapper will usually have his or her head up, facing opponents.  For a thrown snap, especially in formations wherein the ball may be snapped to players in different positions, the snapper will commonly bend over looking between his or her legs.  Because of the vulnerability of a player in such a position, the National Collegiate Athletic Administration (NCAA) and the National Federation of State High School Associations (&quot;Fed&quot;) have adopted rules providing that if a player is positioned at least 7 yards behind the neutral zone to receive a snap, opponents are not to deliberately contact the snapper until one second after the snap (NCAA), or until the snapper has a chance to react (Fed).  However, in professional football it is common for a center to be able to practice a single &quot;shotgun&quot; formation thrown snap enough to keep his head up and toss it blindly.

== History and rationale ==

The snap, the set scrummage and ruck in today's Rugby Union, and the play-the-ball in Rugby League have common origins in rugby football.  As the rules of rugby's scrimmage were written when the game came to North America, they had a significant flaw which was corrected by custom elsewhere, but by the invention of the snap in American football.  See [http://users.bestweb.net/~robgood/football/uncontested.txt &quot;Why the Uncontested Scrimmage&quot;].

The rule adopted by a committee for American football in 1880 first provided for the uncontested right of one side to play the ball by foot (in any direction) for a scrimmage.  A certain use of the foot on the ball which had the same effect as heeling it back was known as a &quot;snap&quot;.  Later in the 19th Century the option of snapping the ball back by hand was added.  The option to play the ball with the foot was preserved, however, for several decades, although by early in the 20th Century it was restricted to kicking the ball forward.  The kick forward in scrimmage was a surprise play which did not work against a prepared defense.  Also for several decades alternatives to the scrimmage for playing the ball from across the sideline after it had gone out of bounds -- a throw-in or &quot;fair&quot;, and &quot;bounding in&quot; -- existed.  Note also that until well into the 20th Century, rather than an official readying the ball for scrimmage, the side entitled to the snap had complete custody of the ball and could snap it from the required spot at any time; for instance, a tackled ball carrier might feign injury, then suddenly snap the ball while recumbent, there being no stance requirement yet.  The neutral zone and the right of the snapper not to be contacted by an opponent before the snap also was not an original feature.  As the 20th Century drew to a close, the NCAA and National Federation of State High School Associations extended that protection to some time '''after''' the snap, in cases where a player is positioned at least 7 yards deep to receive a thrown snap.

Canadian football used the rugby scrimmage unaltered until near the end of the 19th Century, when, regionally at first, under the influence of the American scrimmage, the number of players in the scrimmage was limited to three -- a &quot;centre scrimmager&quot; bound on either side by props called &quot;side scrimmagers&quot;.  The centre scrimmager was later renamed the &quot;snap&quot;, and in intercollegiate play one side was given the right to put foot to ball first.  Beginning regionally again and universally by 1923, the 3-man scrimmage was reduced to the centre alone, the number of players on the field being reduced commensurately from 14 to 12, and a snap rule and neutral zone similar to that of American football was adopted.  In addition to the between-the-legs requirement noted above, for several years after the adoption of the hand snap, a hand-to-hand snap was illegal, the ball required to be thrown instead, in Canadian football.  Apparently a complete break was desired from system of backheeling, and the T formation having gone into eclipse in American football at the time, the Canadian snap was modeled on the formations then in common use in the USA, such as the single wing.

The game design rationale for requiring the snap to be a quick and continuous motion to the backfield is to eliminate the need for rules provisions for a live ball in scrimmage.  In Rugby Union the ball may be retained by the forwards and played for a time via the foot in a scrummage (which Rugby League has as well) or ruck, or by the hands in a maul, necessitating additional restrictions on play and player positioning during those intervals.  In American and Canadian football, the ball as it is put in play is only held in the line (by the snapper) for a fraction of a second.  The uncontested possession also, as Walter Camp pointed out, allows for better offensive and defensive planning by the side entitled to snap the ball and their opposition, respectively.  Sometimes the snap is muffed by a player in the backfield and the ball lost to the other team; however, it is almost inconceivable that the ball be lost before any player of the snapper's team has a chance to play it!

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''FIFO''' is an [[acronym]] for '''First In, First Out'''. This expression describes the principle of a [[queue]] or [[first-come, first-served]] behavior: what comes in first is handled first, what comes in next waits until the first is finished, etc. Thus it is analogous to the behaviour of persons &quot;standing in a line&quot; (preferred in [[American English]]) or &quot;queueing&quot; (preferred in [[Commonwealth English]]), where the persons leave the queue in the order they arrive.

A [[priority queue]] is a variation on the queue which does not qualify for the name FIFO, because it is not accurately descriptive of that [[data structure]]'s behavior. [[Queuing theory]] encompasses the more general concept of queue, as well as interactions between strict-FIFO queues.

The expression '''FIFO''' can be used in different contexts.

==People==
*For queues of people, ''see'' [[queue area]].

==Computer science==
===Data structure===
In [[computer science]] this term refers to the way data stored in a queue is processed. Each item in the queue is stored in a queue (''simpliciter'') data structure. The first data to be added to the queue will be the first data to be removed, then processing proceeds sequentially in the same order. This is typical behavior for a queue, but see also the [[LIFO]] and [[Stack (computing)|stack]] algorithms.

A typical data structure will look like

  struct fifo_node {
    fifo_node *next;
    value_type value;
  };

  class fifo
  {
    fifo_node *front;
    fifo_node *back;
    fifo_node *dequeue(void)
    {
      fifo_node *tmp = front;
      front = front-&gt;next;
      return tmp;
    }
    queue(value)
    {
      fifo_node *tempNode = new fifo_node;
      tempNode-&gt;value = value;
      back-&gt;next = tempNode;
      back = tempNode;
    }
  }

(For information on the abstract data structure, and an implementation in [[scheme]], see [[Queue]]. For details of a common implementation, see [[Circular buffer]].)

Popular UNIX systems include a sys/queue.h C/C++ header file which provides macros usable by applications necessary to create FIFO queues.

===Pipes===
In computing environments that support the [[pipes and filters]] model for [[interprocess communication]], a '''FIFO''' is another name for a [[named pipe]].

==Electronics==
FIFOs are used commonly in [[electronics|electronic]] circuits for buffering and flow control. In hardware form a FIFO primarily consists of a set of read and write pointers, storage and control logic. Storage may be SRAM, flip-flops, latches or any other suitable form of storage. For FIFOs of non-trivial size a dual-port SRAM is usually used where one port is used for writing and the other is used for reading. 

A synchronous FIFO is a FIFO where the same clock is used for both reading and writing. An asynchronous FIFO uses different clocks for reading and writing. Asynchronous FIFOs introduce [[metastability]] issues.
A common implementation of an asychronous FIFO uses a [[Gray code]] (or
any unit distance code) for the read and write pointers to ensure reliable
flag generation. One further note concerning flag generation is that one
must necessarily use pointer arithmetic to generate flags for asynchronous FIFO
implementations. Conversely, one may use either a &quot;leaky bucket&quot; approach or
pointer arithmetic to generate flags in synchronous FIFO implementations.

Examples of FIFO status flags include: full, empty, almost full, or almost empty.

==Accounting==
In [[accounting]], '''FIFO''' is a common method for recording the value of [[inventory]].  It is appropriate where there are many different batches of similar products.  The method presumes that the next item to be shipped will be the oldest of that type in the warehouse.  In practice, this usually reflects the underlying commercial substance of the transaction, since many companies rotate their inventory. See also [[LIFO]] in this context.

In an economy of rising prices, it is common for beginning companies to use FIFO for reporting the value of merchandise to bolster their balance sheet.  As the older and cheaper goods are sold, the newer and more expensive goods remain as assets on the company's books.  Having the more higher valued assets and the lower purchase costs of the sold goods part of the company's books, increases the chances of getting a loan from potential creditors for the company.  However, as the company grows it may switch to LIFO to reduce the amount of taxes it pays to the government.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about firewalls used in [[construction]].  For the [[computer network|networking]] term, see [[firewall (networking)]].''

In construction, a '''firewall''' consists of a  [[window]]less, fireproof [[wall]] (or a wall of substantially heavier construction than other walls in a building) built to prevent [[fire]] from spreading beyond one section of a building.  Such firewalls form the built-up equivalent of [[firebreak]]s in a [[landscape]].  A firewall may contain [[fire door]]s and windows made of fire-rated wired [[glass]].  Their function in containing the undesirable resembles the use of [[bulkhead (partition) | bulkhead]]s in [[shipbuilding]] and [[aircraft]] construction.

Firewalls are also regularly found in [[aircraft]] and in specially prepared [[automobile|cars]] for competition use. For example, a typical conversion of a production car for [[rallying]] will include a metal firewall which seals the [[fuel]] tank off from the interior of the vehicle.  In the event of an accident resulting in fuel spillage, the firewall can prevent burning fuel from entering the passenger compartment, where it could cause serious injury or death.  Firewalls have to be fitted so that they form a complete seal &amp;mdash; usually this is done by bonding the metal sheet to the bodywork using [[fiberglass]] [[resin]].

The term '''firewall''' is also commonly used by automotive [[mechanic]]s to refer to the barrier between the [[passenger]] and [[engine]] compartments of any vehicle.

In [[Norse mythology]], '''Frigg''' (''[[Edda]]s'') or '''Frigga''' (''[[Gesta Danorum]]'') was said to be &quot;foremost among the goddesses,&quot; &lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|1]]&lt;/sup&gt; the wife of [[Odin]], queen of the [[Æsir]], and goddess of the sky.  One of the [[Ásynjur]], she is a goddess of marriage, motherhood, fertility, love, household management, and domestic arts. Her primary functions in the Norse mythological stories are as wife and mother, but these are not her only functions. She has the power of prophecy although she does not tell what she knows &lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|2]]&lt;/sup&gt;, and is the only one other than Odin who is permitted to sit on his high seat [[Hlidskjalf]] and look out over the universe. She also participates in the [[Wild Hunt]] ([[Asgardreid]]) along with her husband. Frigg's children are [[Baldr]], [[Höðr]] and, in an English source, [[Wecta]]; her stepchildren are [[Hermóðr]], [[Heimdall]], [[Tyr]], [[Vidar]], [[Váli (son of Odin)|Váli]], and [[Skjoldr]]. [[Thor]] is either her brother or a stepson. Frigg's companion is [[Eir]], the gods' doctor and goddess of healing. Frigg's attendants are [[Hlín]] (a goddess of protection), [[Gná]] (a messenger goddess), and [[Fulla]] (a fertility goddess). It is unclear whether Frigg's companions and attendants are simply different aspects of Frigg herself (cf. [[avatar]]). According to the poem ''[[Lokasenna]]'' Frigg is the daughter of [[Fjorgyn]] (masculine version of &quot;Earth,&quot; cf. feminine version of &quot;Earth,&quot; Thor's mother), her mother is not identhange]] and a [[financial services]] sector, but they do not define it.

==Origins==
Some theories assume that a free market is a natural form of social organization, and that a free market will arise in any society where it is not obstructed. The consensus among [[economic history|economic historians]] is that the free market economy is a specific historic phenomenon, and that it emerged in late mediaeval and early-modern Europe. Some economic historians see elements of the free market in the economic systems of [[Classical Antiquity]], and in some non-western societies.

By the [[19th century]] the market certainly had organized political support, in the form of laissez-faire liberalism. However, it is not clear if the support preceded the emergence of the market, or followed it. Some historians see it as the result of the success of early liberal [[ideology]], combined with the specific interests of the [[entrepreneur]]. In [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory, the ideology simply expresses the underlying long-term transition from [[feudalism]] to [[capitalism]]. Note that the views on this issue - emergence or implementation - do not necessarily correspond to pro-market and anti-market positions. [[Libertarian]]s would dispute that the market was enforced through government policy, since that has a connotation of repression, and Marxists agree with them, for different reasons.

==Theory==
The law of [[supply and demand]] predominates in the idealized free market, influencing prices toward an [[equilibrium]] that balances the demands for the products against the supplies. At these equilibrium prices, the market distributes the products to the purchasers according to each purchaser's use (or utility) for each product and within the relative limits of each buyer's [[purchasing power]]. The necessary components for the functioning of an idealized free market include the complete absence of artificial price pressures from taxes, subsidies, [[tariff]]s, or government regulation (other than protection from coercion and theft), and no [[government-granted monopoly|government-granted monopolies]] (usually classified as [[coercive monopoly]] by free market advocates) like the [[United States Post Office]], [[Amtrak]], arguably [[patent]]s, etc.

This equilibrating behaviour of free markets makes certain assumptions about their agents, for instance that they act independently. Some models in [[econophysics]] have shown that when agents are allowed to interact locally in a free market (ie. their decisions depend not only on utility and purchasing power, but also on their peers' decisions), prices can become unstable and diverge from the equilibrium, often in an abrupt manner.
The behaviour of the free market is thus said to be non-linear (a pair of agents bargaining for a purchase will agree on a different price than 100 identical pairs of agents doing the identical purchase). Speculation bubbles and the type of [[herd]] behaviour often observed in stock markets are quoted as real life examples of non-equilibrium price trends. Free-market advocates, especially [[Austrian school]] followers, often dismiss this endogenous theory, and blame external influences, such as weather, commodity prices, technological developments, and government meddling on non-equilibrium prices.

The distribution of purchasing power in an economy depends to a large extent on [[social class]], [[labor market|labor]] and [[financial markets]], but also on other, lesser factors such as family relationships, [[inheritance]], [[gift]]s and so on.  Many theories describing the operation of a free market focus primarily on the markets for consumer products, and their description of the labor market or financial markets tends to be more complicated and controversial.

The free market can be seen as facilitating a form of decision-making through what is known as [[dollar voting]], where a purchase of a product is tantamount to casting a vote for a producer to continue producing that product.

The effect of economic freedom on society's and individuals' [[wealth]] remains a subject of controversy. [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[Gerard Debreu]] have shown that under certain idealized conditions, a system of free trade leads to [[Pareto efficiency]].

Many advocates of free makets, most notably [[Milton Friedman]], have also argued that there is a direct relationship between economic growth and economic freedom, though this assertion is much harder to prove both theoretically and empirically.  

Joshua Epstein and Robert Axtell have attempted to predict the properties of free markets in an agent-based computer simulation called sugarscape. They came to the conclusion that, again under idealized conditions, free markets lead to a [[Pareto distribution]] of wealth.

==Practice==
While the free-market is an idealized abstraction, it is useful in understanding real markets whether artificially created and regulated by governments or non-governmental agencies,  or phenomena such as the [[black market]] and the [[underground economy]], which can be remarkably robust in persisting despite attempts to suppress these markets.

==Practical critique of the free market==
Not all advocates of [[capitalism]] consider free markets to be practical. For example, Martin J. Whitman has written, in a discussion of [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]], [[Milton Friedman|Friedman]] and [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]], that these &quot;&amp;hellip;great economists&amp;hellip;missed a lot of details that are part and parcel of every [[value investor]]'s daily life.&quot; While calling Hayek &quot;100% right&quot; in his critique of the pure command economy, he writes &quot;However, in no way does it follow, as many Hayek disciples seem to believe, that government is ''per se'' bad and unproductive while the private sector is, ''per se'' good and productive. In well-run industrial economies, there is a marriage between government and the private sector, each benefiting from the other.&quot; As illustrations of this, he points at &quot;[[Japan]] after [[World War II]], [[Singapore]] and the other [[Asian Tigers]], [[Sweden]] and [[China]] today&amp;hellip; Government has a necessary role in determining how control persons [management, boards of directors, etc.] are incentivized&amp;hellip; &lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Whitman, Third Avenue Value Fund letter to shareholders October 31, 2005. p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
He argues, in particular, for the value of government-provided credit and of carefully crafted tax laws.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Further, Whitman argues (explicitly against Hayek) that &quot;a free market situation is probably also doomed to failure if there exist control persons who are not subject to external disciplines imposed by various forces over and above competition.&quot; The lack of these disciplines, says Whitman, lead to &quot;1. Very exorbitant levels of [[executive compensation]]&amp;hellip; 2. Poorly financed businesses with strong prospects for money defaults on credit instruments&amp;hellip; 3. Speculative [[bubble (economics)|bubbles]]&amp;hellip; 4. Tendency for industry competition to evolve into [[monopoly|monopolies]] and [[oligopoly|oligopolies]]&amp;hellip; 5. Corruption.&quot; For all of these he provides recent examples from the U.S. economy, which he considers to be in some respects under-regulated.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He believes that an apparently &quot;free&quot; relationship&amp;mdash;that between a corporation and its investors and creditors&amp;mdash;is actually a blend of &quot;voluntary exchanges&quot; and &quot;coercion&quot;. For example, there are &quot;voluntary activities, where each individual makes his or her own decision whether to buy, sell, or hold&quot; but there are also &quot;[c]oercive activities, where each individual security holder is forced to go along&amp;hellip;provided that a requisite majority of other security holders so vote&amp;hellip;&quot; Examples of the latter include [[proxy voting]],  most merger and acquisition transactions, certain cash tender offers, and reorganization or liquidation in [[bankruptcy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; 

&quot;I am one with Professor Friedman that, other things being equal, it is far preferable to conduct economic activities through voluntary exchange relying on free markets rather than through coercion. But Corporate America would not work at all unless many activities continued to be coercive.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p.5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The degree of market freedom==
The [[Heritage Foundation]], a [[conservative]] [[think tank]], tried to identify the key factors which allow to measure the degree of freedom of economy of a particular country.  In 1986 they introduced [[Index of Economic Freedom]], which is based on some fifty variables. This and other similar indices do not ''define'' a free market, but measure the ''degree'' to which a modern economy is free, meaning in most cases free of state intervention. The variables are divided into the following major groups:
*Trade policy,
*Fiscal burden of government,
*Government intervention in the economy,
*Monetary policy,
*Capital flows and foreign investment,
*Banking and finance,
*Wages and prices,
*Property rights,
*Regulation, and
*Informal market activity.
Each group is assigned a numerical value between 1 and 5; IEF is the arithmetical mean of the values, rounded to the hundredth.

Initially, countries which were traditionally considered capitalistic received high ratings, but the method improved over time.  Today one can see a vivid correlation between EOF value and country's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]].  &lt;!-- [http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/downloads/economicFreedomandPerCapita.gif] not found 20 Feb 2006. Does someone have an alternate citation? --&gt;

==Ideology and ethics==
Support for the free market as an ordering principle of society is above all associated with [[liberalism]], especially during the [[19th century]]. In Europe, the term 'liberalism' retains its [[connotation]] as the ideology of the free market, but in American usage it came to be associated with government intervention, and acquired a [[pejorative]] meaning for supporters of the free market. Later ideological developments, such as [[minarchism]] and [[libertarianism]] also support the free market, and insist on its pure form. Although the [[Western world]] shares a generally similar form of economy, usage in the United States is to refer to this as [[capitalism]], while in Europe 'free market' is the preferred neutral term. 

[[Marxism]], [[communism]], and [[socialism]] are usually seen as the main ideological opponents of the free market. [[New liberalism|Modern liberalism]] (American usage), and in Europe [[social democracy]], seek only to mitigate what they see as the problems of an unrestrained free market, and accept its existence as such. To most right-wing [[libertarian]]s, there is simply no free market yet, given the degree of state intervention in even the most 'capitalist' of countries. From their perspective, those who say they favor a &quot;free market&quot; are speaking in a relative, rather than an absolute, sense -- meaning (in libertarian terms) they wish that [[coercion]] be kept to the minimum that is necessary to maximize economic freedom (such necessary coercion would be taxation, for example) and to maximize market efficiency by lowering trade barriers, making the tax system neutral in its influence on important decisions such as how to raise capital, e.g., eliminating the [[dividend tax|double tax]] on dividends so that equity financing is not at a disadvantage vis'a'vis debt financing. However, there are some such as [[anarcho-capitalists]] who would not even allow for taxation and governments, instead preferring protectors of economic freedom in the form of private contractors.

The ethical [[justification]] of free markets takes two forms. One appeals to the intrinsic moral superiority of [[autonomy]] and freedom (in the market), see [[deontology]]. The other is a form of [[consequentialism]] - a belief that decentralised planning by a multitude of individuals making free economic decisions produces ''better results'' in regard to a more organized, efficient, and productive economy, than does a centrally-planned economy where a central agency decides what is produced, and allocates goods by non-price mechanisms. An older version of this argument is the [[metaphor]] of the [[Invisible Hand]], familiar from the work of [[Adam Smith]], although it is older. In Smith's time there were no centrally planned economies to serve as a comparison, he was simply arguing that the market benefits the [[common good]]. Modern theories of ''[[self-organization]]'' say the internal organization of a system can increase automatically without being guided or managed by an outside source. When applied to the market, as an ethical justification, they are appealing primarily to its [[intrinsic value]] as a self-organising entity. Intense admiration for these abilities of the market became a characteristic of some pro-market argument in the 1990's, especially among those who saw the [[internet]] as a form of perfect market.

==Legal tender and taxes in a pure free market == 

Some people believe that money, in a truly free market economy, is not monopolized by [[legal tender]] laws or by a central money maker authority which coerces society to use its own money as the unique medium of exchange in trades, in order to receive [[Value added tax|taxes]] from the transactions or to be able to issue [[loan]]s. 

On the other hand, the so called &quot;coercion&quot; of taxes is arguably essential for the market's survival, and a market free from taxes may lead to no market at all. It is obvious that there is no market without private property and it is also obvious that private property itself can only exist while there is someone to defend it and define it. Traditionally, the State defends private property and defines it by issuing ownership titles, and also nominates the central authority to print or mint currency. It is reasonable to coerce people who are doing their exchanges and their trades to give something back in return for the state defense and definition of the money or of the real estate property they gained during those trades. If no taxes are given back to the state then the state collapses. The state's collapse causes private property such as money or real estate to be undefined, and without money or real property, the market, too, may collapse. After the state's collapse only movable goods such as [[energy source]]s or [[information]] or [[weapons]] can (if stored carefully) still remain privately owned and become the subject of a new stateless market. 

&quot;Free market anarchists&quot; disagree with the above assessment, as they maintain that private property and free markets can be protected by voluntarily-funded services under the concept of [[individualist anarchism]]'' and ''[[anarcho-capitalism]]''. A free market could be defined alternatively as a tax-free market, independent of any central authority, which uses as medium of exchange one or several objects (real or virtual ones) that hold the three properties of money (store value, medium of exchange, and unit of account) along with a fourth property of use value (such as energy) or being trusted (as gold was in antiquity) even in the absence of the State. It is disputed, however, whether this hypothetical stateless market could function freely, without coercion and violence.

==Opposition towards free markets==
Critics of laissez-faire variously see the &quot;free market&quot; as an impractical ideal or as a [[rhetorical device]] that puts the concepts of [[freedom]] and anti-[[protectionism]] at the service of vested wealthy interests, allowing them to attack [[labor law]]s and other protections of the [[working class]]es. For example, investment advisor [[Martin J. Whitman]] considers free markets an impracticable ideal: &quot;Corporate America would not work at all unless many activities continued to be coercive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Whitman, Third Avenue Value Fund letter to shareholders October 31, 2005. p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a different critique, [[Noam Chomsky]] argues that the wealthy use free-market rhetoric to justify imposing greater economic [[risk]] upon the lower classes, while being insulated from the rigours of the market by the political and economic advantages that such wealth affords. As the notable political [[activism|activist]] [[Noam Chomsky]] remarked, &quot;the free market is [[socialism]] for the [[wealthy|rich]]&amp;mdash;[free] markets for the poor and state [[protectionism|protection]] for the rich.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Takis Michas, &quot;The Other Chomsky&quot;, ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', November 4, 2005. [http://www.chomsky.info/onchomsky/20051104.htm Reproduced on Chomsky's official site].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky, &quot;The Passion for Free Markets&quot;, ''[[Z Magazine]]'', May 1997.

[[Image:Ford GT40.jpg|thumb|right|250px|GT40 Mk II front. This car won the 24h of Daytona 1966 driven by Ken Miles and Loyd Ruby, giving Ford its first victory in a 24 hour race. (Serial Number GT-40 P 1015 Mk. II)]]
[[Image:Ford GT40 (rear).jpg|thumb|right|250px|GT40 Mk II rear]]

The '''[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] GT40''' was a notable [[sports car]] and winner of the [[24 hours of Le Mans]] four times in a row, from [[1966]] to [[1969]]. It was built to win long-distance [[sports car racing|sports car races]] against [[Ferrari]] (who won at [[List of Le Mans 24h winners|Le Mans]] six times in a row from 1960 to 1965).

The car was named the '''GT40''' after the [[Gran Turismo|Grand Tourisme]] category it was intended to compete in (in fact regulations were changed the car was never homologated in GT) and its overall height of 40 inches (1.02 m, measured at the windscreen) as required by the rules. Large-capacity Ford V8 engines (4.7&amp;nbsp;L and 7&amp;nbsp;L) were used, compared with the Ferrari V12 which had 3.0 L or 4.0 L.

Early cars were simply named &quot;Ford GT&quot; the name GT40 was introduced with the production of the stock Mk. 1.

The contemporary [[Ford GT]] is a modern homage to the GT40.

==History==
[[Henry Ford II]] had wanted a Ford at Le Mans since the early [[1960s]].

Initially, Ford attempted to buy Ferrari. Much to the surprise of Ford who expected long negotiations, the proposal was welcomed by [[Enzo Ferrari]]. A deal had been all but agreed on when Ferrari called the merger off in [[1963]], after an agreement with [[Fiat]] that gave some financial backing to Ferrari, while preserving Ferrari's independance.

Ford had been manipuled to rise the bids with Ferrari and a frustrated Henry Ford II, decided to produce its own car instead. To this end Ford began negotiation with [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]], [[Lola]], and [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]]. Cooper had no experience in GT or prototype and its performances in [[Formula One]] were declining.

Lotus was already Ford partner for their Indy 500 project. While Ford executives had already doubt on the ability of Lotus to handle this new project. [[Colin Chapman]] had probaly similar views as he asked a high price for his contribution and insisted that the car should be named Lotus and not Ford, an attitude that can be viewed as polite refusal. 

The Lola proposal was chosen, since Lola had used a Ford V8 engine in their mid-engined Lola Mk 6 (also known as Lola GT) one of the most advanced racing car of the time that made a noted performance in Le Mans 1962, even if the car didn't finish. However Broadley agreed on a short-term personal contribution to the project without involving Lola cars.

The agreement with Lola cars manager Eric Broadley included a one year collaboration between Ford and Broadley and the sale of the two Lola Mk 6 chassis built to Ford. To form the developpement team Ford also hired the already ex-Aston Martin team manager John Wyer and Ford Motor Co. engineer Roy Lunn was sent to England. Lunn had designed the mid-engined Mustang 1 concept car povered by  1,7 L V4. Despite the small engine of the Mustang 1, Lunn was the only Dearborn's engineer to have some experience with a mid-engined car.

Broadley, Lunn and Wyer began working on the new car at Lola Factory in Bromley. At the end of 1963 the team moved at [[Slough]], [[England]] near Heathrow airport. Ford established a new subsidiary under the direction of Wyer, '''Ford Advancofessions where skills and jobs were considered “depression proof” (government positions, teachers in well-funded districts, doctors, lawyers, etc.) continued to work. Daily life was made more secure if these workers had little debt before the stock market crash, had liquid savings and generally lived without overt extravagances. American middle class households managed to get through the economic depression by adapting to conditions, spending wisely and avoiding unnecessary purchases.

One industry that flourished in America during the 1930s was the movie industry ([[Hollywood]]). The emergence of sound films in the late 1920s, combined with the escapism that film provided to a nation down on its luck, made the film industry one of the few that produced profits throughout the 1930s. Films commonly featured rich sets and carefree characters, allowing an increasingly depression-weary nation to leave its cares behind - if only for the duration of a movie. [[Shirley Temple]]'s films were leading attractions, perhaps because her characters' unwavering hopefulness in the face of trying circumstances spoke to American audiences. Conversely, the film version of Steinbeck’s ''Grapes of Wrath'' (see above), now considered by many to be a masterpiece of American cinema, was a commercial disappointment when it debuted--possibly because it reminded too many moviegoers of the harsh realities of their own situations.

Movie genres that thrived during the 1930s were [[screwball comedy| screwball comedies]], lavish [[Musical_film|musicals]] (notably, [[The Wizard of Oz]]), [[Westerns]] and [[gangster movie]]s.

==International effects==
Many nations experienced an economic decline, though the severity and timing differed from country to country. For example, the [[United Kingdom]] hit its trough in the third quarter of 1932, while [[France]] did not reach its low point until April of 1937. [[Charles P. Kindleberger]] has provided the best international account of the Depression so far in his book ''The World in Depression''.

===Asia===
[[Asia]] was also hit by the Great Depression due to its dependence on the export of raw materials with Europe and America, predominantly rubber and tin for the automotive industry. Asian trade fell sharply as Americla and Europe were gripped by the depression.  Firms in Asia responded by cutting their workforce and reducing wages. 

In [[Japan]], unemployment and poverty rose, disproportionately affecting the lower classes; these hardships were a factor in the rise of [[Japanese nationalism]]. However, compared to some, Japan was not too badly affected.

===Canada===

As America's largest trading partner in the 1930's, [[Canada]] is sometimes considered to be the country hardest hit by the Great Depression. The economy fell further than that of any nation other than the [[United States]], and it took far longer to recover. For example, [[Canada]]'s unemployment rate in 1933-34 reached its acme, when 26% of the population was [[unemployed]]. Western Canada was hit particularly hard during the nadir of the Depression, where a full recovery did not occur until the Second World War began in 1939. When the Depression ended, three parties were engendered in [[Canada]]: the [[CCF]], [[Social Credit Party of Canada]] and the [[Union Nationale]].

Like the rest of the world, [[Canada]]'s economic resuscitation began only with the [[World War II]].

==End of the Great Depression ==
=== In the United States ===
''For further details, see the main [[New Deal]] article.''

It was not until the United States entered World War II that Roosevelt's ideas for massive public expenditures and [[deficit spending]] appeared to work. Roosevelt's administration, of course, had little choice but to increase expenditures, given the war effort. Many of the New Deal policies seemed to work exactly as predicted, winning over many Republicans, who had been the New Deal's greatest opponents. By the end of World War II, Democrats, Republicans and much of the U.S. public assumed that government spendings and deficits were key to economic growth. On the other hand, according to economist [[Robert Higgs]], when looking only at the supply of consumer goods significant GDP growth only resumed in 1946. (Higgs assumes that collective goods like victory in the war were not valued by consumers.) (Source: Robert Higgs (1992), 'Wartime Prosperity? A Reassessment of the U.S. Economy in the 1940s,' ''The Journal of Economic History'' 52(1):41-60.)

From 1932 onward Roosevelt argued that a restructuring of the economy--a &quot;reform&quot; would be needed to prevent another depression.   New Deal programs sought to stimulate [[demand]] and provide work and relief for the impoverished through increased government spending, by:
* instituting regulations which ended what was called &quot;cut throat competition&quot; (in which large players supposedly used [[predatory pricing]] to drive out small players);
* creating regulations which would raise the [[wages]] of ordinary workers, to redistribute wealth so that more people could purchase products. 
The original implementation, in the form of the [[National Recovery Act]], brought in direct unemployment relief, and allowed:
* business to set price codes;
* the NRA board to set labor codes and standards;
* the Federal government to [[underwrite|insure]] the banking system and provide [[price support]]s for [[agriculture]] and [[mining]]. 
This is referred to as the [[First New Deal]]. It was centered around the use of the [[alphabet soup]] of agencies set up in 1933 and 1934, along with the use of previous agencies, to regulate and stimulate the economy. 

The theories behind the New Deal matched the later prescriptions of British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], who advocated increased government spending in a financial crisis. In 1929, federal expenditures constituted only 3% of the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. Between 1933 and 1939, federal expenditure tripled, and Roosevelt's critics accused him of turning America into a socialist, or even [[Stalinist]] state. The aims of the New Deal were as follows: to prevent the economy and banking system from going into a free fall; to provide effective relief until larger economic forces would end the slump; and to prevent those factors which had exacerbated the slump. The New Deal was both a program of national [[recovery]] and of [[reform movement|reform]]. An interesting insight into what motivated Roosevelt came from the transition from the Hoover administration &amp;mdash; both men agreed that it was a global maladjustment of prices, debts and production that was causing the slump. The disagreement came over whether the US government should act first to try and negotiate an end to the root causes internationally, which was Hoover's view, or act for domestic recovery and reform until the international situation could be resolved, which was FDR's view. 

The New Deal was rooted in new ideas, but also in economic orthodoxy of balanced budgets, and restraint of federal power. It represented bigger and broader government than ever before, but not as big as government would later become: spending on the New Deal was far smaller than on the war effort. In short, federal expenditures went from 3% of the GDP in 1929 to about 33% in [[1945]]. The big surprise was just how productive America became: spending financially cured the depression. Between 1939 and 1944 (the peak of wartime production), the nation's output more than doubled. Consequently, unemployment plummeted&amp;mdash;from 19% in 1938 (already down from 1933's 24.9% peak) to 1.2% in 1944&amp;mdash;as the labor force grew by ten million. The [[war economy]] showed just how large the fiscal stimulus required to end the downturn of the Depression was, and it led, at the time, to fears that as soon as America demobilized, that it would return to Depression conditions and industrial output would fall to its pre-war levels. There is general agreement that it was [[World War II]] which finally provided the United States Federal Government with the political will to buy its way out of the Depression and resolve the global [[monetary]] crisis by the imposition of the [[Bretton Woods system]].

Others like [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]], argued that the Great Depression did not resolve itself until after World War II, where the country's economy saw some form of normalcy: reductions in tariffs, lower taxes/spending, reduction of price controls, an end to rationing of goods.  They, along with other microeconomists and free market thinkers, argue that the Great Depression was perpetuated by the New Deal's government influence into the economy, and also argued that the policy prescriptions under the Bretton Woods accord would create new economic problems of their own rather than solve current ones.  They also argued that much of the regulation, legislation, and court rulings that came about during the great depression resulted in not the protection of competition but the protection of competitors at the expense of competition and consumers.

==Political Perspectives on Causes and Cures==
There are multiple competing interpretations about what caused the Great Depression.  The debate is important because the public and policy makers ever since 1929 have demanded that such a disaster never again happen, so it is imperative to explain why.  Economists do not agree on what caused the depression or what prolonged it.  The '''political''' interpretations especially important in the USA are as follows:

====Microeconomists: restrictions to blame====
Many economists at the time argued that the sharp decline in international trade after 1930 helped to worsen the depression.  Some also argued that the growing body of economic intervention after 1932 contributed to the markets inability to react to abrupt changes and kept unemployment high in some countries, such as the US.  The British Empire promoted trade inside the Empire (and not with the U.S.A.)  Germany promoted economic autarky in which countries received benefits (or threats) for trading with Germany.

====Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act to blame==== 
Most historians and economists assign the [[Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act]] of 1930 part of the blame for worsening the depression by reducing international trade and causing retaliation. As for the United States, foreign trade was a small part of overall economic activity; it was a much larger factor in most other countries.  [http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/depress.htm] The average ad valorem rate of duties on dutiable imports for 1921-1925 was 25.9% but under the new tariff it jumped to 50.0% in 1931-1935.  In spite of the objection of more than a thousand members of the American Economic Association Hoover signed the tariff for several reasons. It embodied his recommendations of increased agricultural protection, and reorganizing the Tariff Commission. Hoover constantly praised the law for helping American farmers and the American home market; he ignored the threat to exporters.  It became a major campaign issue in 1932, but Hoover rejected Roosevelt's charges that &quot;the Hawley-Smoot Tariff is one of the most important factors in the present world-wide depression,&quot; and that 
&quot;it has destroyed international commerce.&quot;  Hoover responded, &quot;So they would have us believe this world catastrophe and this destruction of foreign trade happened because the United States increased tariff on one-fourth of one-third of one-eighth of the world's imports. Thus we pulled down the world, so they tell us, by increases of less than one per cent of the goods being imported by the world.&quot; [''Hoover State Papers'', II, 343]

In dollar terms American exports declined from $5.2 billion in 1929 to $1.7 billion in 1933; but prices also fell so the physical volume of exports did not decline as much. Hardest hit were farm commodities such as wheat, cotton, tobacco, and lumber.  According to this theory, the collapse of farm exports caused many American farmers to default on their loans leading to the bank runs on small rural banks that characterized the early years of the Great Depression.

=====Monetarism: Federal reserve to blame=====   
[[Milton Friedman]] and [[Ben Bernanke]] stress the negative role of the Federal Reserve System. It cut the money supply by one-third from 1929 to 1932. There was much less money to go around, businessmen could not get new loans--and could not even get their old loans renewed. They had to stop investing. Not because they did not want to (as the Keynesian model said), but because banks could not lend them the money they needed. This interpretation blames the government and calls for a much more careful Federal Reserve policy. Bernanke became the Chairman of the Federal Reserve System in 2006.

====The Far Left: capitalism to blame====
The revolutionary left, including some socialists, together with communists and anarchists, saw the Great Depression as the beginning of capitalism's final collapse. Their remedy was to build up their movements to take over the labor unions, and perhaps eventually the government. The New Deal did change the laws to help unions grow--but they split into warring AFL and CIO factions and neutralized much of their potential political influence.  Unions grew even faster during the war.

====New Dealers: Business to Blame====
Roosevelt and most of the New Dealers primarily blamed the excesses of big business for causing an unstable bubble-like economy.  The problem was that business had too much power, and the New Deal intended to remedy that by empowering labor unions and farmers (which they did), and by raising taxes on corporate profits (they tried and failed). Regulation of the economy was a favorite remedy.  Some of those regulations, such as establishing the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] which regulates Wall Street, won widespread support and continue to this day. Most of the other regulations were abolished or scaled back in a bipartisan wave of [[deregulation]] 1975-85.

====Keynesianism: public behaviour to blame====
The British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] coined the term &quot;the paradox of thrift&quot; to describe the deepening of the Great Depression after 1929. The paradox of thrift indicates that when people decide to save more this may end up causing people to save less. The increased savings (reduced spending) due to the panic following the stock market crash of 1929 left markets saturated, contributing to price deflation, perpetuating the Great Depression. When people decided to save more (spend less) businesses responded by cutting back on production and laying off workers. Businesses, cutting back on investment spending because they were pessimistic about the future as well, were also doing their share of causing a reduction in aggregate expenditures, reducing their investments, setting in motion a dangerous cycle: less investment, fewer jobs, less consumption and even less reason for business to invest. The lower aggregate expenditures in the economy contributed to a multiple decline in income well below full employment. The economy may reach perfect balance, but at a cost of high unemployment and social misery. At the lower income levels during the Great Depression savings were much lower than before-- hence, the paradox of thrift. As a result, Keynesian economists were increasingly calling for government to take up the slack.

===The New Deal and Keynesian economics===
In the early 1930s, before [[John Maynard Keynes]] wrote ''The General Theory'', he was advocating public works programs and deficits as a way to get the British economy out of the Depression. Although Keynes never mentions fiscal policy in The General Theory, and instead advocates the need to socialize investments, Keynes ushered in more of a theoretical revolution than a policy one. Keynes's basic idea was simple. In order to keep people fully employed, governments have to run deficits when the economy is slowing because the private sector won't invest enough. Many politicians, however, failed to understand his idea.

As the Depression wore on, Franklin D. Roosevelt tried public works, farm subsidies and other devices to restart the economy, but he never completely gave up trying to balance the budget. As a result, unemployment remained high throughout the New Deal years; consumption, investment, and net exports-- the pillars of economic growth-- remained low. With [[fiscal policy]], however, government could provide the needed increased spending by decreasing taxes, increasing government spending, increasing individuals' incomes. As individuals incomes would increase, they would spend more. As they spent more, the [[multiplier effect]] would take over and expand the effect on the initial spending. Expansionary fiscal policy thus involves decreasing taxes or increasing government spending to counteract [[cyclical unemployment]] and slow growth during a recession.

It was [[World War II]], not the New Deal, that finally ended the crisis. Nor did the New Deal substantially alter the distribution of power within American [[capitalism]]; and it had only a small impact on the distribution of wealth among the American people.

Keynes's visit to the [[White House]] in 1934 to urge President Roosevelt to do more deficit spending was a debacle. A dazed, overwhelmed Roosevelt complained to Labor Secretary [[Frances Perkins]], &quot;He left a whole rigmarole of figures-- he must be a mathematician rather than a political economist.&quot;  Keynes, equally frustrated with the encounter, later told Secretary Perkins that he had &quot;supposed the President was more literate, economically speaking.&quot;

===The recession of 1937 and recovery===
The Roosevelt administration was under assault during FDR's second term, which presided over a new dip in the Great Depression in the fall of 1937 that continued through most of 1938. Production declined sharply, as did profits and employment. Unemployment jumped from 14.3% in 1937 to 19.0% in 1938. It was, in the largest measure, a result of a premature effort by the administration to balance the budget by reducing federal spending.  

The administration reacted by launching a rhetorical campaign against monopoly power, which was cast as the cause of the new dip. The president appointed an aggressive new direction of the antitrust division of the Justice Department, but this effort lost its effectiveness once World War II, a far more pressing concern, began.

But the administration's other response to the 1937 deepening of the Great Depression had more tangible results. Ignoring the vitriolic pleas of the Treasury Department and responding to the urgings of the converts to Keynesian economics and others in his administration, Roosevelt embarked on an antidote to the depression, reluctantly abandoning his efforts to balance the budget and launching a $5 billion spending program in the spring of 1938, an effort to increase mass purchasing power. The New Deal had in fact engaged in deficit spending since 1933, but it was apologetic about it, because a rise in the national debt was opposite of what the Democratic party had always preached.  Now they had a theory to justify what they were doing.  Roosevelt explained his program in a [[Fireside chats|fireside chat]] in which he finally acknowledged that it was therefore up to the government to &quot;create an economic upturn&quot; by making &quot;additions to the purchasing power of the nation.&quot; 

Business-oriented observers explained the recession and recovery in very different terms from the Keynesians.  They argued that the New Deal had been very hostile to business expansion in 1935-37, had encouraged massive strikes which had a negative impact on major industries such as automobiles, and had threatened massive anti-trust legal attacks on big corporations.  All those threats diminished sharply after 1938.  For example, the antitrust efforts fizzled out without major cases. The CIO and AFL unions started battling each other more than corporations, and tax policy became more favorable to long-term growth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Gypsy Poster.jpg|right|thumb|width=150px|[[Deborah Gibson]](left) and [[Betty Buckley]] in promotional poster for 1998 production of ''Gypsy'']]

'''''Gypsy: A Musical Fable''''' is a musical with music by [[Jule Styne]], lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]], and a book by [[Arthur Laurents]].  It is frequently considered one of the crowning achievements of the mid-20th century's conventional musical theatre art form, often called the &quot;[[book musical]].&quot; ''Gypsy'' is loosely based on the memoirs of [[Gypsy Rose Lee]], the famous [[striptease]] artist, and focuses on her struggle with her mother, Mama Rose, whose name has become synonymous with &quot;the ultimate show business mother.&quot;  It contains many songs that became popular standards, including &quot;Small World,&quot; &quot;Everything's Coming Up Roses,&quot; &quot;You'll Never Get Away from Me,&quot; and &quot;Let Me Entertain You.&quot; 

The original staging, produced by [[David Merrick]], opened on [[May 21]], [[1959]] and starred [[Ethel Merman]] and [[Jack Klugman]], with Sandra Church in the title role.  Choreography was by [[Jerome Robbins]].

Three songs were cut from the show: &quot;Momma's Talkin' Soft,&quot; &quot;[If I Had] Three Wishes for Christmas,&quot; and &quot;Nice She Ain't.&quot;

In 1962, [[Warner Bros.]] released a film version, starring, respectively, [[Rosalind Russell]], [[Karl Malden]], and [[Natalie Wood]]. [[Lisa Kirk]] dubbed Rosalind Russell's singing voice, but Russell's attempts at singing were rediscovered on scratchy [[acetate disc]]s and recently made available as supplements on the CD reissue of the film soundtrack.

The musical has been revived three times on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], running from 1974&amp;ndash;1975 with [[Angela Lansbury]] as Rose, from 1989&amp;ndash;1991 with [[Tyne Daly]] initially as Rose, later replaced by [[Linda Lavin]], and most recently in 2003 with [[Bernadette Peters]].

The musical was also adapted as a [[television]] movie in 1993 with [[Bette Midler]] playing Rose, and directed by [[Emile Ardolino]]. [[Cynthia Gibb]] portrayed Louise and Jennifer Beck portrayed Dainty June.

A 1998 production featuring [[Betty Buckley]] and [[Deborah Gibson]] at the [[Paper Mill Playhouse]] never made it to Broadway, but became a subject of some notoriety in the theatre community when e-mails from an anonymous cast member detailing the backstage behaviour of the stars became public.  The author was eventually revealed as [[John Flynn]], who has now done several New York stagings of his cabaret act (with parodies of ''Gypsy'' songs), ''Dances with Pitchforks'', based on his experiences portraying &quot;Non-Equity Farmboy 5&quot;.

In 2003, a [[Sam Mendes]]-directed production of ''Gypsy'' played at the [[Shubert Theatre]].  Bernadette Peters played Rose, Tammy Blanchard portrayed Louise, and John Dossett played Herbie. 

The role of Mama Rose in ''Gypsy'' is regarded as the pinnacle of all diva roles in musical theatre, as seen by its frequent revivals with big name stars (some perhaps more deserving than others), a reputation that began with its original cast and the legendary Ethel Merman.  However, in the most recent revival Arthur Laurents, book writer and previous director of the show, praised Bernadette Peters &quot;as the best&quot; Rose yet, bringing to the role a poignant &quot;sense of vunerability.&quot;  Due to a poor marketing strategy and an unfortunate vocal infection of its star during previews, the Peters revival of ''Gypsy'' received limited commercial success despite critics' approval.  Ms. Peters was nominated for a Tony Award for her performance as Mama Rose, famously singing the Act II closer &quot;Rose's Turn&quot; at the 2004 Tonys, but did not win.

[[Image:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|right|Galileo Galilei]]
'''Galileo Galilei''' ([[Pisa]], [[February 15]] [[1564]] &amp;ndash; [[Arcetri]], [[January 8]] [[1642]]), was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[physicist]], [[astronomer]], and [[philosopher]] who is closely associated with the [[scientific revolution]]. His achievements include improvements to the [[telescope]], a variety of astronomical observations, the first [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's First Law: Law of Inertia|law of motion]], the second [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's Second Law: Fundamental Law of Dynamics|law of motion]], and effective support for [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicanism]]. He has been referred to as the &quot;[[List of people known as the father or mother of something|father]] of modern [[astronomy]]&quot;, as the &quot;mother of modern [[physics]]&quot;, and as &quot;father of [[science]]&quot;. His experimental work is widely considered complementary to the writings of [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]] in establishing the modern [[scientific method]]. Galileo's career coincided with that of [[Johannes Kepler]]. The work of Galileo is considered to be a significant break from that of [[Aristotle]]. In addition, his conflict with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] is taken as a major early example of the conflict of authority and [[freedom of thought]], particularly with [[science]], in [[Western society]].

==Family and early career==
Galileo was born in [[Pisa]], in the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] region of [[Italy]], the son of [[Vincenzo Galilei]], a mathematician and musician born in Florence in 1520, and Giulia Ammannati, born in Pescia and married in 1563. Galileo was their first child. Although a devout [[Catholic]], Galileo fathered three children out of wedlock. All were the children of Galileo and [[Marina Gamba]]. Because of their illegitimate birth, both girls were sent to the convent of San Matteo in Arcetri at early ages.

* Virginia (1600&amp;ndash;1634) who took the name [[Maria Celeste]] upon entering a convent. Galileo's eldest child, the most beloved, and inherited her father's sharp mind. She died on April 2, 1634. She is buried with Galileo at the [[Basilica di Santa Croce di Firenze]].
* Livia  (b. 1601) took the name Suor Arcangela. Was sickly for most of her life at the convent.
* Vincenzio (b. 1606) was later legitimized and married Sestilia Bocchineri.

Galileo was home-schooled at a very young age. After that he attended the [[University of Pisa]], but was forced to cease his study there for financial reasons. However, he was offered a position on its faculty in 1589 and taught mathematics. Soon after, he moved to the [[University of Padua]], and served on its faculty teaching [[geometry]], [[mechanics]], and [[astronomy]] until 1610. During this time he explored science and made many landmark discoveries.

==Experimental science==
In the pantheon of the scientific revolution, Galileo takes a high position because of his pioneering use of quantitative experiments with results analysed mathematically. There was no tradition of such methods in European thought at that time; the great experimentalist who immediately preceded Galileo, [[William Gilbert]], did not use a quantitative approach. However, Galileo's father, [[Vincenzo Galilei]], had performed experiments in which he discovered what may be the oldest known non-linear relation in physics, between the tension and the pitch of a stretched string. Galileo also contributed to the rejection of blind allegiance to authority (like the Church) or other thinkers (such as [[Aristotle]]) in matters of science and to the separation of science from [[philosophy]] or religion. These are the primary justifications for his description as the &quot;father of science&quot;.

In the 20th century some authorities challenged the reality of Galileo's experiments, in particular the distinguished French [[History of science and technology|historian of science]] [[Alexandre Koyré]]. The experiments reported in ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' to determine the law of acceleration of falling bodies, for instance, required accurate measurements of time, which appeared to be impossible with the technology of the 1600s. According to Koyré, the law was arrived at deductively, and the experiments were merely illustrative thought experiments.

Later research, however, has validated the experiments. The experiments on falling bodies (actually rolling balls) were replicated using the methods described by Galileo (Settle, 1961), and the precision of the results was consistent with Galileo's report. Later research into Galileo's unpublished working papers from as early as 1604 clearly showed the reality of the experiments and even indicated the particular results that led to the time-squared law (Drake, 1973).

==Astronomy==
===Contributions===
Although the popular idea of Galileo inventing the [[telescope]] is inaccurate, he was one of the first people to use the telescope to observe the [[sky]], and for a time was one of very few people able to make a telescope good enough for the purpose. Based on sketchy descriptions of telescopes invented in the [[Netherlands]] in 1608, Galileo made one with about 8x magnification, and then made improved models up to about 20x. On [[August 25]], [[1609]], he demonstrated his first telescope to [[Venice|Venetian]] lawmakers. His work on the device also made for a profitable sideline with merchants who found it useful for their shipping businesses. He published his initial telescopic astronomical [[observation]]s in March 1610 in a short treatise entitled ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' (''Sidereal Messenger'').

[[image:galileo.script.arp.600pix.jpg|thumb|200px|right|It was on this page that Galileo first noted an observation of the [[natural satellite|moons]] of [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]. This observation upset the notion that all celestial bodies must revolve around the Earth. Galileo published a full description in ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' in March 1610.]]



On [[January 7]], [[1610]] Galileo discovered three of [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]'s four largest [[natural satellite|satellites]] (moons): [[Io (moon)|Io]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], and [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]]. [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] he discovered four nights later. He determined that these moons were [[orbit]]ing the [[planet]] since they would appear and disappear; something he attributed to their movement behind Jupiter. He made additional observations of them in 1620. Later astronomers overruled Galileo's naming of these objects, changing his ''Medicean stars'' to [[Galilean_moons|''Galilean satellites'']]. The demonstration that a planet had smaller planets orbiting it was problematic for the orderly, comprehensive picture of the [[geocentric model]] of the universe, in which everything circled around the [[Earth]].

Galileo noted that [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] exhibited a full set of [[Lunar phase|phase]]s like the [[Moon]]. The [[heliocentric model]] of the solar system developed by [[Copernicus]] predicted that all phases would be visible since the orbit of Venus around the [[Sun]] would cause its illuminated hemisphere to face the Earth when it was on the opposite side of the Sun and to face away from the Earth when it was on the Earth-side of the Sun. By contrast, the [[geocentric model]] of [[Ptolemy]] predicted that only crescent and new phases would be seen, since Venus was thought to remain between the Sun and Earth during its orbit around the Earth. Galileo's observation of the phases of Venus proved that Venus orbited the Sun and lent support to (but did not prove) the [[heliocentric model]].

Galileo was one of the first Europeans to observe [[sunspot]]s, although there is evidence that [[China|Chinese]] astronomers had done so before. He also reinterpreted a sunspot observation from the time of [[Charlemagne]], which formerly had been attributed (impossibly) to a transit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]. The very existence of sunspots showed another difficulty with the unchanging perfection of the heavens as assumed in the older philosophy. And the annual variations in their motions, first noticed by Francesco Sizzi, presented great difficulties for either the geocentric system or that of [[Tycho Brahe]]. A dispute over priority in the discovery of sunspots led to a long and bitter feud with [[Christoph Scheiner]]; in fact, there can be little doubt that both of them were beaten by [[David Fabricius]] and his son [[Johannes Fabricius|Johannes]].

He was the first to report lunar [[mountain]]s and [[impact crater|crater]]s, whose existence he deduced from the patterns of light and shadow on the Moon's surface. He even estimated the mountains' heights from these observations. ractical means of moving people and freight. Anything and everything floated on the lakes. Some ended up on the bottom due to storms, fires, collisions and underwater hazards. (See ''[[SS_Edmund_Fitzgerald|Edmund Fitzgerald]]'' and ''[[Le Griffon]]''.)  [[Barge|Barges]] from middle [[North America]] were able to reach the Atlantic Ocean from the Great Lakes when the [[Erie Canal]] opened in [[1825]].  By 1848, with the opening of the [[Illinois_and_Michigan_Canal|Illinois and Michigan Canal]] at [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], direct access to the Mississippi River was possible from the lakes.  With these two canals an all-inland water route was provided between New York City and New Orleans.

The main business of many of the passenger lines in the 1800s was transporting [[immigration|immigrants]]. Many of the larger cities owe their existence to their position on the lakes as a freight destination as well as for being a magnet for immigrants. After railroads and surface roads developed the freight and passenger businesses dwindled and, excepting ferries and a few foreign cruise ships, now has vanished.

Yet, the immigration routes still have an effect today. Immigrants often formed their own communities and some areas have a pronounced ethnicity, say Dutch, German, Polish or Finnish, among many others. Since many immigrants settled for a time in New England before moving westward, many areas  on the U.S. side of the Great Lakes also have a New England feel, especially in home styles and accent.

Since general freight these days is transported by railroads and trucks (lorries), domestic ships mostly move bulk cargoes, such as [[iron ore]] and its derivatives, [[coal]] and [[limestone]] for the [[steel]] industry. The domestic bulk freight developed because of the nearby mines. It was more economical to transport the ingredients for steel to centralized plants rather than try to make steel on the spot. Ingredients for steel, however, are not the only bulk shipments made. Grain exports are also a major shipping commodity on the lakes.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, iron and other ores such as copper were shipped south (downbound ships) and supplies, food staples, and coal was shipped north (upbound). Due to the location of the coal fields in [[Pennsylvania]] and [[West Virginia]], and the general northeast track of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], railroads naturally developed shipping routes that went due north to ports such as [[Erie, Pennsylvania]] and [[Ashtabula, Ohio]].


Because the lake maritime community largely developed independently, it has its own language. Ships, no matter the size, are referred to as ''boats''. When the sailing ships gave way to steamships, they were called ''steamboats''&amp;mdash;the same term used on the Mississippi. The ships also have a distinctive design. Ships that primarily trade on the lakes are known as ''lakers''. Foreign boats are known as ''salties''.

One of the more common sights on the lakes is the 1,000 by 105-foot (305 by 32-m), 60,000 U.S. [[long ton]] (61,000 [[tonne|metric tonnes]]) self-unloader. This is a laker with a huge conveyor belt system that can unload itself by swinging a crane over the side. Understandably, because most things go by land and the fact that one modern ship is the equivalent of many older ships, the Great Lakes fleet is a fraction of what it once was.

===Modern economy===

The Great Lakes are used as a major mode of [[transport]] for bulk goods. The brigantine ''[[Le Griffon]]'', which was commissioned by [[René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]], was towed to the southern end of the [[Niagara River]], to become the first sailing ship to travel the upper Great Lakes on [[August 7]], [[1679]].

In 2002, 162 million net tons of dry bulk cargo was moved on the Lakes. This was, in order of volume: iron ore, coal, stone, grain, salt, cement and potash. The iron ore and much of the stone and coal are used in the steel industry. There is also some shipping of liquid and containerized cargo but most container ships cannot pass the locks on the Saint Lawrence Seaway because they are too wide. The total amount of shipping on the lakes has been on a downward trend for several years.    

[[Image:Carlb-lake-ontario-02.jpg|right|350px|Wolfe Islander III, Kingston, Ontario]]
Recreational boating and tourism are major industries on the Great Lakes. A few small cruise ships operate on the Great Lakes including a couple of [[sailing|sailing ships]]. Sport fishing, commercial fishing, and Native American fishing represent a US$4 billion a year industry with [[salmon]], [[whitefish (genus)|whitefish]], [[smelt]], [[lake trout]], and [[walleye]] being major catches.

The Great Lakes are used to supply drinking water to tens of millions of people in bordering areas. This valuable resource is collectively administered by the state and provincial governments adjacent to the lakes.

===Passenger traffic===

Several ferries operate on the Great Lakes to carry passengers to various islands, including [[Isle Royale]], [[Pelee, Ontario|Pelee Island]], [[Mackinac Island]], [[Beaver Island (Lake Michigan)|Beaver Island]], both [[Bois Blanc Island]]s, [[Kelleys Island, Ohio|Kelleys Island]], [[South Bass Island]], [[North Manitou Island]], [[South Manitou Island]], [[Harsens Island]], [[Manitoulin Island]], and the [[Toronto Islands]]. [[2005|As of 2005]], three car ferry services cross the Great Lakes: a steamer across Lake Michigan from [[Ludington, Michigan]] to [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin]]; a high speed catamaran on a second Lake Michigan route from [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] to [[Muskegon, Michigan]]; and [[Spirit of Ontario I|an international ferry]] across Lake Ontario from [[Rochester, New York]] to [[Toronto, Ontario]].

===Perils on the Inland Seas===

Travel on the Lakes has not been without risks.  There are parts where no land is visible due to the curvature of the earth and the immense size of the Lakes: thus they are sometimes referred to as ''inland seas''.

[[Storm]]s and [[reef]]s are a common threat, and many thousands of [[ship]]s have sunk in these waters. It is estimated that between 6,000 and 10,000 ships have sunk or been stranded since the early 1800s, many with partial or total loss of crew. This area is prone to sudden and severe storms, particularly in the autumn from late October until early December.  The [[Great Lakes Storm of 1913]] became the worst Great Lakes storm on record: at least 12 ships sank, and 31 more were stranded on rocks and beaches. At least 248 sailors lost their lives over that weekend.  The [[SS Edmund Fitzgerald|SS ''Edmund Fitzgerald'']], which sank November 10, 1975, was famously the last major freighter lost on the lakes.

The greatest concentration of these wrecks lies near [[Thunder Bay (Michigan)]], beneath Lake Huron, near the point where eastbound and westbound shipping lanes converge.  Today there is a U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] Marine Archeology Research Station located in the [[Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary]].  Here divers can explore more than 200 shipwrecks that form one of the most concentrated and best preserved [[maritime archaeology]] sites in the world.

===Invasive species===

The Great Lakes have been hit economically by various [[invasive species]], two of the most significant being the [[Lamprey|sea lamprey]] and [[zebra mussel]]. The mussel clogs pipes leading to the lake and causes approximately US$1 billion in damages per year while destroying native species. The lamprey feeds on the sport fish of the lake, making it less attractive to fishermen.  An electric fence has been set up across the mouth of the Great Lakes in order to keep an invasive species of carp out of the area.

==Political issues==

The [[International Joint Commission]] was established in 1909 to help prevent and resolve disputes relating to the use and quality of boundary waters, and to advise Canada and the United States on questions related to water resources. Concerns over diversion of Lake water are of concern to both Americans and Canadians. Some water is diverted through the [[Chicago River]] to operate the [[Illinois Waterway]] but the flow is limited by treaty. Possible schemes for bottled water plants and diversion to dry regions of the continent raise concerns. Under the U.S. &quot;Water Resources Development Act&quot;[http://www.ohiodnr.com/water/planing/greatlksgov/fedstatut.htm], diversions of water from the Great Lakes basin requires the approval of all eight Great Lakes governors, which rarely occurs. International treaties regulate large diversions. In 1998, the Canadian company [[Nova Group]] won approval from the Province of Ontario to withdraw 600,000 m&amp;sup3; (158,000,000 US gal) of Lake Superior water annually to ship by tanker to Asian countries. Public outcry forced the abandonment of the plan before it began.

The [[Rush-Bagot Treaty|Rush-Bagot Agreement]] of 1817 limits the number of armed vessels permitted on the Great Lakes. Some are wondering if this agreement will survive the aftermath of [[September 11, 2001]].

[[Lake Champlain]] on the border between upstate [[New York]] and northwestern [[Vermont]] briefly became the sixth &quot;Great Lake of the [[United States]]&quot; on [[March 6]], [[1998]], when [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] signed Senate Bill 927.  This bill, which reauthorized the [[National Sea Grant Program]], contained a line penned by Senator [[Patrick Leahy]] (D-VT) declaring [[Lake Champlain]] to be a Great Lake.  Not coincidentally, this status allows neighboring states to apply for additional federal research and education funds allocated to these national resources.  Following a small uproar (and several ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' articles), the Great Lake status was rescinded (although [[Vermont]] universities continue to receive funds to monitor and study the lake).

===Ecological challenges===

The Lakes provided fish to the [[American Indian|Native]] groups who lived near them or upon their shores.  Early European settlers were astounded by both the variety and quantity of fish. Historically, fish populations were the early indicator of the condition of the Lakes, and have remained one of the key indicators even in our technological era of sophisticated analyses and measuring instruments.  According to the bi-national (U.S. and Canadian) resource book, ''The Great Lakes: An Environmental Atlas and Resource Book'', &quot;the largest Great Lakes fish harvests were recorded in 1889 and 1899 at some 67,000 tonnes (147 million pounds),&quot; though the beginning of environmental impacts on the fish can be traced back nearly a century prior to those years.

By 1801, New York legislators found it necessary to pass regulations curtailing obstructions to the natural migrations of Atlantic salmon from Lake Erie into their spawning channels.  In the early nineteenth century, Upper Canada’s government found it necessary to introduce similar legislation prohibiting the use of weirs and nets at the mouths of Lake Ontario’s tributaries.  Other protective legislation was passed as well, but enforcement remained difficult and often quite spotty.

On both sides of the U.S.-Canada border, the proliferation of dams and impoundments multiplied, necessitating more regulatory efforts.  The decline in fish populations was unmistakable by the middle of the nineteenth century.  The decline in [[salmon]] was recognized by Canadian officials and reported as virtually a complete absence by the end of the 1860s. The Wisconsin Fisheries Commission noted a reduction of roughly 25 percent in general fish harvests by 1875.

Overfishing was cited as responsible for the decline of the population of various [[whitefish]], important due to their culinary desirability and, hence, economic consequence. Moreover, between 1879 and 1899, reported whitefish harvests declined from some 24.3 million pounds (11 million kg) to just over 9 million pounds (4 million kg).  Recorded sturgeon catches fell from 7.8 million pounds (1.5 million kg) in 1879 to 1.7 million pounds (770,000 kg) in 1899.

There were, however, other factors in the declines besides overfishing and the problems posed by dams and other obstructions.  [[Logging]] in the region removed tree cover near stream channels which provide spawning grounds, and this affected necessary shade and temperature-moderating conditions.  Removal of tree cover also destabilized soil, allowing soil to be carried in greater quantity into the streambeds, and even brought about more frequent flooding.  Running cut logs down the Lakes’ tributary rivers also stirred bottom sediments.  In 1884, the New York Fish Commission determined that the dumping of sawmill waste (chips and sawdust) was impacting fish populations.

The Great Lakes are international, and in situations that require regulation, a lack of cooperation between the U.S. and Canada might be predicted to have disastrous consequences.  In the development of ecological problems in the Great Lakes, it was the influx of parasitic [[lamprey]] populations after the development of the [[Erie Canal]] and the much later [[Welland Canal]] that led to the two federal governments attempting to work together – which proved a very complicated and troubled road.

Nevertheless, despite the ever more sophisticated efforts to eliminate or minimize the lamprey, by the mid 1950s Lake Michigan and Huron’s lake trout populations were reduced by about 99%, with the lamprey deemed largely to blame.  A result was the bi-national Great Lakes Fishery Commission.

Other ecological problems in the Lakes and their surroundings have stemmed from urban sprawl, sewage disposal, and toxic industrial effluent.  These, of course, also affect aquatic food chains and fish populations.  Some of these glaring problem areas are what attracted the high-level publicity of Great Lakes ecological troubles in the 1960s and 1970s.  Evidence of chemical pollution in the Lakes and their tributaries now stretches back for decades.  In the late 1960s, the recurrent phenomenon of the surface of river stretches (see Ohio’s [[Cuyahoga River]]) catching fire, due to a combination of oil, chemicals, and combustible materials floating on the water’s surface, came to the attention of a public growing more environmentally aware.  Another aspect that caught popular attention was the “toxic blobs” (expanses of lake bed covered by various combinations of such substances as solvents, wood preservatives, coal tar, and metals) found in Lake Superior, the St. Clair River, and other portions of the Great Lakes region.

According to the authoritative bi-national source ''The Great Lakes: An Environmental Atlas and Resource Book'', &quot;Only pockets remain of the once large commercial fishery.&quot;

'''Girth''' generally refers to the [[circumference]] of a cylindrical object, such as a tree trunk.

In [[graph theory]], the '''girth''' of a graph is the length of the shortest [[glossary of graph theory#Cycle|cycle]] contained in the graph. If the graph doesn't contain any cycles, its girth is defined to be [[infinity]].

For example, a 4-cycle (square) has girth 4. A grid has girth 4 as well, and a triangular mesh has girth 3.

A [[cubic graph]] of girth &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; that is as small as possible is known as a &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;-[[cage graph]].  The [[Petersen graph]] is the unique 5-cage (it is the smallest cubic graph of girth 5).  The [[Heawood graph]] is the unique 6-cage, and the [[Tutte eight cage]] is the unique 8-cage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''(For discussions on politics concerning firearms and gun safety, see [[Gun Politics]] or [[Talk:Gun Politics]]. This page only deals with non-political aspects of gun safety.)''

'''Gun safety''' is a collection of rules and recommendations that can be applied when handling [[Firearm|firearms]]. The purpose of gun safety is to eliminate or minimize the risks of unintentional damage, injury and/or death caused by improper handling of firearms.

== Gun safety rules and mindset ==

[[Image:Gun_safety.jpg|thumb|Example of safe gun use. The gun is pointed at the ground and the handler's finger is off the trigger.]]

Gun safety training seeks to instill a certain mindset and appropriate habits, or rules. The mindset is that firearms are inherently dangerous and must always be handled with care. Handlers are taught to treat firearms with respect for their destructive capabilities, and strongly discouraged from playing or toying with firearms, a common cause of accidents.

The rules of gun safety follow from this mindset. While there are many variations, the following rules are those most commonly taught during gun safety training:

*Always treat firearms as if they are loaded, not safetied, and ready to fire.
*Always point the [[Muzzle (firearm)|muzzle]] away from anything and everything which you do not intend to fire upon.
*Always keep your fingers away from the trigger until you are ready to fire.
*Always be sure of your target and its surroundings.

=== Treat firearms as if they are loaded ===

This rule is a matter of proper mindset rather than a specific habit. Many firearm accidents result from the handler believing a firearm is emptied, safetied, or otherwise not ready to fire when in fact it is ready. If a handler always treats firearms as capable of being fired at any time, the handler is more likely to take precautions to prevent an unintentional discharge and to avoid damage or injury if one does occur.

The phrase &quot;The gun is always loaded&quot; is often used. The purpose is to discourage mental habits such as &quot;I know my gun is empty so (some unsafe practice) is OK.&quot; Inexperienced handlers often think this way and accidents can happen as a result. A gun safety instructor can respond to such reasoning by restating the rule: &quot;No, your gun is '''always''' loaded&quot;.

=== Point the muzzle away from non-targets ===

This rule is intended to minimize the damage caused by an unintended discharge. The first rule teaches that a firearm must be assumed to be ready to fire. This rule goes beyond that and says &quot;Since the firearm might fire, assume that it '''will''' and make sure no harm occurs when it does&quot;. 

A consequence of this rule is that any kind of playing or &quot;toying&quot; with firearms is prohibited. Playfully pointing firearms at people or other non-targets violates this rule.

Two natural &quot;safe&quot; directions to point the muzzle are upwards (at the sky) and downwards (at the ground). Both have their advantages and disadvantages. Firing at the ground may result in a [[ricochet]] or cause hazardous fragments to be flung at people or Söderköping]]

'''General Motors Corporation''' ({{nyse|GM}}), also known as '''GM''', is a [[United States]]-based [[automobile maker]] with worldwide operations and brands including [[Buick]], [[Cadillac]], [[Chevrolet]], [[GMC Truck|GMC]], [[Holden]], [[Hummer]], [[Opel]], [[Pontiac]], [[Saturn automobile|Saturn]], [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] and [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]].

Chevrolet and GMC divisions produce [[truck]]s, as well as passenger vehicles. Other brands include [[Delco|AC Delco]] and [[Allison Transmission]]. GM also has a 8% stake in [[Isuzu]] and a 20% stake in [[Suzuki]] in [[Japan]] and a joint venture with [[AvtoVAZ]] in [[Russia]]. In December [[2003]], it acquired [[Delta Motor Corporation|Delta]] in [[South Africa]], in which it had taken a 45 % stake in [[1997]], and which is now a fully-owned subsidiary, General Motors South Africa. General Motors is also a majority shareholder (50.9%) in [[GM Daewoo]].   

GM's headquarters are in the [[Renaissance Center]] in [[Detroit, Michigan]]. The company is the world's largest vehicle [[manufacturing|manufacturer]] and employs over 340,000 people. In [[2001]], GM sold 8.5 million vehicles through all its branches; in [[2002]], GM sold 15 % of all cars and trucks in the world. They also owned [[Electronic Data Systems]] from [[1984]] to [[1996]] and, prior to selling it to [[News Corporation]], [[DirecTV]]. GM owned [[Frigidaire]] from [[1918]] to [[1979]].

==History==
[[Image:Detroit GM headquarters.jpg|thumb|270px|General Motors Headquarters, Renaissance Center, Detroit, Michigan.]] 
General Motors (GM) was founded in [[1908]] in Flint, Michigan as a holding company for Buick, then controlled by [[William C. Durant]], and acquired [[Oldsmobile]] later that year.  The next year, Durant brought in [[Cadillac]], [[Elmore (automobile)|Elmore]], and [[Oakland automobile|Oakland]]. In 1909, General Motors acquired the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company of Pontiac, Michigan, the predecessor of GMC Truck. A Rapid became the first truck to conquer [[Pikes Peak]] in 1909. 

During the [[1920s]] and [[1930s]], General Motors bought out the [[bus]] company [[Yellow Coach]], helped create [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus lines]], replaced intercity train transport with buses, and established subsidiary companies to buy out [[trolley|streetcar]] companies and replace the rail-based services with buses. GM formed [[United Cities Motor Transit]] in 1932 (''see [[General Motors streetcar conspiracy]] for additional details'').

General Motors bought the [[internal combustion engine]]d [[railcar]] builder [[Electro-Motive Corporation]] and its engine supplier [[Winton Engine]] in [[1930]], renaming both as the [[General Motors Electro-Motive Division]]. Over the next twenty years, diesel-powered locomotives and trains &amp;ndash; the majority built by GM &amp;ndash; largely replaced other forms of traction on American railroads. (During [[World War II]], these engines were also important in American [[submarines]] and [[destroyer escorts]].) Electro-Motive was sold in early 2005.

On [[December 31]], [[1955]], General Motors became the first American corporation to make over one [[billion]] [[US dollar|dollars]] in a year.  

After GM's massive lay-offs hit [[Flint, Michigan]] a [[Strike action|strike]] began at the General Motors parts factory in Flint on [[June 5]], [[1998]], which quickly spread to five other assembly plants and lasted seven weeks.

At one point GM was the largest corporation ever in the United States, in terms of its revenues as a percent of GDP. In [[1953]] [[Charles Erwin Wilson]], then GM president, was named by [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. When he was asked during the hearings before the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]] if as secretary of defense he could make a decision adverse to the interests of General Motors, Wilson answered affirmatively but added that he could not conceive of such a situation &quot;because for years I thought what was good for the country was good for General Motors and vice versa&quot;. Later this statement was often garbled when quoted, suggesting that Wilson had said simply, &quot;What's good for General Motors is good for the country.&quot; At the time, GM was the one of the largest employers in the world &amp;ndash; only Soviet state industries employed more people.

===General Motors Hughes Electronics===
[[Hughes Electronics]] was formed in [[1985]] when [[Hughes Aircraft]] was sold by the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] to General Motors for $5 billion. General Motors merged Hughes Aircraft with its Delco Electronics unit to form GM Hughes Electronics (GMHE). The group then consisted of:
*Hughes Aircraft
*Delco Electronics
*Hughes Space and Communications
*Hughes Network Systems
*Hughes Training

In August [[1992 in aviation|1992]] GM Hughes Electronics purchased [[General Dynamics]]' Missile Systems business. In [[1994 in aviation|1994]] Hughes Electronics introduced [[DirecTV]], the world's first high-powered [[direct broadcast satellite]] service. In [[1995 in aviation|1995]] Hughes Electronic's [[Hughes Aircraft#Hughes Space and Communications|Hughes Space and Communications]] division became the largest supplier of commercial satellites. Also in 1995 the group purchased [[Magnavox Electronic Systems]] from the [[Carlyle Group]]. In [[1996 in aviation|1996]] Hughes Electronics and [[PanAmSat]] agree to merge their fixed satellite services into a new publicly held company, also called PanAmSat with GM Hughes Electronics as majority shareholder.

In [[1997 in aviation|1997]] GM transferred Delco Electronics to its [[Delphi Corporation|Delphi Automotive Systems]] business. Late in the year the defense operations of Hughes Electronics (Hughes Aircraft and missile business) were merged with Raytheon.

Hughes Space and Communications remained independent until [[2000 in aviation|2000]], when it was purchased by [[Boeing]] and became [[Boeing Satellite Systems]].

In 2000, the remaining parts of Hughes Electronics: DirecTV, DirecTV Latin America, PanAmSat and Hughes Network Systems, were purchased by [[NewsCorp]] and renamed The DirecTV Group. NewsCorp sold PanAmSat to [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.]] (KKR) in August 2004.

==Corporate structure and issues==
Current members of the [[board of directors]] of General Motors are: [[Percy Barnevik]], [[Erskine Bowles]], [[John Bryan]], [[Armando Codina]], [[George M. C. Fisher|George Fisher]], [[Karen Katen]], [[Kent Kresa]], [[Ellen Kullman]], [[Philip Laskawy]], [[Jerome York]], [[Eckhard Pfeiffer]], and [[Rick Wagoner]] (chairman). York was elected to the board on [[February 6]], [[2006]] to represent [[Kirk Kerkorian]], as [[E. Stanley O'Neal]] stepped down.

Rick Wagoner is also the [[chief executive officer]] of the company (since [[June 1]], [[2000]]), succeeding [[John F. Smith, Jr.]]

===Social policies===
General Motors was named one of the 100 Best Companies for Working Mothers in [[2004]] by ''Working Mothers'' magazine.

Due to its highly compensated workforce GM has the highest health care and labor costs in the industry, and some analysts have criticized the company for this.

===Subsidies===
In March [[2005]], the [[Government of Canada]] &quot;gave [[Canadian dollar|C$]]200 million to General Motors for its Ontario plants, and last fall it awarded C$100 million to [[Ford Motor Co.]] to expand their Canadian auto production, provide jobs and contribute to the economy,&quot; according to [[Jim Harris (politician)|Jim Harris]]. With additional subsidies promised to non-North American auto companies like Toyota, Premier Dalton McGuinty said the money the province and Ottawa are pledging for the project is well-spent. His government has committed [[Canadian dollar|C$]]400 million, including the latest Toyota package of [[Canadian dollar|C$]]125 million, to the province's automobile sector, which helped finance $5 billion worth of industry projects.

===Marketing problems===
GM corporate management has since 1955 allowed the gradual blurring of the distinctions between its own divisions. These divisions were once each targeted to specific market segments and, despite some shared components, each vehicle distinguished itself from comparable GM stablemates with unique styling and (to some extent) bespoke technology. The shared components and common corporate management created substantial [[economy of scale| economies of scale]] while the distinctions between the divisions created an orderly upgrade path, with an entry-level buyer starting out with a practical and economical Chevrolet and, (assuming progressive prosperity of the buyer), moving through offerings of the several divisions until the purchase of a Cadillac. The divisions were not [[competition|competing]] with each other so much but rather they were passing along the same customer, who would thus always be buying a GM product, with the profits flowing to this single corporation.

Before 1955:
*[[GMC Truck]] - produced strictly utilitarian commercial vehicles over a wide range of capacities
*[[Chevrolet]] - an entry-level brand offering high utility at low price, with some light trucks and panel vans
*[[Pontiac]] - a brand that sold solid, extremely quiet vehicles (these used a side valve straight eight), attractive to a modest and reserved lower middle class
*[[Oldsmobile]] - a leading technical innovator with the first production [[automatic transmission]], this eventually became GM's first &quot;performance&quot; division, introducing the industry's first short-stroke, high-compression overhead-valve V8 (the &quot;Oldsmobile Rocket&quot;) in 1949
*[[Buick]] - a more expensive and luxurious brand for the upper middle class (often called the &quot;doctor's car&quot;) with four models - the small body/engine ''Special'' and ''Super'' and the larger ''Century'' and ''Roadmaster'', each emphasizing a soft ride, upscale interior, and in the late 1940's an available &quot;shiftless&quot; automatic transmission and hydraulic power windows
*[[Cadillac]] - the self styled &quot;''standard of luxury''&quot;, with large production competition only from rival [[Packard]]

The postwar industry became enamored with the concept of &quot;planned obsolescence&quot;, implemented by both technical and styling innovations, with a three year product cycle typical within the industry. In this cycle, a new basic body shell is introduced and then modified for the next two years by minor styling changes. GM, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]] competed vigorously in this new environment.

By 1957, with a &quot;horsepower race&quot; active in the U.S. industry, Pontiac became somewhat performance-minded, rivaled by some specific Buick models (the Century for example), completing the evolution in the early and mid 1960's with the Bonneville and the GTO, with Oldsmobiles mostly later becoming soft, comfortable, and (for larger families) practical vehicles. High performance vehicles were available from all of the divisions, peaking in 1970 and ending with the imposition of anti-[[smog]] technologies that severely impacted performance, drivability, and efficiency across the industry in the early 1970's.

By the late 1960s, most of GM's vehicles were built upon a few common ''platforms'' and in the 1970s, began to use nearly identical body panel stampings, differing only in internal and external trim items. This was seen especially in the compact passenger vehicles offered by the divisions.

Beginning in the 1980's, GM frequently &quot;rebadged&quot; one division's successful vehicle into several models across the divisions, all positioned close to one another in the market place. Thus, a new GM model's main competition might be another model spawned off the same platform.  This led to so-called market &quot;[[Cannibal#Other uses of the word|cannibalization]]&quot;, where GM's respective divisions spent time stealing sales from one another, while other more co-ordinated efforts (notably from the Japanese manufacturers) were allowed to increase their market penetration.  For instance, the company's GMT360 midsized light truck platform has, since its inception in 2002, spawned the basic Chevrolet Trailblazer, an extended version of the Trailblazer, the Oldsmobile Bravada, the GMC Envoy, the Envoy XL (an extended Envoy with a reconfigurable tailgate) and later, the Isuzu Ascender, Buick Rainier, and Saab 9-7X.   Though each model had a more or less unique mission, without bespoke engine choices or radically different suspension settings and trim choices, the cars can hardly be told apart.  

Critics have suggested that this progressive blurring of well-defined brands has been a large contributor the late 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and early 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century market failures of GM.

During the 1980's and later GM divisions had market issues concerning quality - not that the vehicles produced were especially bad but rather that they did not compare well to foreign competition in matters of fit and finish, durability of sheet metal, paint (which was not at all durable for several years after a formulation change), and plastic components.

In 2004, GM redirected resources from the development of new sedans to an accelerated refurbishment of their light trucks and [[SUV]]s for introduction as 2007 models in early 2006. Shortly after this decision, fuel prices increased by over 50 % and this in turn affected both the trade-in value of used vehicles and the perceived desirability of new offerings in these market segments.  The  current marketing plan is currently to extensively tout these revised vehicles as offering the best fuel economies ''in their class'' (of vehicle), although such advantages are expected to be minor until the introduction of new hybrid light trucks in 2007, with projected 25% mileage improvements. In contrast, Ford, GM's primary domestic competitor, has emphasized building more and better passenger cars with attractive styling, features, and quality, with profitability flowing from lower production costs through reduction of excess plant capacity and firm consumer demand, which enables avoidance of marketing incentives (such as ''low'' or ''zero interest'', ''cash back'', or ''free'' or ''low cost'' added accessory, appearance, and other [[automotive package|packages]]).

===Financial woes===
As is the case with other U. S. automobile manufacturers, international exchange rates tend to favor Japanese and Korean competitors. The expected future entry of [[China]] into the U. S. automotive market is likely to be advantaged by unrealistic currency exchange ratios that have become a ''structural'' problem owing to the Chinese government's extensive purchase of U. S. government debt in the form of bonds. European manufactures are somewhat disadvantaged by over-regulation. Irrespective of these various manufacturing conditions, various foreign manufacturers have demonstrated an ability to compete in the U.S. market with vehicles assembled in various U.S. states and using a substantial portion of domestic content. Such plants are advantaged over GM and Ford through the employment of a younger, nonunion, and more generally healthy workforce.

General motors has extensive &quot;legacy&quot; costs in pensions and health care costs from retirees, some of these obligations taken at a time when GM had a much larger share of the domestic U.S. market. GM has also committed itself (through union agreements) to pay ongoing wages to non-working employees displaced by automation (the so-called ''Jobs Bank''). The subsequent loss of market share due to marketing and quality problems has severely impacted GM's ability to carry these obligations.

In April 2005, General Motors posted a US$1.1-billion loss, for the first quarter of that year. Its debt was also downgraded to [[junk bond]] status. GM announced plans to cut 25,000 jobs in the United States, and included plans to shut down one of the Oshawa, Ontario, plants by 2008.

By November 2005, within the first nine months of the year, GM had posted a near $4 billion loss. On [[November 21]], [[2005]], GM had announced a revised plan of increased cuts. These cuts went from 25,000 to 30,000 employees, or 9% of its labor force. GM also increased the number of plant closings. Originally, the company planned eight plant closings; the new plan calls for the closing of twelve facilities.

In December, 2005, [[Standard and Poor's]] further downgraded GM bonds to &quot;B&quot;, with the observation that it is &quot;now dubious&quot; whether the new line of SUVs and trucks would return GM's North American auto business to profitability (WSJ US edition, [[13 December]] [[2005]], p. A3).

On [[December 21]] [[2005]] Toyota Motor Corp announced that it would produce 9.06 million vehicles for 2006.  Analysts estimate that GM will only produce around 8.825 million cars for 2006, giving up the title of the world's largest auto producer.  GM has held the title for 74 consecutive years without a doubt.  However, GM's Wagoner is confident that GM will remain #1.

In February 2006, GM decided to slash its annual dividend to $1.00 per share.  GM had resisted the move for some time.  However, the reduction will save GM about $565 million in cash each year.

For the first time ever, in [[2004]] the total number of cars produced by all makers in [[Ontario]] exceeded those produced in [[Michigan]]. GM officials cited profitability of their [[Oshawa, Ontario]], plant in refusing to distribute the job losses.

===Alternative vehicles===
General Motors has long worked on alternative-technology vehicles, but has repeatedly failed to deliver them in a profitable way.  The company was the first to use [[turbocharger]]s and was an early proponent of [[V6]] engines in the [[1960s]], but quickly lost interest as the [[muscle car]] race took hold. They demonstrated [http://www.conklinsystems.com/firebird/mlife.php] [[gas turbine]] vehicles powered by [[kerosene]], an area of interest throughout the industry in the late 1950's, but despite extensive thermal recycling (developed by Chrysler) the fuel consumption was too high and starting torque too low for everyday use. They were also an early licensee of [[Wankel engine]] technology, even developing the [[Chevrolet Monza]] around the powerplant, but abandoned the alternative engine configuration in view of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. In the [[1970s]] and [[1980s]], GM pushed [[Diesel]] engines and [[cylinder deactivation]] technologies to disastrous results due to poor durability in the Oldsmobile diesels (this was a modified gasoline engine) and drivability issues in the Cadillac 4-6-8 variable cylinder engines.

In [[1996]], GM introduced the [[General Motors EV1|EV1]], the first modern mass-produced [[electric car]]. Despite the positive publicity generated by this vehicle, the company never spread the technology beyond [[California]] and [[Arizona]], and pulled the plug on the program in [[2003]].

GM was also an early innovator in [[hybrid vehicle]] development, building Diesel-electric trains since the [[1930s]] and [[bus]]es since the [[1990s]] (but without stored energy recovery), but did not introduce a true hybrid passenger car until [[2004]].  Their earlier [[Chevrolet Silverado#Hybrid|hybrid pickup truck]] was such a mild application of the technology that many criticized it for being not a hybrid at all. The [[2006]] [[Saturn VUE|Saturn VUE Green Line]] will be the first hybrid passenger vehicle from GM, but it too is a mild design. GM has hinted at new hybrid technologies to be employed that will be optimized for higher speeds such as are encountered in [[freeway]] driving. As a great bulk of GM's fleet fuel consumption is by high fuel consuming light trucks and SUVs, a modest improvement in their mileage applied across this large fleet (say twelve to fifteen percent) would in fact conserve a significant amount of refined fuel.

Rather than effectively deliver hybrid and electric vehicles at the present time, GM has extensively touted its research and prototype development of hydrogen powered vehicles, to be produced at some unspecified future time and using a support infrastructure yet to be built. Since production and use of hydrogen from fossil fuels is at present about 1/6 as efficient as direct use of the fuel (e.g, compressed natural gas), this is a future dependent upon the availability of extremely low cost electricity - as might be produced at some indefinite future time by speculative power sources such as nuclear fusion.

===GM in China===
General Motors is the top-selling foreign auto maker in [[China]], with 11.2% of the total market there.  The [[Buick]] brand is especially strong, led by the [[Buick Excelle]] subcompact.  [[Cadillac]] initiated sales in China in 2004, starting with imports. GM pushed the [[Chevrolet]] brand there in [[2005]] as well, transferring the formerly-Buick Sail to that marque.  The company manufactures most of its China-market vehicles locally, through its [[Shanghai GM]] joint venture. The [[SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile]] joint-venture is also successful selling trucks and vans under the [[Wuling]] marque.

The '''Golden Gate Bridge''' is a [[suspension bridge|suspension]] [[bridge]] spanning the [[Golden Gate]], the opening into the [[San Francisco Bay]] from the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It connects the city of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] on the northern tip of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] and a portion of the south-facing [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] [[Marin Headlands|headlands]] near the small bayside town of [[Sausalito, California|Sausalito]], and is located at {{Coor dms|37|49|12|N|122|28|43|W|}}. The entire bridge (including the approach) spans 1.7 miles (2.7 km) long; the distance between the towers (&quot;main span&quot;) is 4,200 feet (1,280 m), and the clearance below the bridge is 220 ft (67 m) at mean high water.  The two towers rise 746 feet (230 m) above the water.  The diameter of the main suspension cables is 36 inches (0.91 m).

The Golden Gate Bridge was the [[List of largest suspension bridges|largest suspension bridge]] in the world when it was built in 1937 and has become an internationally recognized symbol of San Francisco.

==History==
The bridge was the brainchild of [[Joseph Strauss]], an engineer responsible for over 400 drawbridges, though they were far smaller than this project and mostly inland. Strauss spent over a decade drumming up support in Northern California.  Strauss's initial design[http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/news_events/exhibits/bridge/up028.html] comprised a massive [[cantilever]] on each side connected with a central suspension segment. Other key figures in the bridge's construction include architect Irving Morrow, responsible for the [[Art Deco]] touches and the choice of color, and engineer [[Charles A. Ellis|Charles Alton Ellis]] and bridge designer [[Leon Moisseiff]], who collaborated on the complicated mathematics involved.

The [[Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District|Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District]] was incorporated in 1928 as the official entity to design, construct, and finance the Golden Gate Bridge. The District includes not only the City &amp; County of San Francisco, and Marin County, in whose boundaries the bridge sits, but also [[Napa_County,_California|Napa]], [[sonoma_County,_California|Sonoma]], [[Mendocino_County,_California|Mendocino]] and [[Del_Norte_County,_California|Del Norte]] counties. Representatives from each of the six counties sit on the District's Board of Directors. Voters within the District approved funding for the project in 1930 through a special bond issue that put their homes, farms and business properties up as collateral. This bond issue raised the initial $35 million to finance the building of the Bridge. Construction began on [[January 5]], [[1933]]. The last of the construction bonds were retired in [[1971]], with $35 million in principal and nearly $39 million in interest being financed entirely from tolls. Strauss, a graduate of the [[University of Cincinnati]], placed a brick from his [[alma mater]]'s demolished McMicken Hall in the south anchorage before the concrete was poured.  The bridge was completed in April [[1937]] and opened to pedestrians on [[May 27]] of that year. The next day, President Roosevelt pushed a button in [[Washington, DC]] signaling the start of vehicle traffic over the Bridge. A unique aspect of the bridge's construction was the safety net set up beneath it, significantly reducing the expected number of deaths for such a project. 11 men were killed from falls during construction, and approximately 19 men were saved by the safety net. 10 of the deaths occurred near completion, when the net itself failed under the stress of a scaffold fall. The 19 workers whose lives were saved by the safety nets became proud members of the (informal) ''Halfway to Hell Club''.
[[Image:GoldenEndFortMason.JPG|300px|thumb|right|A golden sunset behind the bridge.]]
[[Image:Golden Gate Bridge from underneath.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A photograph of the bridge from a boat underneath.]]
The center span was the [[List of largest suspension bridges|longest among suspension bridges]] until [[1964]] when the [[Verrazano Narrows Bridge]] was erected between the boroughs of [[Staten Island]] and [[Brooklyn]] in [[New York City]]. The Golden Gate Bridge also had the world's tallest suspension towers at the time of construction, and retained that record until more recently. In [[1957]], [[Michigan]]'s [[Mackinac Bridge]] surpassed the Golden Gate Bridge's length between anchorages to become the world's longest suspension bridge in total length. The longest center suspension span in the world is currently the [[Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge]] in [[Japan]].

As the only road to exit San Francisco to the north, the bridge is part of both [[United States Highway 101]] and [[California State Route 1]]. The bridge has six total lanes of vehicle traffic, and walkways on both sides of the bridge. The median markers between the lanes are moved to conform to traffic patterns. On weekday mornings, traffic flows mostly southbound into the city, so  four of the six lanes run southbound. Conversely, on weekday afternoons, three lanes run northbound. While there has been discussion concerning the installation of a movable barrier since the 1980s, the Bridge Board of Directors, in March 2005, committed to finding funding to complete the $2 million study required prior to the installation of a moveable median barrier. The eastern walkway is for pedestrians and bicycles during the weekdays and during daylight hours only, and the western walkway is open to bicycles on weekends. 

The [[speed limit]] on the Golden Gate Bridge was reduced from 55 mph (90 km/h) to 45 mph (70 km/h) on [[October 1]], [[1983]]. With no moveable median barrier yet, a head-on collision at 55 mph (90 km/h) would create almost 1.5 times the force than at 45 mph (70 km/h).

On [[September 1]], [[2002]], the toll for Southbound [[motor vehicle]]s was raised from US$3.00 to $5.00.  Northbound motor vehicle traffic, cycling, and pedestrian traffic remain toll free.

== Aesthetics ==
The color of the bridge is orange vermilion, deemed ''[[safety orange|International Orange]]''. The color was selected by consulting architect Irving Morrow because it blends well with the natural surroundings yet enhances the bridge's visibility in fog.
[[Image:Ggb by night.jpg|250px|thumb|The Golden Gate Bridge by night, with part of downtown [[San Francisco]] visible in the background at far left.]]
The bridge is widely considered one of the most beautiful examples of bridge engineering, both as a structural design challenge and for its aesthetic appeal. It was declared one of the modern [[Seven Wonders of the World|Wonders of the World]] by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]. According to Frommer's travel guide, the Golden Gate Bridge is &quot;possibly the most beautiful, certainly the most photographed, bridge in the world.&quot; [http://www.frommers.com/destinations/sanfrancisco/A25170.html] (although Frommers also bestows the &quot;most photographed&quot; honor on [[Tower Bridge]] [http://www.frommers.com/destinations/london/A29870.html])

== Paintwork ==

The bridge was originally painted with [[red lead]] primer and a [[lead]]-based [[topcoat]], which was touched up as required.  In the mid-[[1960s]], a program was started to improve corrosion protection by stripping the original paint off and repainting the bridge with [[zinc silicate]] primer and, originally, [[vinyl]] topcoats [http://goldengatebridge.org/research/facts.php#PaintHowOften] [http://goldengatebridge.org/research/factsGGBIntOrngPaint.php]. [[Acrylic paint|Acrylic]] topcoats have been used instead since [[1990]] for air quality reasons. The program was completed in [[1995]], and there is now ongoing maintenance by 38 painters [http://goldengatebridge.org/research/facts.php#IronworkersPainters] to touch up the paintwork where it becomes seriously eroded.

== Suicides ==
The Golden Gate Bridge is notorious as a popular site for [[suicide]]. The official suicide count ended in [[1995]] when the number approached 1,000. Through the eight years to 2003, on average there was one suicide jump every two weeks, which brought the unofficial total to over 1,300 suicides {{fact}}. The 220-foot (67 m) fall takes four seconds and jumpers hit the water at 75 miles per hour (120 km/h). [[As of 2003]], only 26 people have survived the jump. The survivors all struck the water feet first and most suffered multiple internal injuries and broken bones. One young man supposedly jumped off the bridge in the 1980s, swam ashore and walked up on the beach. The doctor who examined him was then reported to have said that the man was in the best shape of anyone he had ever seen. {{fact}}
[[Image:suicidemessageggb01252006.JPG|250px|thumb|left|A suicide hotline phone located on the bridge.]]

Various methods have been discussed to reduce the number of suicides. One method introduced has been to close the bridge to pedestrians at night; bicyclists are still permitted across at nighttime, but they have to be buzzed in and out through the remotely controlled security gates during nighttime. [http://goldengatebridge.org/bikesbridge/bikes.php] Attempts to introduce a suicide barrier have been thwarted by engineering difficulties, high costs, and public opposition. On [[January 27]] [[2005]], Bridge District staff re-introduced for the eighth time the topic of a suicide barrier to the Bridge’s Building and Operations committee, citing &quot;the high profile of this issue in recent press and community conversations.&quot; On [[March 11]] [[2005]], the Board of Directors of the Golden Gate Bridge voted 15-1 to approve a two-year, $2 million plan to explore the feasibility of a barrier. Proponents of the barrier cite the example of the [[Empire State Building]] and the [[Eiffel Tower]], where suicides dropped to zero after a barrier was put up. Those against the barrier argue that a barrier would be unsightly, too costly, and would simply move suicides elsewhere. [[Jump for Life]], a creative alternative to a suicide barrier, was proposed in late [[2005]].

Suicide on the Golden Gate Bridge is a theme of [[Jenni Olson]]'s experimental short film, [[The Joy of Life]] ([[2005)]]). Documentarian [[Eric Steel]] was accused by the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' in 2005 of misrepresenting the nature of a request to film the Golden Gate National Recreation Area when he filed a film permit application. Steel had stated that he was making a film about the Bridge as a beautiful landmark, but instead captured 19 suicides on tape. {{fact}}

'''Guglielmo Marchese Marconi''', [[Royal Victorian Order|GCVO]] ([[25 April]] [[1874]] &amp;ndash; [[20 July]] [[1937]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[electrical engineer]] and [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel]] laureate, known for the development of a practical wireless telegraphy system commonly known as the &quot;[[radio]]&quot;. Marconi was President of the [[Accademia d'Italia]] and a member of the [[Grand Coubeen a net importer of foreign workers, mainly from neighbouring [[Albania]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Eastern Europe]], since the early 1990s.

Today the country is dealing with various challenges, including the reduction of [[unemployment]] which currently stands at slightly below 10%, the reform of the social security system, the privatization (at least in part) of the [[public sector]], the overhauling of the tax system and the further reduction of certain bureaucratic inefficiencies. Forecasts predict that [[2006]] will be yet another year of substantial economic growth, estimated to reach 3.7%, well above the European Union's average. The reduction of the [[fiscal deficit]] to the Eurozone target of 3% of [[gross domestic product|GDP]] has also become a key issue. Shortly after its election, the new conservative [[New Democracy]] government revealed to the [[Eurostat]] agency that the previous figures supplied to it by the [[PASOK]] government as the basis of the Greek entry into the Eurozone were [[Greek Financial Audit, 2004|not correct]] (although even according to the &quot;corrected&quot; numbers, when calculated with the methodology still in force at the time of the Greek application for entry, the country had actually met the criteria for entry into the the Eurozone). Under a negotiated agreement, the EU gave Greece a two year deadline (budgets of 2005 and 2006) in order to bring the deficit in line with the criteria of the [[European]] [[stability pact]]. Indeed, in 2005, the government managed to reduce the fiscal deficit by almost two percentage points and the goal of reaching the 3% target by the end of 2006 seems realistic.

The [[Bank of Greece]], now a subsidiary of the [[European Central Bank]], functions as the nation's central bank. This bank is not the same as the &quot;[[National Bank of Greece]]&quot;, a commercial bank.

On the 2006 agenda for the Greek government is the privatization of several state owned companies as well as that creation of a new National Airline to replace Olympic Airlines.

== Tourism ==
{{main|Tourism in Greece}}
Greece has traditionally been one of the most popular tourist destinations on a global basis and each year, particularly in the summer months, the nation's numerous cosmopolitan islands are packed with millions of international visitors. Unparalleled natural beauties, golden beaches, idyllic sunsets, a legendary nightlife and the world famous Greek cuisine combined with a unique hospitality and an impressively developing tourist infrastracture make Greece an irresistible hotspot for many. The spectacular success of the [[2004 Olympic Games]] boosted the country's international prestige even further and reaffirmed its status as one of the safest places to be. In [[2004]], Greece ranked 12th in terms of international tourist arrivals when more than 14.2 million visitors came to the country, many of which combining both vacations and attendance of Olympic athletic events. In [[2005]], however, those numbers increased by 14%, surpassing 16.1 million arrivals. In [[2006]], those figures are only expected to grow bigger.

The [[New Democracy]] government, that took power in March 2004, established a brand new Ministry of Tourism headed by Mr. [[Dimitris Avramopoulos]]. Mr Avramopoulos proved to be a particularly competent man, determined to massively promote the nation to new, emerging markets in addition to the traditional ones, through various means of communication. For instance and among other initiatives, [[Helena Paparizou]], the winner of the [[2005 Eurovision Song Contest]] was recently designated as the official ambassador of the [http://www.gnto.gr  Hellenic Tourism Organization]. An interesting fact that is attributed in all those efforts is that according to a survey conducted in [[China]] in 2005, Greece was voted as Chinese' people number one choice. On [[February 14]], [[2006]], Ms Fani Palli- Petralia was appointed as the new minister of Tourism as a result of an extensive cabinet reshufle. Mr. Avramopoulos was appointed as the new Health Minister. 

Overall, this year the Greek Ministry of Tourism plans to invest more than 30 billion euros in the tourism industry, one of the most essential sectors of the Greek economy. That is 4 times more than the amount spent in 2002 by the previous government. What is more, the government intends to promote winter tourism in Greece, something that could potentially double international arrivals.

Apart from [[Athens]], other top ranking tourist destinations include the islands of [[Mykonos]], [[Santorini]], [[Rhodes]], [[Crete]], [[Corfu]], [[Paros]], [[Ios]], [[Kos]], [[Kefallonia]], [[Zakynthos]] and [[Hydra]] as well as the northern [[Halkidiki]] peninsula.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Greece}}
The population of Greece is (officially) 98% Greek [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/gr.html#People] although Greece has various linguistic and cultural minorities. A non-comprehensive list of these would include [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] Slavs, [[Pomaks]], and various [[Roma (people)|Roma]] groups. A number of religious minorities exist, including the [[Greek Muslim minority|Muslim minority]] in [[Western Thrace|western Thrace]], which makes up about a third of that region's population.

About 60-65% of Greek immigrants have come from [[Albania]] (following the fall of communism) although some 200.000 have been documented as ethnic [[Greeks]] or ''homogeneis''. The other principal [[nationalities]] are, according to residence permit data, [[Bulgarians]], [[Armenians]], [[Romanians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Pakistanis]] and [[Georgians]]; overall, over 180 different nationalities have been recorded. The legal status of immigrants has been very tenuous since the 1990s (as throughout [[the European Union]]), with high levels of illegality. Since 1997 three legalization programmes were enacted by the Greek state [a fourth went through in 2005].

Several prominent Greek sportsmen migrated to Greece as ethnic Greeks from [[Albania]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in the 1990s, including legendary [[weightlifter]]s [[Pyrros Dimas]] and [[Kakhi Kakhiashvili]].

=== Religion ===
The majority of Greeks (95-98%) have at least nominal membership in the Eastern Orthodox Church. Greek [[Muslim]]s make up about 1.3% of the population, and live primarily in [[Western Thrace|Thrace]]. Greece also has some [[Roman Catholic]]s, mainly in the city of [[Patras]], [[Corfu]], and the [[Cyclades]] islands of [[Syros]], [[Paros]], [[Tinos]], and [[Naxos, Greece|Naxos]]; some [[Protestant]]s and some [[Jew]]s, mainly in [[Thessaloniki]] (which was once a major Jewish city until the [[Holocaust]]). Some groups in Greece have started an attempt to reconstruct [[Hellenic polytheism]], the ancient Greek [[paganism|pagan]] religion. See also: [[Greek Orthodox Church]].

Prior to Ottoman rule, Greece was part of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The civil and religious capital of the Empire was moved to  [[Constantinople]] (modern day [[Istanbul]]) by [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]]. Since Constantine’s time the Orthodox Christian faith has flourished and spread throughout Eastern Europe. Even under [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] rule and repeated attempts at prosletization - firstly by the [[Jesuits]] and then by the Protestants - [[Orthodox Christianity]] survived and flourished. 

The role of the [[Church of Greece|Orthodox Church]] in maintaining Greek ethnic and cultural identity during the 400 years of Ottoman rule, strengthened the bond between religion and the state. Most Greeks, even many non-practicing Christians, revere and respect the Orthodox Christian faith; even the majority of non-beliving, secular Greeks feel culturally attached to their Church. Most Greeks attend Church during the Major Feast days, and are emotionally attached to [[Orthodox Christianity]] as their 'national' religion. 

The [[Constitution of Greece|Greek Constitution]] reflects this relationship by guaranteeing absolute freedom of religion while still defining the &quot;prevailing religion&quot; of Greece as the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] of Christ. In practice, the [[Church of Greece|Orthodox Church]] and the secular state are intimately involved with one another in certain areas.  Joint approval is needed for the building of churches and the Church has even blocked the building of places of worship for other religions in [[Athens]].  Priests receive state salaries.  The President of the Republic takes an oath on the [[Bible]] and [[Orthodox Christianity]] is given privileged place in religious studies in primary education. Non Greek Orthodox members of parliament are sworn in accordance to their own faith. The Church has also been allowed to keep its large portfolio of financial assets exempt from taxation and fiscal auditing. 

Starting in January 2005, a series of highly publicised corruption scandals involving high rank church officials have led to many calls by secular Greeks for the complete separation of Church and State and greater control of Church assets. 

One small part of Greece, [[Mount Athos]], is recognised by the Greek constitution as an autonomous monastic republic, although foreign relations remain the prerogative of the Greek state.

Spiritually, Mount Athos is under the Patriarchate of Constantinople and is therefore in communion with all the monasteries on Mount Athos and with the Orthodox Church based in various countries. One monastery has recently broken away and has formed a completely independent schism on the Holy Mountain -- [[Esphygmenou Monastery]]. Esphygmenou is composed of 117 [[Zealot]] monks who stubbornly oppose the head of the Church and do not commemorate him any more. They believe that they are the last remaining true Christians in the world and that Orthodoxy has been corrupted by having dialogue with other faiths.  They also object to the lifting of the anathemas against the Roman Catholic Church in the 1960's by Patriarch [[Athenagoras]].

[[Jew]]s have been present in Greece for the last 2000 years. The earliest reference to a Greek Jew is in an inscription, dated c. 300-250 BCE found in Oropos, a small coastal town between [[Athens]] and [[Boeotia]], and refers to him as &quot;Moschos, son of Moschion the Jew&quot; who was in all likelihood, a slave. The first Greek Jewish population became known as the [[Romaniotes]] and their language became known as [[Yevanic language|Yevanic]] (from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for Greece: יון/Yavan). From the 16th century onwards, [[Salonica]], a city in northern Greece, had one of the largest (mostly [[Sephardic]] by then) Jewish communities in the world and a solid rabbinical tradition. On the island of [[Crete]], the Jews played an important part in the transport trade. During [[World War II]], when Greece was occupied by [[Nazi]] [[Germany]], 86% of the Greek Jews were murdered by the invading Axis and only a minority survived and most of them have emigrated to [[Israel]]. Greece's Jewish community today is estimated at 4,500.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Demographics of Greece''' is about the population that has inhabited the Greek peninsula, a region where the [[Greek language]] has been continuously spoken for over 3500 years. The 2001 census of '''[[Greece]]''' reported a population of 10,964,020 people.

==Historical Overview==
[[Greece]] was inhabited as early as the [[Paleolithic]] period and by [[3000 BC]] had become home, in the [[Cycladic civilization|Cycladic Islands]], to a culture whose art remains among the most evocative in world history. Early in the [[2nd millennium BC]], the island of [[Crete]] nurtured the sophisticated maritime empire of the [[Minoans]], whose trade reached from [[Egypt]] to [[Sicily]]. The Minoans were challenged and eventually supplanted by the Mycenaeans of the Greek mainland, who spoke a dialect of ancient Greek. 

Prior to the second millennium BC, the Greek peninsula was inhabited by various pre-Hellenic peoples (notably the [[Pelasgians]]). After the invasion of the [[Greek language|Greek-speaking]] peoples, the local populations were displaced or assimilated and the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] civilization was formed. The [[Greek language]] dominated the peninsula, and Greece's mosaic of small city-states became culturally similar. The population estimates on the Greeks during the 5th century BC, is approximately 3 million on the Greek peninsula and 6 million in the entire Mediterranean basin (including all colonies). After [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquests, Greek culture and colonization was expanded in the [[Hellenistic]] Kingdoms of the East. After the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] occupation of Greece, the Greek culture was favoured by the Romans and it continued to dominate on the Eastern part of the Empire and in [[Rome]]. After the foundation of [[Constantinople]] in 330 AD by Constantine the Great, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] developed independently from the West. It continued the use of [[Koine Greek|Greek]] until it totally displaced [[Latin language|Latin]] from the administration, and the empire became ethnically unified via the official adaption of [[Christianity]]. The most common term used by scholars to refer to that medieval state is '[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]'. During the long history of the [[Byzantine Greek]] state, the Greek peninsula was occasionally invaded by the following peoples: [[Goths]], [[Avars]], [[Slavs]], [[Normans]], [[Franks]] and other [[Latin peoples|Latins]] who had betrayed the [[Crusades]]. The only group however which planned to established permanent settlements in the region were the Slavs. They settled in isolated valleys of [[Peloponnese]] and [[Thessaly]], establishing communities that were referred by the Byzantines as &quot;Sclavinias&quot;. By the 9th century AD, Sclavinias in Greece were largerly eliminated. The populations in central and southern Greece were the subject of population exchanges, army recruitments and Hellenizations, but some Slavic communities managed to survive in rural [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. At the same time a large [[Jewish]] emmigrant community from [[Spain]] established itself in [[Thessaloniki]]. The [[Byzantine Empire]] ultimately fell to [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 15th century. Ottoman colonies were established in the Balkans, notable in Macedonia, Peloponnese and Crete. The Christian subjects of the Sultan had very restricted rights, and during that period many religious conversions took place. For those reasons, the population of the region decreased, yet it remained largerly ethnically similar, as the Christians didn't have the right to use any means of transportation. The only notable event however, was the gradual settlement of [[Arvanites]] and [[Vlachs]] in isolated communities throughout the Greek peninsula. Some of the ancestors of those settlers survive until today, but only as linguistic groups of purely Greek ethnic identity.

The [[population exchange]]s with [[Bulgaria]] and [[Turkey]] that took place in the early 20th century, added in total some 2 million Greeks from [[Asia Minor]], [[Constantinople]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Albania]] and [[Yugoslavia]] to the demography of the Greek Kingdom.

==Education==
[[Image:Greece demography.png|thumb|Population of Greece from 1961 to 2003.]]
Greek education is free and compulsory for children between the ages of 5 and 15. English language study is compulsory from 5th grade through high school. University education, including books, is also free, contingent upon the student's ability to meet stiff entrance requirements. 

A high percentage of the student population seeks higher education. About 100,000 students are registered at Greek universities, and 15% of the population currently holds a university degree. Entrance to a university is determined by state-administered exams, the candidate's grade-point average from high school, and his/her priority choices of major. About one in four candidates gains admission to Greek universities.

The Greek law does not currently offer official recognition to the graduates of private universities that operate in Greece. As a result, a large and growing number of students are pursuing higher education abroad. The Greek Government decides through an evaluation procedure whether to recognize degrees from specific foreign universities as qualification for public sector hiring. Other students attend private, post-secondary educational institutions in Greece that are not recognized by the Greek Government.

The number of Greek students studying at European institutions is increasing along with EU support for educational exchange. In addition, nearly 5,000 Greeks are studying in the United States, about half of whom are in graduate school. Greek per capita student representation in the U.S. is the highest of any European country.

==Religion Groups in Greece==
[[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] is the official and dominant religion in Greece. During the centuries of Ottoman domination, the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] preserved Greek language, values, and national identity and was an important rallying point in the struggle for independence. There is a '''[[Greek Muslim minority|Muslim minority]]''' concentrated in Thrace, which has a [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] ethnic identity. Other religious communities in Greece include [[Catholic]]s, [[Jew]]s, [[Church of the Genuine Orthodox Christians of Greece|Old Calendar Orthodox]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Mormon]]s, and [[Protestant]]s.

==Minority Ethnic and Linguistic Groups==
A survey conducted by the VPRC Institute in 2001 found the following minority linguistic groups in Greece:
* 3.3% [[Arvanitic language|Arvanitic]] speakers
* 2.2% [[Turkish language|Turkish]] speakers
* 2.0% [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] speakers 
* 1.4% [[Italian language|Italian]] speakers
* 0.7% [[Russian language|Russian]] speakers
* 0.6% [[Macedonian language|Macedonian Slavic]] speakers
* 0.6% [[Romany language|Roma]] speakers
The survey mentioned that most of the respondents were using the [[Greek language]] in everyday life.

'''Birth ratem of the Games has gone and the EU farm subsidies get cut in 2006 and b) to proceed with stuctural economic reforms, especially in the areas of [[social insurance]], [[social welfare|welfare]], and the [[labour market]] which will encourage further [[investments]], lower the country's high [[unemployment]] and promote growth and economic stability. The first step was taken on the 30th June 2005 with substantial reforms of the insurance system for bank employees against fierce opposition from the unions and the main opposition political party [[PASOK]] with laws liberalising working hours in [[retail]] [[trade]] and employment and providing for public/private financing initiatives of public works and services to follow over the summer.

In 2004, [[Eurostat]], the statistical arm of the [[European Commission]] (after an audit performed by the New Democracy government) revealed that the budgetary statistics, on the basis of which Greece joined the European monetary union, had been massively [http://epp.eurostat.cec.eu.int/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/GREECE/EN/GREECE-EN.PDF falsified] by the previous Greek government (mostly by delaying accounting for huge military expenses; the country, though, had met the criteria for entry into the Eurozone even with revised numbers, when calculated with the [[Eurostat]] methodology still in force at the time of Greece's application for entry).    

== Principal sectors ==

Services, including [[tourism]], make up the largest and fastest-growing sector of the Greek economy, accounting for about 70% of GDP in 2002.

Tourism is a major source of foreign exchange earnings. Although it is one of the country's most important industries, it has been slow to expand and suffers from poor infrastructure. With more than 14 million tourists visiting Greece in 2002, the tourist industry faced declining revenues, partly due to the strong [[drachma]]. Revenue from tourism exceeded $5.2 billion in 1998, having increased somewhat as Greek tourism benefited from problems in neighboring countries and an economic recovery in the European Union.

The [[manufacturing]] sector accounts for about 13% of GDP. The [[food]] industry is one of the most profitable and fastest-growing areas of manufacturing, with significant export potential. High-technology equipment production, especially for [[telecommunications]], is also a fast-growing sector. Other important areas include textiles, building materials, machinery, transport equipment, and electrical appliances.

Greece is traditionally a seafaring nation and has built an impressive shipping industry based on its geographic location and the entrepreneurial ability of its ship owners. The Greek-owned fleet (all flags), one of the three largest worldwide, totalled 3,358 ships (134 million DWT) in 1998.

Construction activity (about 10% of GDP) has increased due to infrastructure projects partially financed by European Union structural funds and the public investment for the Olympic Games in Athens. Up to 1999, about $20 billion has gone to projects to modernize and develop Greece's transportation network. The centerpiece of this effort was the construction of the new international airport El. Venizelos near Athens and the new ring road &quot;Attiki Odos&quot; to connect it with the city and the south of the country. In addition, the Athens [[metro|metro]] system is being greatly expanded, and construction or expansion of roads, railway lines, and bridges is either underway or planned.

== EU membership ==

Greece must realign its economy as part of an extended transition to full EU membership that began in 1981. Greek businesses are adjusting to competition from EU firms and the government has had to liberalize its economic and commercial regulations and practices. However, Greece has been granted waivers from certain aspects of the EU's 1992 single market program.

Historically, Greece has been a net beneficiary of the EU budget. Net payments to Greece totaled $4.9 billion in 1998, representing 4.2% of GDP. Net inflows were estimated at about $5 billion in 1998. These funds contribute significantly to Greece's current accounts balance and reduce the state budget deficit.

Greece is receiving additional substantial support from the EU through the [[Delors II]] package. In July 1994, the Greek government and the EU agreed on a final plan which provided Greece 16.6 billion [[European Currency Unit|ECU]] for the period 1994-1998, of which 14 billion ECU was from the Community Support Framework and 2.6 billion ECU was from the Cohesion Fund. This level of assistance was continued in 1999 and finances major public works and economic development projects, upgrades competitiveness and human resources, improves living conditions, and addresses disparities between poorer and more developed regions of the country

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Greece}}
Greece was elected by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] to the [[United Nations Security Council]], on [[15 October 2004]] , as a non-permanent member for 2005 and 2006.
Prominent issues in Greek foreign policy include  the enduring [[Cyprus]] problem, Greek-Turkish differences over the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], a dispute over the name of the [[Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]], and relations with the [[United States|USA]].

==South East Europe==

===Bilateral relations with Turkey ===
'''''Main article [[Greco-Turkish relations]]''''' 

Greece and Turkey carried out a population exchange in the [[1920s]] in an attempt to reduce tensions between the two countries. It was not a complete exchange of minorities, as significant Greek communities remained in [[Istanbul]] and Turkish communities stayed in [[Western Thrace]]. Nevertheless, the strategy worked, and the two sides enjoyed good relations and cooperation in the [[1930s]]. They began to deteriorate in the mid-[[1950s]], however, mainly because of [[Cyprus]]. Relations have been steadily improving again since the turn of the century.

The decade of [[1950s]] was marked by the actions of [[EOKA]], a Cypriot nationalist group fighting the [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial government and demanding a unification of Cyprus with Greece (''[[enosis#Enosis|enosis]]''). There have been claims that EOKA was also targeting the [[Turkish Cypriot]] community. 

In [[1960]], Some members of EOKA were indignant over the fact that ''enosis'' was not granted, and formed [[EOKA#EOKA-B|EOKA-B]] to instigate a [[coup]] against [[Presidents of Cyprus|President of Cyprus]] [[Makarios III]]. The [[July 15]], [[1974]] coup was supported by the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|Greek military junta]] in [[Athens]]. Turkey reacted with a military invasion that helped bring about the fall of the Greek military dictatorship. It also led to the [[de facto]] division of Cyprus. The atrocities instigated by both Greek and Turkish Cypriots on the island led to the demolishment of the military junta and the restitution of democracy in Greece.

The Turkish government has claimed that the invasion was justified by the [[1960 Treaty of Guarantee|guarantorship agreement]] between [[Turkey]], [[Greece]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. [[EOKA]] and [[EOKA#EOKA-B|EOKA-B]] no longer exist, but Turkish troops remain on the island, and a separate state was proclaimed in [[1975]] under the name [[Turkish Federated State of Northern Cyprus]]. The name was changed to [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] on [[15 November]], [[1983]]. This self proclaimed state is not a UN member and is not recognized by any nation except [[Turkey]]. [[Azerbaijan]] maintains unofficial relations with the &quot;TRNC&quot; but has not officially recognized it except for a resolution from a subnational legislative body.

{{dubious}}
Since then, Greece has strongly supported Greek-Cypriot efforts, calling for the removal of Turkish troops and the restoration of a unified state. The Republic of Cyprus has received strong support from Greece in international forums. Greece has a military contingent on Cyprus, and Greek officers fill some key positions in the Greek Cypriot National Guard, as permitted by the constitution of Cyprus. The United Nations proclaimed the northern part of the island as occupied territory and the Republic of Cyprus has not changed its inaugural constitution: it always considers northern Cypriots as citizens of the Republic and grants them with the privileges of the southern Cypriots. 

Other issues dividing Greece and Turkey involve the delimitation of the [[continental shelf]] in the Aegean Sea, territorial waters and airspace, and the condition of the Greek minority in Turkey and the Muslim minority in Greece. Greek and Turkish officials held meetings in the [[1970s]] to discuss differences on Aegean questions, but Greece discontinued these discussions in the fall of [[1981]]. In [[1983]], Greece and Turkey held talks on trade and tourism, but these were suspended by Greece when Turkey recognized the illegal Turkish-Cypriot declaration of an independent state in northern Cyprus in November 1983.

After a dangerous dispute in the Aegean in March [[1987]] concerning oil drilling rights, the Prime Ministers of Greece and Turkey exchanged messages exploring the possibility of resolving the dispute over the continental shelf. Greece wanted the dispute to be decided by the International Court of Justice. Turkey preferred bilateral political discussions. In early [[1988]], the Turkish and Greek Prime Ministers met at [[Davos, Switzerland]], and later in [[Brussels]]. They agreed on various measures to reduce bilateral tensions and to encourage cooperation. New tensions over the Aegean Sea surfaced in November [[1994]], precipitated by Greece's claims that the Law of the Sea Treaty states that it reserved the right to declare a 12&amp;nbsp;[[nautical mile]] (22 km) territorial sea boundary around its Aegean islands as permitted by the treaty. Turkey stated that it would consider any such action a cause for war. New technical-level bilateral discussions began in 1994 but soon fizzled-out.

In January [[1996]], Greece and Turkey came close to an armed confrontation over the question of which country had sovereignty over an [[Imia-Kardak crisis|islet in the Aegean]]. In July [[1997]], on the sidelines of the [[NATO]] summit in Madrid, Greek and Turkish leaders reached agreement on six principles to govern their bilateral relations. Within a few months, however, the two countries were again at odds over Aegean airspace and sovereignty issues. Tensions remained high for months, although various confidence-building measures were discussed to reduce the risk of military accidents or conflict in the Aegean, under the auspices of the [[NATO]] Secretary General.

Relations between the two countries began to improve steadily since a devasting earthquake in [[Izmit|Kocaeli]] on [[August 17]] [[1999]]. Greece was among the first countries to send aid and rescue teams to the region, and Turkey returned the gesture when a smaller earthquake shook Athens later that year. Since then, Greece has come out in support of Turkey's bid for [[European Union|EU]] membership, and there has been greatly increased co-operation between the two countries to resolve the [[Cyprus dispute]].

It must be noted that the Republic of Cyprus is a sovereign state with its own diplomatic corps and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Though a highly sentimental issue for both populations, the Cyprus problem is mainly a bilateral problem between northern and southern Cypriots.

On [[May 6]] [[2004]], Turkey's Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] became the first Turkish premier to visit Greece in sixteen years. Two days later, he became the first PM in 52 years to visit the Greek Muslim minority in Western Thrace, a community which has been at the centre of rifts between Greece and Turkey for decades. He said, &quot;I'm specially addressing my brothers. You will, without doubt, protect your special identity. Nobody is telling you to lose or give up your Turkish identity. But don't forget you are citizens of Greece.&quot; His words were a clear indication of how much relations had improved, though the implications of the characterization of the Muslim minority as a &quot;turkish&quot; are potentially perplexing.

=== Bilateral relations with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM)===

Greek refusal to recognize the [[Republic of Macedonia|Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]] (FYROM) under its chosen name of &quot;Republic of Macedonia&quot; has been an important issue in Greek politics since [[1992]]. Greece was adamantly opposed to the use of the name &quot;Macedonia&quot; by the government in Skopje, claiming that the name is intrinsically Greek and should not be used by a foreign country.

Furthermore, Greece believes that an independent &quot;Republic of Macedonia&quot; bordering the Greek region of Macedonia would fuel [[irre cut [[flower]]s have boomed, while more traditional exports such as [[sugar]], [[banana]]s, and [[coffee]] continue to represent a large share of the export market.

The United States is the country's largest trading partner, providing 41% of Guatemala's imports and receiving 34% of its exports. The government sector is small and shrinking, with its business activities limited to public utilities--some of which have been [[privatization|privatized]]--ports and airports and several development-oriented financial institutions. Guatemala was certified to receive export trade benefits under the United States' [[Caribbean Basin Trade and Partnership Act]] (CBTPA) in October [[2000]], and enjoys access to U.S. [[Generalized System of Preferences]] (GSP) benefits. Due to concerns over serious worker rights protection issues, however, Guatemala's benefits under both the CBTPA and GSP are currently under review.

Current economic priorities include:
* [[liberalization|Liberalizing]] the trade regime;
* Financial services sector reform;
* Overhauling Guatemala's public finances;
* Simplifying the [[tax]] structure, enhancing tax compliance, and broadening the tax base.
* Improving the investment climate through procedural and regulatory simplification and adopting a goal of concluding treaties to protect investment and [[intellectual property]] rights.

Import tariffs have been lowered in conjunction with Guatemala's Central American neighbors so that most fall between 0% and 15%, with further reductions planned. Responding to Guatemala's changed political and economic policy environment, the international community has mobilized substantial resources to support the country's economic and social development objectives. The United States, along with other donor countries--especially [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]], [[Japan]], and the international financial institutions--have increased development project financing. Donors' response to the need for international financial support funds for implementation of the Peace Accords is, however, contingent upon Guatemalan government reforms and counterpart financing.

Problems hindering economic growth include high [[crime]] rates, [[literacy|illiteracy]] and low levels of [[education]], and an inadequate and underdeveloped capital market. They also include lack of [[infrastructure]], particularly in the transportation, [[telecommunication]]s, and electricity sectors, although the state telephone company and electricity distribution were privatized in [[1998]]. The distribution of income and wealth remains highly skewed. The wealthiest 10% of the population receives almost one-half of all income; the top 20% receives two-thirds of all income. As a result, approximately 80% of the population lives in [[poverty]], and two-thirds of that number live in extreme poverty. Guatemala's social indicators, such as infant mortality and illiteracy, are among the worst in the hemisphere.

In 2005 Guatemala ratified its signature to the [[Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement|Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA)]] between the [[United States of America]] and several other Central American countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Guatemala]] is a signatory to the [[Rio Pact]] and is a member of the [[Central American Defense Council]] (CONDECA). The [[President of Guatemala|President of the Republic]] is commander in chief. The [[Ministry of Defence of Guatemala|Minister of Defense]] is responsible for policy. Day-to-day operations are the responsibility of the military chief of staff and the national defense staff.

An agreement signed in September [[1996]], which is one of the substantive peace accords, mandated that the mission of the armed forces change to focus exclusively on external threats. However, both former president [[Álvaro Enrique Arzú Irigoyen]] and his successor president [[Alfonso Portillo]] have used a constitutional clause to order the army on a temporary basis to support the police in response to a nationwide wave of violent crime.

The accord calls for a one-third reduction in the army's authorized strength and budget &amp;mdash; already achieved &amp;mdash; and for a constitutional amendment to permit the appointment of a civilian minister of defense. A constitutional amendment to this end was defeated as part of a May [[1999]] plebiscite, but discussions between the executive and legislative branches continue on how to achieve this objective.

The army has met its accord-mandated target of 28,000 troops, including subordinate air force (1,000) and navy (1,000) elements. It is equipped with armaments and material from the [[United States]], [[Israel]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], [[Argentina]], [[Spain]], and [[France]]. As part of the army downsizing, the operational structure of 19 military zones and three strategic brigades are being recast as several military zones are eliminated and their area of operations absorbed by others. The air force operates three air bases; the navy has two port bases.

The Guatemalan army has a special forces unit (specializing in anti-insurgent jungle warfare)  known as the [[Kaibiles]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Guatemala]]'s major diplomatic interests are regional security and, increasingly, regional development and economic integration. The [[Central American Ministers of Trade]] meet on a regular basis to work on regional approaches to trade issues. In March 1998, Guatemala joined its [[Central America]]n neighbors in signing a [[Trade and Investment Framework Agreement]] (TIFA). In 2000 it joined [[Honduras]] and [[El Salvador]] in signing a free trade agreement with [[Mexico]], which went into effect in 2001. Guatemala also originated the idea for, and is the seat of, the [[Central American Parliament]] (PARLACEN).

Guatemala participates in several regional groups, particularly those related to the environment and trade. For example, US President Clinton and the Central American presidents signed the CONCAUSA ([[Conjunto Centroamerica-USA]]) agreement at the [[Summit of the Americas]] in December 1994. CONCAUSA is a cooperative plan of action to promote clean, efficient energy use; conserve the region's biodiversity; strengthen legal and institutional frameworks and compliance mechanisms; and improve and harmonize environmental protection standards.

Guatemala has a longstanding claim to a large portion of [[Belize]]; the territorial dispute caused problems with the [[United Kingdom]] and later with Belize following its 1981 independence from the U.K. In December 1989, Guatemala sponsored Belize for permanent observer status in the Organization of American States (OAS). In September 1991, Guatemala recognized Belize's independence and established diplomatic ties, while acknowledging that the boundaries remained in dispute. In anticipation of an effort to bring the border dispute to an end in early 1996, the Guatemalan Congress ratified two long-pending international agreements governing frontier issues and maritime rights.

In early 2000, the Guatemalan Foreign Ministry proposed a border settlement that would transfer more than half of Belize's territory to Guatemala. Following a spate of border incidents, both sides agreed during talks under OAS auspices in November 2000 to confidence-building measures to reduce tensions. They followed that with an agreement on opening substantive discussions on the dispute. 

Notably, both Guatemala and Belize are participating in the confidence building measures, including the Guatemala-Belize Language Exchange Project (for more information see: www.guatemalabelize.com and www.confidence2.org ).

Guatemala maintains official relations with the [[Republic of China]] (known as &quot;Taiwan&quot;) instead of the [[People's Republic of China]].

'''Disputes - international:'''
territory in Belize claimed by Guatemala; precise alignment of boundary in dispute

'''Illicit drugs:'''
transit country for cocaine shipments; minor producer of illicit opium poppy and cannabis for the international drug trade; active eradication program in 1996 effectively eliminated the cannabis crop; proximity to Mexico makes Guatemala a major staging area for drugs (cocaine shipments)

== History ==
Rising sea levels transformed Guernsey into the tip of a [[peninsula]] jutting out into the emergent English Channel until about [[6000 BC]], when Guernsey and other promontories were cut off from continental Europe, becoming islands. At this time, [[Neolithic]] farmers settled the coasts and created the [[dolmens]] and [[menhirs]] that dot the islands. The island of Guernsey contains three [[Statue menhir|sculpted menhirs]] of great archaeological interest; the dolmen known as L'Autel du Dehus also contains a [[dolmen deity]].

During their migration to Brittany, the Britons occupied the ''Lenur Islands'' (former name of the Channel Islands) including ''Lisia'' (Guernsey) and ''Angia'' (Jersey). It was formerly thought that the Island's original name was ''Sarnia'', but recent research shows that to have been the Latin name for [[Sark]].  Coming from the kingdom of Gwent, Saint [[Samson of Dol|Sampson]] (abbot of Dol, in Brittany) is credited with the introduction of [[Christianity]] to Guernsey.

In [[933]] the islands, formerly under the control of the kingdom, then [[Duchy of Brittany]] were annexed by the [[Duchy of Normandy]]. The island of Guernsey and the other [[Channel Island]]s represent the last remnants of the medieval Duchy of Normandy. In the islands, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]]'s traditional title as [[head of state]] is [[Duke of Normandy]].  In fact, locals jokingly refer to [[England]] as the colony!

During the [[English Civil War]], Guernsey sided with [[English Parliament|Parliament]], while Jersey remained [[Charles I of England|Royalist]].  Guernsey's decision was mainly related to the higher proportion of [[Calvinists]] and other Reformed churches, as well as [[Charles I]]'s refusal to take up the case of some Guernsey seamen who had been captured by the [[Barbary corsairs]].  The allegiance was not total, however, there were a few Royalist uprisings in the Southwest of the island, while Castle Cornet was occupied by the then Governor, Sir Peter Osbourne, and Royalist troops.  [[Castle Cornet]] was the last Royalist stronghold to capitulate, in 1651.

During [[World War I]] approximately 3,000 island men served in the [[British Expeditionary Force]]. Of these, about 1,000 served in the [[Royal Guernsey Light Infantry]] regiment which was formed from the Royal Guernsey Militia in 1916.

The Bailiwick of Guernsey was [[Occupation of the Channel Islands|occupied by German troops]] in [[World War II]]. Before the occupation, many Guernsey children were evacuated to England to live with relatives or strangers during the war. Some children were never re-united with their families. During the occupation, some people from Guernsey were deported by the Germans to camps in the southwest of [[Germany]], notably to [[Biberach an der Riß|Biberach an der Riss]] and interned in the Lindele Camp (&quot;Lager Lindele&quot;). There was also a concentration camp built in Alderney where forced labourers, predominantly from Eastern Europe, were kept. It was the only concentration camp built on British soil and is commemorated on memorials under the Alderney's name in French: 'Aurigny'.

== Politics ==
{{main|Politics of Guernsey}}
[[The States]] of Guernsey, officially called the [[States of Guernsey|States of Deliberation]], consists of 45 People's Deputies, elected from multi- or single-member districts every four years. There are also two representatives from [[Alderney]], a self-governing dependency of the Bailiwick, but [[Sark]] sends no representative. There are also two non-voting members - the Attorney General and the Solicitor General both appointed by the monarch. Laws passed by the States are known as 'Ordinances'.

The Lieutenant Governor is the representative of [[the Crown]]. The [[official residence]] of the Lieutenant Governor is Government House. Since [[18 October]] 2005, the incumbent is Vice-Admiral Sir Fabian Malbon, born in Southsea in 1946 and a serving naval officer 1965-2002. His last naval posting before retirement from the Royal Navy was deputy commander-in-chief of fleet.

Each parish is administered by a Douzaine.  Douzeniers are elected for a six year mandate, two Douzeniers being elected by parishioners at a Parish Meeting in November each year. The senior Douzenier is known as the Doyen. Two elected [[Constable]]s carry out the decisions of the Douzaine, serving for between one and three years. The longest serving Constable is known as the Senior Constable and his or her colleague as the Junior Constable. 

The legal system is derived from [[Normans|Norman]] French and English common law, justice being administered through a combination of Magistrates Court and the Royal Court. The Royal Court is presided over by the Bailiff and 12 [[Jurat|Jurats]] (a permanent elected jury), the ultimate court of appeal being the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]].

'''Greenpeace''' is an international [[environmental organization]] founded in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] in [[1971]].
Greenpeace is known for its use of [[nonviolence|nonviolent direct action]] campaigns to stop atmospheric and underground [[nuclear testing]] as well as bring an end to high seas [[whaling]]. In later years, the focus of the organisation turned to other environmental issues, including [[bottom trawling]], [[global warming]] and [[genetic engineering]]. Greenpeace has national and regional offices in 41 countries worldwide, all of which have affiliation with the [[Amsterdam]]-based Greenpeace International. The global organisation receives its income through the individual contributions of an estimated 2.8 million financial supporters, as well as from grants from [[charity|charitable foundations]], but does not accept funding from governments or corporations.

Greenpeace's official mission statement describes the organisation and its aims thus:

:''Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation which uses non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental problems, and to force solutions for a green and peaceful future. Greenpeace's goal is to ensure the ability of the earth to nurture life in all its diversity.''

== Early history ==
The origins of Greenpeace lie in the formation of the ''[[Don't Make A Wave Committee]]'' by an assortment of [[Canadian]] and [[United States of America|American]] expatriate [[peace]] [[activism|activists]] in [[Vancouver]] in [[1970]]. Taking its name from a slogan used during protests against [[United States]] [[nuclear testing]] in late [[1969]], the Committee came together with the objective of stopping a second underground nuclear bomb test codenamed [[Amchitka|Cannikin]] by the [[United States military]] beneath the island of [[Amchitka]], [[Alaska]]. The first ship expedition was called the ''Greenpeace I'', and the second relief expedition the ''Greenpeace Too!''. The test was not stopped, but the organization of the committee laid the groundwork for Greenpeace's later activities. 

[[Image:Greenpeace-Brasília.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Greenpeace protest in [[Brasília]], [[Brazil]].]]

Bill Darnell has received the credit for combining the words ‘green’ and ‘peace’, thereby giving the organization its future name.

On [[4 May]] [[1972]], following Dorothy Stowe's departure from the chairmanship of the ''Don't Make A Wave Committee'', the fledgling environmental group officially changed its name to the &quot;Greenpeace Foundation&quot;.

===Greenpeace===
By the late [[1970s]], spurred by the global reach of what Robert Hunter called &quot;[[mind bombs]]&quot;, in which images of confrontation on the high seas converted diffuse and complex issues into considerably more media-friendly David versus Goliath-style narratives, more than 20 groups across [http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/ North America], [http://www.greenpeace.org/international Europe], [http://www.greenpeace.org.nz New Zealand] and [http://www.greenpeace.org.au Australia] had adopted the name &quot;Greenpeace&quot;.

In [[1979]], however, the original Vancouver-based Greenpeace Foundation had encountered financial difficulties, and disputes between offices over fund-raising and organizational direction split the global movement. [[David McTaggart]] lobbied the Canadian Greenpeace Foundation to accept a new structure which would bring the scattered Greenpeace offices under the auspices of a single global organization, and on [[October 14]], 1979, Greenpeace International came into existence. Under the new structure, the local offices would contribute a percentage of their income to the international organization, which would take responsibility for setting the overall direction of the movement. 

Greenpeace's transformation from a loose international network &amp;mdash; united by style more than by focus &amp;mdash; to a global organization able to apply the full force of its resources to a small number of environmental issues deemed of global significance, owed much to McTaggart's personal vision. McTaggart summed up his approach in a [[1994]] memo: &quot;No campaign should be begun without clear goals; no campaign should be begun unless there is a possibility that it can be won; no campaign should be begun unless you intend to finish it off&quot;. McTaggart's own assessment of what could and couldn't be won, and how, frequently caused controversy.

In re-shaping Greenpeace as a centrally coordinated, hierarchical organization, McTaggart went against the anti-authoritarian ethos that prevailed in other environmental organizations that came of age in the 1970s. While this pragmatic structure granted Greenpeace the persistence and narrow focus necessary to match forces with government and industry, it would lead to the recurrent criticism that Greenpeace had adopted the same methods of governance as its chief foes &amp;mdash; the [[multinational corporation]]s.

For smaller actions, and continuous local promotion and activism, Greenpeace has networks of active supporters that coordinate their efforts through national offices. The [http://www.greenpeace.org.uk United Kingdom] has some 6,000 Greenpeace activists.

=== Funding ===
Despite its founding in [[North America]], Greenpeace achieved much more success in [[Europe]], where it has more members and gets most of its money. The vast majority of Greenpeace's donations come from private individual members, however, it has received donations from some prominent figures such as [[Ted Turner]].

In order to ensure its independence and impartiality, Greenpeace does not accept money from [[corporation]]s or from governments: it screens donations to ensure compliance.

==Greenpeace Ships==

Since Greenpeace was founded, ships have played a vital role in its campaigns.  

In [[1978]], Greenpeace launched the original ''[[Rainbow Warrior]]'', a 40-metre, former fishing [[trawler]] named for the [[Cree]] legend that inspired early activist Robert Hunter on the first voyage to Amchitka.  Greenpeace purchased the ''Rainbow Warrior'' (originally launched as the ''Sir William Hardy'' in [[1955]]) at a cost of £40,000, and volunteers restored and refitted her over a period of four months.

First deployed to disrupt the hunt of the [[Iceland]]ic whaling fleet, the ''Rainbow Warrior'' would quickly become a mainstay of Greenpeace campaigns. Between 1978 to 1985, crew members also engaged in non-violent direct action against the ocean-dumping of toxic and radioactive waste, the [[Grey Seal]] hunt in the [[Orkney Islands|Orkneys]] and nuclear testing in the Pacific.

In [[1985]], the ''Rainbow Warrior'' was to trespass into the waters surrounding [[Moruroa]] atoll, site of French nuclear testing. The ship was bombed in a New Zealand harbour by the French government (by order of the French president, [[François Mitterrand]] himself, as per a publication in [[Le Monde]] in [[2005]], on the 20th anniversary of the bombing); in this event, photographer [[Fernando Pereira]] was killed, the French Government in 1987 agreed to pay New Zealand compensation of NZ$13 million and formally apologised for the bombing. (Also see [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior]].) 

In [[1989]] Greenpeace commissioned a replacement vessel, also named the ''Rainbow Warrior'', which remains in service today as the flagship of the Greenpeace fleet. The fleet consists of three other ships: the [[MV Arctic Sunrise]], the [[MV Esperanza]], and the Argus.

In [[2005]] the ''Rainbow Warrior II'' ran aground at the [[Tubbataha Reef]] in the Philippines, while Greenpeace was on a mission to &quot;protect&quot; the very same reef.  [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4395572.stm They were fined $7,000 USD] for the damage and agreed to pay the fine, although they said that the Philippines government had intentionally given them outdated maps.

Along with the newly commissioned Rainbow Warrior the Greenpeace organization has 3 other ships.

The organisation currently actively addresses many environmental issues, with primary focus on efforts to stop global warming and to preserve the biodiversity of the world's oceans and ancient forests. In addition to the more conventional [[environmental organisation]] methods, such as lobbying politicians and attendance at international conferences, Greenpeace has a stated methodology of engaging in [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] [[direct action]].

Greenpeace uses direct action to attract attention to particular environmental causes, whether by placing themselves between the whaler's harpoon and their prey, or by invading nuclear facilities dressed as barrels of radioactive waste. 

Some of Greenpeace's most notable successes include the ending of [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty|atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons]], a (purportedly) permanent moratorium on international commercial [[whaling]], and the declaration by treaty of [[Antarctica]] as a global park, forbidding possession by individual nations or commercial interests. To back up this latter point, [[World Park Base]] was established in Antarctica, and ran for five years, from 1987 through 1992.

===Anti-nuclear testing===
In September [[1971]], the Don't Make A Wave Committee chartered the ''[[Phyllis Cormack]]'', a fishing vessel skippered by [[John Cormack]]. They named it the ''Greenpeace'', and set sail for the island of [[Amchitka]] with the intention of disrupting the scheduled second nuclear test. The [[United States Coast Guard|US Coast Guard]] vessel ''Confidence'' intercepted  the ''Phyllis Cormack'' and forced her to return to port.

Upon their return to [[Alaska]], the crew learned that protests had taken place in all major Canadian cities, and that the United States had postponed the second underground test until November. Although attempts to sail into the test zone using a second chartered vessel also failed, no further nuclear tests took place at Amchitka.

====Moruroa Atoll and the ''Vega''====
In May 1972, when the newly-formed Greenpeace Foundation put out a call to sympathetic skippers to help them protest against the [[France|French]] Government's atmospheric nuclear tests at the Pacific atoll of [[Moruroa]], a response came from [[David McTaggart]], a Canadian expatriate and former entrepreneur based in New Zealand. McTaggart, a champion [[badminton]] player in his youth, had sold his business interests and relocated to the South Pacific following a gas explosion which seriously wounded an employee at one of his ski-lodges. Outraged that any government could exclude him from any part of his beloved Pacific, McTaggart offered his yacht, the ''Vega'', to the cause, and set about assembling a crew.

In [[1973]], McTaggart sailed the ''Vega'' into the exclusion zone around Moruroa, only to have his vessel rammed by the [[French Navy]]. When he repeated the protest the following year, French sailors boarded the ''Vega'' and brutally beat McTaggart. Later, the Navy released to the media staged photographs of McTaggart dining with senior navy officers, which suggested a degree of civility between the opposing parties. A different picture emerged when photographs of McTaggart's beating, smuggled off the yacht by crew member [[Anne-Marie Horne]], also appeared in the media.

The campaign against [[French nuclear testing]] achieved a victory when the French government announced a halt to atmospheric testing, only to begin testing underground. Greenpeace would continue to campaign against testing in the Pacific until the French ceased their testing programme in [[1995]].
[[Image:Rainbow warrior.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The [[Rainbow Warrior]].]]
==== Rainbow Warrior and French bombing ====

Greenpeace's continued protest against nuclear testing at Moruroa atoll prompted the government of [[France]] to order the [[bomb]]ing of the ''[[Rainbow Warrior]]'', in [[Auckland, New Zealand|Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], in 1985.

The ''Warrior'' had sailed from the North Pacific, where it assisted the evacuation of the inhabitants of [[Rongelap Atoll]] in the [[Marshall Islands]], who continued to suffer health effects attributed to the fallout from American nuclear testing during the 1950s and 1960s. Greenpeace plans envisaged the ship leading a flotilla of vessels protesting against imminent nuclear tests at Moruroa.

On the evening of [[July 10]], [[1985]], [[Scuba diving|frogmen]] attached two bombs to the hull of the ship. The first bomb detonated at 11:38, closely followed by the second explosion, sinking the ship and killing photographer [[Fernando Pereira]], who had come back to fetch his belongings. 

Acting on tip-offs from a shocked public, the New Zealand police quickly traced the bombing to Major [[Alain Mafart]] and Captain [[Dominique Prieur]], members of the French armed forces posing as a Swiss honeymoon couple. The police arrested Mafart and Prieur, but attempts on the part of New Zealand authorities to secure the extradition of their suspected accomplices from Australia, and later from France, failed.

The French Government initially denied any involvement in the bombing, but mounting pressure from the French and international media led to the admission, on [[September 22]], that the [[DGSE|French secret service]] had ordered the bombing. Investigations subsequent to the bombing also revealed that [[Christine Cabon]], a French secret service agent, had infiltrated the Auckland office of Greenpeace New Zealand, posing as a volunteer in order to gather information on the Moruroa campaign and the ''Rainbow Warrior''’s movements.

In [[1987]], the French Government agreed to pay New Zealand compensation of NZ$13 million and formally apologised for the bombing. The original ''Rainbow Warrior'', too damaged to repair, was cleaned and scuttled in [[Matauri Bay]], where it serves as an [[artificial reef]] and popular [[diving]] destination.

A [[2005]] publication in French newspaper [[Le Monde]] made clear that it was by order of the French president, [[François Mitterrand]] himself, that the attack took place.

===Saving the Whales===
When [[Paul Spong]], a New Zealand neuroscientist hired by the [[Vancouver Aquarium Marine Science Centre|Vancouver Aquarium]] to study the behaviour of whales in captivity, contacted Robert Hunter, the 'Save the Whales' campaign which resulted took place initially under the banner of [[Project Ahab]], due to Irving Stowe's resistance to broadening Greenpeace's scope beyond opposition to nuclear weapons.

Stowe's death in [[1974]] effectively ended this deadlock, and a re-chartered ''Phyllis Cormack'' steamed from Vancouver to meet the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] whaling fleet off the Californian coast in the spring of [[1975]]. Thanks to the guidance of a primitive radio direction-finder and some fortuitous navigation by musician [[Mel Gregory]], who steered towards the moon rather than following a compass, the Cormack encountered the whaling fleet on [[June 26]].

The crew used fast [[Zodiac inflatable]]s to position themselves between the harpoon of the catcher ship ‘’Vlastny’’ and a fleeing whale. Television broadcasts around the world showed film footage of the ‘’Vlastny’’ firing a harpoon over the heads of Greenpeace activists, highlighting the plight of the whales to the world's public in the closing days of the [[International Whaling Commission]]'s [[1976]] conference in [[London]], [[England]].

===Kleenex and the destruction of ancient forests===
In [[November 2004]], Greenpeace launched a campaign against the [[Kimberly-Clark Corporation]] because its tissue products, including the popular [[Kleenex]] brand, have been linked to the destruction of ancient [[boreal forest]]s. The environmental organization charges that Kimberly-Clark uses more than 2.5 million tonnes of [[virgin pulp]] from forests to produce its tissue products, including the Kleenex brand. The corporation is a purchaser of pulp from clearcutting operations in ancient forests in [[Ontario]] and [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. The forests have existed for over 10,000 years &amp;mdash; since the last [[ice age]] and are home to threatened wildlife such as [[woodland caribou]] and [[wolverine]].

As part of its [http://www.kleercut.net/ international &quot;Kleercut&quot; campaign], Greenpeace has been educating consumers about the links between Kleenex tissue products and ancient forests, moving [[shareholder]]s to put pressure on Kimberly-Clark and motivating customers to switch to more environmental tissue product manufacturers.

==Criticism and attacks==
During its history, Greenpeace has weathered criticism from government and industry, and on occasion, from other environmental groups; been bombed by French special forces; and members are often arrested for minor offences such as trespass. The organisation's system of governance and its use of [[nonviolent direct action]] (which is considered by some to be illegal acts of [[civil disorder]]) have been particular sources of controversy. On the other hand, there has also been criticism from those who feel the organisation is too mainstream. Paul Watson, who parted ways to found [[Sea Shepherd]], once called Greenpeace &quot;The Avon ladies of the environmental movement,&quot; because of their door-to-door fund-raising that relies on the media exposure of deliberately orchestrated and highly publicised actions to keep the name of Greenpeace on the front pages.

Two of Greenpeace's most vocal critics are Icelandic filmmaker [[Magnus Gudmundsson]], director of the pro-whaling documentary ''Survival in the High North'', and former Greenpeace International Director [[Patrick Moore (environmentalist)|Patrick Moore]]. Gudmundsson's criticisms have focused largely on the social impacts of anti-[[whaling]] and anti-sealing campaigns, while Moore's main criticisms have been levelled at the campaign to protect the forests of British Columbia. Supporters of Greenpeace counter that, like many of the organisation's most outspoken critics, Gudmundsson and Moore receive considerable funding from the very industries that have been subject to Greenpeace campaigns. Gudmundsson's documentary was judged libellous by a Norwegian court in 1992 and he was ordered to pay damages to Greenpeace. Similarly, a Danish tribunal held that the allegations against Greenpeace about faking video materials were unfounded. Many media that published Gudmundsson's allegations have subsequently retracted and apologised (e.g. Irish Sunday Business Post and TVNZ).

The factual basis of particular campaigns has been criticised, for example over the [[Brent Spar]] [[oil platform]] affair, in which Greenpeace mounted a successful campaign (including occupation of the platform and a public [[boycott]]) to force the platform's owners, [[Royal Dutch Shell|Royal Dutch/Shell]], to dismantle the platform on land instead of [[scuttling]] it. A moratorium on the dumping of offshore installations was almost immediately adopted in Europe, and three years later the Environment Ministers of the countries bordering the North East Atlantic agreed with Greenpeace, and adopted a permanent ban on the dumping of offshore installations at sea http://archive.greenpeace.org/odumping/radioactive/reports/odhistory.pdf. After the occupation of the Brent Spar it was argued that Shell had not misled the public as to the amount of toxic wastes on board the installation. Greenpeace admitted that its claims that the Spar contained 5000 tonnes of oil were inaccurate and apologised to Shell on [[September 5]]. However Greenpeace also argued that the issue was one of wider industrial responsibility, and as the first offshore installation to be dumped in the North East Atlantic, the Brent Spar would have been followed by dozens or hundreds more, thereby setting a dangerous precedent. 

In [[September 2003]] the [[Public Interest Watch]] (PIW) complained to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] claiming that Greenpeace tax returns were inaccurate and breached the law.[http://www.publicinterestwatch.org/pdfs/PIW_report.pdf] PIW claimed that Greenpeace was using non-profit donations for advocacy instead of charity and educational purposes.  PIW wanted the IRS to investigate the complaint. Greenpeace rejected the claims and challenged PIW to disclose its funders, a request rejected by the then PIW Executive Director, Mike Hardiman.[http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewNation.asp?Page=%5CNation%5Carchive%5C200309%5CNAT20030923b.html] The charitable status of Greenpeace has been revoked in Canada (since 1989). &lt;!-- and the US? source? --&gt;

      <comment>/* Modern guilds */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''guild''' is an [[Voluntary association|association]] of people of the same trade or pursuits (with a similar [[skill]] or [[craft]]), formed to protect mutual interests and maintain standards of morality or conduct. Historically they were formed to [[benefit society|benefit societies]] or [[small business]] associations, also referred to as a trade union of sorts, since each crafter was a self-employed individual [[artisan]] or part of a small craft shop or co-operative.  They exist in modern and medieval incarnations, both of which are discussed in this article.  One's view of guilds tends to be heavily colored by one's view of [[political economy]], since the whole history of [[trade]], [[technology]], [[intellectual property]], regulated [[profession]]s, [[social security]], and [[professional ethics]] are entwined with the history of the guilds in Europe.

==Early history==
Regulated professions were a feature of the ancient and classical world.  The [[Code of Hammurabi]] specified a death penalty for [[builder]]s, or [[masonry|masons]], whose buildings fell on the inhabitants.  [[Hammurabi]] himself had been a stonemason, so this could be considered an early example of self-regulation.  The [[Hippocratic Oath]] applies to this day as the basis of the modern [[physician]]s' [[ethical code]].  All known [[legal code]]s include some limits on the practices or powers of [[jurist]]s, e.g. the [[Rules of Civil Procedure]], or [[politician]]s, e.g. the rules of [[parliamentary debate]].  It has generally been recognized that those in a position of special knowledge or trust were to be held accountable to the public for their advice and services.

[[Islamic civilization]] extended this to a degree to the [[artisan]] as well — most notably to the [[warraqeen]], &quot;those who work with paper&quot;.  [[Early Muslim philosophy|Early Muslim]]s were heavily engaged in translating and absorbing all [[ilm]] (&quot;[[knowledge]]&quot;) from all other known civilizations, &quot;as far as [[China]].&quot;  Critically analyzing, accepting, rejecting, improving and codifying knowledge from other cultures became a key activity, and a [[knowledge industry]] as presently understood began to evolve.  By the beginning of the [[9th century]], paper had become the standard medium of written communication, and most warraqeen were engaged in paper-making, book-selling, and taking the dictation of authors, to whom they were obliged to pay royalties on works, and who had final discretion on the contents.  As the standard means of presentation of a new work was its public dictation in the [[mosque]] or [[madrassah]], in front of many scholars and students, a high degree of professional respect was required to ensure that other warraqeen did not simply make and sell copies, or that authors did not lose faith in the warraqeen or this system of publication.  This was an early guild.

This publication industry that spanned the Muslim empire from the first works under this system in [[874]] to the 15th century, gave rise to all concerns a modern [[intellectual property law]]yer would recognize:  by means of the tens of thousands of books per year so published, [[instructional capital]] from one group of artisans admired for their work could be spread to other artisans elsewhere who could copy it and perhaps &quot;[[passing off|pass it off]]&quot; as the original, exploiting the [[social capital]] built up at great expense by the originators of techniques.  Artisans began to take various ways to protect their proprietary interests, restrict access to techniques, materials, and to markets.

==European history==
In the [[Early Middle Ages]] most of the Roman craft organizations, formed as religious confraternities, had disappeared with the apparent exceptions of stonecutters and perhaps glassmakers.  [[Gregory of Tours]] tells a miraculous tale of a builder whose art and techniques suddenly left him, but were restored by an apparition of the Virgin Mary in a dream. Michel Rouche (1987 pp431ff) remarks that the story speaks for the importance of practically transmitted journeymanship.

The early egalitarian communities called &quot;guilds&quot; (for the gold deposited in their common funds) were denounced by Catholic clergy for their &quot;conjurations&quot;&amp;mdash;the binding oaths sworn among artisans to support one another in adversity and back one another in feuds or in business ventures. The occasion for the drunken banquets at which these oaths were made was [[December 26]], the pagan feast of [[Yule|Jul]]: Bishop [[Hincmar]], in 858 sought vainly to Christianize them (Rouche 1987 p 432). 
 
By about 1100 European '''guilds''' (or '''gilds''') and [[Livery Company|livery companies]] had evolved into an approximate equivalent to modern-day [[business]] organizations such as [[institute]]s or [[consortium]]s.  They had strong controls over [[instructional capital]], and the modern concepts of a lifetime progression of [[apprentice]] to [[craftsman]], [[journeyer]], and eventually to widely-recognized [[master craftsman|master]] and [[master craftsman|grandmaster]] began to emerge. The appearance of the European guilds is believed to be tied to the emergent [[money]] economy, and to [[urbanization]]. Before this time it was not possible to run a money-driven organization, as [[commodity money]] was the normal way of doing business.

The guild was at the center of [[Europe|European]] handicraft organization.  The guild system reached a mature state in [[Germany]] in the [[Middle Ages]], circa [[1300]]. The guilds were identified with organizations enjoying certain [[privilege]]s ([[letters patent]]), usually issued by the [[monarch|king]] or [[state]] and overseen by local town business authorities (some kind of [[chamber of commerce]]).  These were the predecessors of the modern [[patent]] and [[trademark]] system.

Like their Muslim predecessors, European guilds imposed long periods of [[apprenticeship]], and made it difficult or impossible for those lacking the approval of their peers to gain access to materials or knowledge, or sell into certain markets.   These are defining characteristics of [[mercantilism]] in economics, which dominated most European thinking about [[political economy]] until the rise of [[classical economics]].  States applied this thinking, for instance, to restrict the flow of gold and silver to military opponents, as gold was useful to buy weapons and hire [[mercenaries]].

The guilds also maintained funds in order to support infirm or elderly members, as well as widows and orphans of guild members, funeral benefits, and a 'tramping' allowance for those needing to travel to find work.

==Organization==
The guild was made up by experienced and confirmed experts in their field of handicraft. They were called [[master craftsman|master craftsmen]]. Before a new employee could rise to the level of mastery, he had to go through a schooling period during which he was first called an [[apprenticeship|apprentice]]. After this period he could rise to the level of [[journeyman]].  Apprentices would typically not learn more than the most basic techniques until they were trusted by their peers to keep the guild's or company's secrets.

Some argue that the title 'journeyman' is derived from the itinerant nature of the position. However, it is more likely that the title derives from the French word for 'day' (''jour'') from which came the middle English word ''journei''. Journeymen were generally paid by the day and were thus day laborers. After being employed by a master for several years, and after producing a qualifying piece of work, the apprentice attained the rank of journeyman and was given a letter which entitled him to travel to other towns and countries to learn the art from other masters. These journeys could span large parts of Europe and were an unofficial way of communicating new methods and techniques.

After this journey and several years of experience, a journeyman could be elected to become a master craftsman. This would require the approval of all masters of a guild, a donation of money and other goods, and in many practical handicrafts the production of a so-called [[masterpiece]], which would illustrate the abilities of the aspiring master craftsman.

The medieval guild was offered a letters patent (usually from the king) and held an [[oligopoly]] on its trade in the town in which it operated: handicraft workers were forbidden by law to run any business if they were not members of a guild, and only masters were allowed to be members of a guild. Before these privileges were legislated, these groups of handicraft workers were simply called 'handicraft associations'.

The town authorities were represented in the guild meetings and thus had a means of controlling the handicraft activities.  This was important since towns very often depended on a good reputation for export of a narrow range of products, on which not only the guild's, but the town's, reputation depended. Controls on the association of physical locations to well-known exported products, e.g. wine from the [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] and [[Bordeaux]] regions of [[France]], [[fine china]] from certain cities in [[Holland]], [[lace]] from [[Chantilly]], etc., helped to establish a town's place in global commerce — this led to modern [[trademark]]s.

In many German towns, the more powerful guilds attempted to influence or even control town authorities. In the [[14th century]], this led to numerous bloody uprisings, during which the guilds dissolved town councils and detained patricians in an attempt to increase their influence.

==Fall of the guilds==
Despite its advantages for agricultural and artisan producers, the guild became a target of much criticism towards the end of the 1700s and the beginning of the 1800s. They were believed to oppose [[free trade]] and hinder [[technological innovation]], [[technology transfer]] and [[business development]].  According to several accounts of this time, guilds became increasingly involved in simple territorial struggles against each other and against free practitioners of their arts, but the neutrality of these claims is doubted.  It may be [[propaganda]].

Two of the most outspoken critics of the guild system were [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Adam Smith]], and all over Europe a tendency to oppose government control over trades in favour of [[laissez-faire]] [[free market]] systems was growing rapidly and making its way into the political and legal system. Even [[Karl Marx]] (not normally in league with Adam Smith) in his ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' criticized the guild system for its rigid gradation of social rank and the relation of opressor/opressed entailed by this system. From this time comes the low regard in which some people hold the guilds to this day. For example, Smith writes in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (Book I, Chapter X, paragraph 72):

:It is to prevent this reduction of price, and consequently of wages and profit, by restraining that free competition which would most certainly occasion it, that all corporations, and the greater part of corporation laws, have been established. (...) and when any particular class of artificers or traders thought proper to act as a corporation without a charter, such adulterine '''guilds''', as they were called, were not always disfranchised upon that account, but obliged to fine annually to the king for permission to exercise their usurped privileges.

In part due to their own inability to control unruly [[corporation|corporate]] behavior, the tide turned against the guilds.  

Because of industrialization and modernization of the trade and industry, and the rise of powerful nation-states that could directly issue [[patent]] and [[copyright]] protections &amp;mdash; often revealing the [[trade secret]]s &amp;mdash; the guilds' power faded.  After the [[French Revolution]] they fell in most European nations through the [[1800s]], as the guild system was disbanded and replaced by free trade laws. By that time, many former handicraft workers had been forced to seek employment in the emerging manufacturing industries, using not closely-guarded techniques but standardized methods controlled by [[corporation]]s.

This was not uniformly viewed as a [[public good]]:  [[Karl Marx]] criticized the [[Marx's_theory_of_alienation|alienation]] of the worker from the products of work that this created, and the [[exploitation]] possible since materials and hours of work were closely controlled by the owners of the new, large scale [[means of production]].

==Influence of guilds==
Guilds are sometimes said to be the precursors of modern [[trade union]]s, and also, paradoxically, of some aspects of the modern [[corporation]].  Guilds, however, were groups of self-employed skilled craftsmen with ownership and control over the materials and tools they needed to produce their goods. Guilds were, in other words, small business associations and thus had very little in common with trade unions. However, the journeymen organizations, which were at the time illegal, may have been influential.

The exclusive privilege of a guild to produce certain goods or provide certain services was similar in spirit and character with the original [[patent]] systems that surfaced in England in [[1624]].  These systems played a role in ending the guilds' dominance, as [[trade secret]] methods were superseded by modern firms directly revealing their techniques, and counting on the state to enforce their legal [[monopoly]].

Some guild traditions still remain in a few handicrafts, in Europe especially among [[shoemaker]]s and [[barber]]s.  Some of the [[ritual]] traditions of the guilds were conserved in [[order (religious)|order]] organizations such as the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]].  These are, however, not very important economically except as reminders of the responsibilities of some trades toward the public.

Modern [[antitrust]] law could be said to be derived in some ways from the original statutes by which the guilds were abolished in Europe.

== Modern guilds ==
Modern guilds exist in different forms around the world. In many European countries guilds have had a revival as local organisations for craftsmen, primarily in traditional skills.  They may function as fora for developing competence and are often the local units of a national employers organization.  

In the [[United States]] guilds exist in several fields.  The [[Screen Actors Guild]] and [[Writers Guild of America]] are capable of exercising very strong control in [[Hollywood]] because a very strong and rigid system of intellectual property respect exists (as with some medieval trades).  These guilds exclude other actors and writers who do not abide by the strict rules for competing within the film and television industry in America. 

Real estate brokerage is an excellent example of a modern American guild. Telltale signs of guild behavior are on display in real estate brokerage: standard pricing (6% of the home price), strong affiliation among all practicioners, self-regulation (see [[National Association of Realtors]]), strong cultural identity (see [[Realtor]]), little price variation with quality differences, and traditional methods in use by all practicioners. In September 2005, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against the National Association of Realtors challenging NAR practices that, DOJ asserts, prevent competition from practicioners who use different methods. The DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission in 2005 advocated against state laws, supported by NAR, that disadvantage new kinds of brokers. For a description of the DOJ action, see [http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/nar.htm].  U.S. v. National Assoc. of Realtors, U.S. District Court Norther District Illinois, Eastern Division, September 7, 2005, Civil Action No. 05C-5140.

Scholars from the [[history of ideas]] have noticed that [[consultant]]s play a part similar to that of the journeymen of the guild systems: they often travel a lot, work at many different companies and spread new practices and knowledge between companies and corporations.

Many professional organizations similarly resemble the guild structure. Professions such as architecture, engineering, and land surveying require varying lengths of apprenticeships before one can be granted a 'professional' certification. These certifications hold great legal weight and are required in most states as a prerequisite to doing business there.

[[Thomas Malone]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] champions a modern variant of the guild structure for modern &quot;e-lancers&quot;, professionals who do mostly [[telework]] for multiple employers.  [[Insurance]] including any [[professional liability]], [[intellectual capital]] protections, an [[ethical code]] perhaps enforced by peer pressure and software, and other benefits of a strong association of producers of knowledge, benefit from [[economies of scale]], and may prevent cut-throat competition that leads to inferior services undercutting prices.  And, as with historical guilds, resist foreign competition.

The [[free software]] community has from time to time explored a guild-like structure to unite against competition from [[Microsoft]], e.g. [[Advogato]] assigns journeyer and master ranks to those committing to work only or mostly on free software.  [[Debian]] also publishes a list of what constitutes [[free software]].

In the [[City of London]], the ancient guilds survive as [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]], most of which play a ceremonial role.

In [[MMORPG|online computer games]] players form groups called [[Player guild]]s who perform some of the functions of ancient guilds.  They organize group activities, regulate member behavior, exclude non-conforming individuals, and react as a group when member safety or some aspect of guild life is threatened.  In games where fictional &quot;building&quot; is possible they may cooperate on projects in their online world.  The practice was taken from the Guilds in the quasi-medieval settings of the [[role-playing game]] [[Dungeons and Dragons]].  The first computer implementation was in the ground-breaking [[MUD]] [[Avalon, the Legend Lives|Avalon]]. The first graphical online RPG to provide guilds was ''[[Neverwinter Nights#History|Neverwinter Nights]]'', which ran from [[1991]] to [[1997]] on [[AOL]].

'''''Gradius''''' ([[Europe|EU]]:'''Nemesis''') is a [[scrolling shooter|horizontally-scrolling]] [[shoot 'em up]] [[arcade game]] developed by [[Konami]] in [[1985]]. It is the first game in the long-running and popular [[Gradius series|''Gradius'' series]]. ''Gradius'' has the distinction of popularizing a weapon selection bar, based upon collecting power-ups to 'purchase' additional weapons. The game was ported to many systems, most notably the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and the Japanese [[MSX]] computer. ''Gradius'' is considered a highly influential game and has set the foundation for many other horizontal shooters for years to come {{citation needed}}&lt;!-- need a citation for the popularity/weapon selection first claim/influence on the further shooters --&gt;.

==Description==
The player controls the trans-dimensional [[spaceship]] [[Vic Viper]], and must battle waves of enemies through various different environments. Released under the title ''Nemesis'' in some markets, the name ''Gradius'' may be an [[Engrish]] mistranslation of [[Gladius]], [[Latin]] for &quot;sword.&quot;

==Gameplay==
===Weapon system===
When [[gameplay]] begins, the Vic Viper is relatively slow and has only a weak gun. This level of capability is generally insufficient for engaging enemies, but the Vic Viper can gain greater capabilities by collecting and using [[power-up]] items.

While most arcade games utilize distinct power up-items that each correspond to a specific effect on the [[player character]], ''Gradius'' has a single power-up item. The effect of this power-up item is to advance the currently selected item in a power-up menu that appears at the bottom of the screen. When the desired power-up is highlighted, the player can obtain it by pressing the power-up button, returning the menu to its initial state in which no power-up is highlighted.

* '''Speed Up''' &amp;ndash; This power up increases the speed of the Vic Viper's movement; usually needed at the beginning highest per capita incomes on earth, but since 1989 standard of living has declined sharply as the supply and demand has run out. Oil rich states can sustain high GDPs without industrializing, but this high level will not be sustainable past the point that the oil runs out. Economies experiencing an [[asset bubble]], such as a [[housing bubble]] or stock bubble, or a low private saving rate tend appear to grow faster due to higher consumption, mortgaging their futures for present growth.  Environmental degradation at the expense of economic growth can end up costing dearly to clean up, GDP doesn't account for this in places such as China. 
* GDP counts work that produces no net change. For instance, a hurricane destroying thousands of homes would not be counted by GDP, but the rebuilding of those homes would be.   A good recent example would be the aftermath of 2005 Katrina hurricane, which is poised to become the most expensive hurricane in history. GDP would capture the rebuilding activity and suggest a rising living standard, but we're only working toward restoring what was lost for the most part. Therefore, GDP growth would over-estimate the increase in the standard of living. See [[externality|Negative externalities]].
* As a measure of actual sale prices, GDP does not capture the [[economic surplus]] between the price paid and subjective value received.  
* the annual growth of real GDP is adjusted by using the &quot;[[GDP deflator]]&quot;, which tends to underestimate the objective differences in the quality of manufactured output over time. (The deflator is explicitly based on [[subjective]] experience when measuring such things as the consumer benefit received from [[Moore's law|computer-power improvements]] since the early [[1980s]]). Therefore the GDP figure may underestimate the degree to which improving technology and quality-level are increasing the real standard of living.
* Some economists such as [[Herman Daly]] consider GDP to be a poor measure even of ''material well being'', especially in developed countries. They argue that GDP only measures production and consumption, not however the level of [[utility]] people gain from producing and consuming.  This idea is expressed in the theory of [[uneconomic growth]], which states that GDP growth above a certain &quot;economic limit&quot; actually decreases material well being. An extreme example of this is a major war. Historically, GDP growth was often boosted in war time while material living standards fell considerably.
* GDP does not take [[social inequality|inequality]] into account.

Some economists have attempted to create a replacement for GDP called the [[Genuine Progress Indicator]] (GPI), which attempts to address many of the above criticisms.  Many nations calculate a [[national wealth]], a sum of all assets in a nation, but again doesn't account for future obligations such as environmental degradation, asset bubbles, and debt. Other nations such as [[Bhutan]] have advocated [[gross national happiness]] as a standard of living, claiming itself as the world's happiest nation.

'''Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel''' [{{IPA|ˈgeːɔrk ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈfriːdrɪç ˈheːgəl}}] ([[August 27]], [[1770]]&amp;ndash;[[November 14]], [[1831]]) was a [[German people|German]] [[philosopher]] born in [[Stuttgart]], [[Württemberg]], in present-day southwest [[Germany]]. His influence has been widespread on writers of widely varying positions, including both his admirers ([[F. H. Bradley]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]]), and his detractors ([[Kierkegaard]], [[Schopenhauer]], [[Heidegger]]).  He is best known for attempting to elaborate a comprehensive and systematic [[ontology]] from a logical starting point.

==Teachings==
Hegel was fascinated by the works of [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], and by the [[French Revolution]].  Modern philosophy, culture, and society seemed to Hegel fraught with contradictions and tensions, such as those between the subject and object of [[knowledge]], mind and nature, [[Self_%28philosophy%29|self]] and [[Other|other]], freedom and authority, knowledge and faith, the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]]. Hegel's main philosophical project was to take these contradictions and tensions and interpret them as part of a comprehensive, evolving, rational unity that, in different contexts, he called &quot;the absolute idea&quot; or &quot;absolute knowledge&quot;. 

According to Hegel, the main characteristic of this [[unity]] was that it [[evolve]]d through and [[manifest]]ed itself in [[contradiction]] and [[negation]].  Contradiction and negation have a [[dynamic]] quality that at every point in each [[domain]] of [[reality]] &amp;mdash; [[consciousness]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[art]], [[nature]], [[society]] &amp;mdash; leads to further development until a [[rationality|rational]] unity is reached that preserves the contradictions as phases and sub-parts of a larger, evolutionary whole.  This whole is [[mental]] because it is [[mind]] that can comprehend all of these phases and sub-parts as steps in its own process of comprehension.  It is rational because the same, underlying, [[logic]]al, developmental order underlies every domain of reality and is ultimately the order of self-conscious rational thought, although only in the later stages of development does it come to full self-consciousness. The rational, self-conscious [[whole]] is not a thing or [[being]] that lies outside of other existing things or minds.  Rather, it comes to completion only in the philosophical comprehension of individual existing human minds who, through their own understanding, bring this developmental process to an understanding of itself.  

Central to Hegel's [[conception]] of [[knowledge]] and mind (and therefore also of reality) was the notion of [[identity]] in [[difference]], that is that mind [[externalization|externalizes]] itself in various forms and [[object]]s that stand outside of it or opposed to it, and that, through recognizing itself in them, is &quot;with itself&quot; in these external manifestations, so that they are at one and the same time mind and other-than-mind.  This notion of identity in difference, which is intimately bound up with his conception of contradiction and negativity, is a principal feature differentiating Hegel's thought from that of other philosophers.

Many consider Hegel's thought to represent the summit of early 19th century Germany's movement of philosophical [[idealism]]. It would come to have a profound impact on many future philosophical schools, including schools that opposed Hegel's specific dialectical idealism, such as [[Existentialism]], the [[historical materialism]] of [[Karl Marx]], [[historicism]], and [[British idealism|British Idealism]]. At the same time, modern [[Analytic_philosophy|analytic]] and [[Logical_positivism|positivistic]] philosophers have considered Hegel a principal target because of what they consider the [[obscurantism]] of his philosophy (though some Germans, notably Schopenhauer, shared that criticism of his thought).  Hegel was aware of his 'obscurantism' and saw it as part of philosophical thinking that grasps the limitations of everyday thought and concepts and tries to go beyond them.  Hegel wrote in his essay &quot;Who Thinks Abstractly?&quot; that it is not the philosopher who thinks abstractly but the person on the street, who uses concepts as fixed, unchangeable [[given]]s, without any [[context]].  It is the philosopher who thinks concretely, because he or she goes beyond the limits of everyday [[concept]]s and understands their larger context.  This can make philosophical thought and language seem mysterious or obscure to the person on the street.

Hegel influenced [[Kierkegaard]], [[Feuerbach]], [[Marx]], and [[Engels]], although all of them  opposed the most central themes of Hegel's philosophy.  Hegel did not have any influence on the [[German_nationalism|nationalist movement]] in Germany.  After less than a generation, Hegel's philosophy was suppressed and even banned by the [[Prussia]]n [[right-wing]], and was firmly rejected by the [[left-wing]] in multiple official writings.  After the period of [[Bruno Bauer]], Hegel's influence did not make itself felt again until the philosophy of [[British idealism|British Idealism]] and the 20th century Hegelian [[Neo-Marxism]] that began with [[Georg Lukács]].

==Life and work==
Hegel was born in [[Stuttgart]] on [[27 August]], [[1770]].  As a child he was a voracious reader of literature, newspapers, philosophical essays, and writings on various other topics.  In part, Hegel's literate childhood can be attributed to his uncharacteristically progressive mother who actively nurtured her children's intellectual development.  The Hegels were a well-established middle class family in [[Stuttgart]]. His father was a [[civil service|civil servant]] in the administrative government of [[Württemberg]].  Georg was a sickly child and almost died of illness before he was six.  

He received his education at the [[Tübinger Stift]] (seminary of the [[Protestant Church]] in Württemberg), where he was friends with the future philosopher [[Friedrich Schelling]] and the poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin]].  In their shared dislike for what was regarded as the restrictive environment of the [[Tübingen]] seminary, the three became close friends and mutually influenced each other's ideas.  The three watched the unfolding of the [[French Revolution]] and immersed themselves in the emerging criticism of the [[idealist]] philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]]. To be more precise, Hölderlin and Schelling immersed themselves in debates on Kantian philosophy; Hegel's interest only came later, after his own abortive attempts to work out a popular philosophy - which was his original ambition. The Popularphilosophen were writers who introduced and debated issues of the day, a way of promoting the values of the Enlightenment. Most of them were informed by English or Scottish thinkers such as Locke or Reid; Hegel wanted to &quot;complete&quot; the critical philosophy of Kant in the mode of a Popularphilosoph. At Tübingen he was skeptical of the highly theoretical (and technical) discussions that Hölderlin and Schelling engaged in. It was only in 1800 that Hegel admitted the need to resolve the difficulties of the Kantian system before it could hope to be put into practice.

Hegel published only four books during his life: the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (or ''Phenomenology of Mind''), his account of the evolution of consciousness from sense-perception to absolute knowledge, published in [[1807]]; the ''[[Science of Logic]]'', the logical and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] core of his philosophy, in three volumes, published in [[1811]], [[1812]], and [[1816]] (revised 1831); ''[[Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences]]'', a summary of his entire philosophical system, which was originally published in [[1816]] and revised in [[1827]] and [[1830]]; and the ''(Elements of the) Philosophy of Right'', his political philosophy, published in [[1822]]. He also published some articles early in his career and during his Berlin period. A number of other works on the [[philosophy of history]], [[Philosophy_of_religion|religion]], [[aesthetics]], and the [[history of philosophy]] were compiled from the lecture notes of his students and published posthumously.

[[Image:Hegelgrave.jpg|thumb|left|Hegel's Grave in Berlin]]Hegel's works have a reputation for their difficulty, and for the breadth of the topics they attempt to cover. Hegel introduced a system for understanding the [[history of philosophy]] and the world itself, often described as a ''progression in which each successive movement emerges as a solution to the contradictions inherent in the preceding movement''. For example, the [[French Revolution]] for Hegel constitutes the introduction of real [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] into [[Western world|Western societies]] for the first time in recorded history. But precisely because of its absolute novelty, it is also absolutely radical: on the one hand the upsurge of violence required to carry out the revolution cannot cease to be itself, while on the other, it has already consumed its opponent. The revolution therefore has nowhere to turn but onto its own result: the hard-won freedom is consumed by a brutal [[Reign of Terror]]. History, however, progresses by learning from its mistakes: only after and precisely because of this experience can one posit the existence of a [[constitution]]al [[state]] of free citizens, embodying both the benevolent organizing power of rational [[government]] and the revolutionary ideals of freedom and equality.

Hegel's dense and demanding writing style can be difficult to read; he is described by [[Bertrand Russell]] in the ''History of Western Philosophy'' as the single most difficult philosopher to understand.  This is partly because Hegel tried to develop a new form of thinking and logic, which he called &quot;[[speculative reason]]&quot; and which is today popularly called &quot;[[dialectic]],&quot; to try to overcome what he saw as the limitations of both common sense and of traditional philosophy at grasping philosophical problems and the relation between thought and reality.  His work also can be perplexing for modern audiences because he had a [[teleological]] and rationalistic view of human society and history that are at odds with recent intellectual trends.  And for English readers there is the additional challenge posed by the difficulty of translating his terminology and idiom into English.

==Hegel's legacy==
Some of Hegel's writing was intended for those with advanced knowledge of philosophy, although his &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; was intended as a [[textbook]] in a [[university]] [[course (education)|course]]. Nevertheless, like many philosophers, Hegel assumed that his readers would be well-versed in [[Western philosophy]], up to and including [[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]], [[Hume]], [[Kant]], [[Fichte]], and [[Schelling]].  For those wishing to read his work without this background, introductions to Hegel and commentaries about Hegel may suffice. However, even this is hotly debated since the reader must choose from multiple interpretations of Hegel's writings from incompatible schools of philosophy.  Reading Hegel directly would be the best way to learn about Hegel, but this task has historically proved to be beyond the average reader of philosophy. This difficulty may be the most urgent problem with respect to the legacy of Hegel.

One especially difficult aspect of Hegel's work is his innovation in logic.  In response to Immanuel Kant's challenge to the limits of [[Critique of Pure Reason|Pure Reason]], Hegel developed a radically new form of logic, which he called ''speculation'', and which is today popularly called [[dialectic]]s.  The difficulty in reading Hegel was perceived in Hegel's own day, and persists into the 21st century.  To understand Hegel fully requires paying attention to his critique of standard logic, such as the [[law of contradiction]] and the [[law of the excluded middle]], and, whether one accepts or rejects it, at least taking it seriously.  Many philosophers who came after Hegel and were influenced by him, whether adopting or rejecting his ideas, did so without fully absorbing his new speculative or dialectical logic.

===Left and right Hegelianism===
Another confusing aspect about the interpretation of Hegel's work is the fact that past historians have spoken of Hegel's influence as represented by two opposing camps. The [[Right Hegelians]], the allegedly direct disciples of Hegel at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität (now known as the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin]]), advocated a Protestant orthodoxy and the political conservatism of the post-[[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] Restoration period.  The [[Left Hegelians]], also known as the [[Young Hegelians]], interpreted Hegel in a revolutionary sense, leading to an advocation of [[atheism]] in religion and [[liberal democracy]] in politics. 

In more recent studies, however, this old paradigm has been questioned.  For one thing, no Hegelians of the period ever referred to themselves as Right Hegelians.  That was a term of insult that [[David Strauss]] (a self-styled Left Hegelian) hurled at [[Bruno Bauer]] (who has most often been classified by historians as a Left Hegelian, but who rejected both titles for himself).  For another thing, no self-styled &quot;Left Hegelian&quot; described himself as a follower of Hegel.  This includes Karl Marx.  Several &quot;Left Hegelians&quot; openly repudiated or insulted the legacy of Hegel's philosophy.  Even Marx stated that to make Hegel's philosophy useful for his purposes, he had to &quot;turn Hegel upside down.&quot;  Perhaps it is more accurate to say that the so-called &quot;Left Hegelian&quot; movement was actually an anti-Hegelian movement.  

Nevertheless, this historical category continues to persist in modern literature. The critiques of Hegel offered from the &quot;Left Hegelians&quot; led the line of Hegel's thinking into radically new directions&amp;mdash;and form a disproportionately  large part of the literature on and about Hegel.

20th century interpretations of Hegel have been shaped by several schools of thought:  [[British idealism|British Idealism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Marxism]], [[Fascism]] and [[postmodernism]].  Since the fall of the [[USSR]], a new wave of Hegel scholarship has arisen in the West, without the preconceptions of these particular schools of thought.  [[Walter Jaeschke]] and [[Otto Poeggler]] in Germany, as well as [[Peter Hodgson]] and [[Howard Kainz]] in America, are notable in this regard.

===Triads===
In previous modern accounts of Hegelianism (to undergraduate classes, for example), Hegel's dialectic was most often characterized as a three-step process of &quot;[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis]]&quot;, namely, that a &quot;thesis&quot; (e.g. the French Revolution) would cause the creation of its &quot;antithesis&quot; (e.g. the Reign of Terror that followed), and would eventually result in a &quot;synthesis&quot; (e.g. the Constitutional state of free citizens).  However, Hegel used this cll industrial company headquartered in [[Fairfield, Connecticut]]. The company describes itself as composed of a number of primary business units or &quot;businesses.&quot; Each &quot;business&quot; is itself a vast enterprise, any of which would, even as a standalone company, rank in the [[Fortune 500]]. The list of GE businesses varies over time as the result of [[acquisitions]], [[divestiture]]s and [[reorganization]]s.

Through these businesses, GE participates in a wide variety of markets including the generation, transmission and distribution of [[electricity]], [[lighting]], industrial [[automation]], [[medical imaging]] equipment, [[motor]]s, [[railway]] [[locomotive]]s, [[aircraft]] [[jet engine]], [[aviation]] services and materials such as [[plastic]]s, [[silicone]]s and [[abrasive]]s. It was co-founder and is 80% owner (with Vivendi Universal) of [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC Universal]], the National Broadcasting Company. Through GE Commercial Finance, GE Consumer Finance, GE Equipment Services, and GE Insurance it offers a range of financial services as well. It has a presence in over 100 countries.

Interestingly, over half of GE's revenue is derived from [[financial services]], ostensibly making it a financial company with a manufacturing arm. It is also one of the largest lenders in countries other than the United States, such as [[Japan]]. Even though the first wave of conglomerates (such as [[ITT]], [[Ling-Temco-Vought]], [[Tenneco]], etc) fell by the wayside by the mid-[[1980s]], in the late [[1990s]], another wave (consisting of [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]], [[Tyco International|Tyco]], and others) tried and failed to emulate GE's success.

==GE's Brand==
General Electric has one of, if not the, most valuable corporate brand in the world. CEO [[Jeffrey Immelt]] had the new [[brand]] commissioned in [[2004]], after he took the reigns as chairman, in order to unify all the diversified businesses of GE. The brand included a change of the corporate color palette, small modifications to the [[GE Logo]], a new customized font, called [[GE Inspira]], and a new slogan, &quot;imagination at work&quot;. The new brand requires many headlines to be lowercased and adds visual &quot;white space&quot; to their documents and advertising to promote an open and approachable company. The new brand was designed by [[Wolff Olins]] and can be seen on GE's corporate website. GE BrandCentral[http://www.gebrandcentral.com] is a website dedicated to managing the brand and requests for font and logo usage. Unfortunately, it is closed to the public.

==Jack Welch==
The [[CEO]] from [[1981]]-[[2001]] was [[Jack Welch]], who many regard as one of the premier business [[managers]] of his era. Nicknamed &quot;Neutron Jack&quot;, he presided over a 28-fold increase in [[earnings]] (on a 5-fold increase in [[revenue]]) with his policy (referred to by detractors as &quot;[[rank and yank]]&quot;) of sacking the worst performing 10% of his staff every year. In running GE's many diverse businesses he maintained a policy of only keeping those businesses which were #1 or #2 within their respective industries. In [[1987]], GE was the United States' second largest [[nuclear power]] company and third largest producer of [[nuclear weapons systems]]. Jack Welch introduced the use of the [[six sigma]] [[quality system]], originally developed at [[Motorola]], within GE.

==Corporate information==
The company's [[market capitalization]] ([http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GE]) is almost $100 billion higher than that of [[Microsoft]] ([http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=msft]). In [[2004]], GE was named number one company for employers and employees on the [[Forbes]] 500 Global Player list.

Jeffrey Immelt succeeded Jack Welch as CEO of General Electric and holds that office today. Current members of the [[board of directors]] of General Electric are: [[James Cash, Jr.]], Sir [[William Castell]] (Deputy Chairman, and Executive Officer), [[Dennis Dammerman]], [[Ann Fudge]], [[Claudio Gonzalez]], [[Jeffrey Immelt]], [[Andrea Jung]], [[A.G. Lafley]], [[Robert Lane (businessman)|Robert Lane]], [[Ralph Larsen]], [[Rochelle Lazarus]], [[Sam Nunn]], [[Roger Penske]], [[Robert Swieringa]], [[Douglas Warner]], and [[Bob Wright]].

== Superfund Sites ==

General Electric has agreed to pay the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] $110 million dollars in order to clean up three [[superfund]] sites contaminated with [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs).  The three superfund sites are composed of a 200 mile stretch along the [[Hudson River]], a section of the [[Housatonic River]] in [[Pittsfield]], MA and a transformer facility near [[Rome]], GA.  General Electric had initially spent $120 million between 1990 and 2005 with public relations and lobbying firms in order to fight responsibility for cleanup costs.[http://www.odwyerpr.com/members/0111ge.htm]

'''George Harrison''', [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] ([[February 24]], [[1943]] &amp;ndash; [[November 29]], [[2001]]) was a popular [[United Kingdom|British]] [[guitarist]], [[singer]], [[songwriter]], [[record producer]], and [[film producer]], best known as a member of [[The Beatles]]. 

Harrison was the [[lead guitar]]ist of The Beatles. During the band’s extremely successful career, [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]] were its main songwriters. However, Harrison usually wrote and sang lead on one or two songs per album, including the popular &quot;[[If I Needed Someone]]&quot;, &quot;[[Taxman]]&quot;, &quot;[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]&quot;, &quot;[[Here Comes the Sun]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Something (song)|Something]]&quot;. 

During the era of the Beatles, Harrison also became attracted to [[Music of India|Indian music]] and [[Hinduism]], sparking unprecedented interest in them in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. Both would subsequently play a prominent role in Harrison’s life and music. 

Harrison also had an uneven but sometimes very successful solo career after the break-up of The Beatles, scoring major hits with &quot;[[My Sweet Lord]]&quot; (1970), &quot;[[Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)]]&quot; (1973), &quot;[[All Those Years Ago]]&quot; (1981), and &quot;[[Got My Mind Set on You]]&quot; (1987). He also organized the first large-scale charity concert, ''[[The Concert For Bangladesh]]'', which took place on [[August 1]], [[1971]]. Harrison was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a solo artist in 2004.

Harrison was also a [[film producer]] and founded [[Handmade Films]] in 1979. The company's films include [[Monty Python]]’s ''[[The Life of Brian]],'' ''[[Time Bandits]]'', ''[[Withnail and I]]'', and ''[[Mona Lisa (movie)|Mona Lisa]]''. Harrison also has a cameo role in the Beatles parody film ''[[All You Need Is Cash|The Rutles]]''.

==Early years==
George Harrison was born in [[Liverpool]], [[England]] in 1943. His sister has said that their mother wrote in her diary that he was born ten minutes after midnight on [[February 25]], though Harrison subsequently claimed that he had, in fact, been born on [[February 24]] at 11:40 PM.  His full name is often given as &quot;George Harold Harrison,&quot; but this is incorrect.  Harrison had no middle name, as one can see on his birth certificate.  Harold was his father's name.

Harrison’s childhood home is located at [[12 Arnold Grove]]. He first attended school at [[Dovedale Infants]], just off [[Penny Lane]]. Later on, he attended the [[Liverpool Institute for Boys]] (now the [[Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts]]), a &quot;smart school&quot;, but was regarded as a poor student, and contemporaries described him as someone who would &quot;sit alone in the corner&quot;. In the mid-1950s he knew [[Paul McCartney]] (also a Liverpool Institute student) and beginning in February 1958 played lead [[guitar]] in the band (initially called [[The Quarry Men]]) that eventually became The Beatles.

In 1959, Harrison worked briefly as an apprentice electrician at [[Blacklers Stores]] in [[Liverpool]]. The training helped, and Harrison became the member who knew the most about rigging their sound equipment. Later he set up his own [[multitrack recording]] gear at his Esher home, [[Kinfauns]], making [[demo (music)|song demos]] for himself and The Beatles.

==Role in The Beatles==
Harrison was a fluent, inventive and highly accomplished lead and rhythm guitarist, whose influences included [[Chuck Berry]], [[Carl Perkins]] and [[Chet Atkins]]. Although he was a creative soloist, several of his famous Beatles guitar solos were recorded under specific directions from Paul McCartney, who on occasion demanded that Harrison play what he envisioned virtually note-for-note. Other Harrison solos were directed or modified by producer [[George Martin]], who also vetoed several of Harrison's song and instrument offerings; Martin admitted years later, &quot;I was always rather beastly to George.&quot;

During the era of [[Beatlemania]], Harrison was characterized as the &quot;Quiet Beatle&quot;, noted for his introspective manner and his tendency not to speak in press conferences. He studied situations and people closely, though, and was the most interested of any Beatle in the band's finances, often quizzing [[Brian Epstein]] about them. He could also wisecrack as well as anyone in the band; when a reporter asked what they did in their hotel suite between shows, Harrison told him &quot;We [[ice skating|ice-skate]].&quot; He also gave the '[[Beatle haircut]]' a formal name: &quot;Arthur!&quot;
[[Image:PDGeorge Harrison.jpg|right|thumb|Harrison in the early 1960s]]
Harrison wrote his first song, &quot;[[Don't Bother Me]]&quot;, during a sick day in 1963, as an exercise &quot;to see if I ''could'' write a song&quot;, as he remembered. &quot;Don't Bother Me&quot; appeared on the second Beatles album (''[[With the Beatles]]'') late that year, on ''[[Meet the Beatles!]]'' in the US in early 1964, and also in ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]''. Harrison was usually allotted only one original song per album, the break coming in 1966, when three Harrison songs appeared on ''[[Revolver (album)|Revolver]]''.

A turning point in Harrison's career came during an American tour in 1965, when his friend [[David Crosby]] of [[The Byrds]] introduced him to Indian classical music and the work of [[sitar]] maestro [[Ravi Shankar (musician)|Ravi Shankar]]. Harrison quickly became fascinated with the instrument, immersed himself in Indian music and was pivotal in popularizing the sitar in particular and Indian music in general in the West. Buying a sitar himself as the Beatles came back from a Far East tour, he became the first western popular musician to play one on a pop record &quot;[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]&quot;. He championed Shankar with western audiences, and was largely responsible for having him included on the bill at the [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey International Pop Festival]] in June 1967. Shankar didn't admire Harrison's first Indian-influenced efforts, but the two became friends, and Harrison began his first formal musical studies with Shankar.

A personal turning point for Harrison came during the filming of the movie ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', on location in the [[Bahamas]], when a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] devotee presented each Beatle with a book about [[reincarnation]]. Harrison’s interest in Indian culture expanded to his embracing [[Hinduism]]. A pilgrimage with wife Pattie to the [[Republic of India]], where Harrison studied sitar, met several gurus and visited various holy places, filled the months between the end of the final Beatles tour in 1966 and the commencement of the ''Sgt. Pepper'' sessions. Ironically though, it was through Pattie (and back in England) that George met [[Maharishi]] [[Mahesh Yogi]], who introduced the Beatles, their wives and girlfriends to [[Transcendental Meditation]]. While they parted company with the Maharishi months afterwards, Harrison continued his pursuit of [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern]] [[spirituality]].

In the summer of 1969, he produced the single &quot;[[Hare Krishna Mantra]]&quot;, performed by Harrison with the devotees of the London [[Radha]]-[[Krishna]] Temple, that topped the 10 best-selling record charts throughout UK, Europe, and Asia. That same year, he and fellow Beatle John Lennon met [[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]], Founder-[[acharya]] of the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON). Soon after, Harrison embraced the Hare Krishna tradition (particularly ''japa-yoga'' chanting with beads; a meditation technique similar to the [[Catholic]] [[rosary]]), and remained associated with it until his death. When during his lifetime, Harrison bequeathed to ISKCON his [[Letchmore Heath]] mansion (renamed [http://chantandbehappy.com/manorvirtual/ Bhaktivedanta Manor]) north of London, he redoubled speculations that he would leave ISKCON a large sum in his will; in fact, he left nothing to the organization. [http://www.newsindia-times.com/2002/12/13/intl-top14.html].

Harrison formed a close friendship with [[Eric Clapton]] in the late 1960s and they co-wrote the song &quot;[[Badge (song)|Badge]]&quot;, which was released on [[Cream (band)|Cream's]] farewell album in [[1969 in music|1969]].  This song was the basis for Harrison's composition for The Beatles' ''[[Abbey Road (album)|Abbey Road]]'' album, &quot;[[Here Comes the Sun]]&quot;, which was written in Clapton's back garden. 

Friction between Harrison and McCartney increased markedly during the recording of the ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]'', with Harrison threatening to leave the group on several occasions. The tension between Harrison and McCartney can be clearly seen in several scenes in the ''[[Let It Be (film)|Let It Be]]'' documentary film and relations became so strained during the making of the film that Harrison briefly quit the band.

Harrison's songwriting improved greatly through the years, and his material gradually earned respect from both his fellow Beatles (with Lennon telling McCartney during 1969 &quot;George's songs this year are at least as good as ours&quot;) and the public. Nonetheless, he later said that he always had difficulty getting the band to record his songs.

Notable Harrison compositions from The Beatles' oeuvre include: the intricate &quot;[[If I Needed Someone]]&quot;; &quot;[[I Want to Tell You]]&quot;; the Indian-influenced &quot;[[Love You To]]&quot;; the acerbic &quot;[[Taxman]]&quot; (later referenced in [[Cheap Trick]]'s &quot;Taxman, Mr. Thief&quot; and [[The Jam]]'s &quot;Start&quot;); the much-maligned &quot;[[Within You Without You]]&quot;; &quot;[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]&quot;, which was strongly influenced by the music of his friend [[Roy Orbison]] and featured a guitar solo by his close friend Eric Clapton; and &quot;[[Piggies]]&quot;, which later featured inadvertently in the notorious [[Charles Manson]] murder case (as did McCartney's &quot;[[Helter Skelter]]&quot; actually about a fairground ride). 

&quot;[[Something (song)|Something]]&quot; and &quot;[[Here Comes the Sun]]&quot; are probably his two best-known Beatles songs. &quot;Something&quot; is considered one of his very best works, and was even covered by [[Elvis Presley]] and  [[Frank Sinatra]], who famously deemed it &quot;the greatest love song of the last 50 years.&quot; At the same time, &quot;Something&quot; serves as a supreme example of Harrison's lack of recognition as a songwriter - Frank Sinatra once called it his &quot;favorite Lennon-McCartney tune.&quot; His increasing productivity, coupled with his difficulties in getting The Beatles to record his music, meant that by the end of the group's career he had amassed a considerable stockpile of unreleased material.

When asked years later what kind of music The Beatles might have made if they'd stayed together, his answer was to the point: &quot;The solo stuff that we've done would have been on Beatle albums.&quot; Harrison, Lennon and McCartney had always largely written apart; on one level, breaking up for each was merely a change of collaborators.

==1970s==
After the Beatles split in 1970, Harrison released a number of albums that were critically and commercially successful, both as solo projects and as a member of other groups.  After years of being limited in his contributions to the Beatles, he released a large number of the songs he had stockpiled in the first major solo work released after the breakup, ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', the first triple album by a single artist in rock history. It included the number one hit single &quot;[[My Sweet Lord]]&quot;, although Harrison was later sued for [[copyright infringement]] over the supposed similarities to the 1963 [[The Chiffons|Chiffons]] single &quot;[[He's So Fine]]&quot;. Harrison denied deliberately stealing the song, but he did lose in court during 1976; in the ruling, the court accepted the possibility that Harrison had &quot;unconsciously copied&quot; the Chiffons melody as the basis for his own song. Disputes over damages dragged on into the 1990s, with manager [[Allen Klein]] changing sides by buying [[Bright Tunes]], which published &quot;He's So Fine&quot;, and continuing the suit after parting with Harrison, and Harrison ultimately winding up as the owner of both songs.
[[Image:BanglaDeshCover.jpg|right|thumb|The Concert for Bangaldesh]]
Harrison was probably the first modern musician to organize a major [[charity]] concert. His [[Concert for Bangladesh]] on [[August 1]], [[1971]], drew over 40,000 people to two shows in [[New York City|New York's]] [[Madison Square Garden]] with the intention of aiding the starving refugees from the war in [[Bangladesh]]. [[Ravi Shankar (musician)|Ravi Shankar]] opened the proceedings, which included other popular musicians such as [[Bob Dylan]] (who rarely appeared live in the early 1970s), [[Eric Clapton]] who made his first public appearance in months (due to a heroin addiction, begun as [[Derek and the Dominos]] broke up), [[Leon Russell]], [[Badfinger]], [[Billy Preston]] and fellow Beatle [[Ringo Starr]]. Unfortunately, tax troubles and questionable expenses tied up many of the concert's proceeds. ([http://www.theconcertforbangladesh.com/ Apple Corps] recently released a newly arranged concert DVD and CD on October 25, 2005 in the USA, and October 24 in the rest of the world. The DVD and CD contains additional material (such as previously unreleased rehearsal footage of &quot;If Not For You&quot; featuring Harrison and Dylan), and all artists' sales royalties continue to go to [[UNICEF]].)

In addition to his own works, during this time Harrison wrote and/or produced several hits for Ringo Starr (&quot;It Don't Come Easy&quot;, &quot;Photograph&quot;) and also appeared on tracks by John Lennon (&quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot;), [[Harry Nilsson]] (&quot;You're Breakin' My Heart&quot;), [[Badfinger]] (&quot;Day After Day&quot;), [[Billy Preston]] (&quot;That's The Way God Planned It&quot;) and [[Cheech &amp; Chong]] (&quot;Basketball Jones&quot;).

Harrison's next album was ''[[Living in the Material World]]'' in 1973.  &quot;Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)&quot; was a big hit, and &quot;[[Sue Me Sue You Blues]]&quot; was a window into the former Beatles' miserable legal travails, but overall the record was seen as too overtly religious.  

In 1974 Harrison released ''[[Dark Horse (album)|Dark Horse]]'' and at the same time launched a major tour of the United States which was subsequently criticised for its long opening act of Ravi Shankar &amp; Friends, Harrison's hoarse voice, and his frequent preaching to the audience. It was during this period while in LA preparing for the 1974 tour that he also opened offices for his new [[Dark Horse Records]] on the [[A&amp;M Records]] lot on La Brea Avenue in Los Angeles. It was in those offices that he met a beautiful young woman by the name of Olivia Trinidad Arias who was assigned to work at his label with [[Terry Doran]] from Apple and Jack Oliver who came over from London to run Dark Horse Records. The relationship progressed during the rehearsals and Olivia joined George on his 1974 tour during which their relationship blossomed into something more resulting in her permanent rfficient]] is a [[number]] between 0 and 1, where 0 corresponds with perfect equality (where everyone has the same income) and 1 corresponds with perfect inequality (where one person has all the income, and everyone else has zero income). The '''Gini index''' is the Gini coefficient expressed in [[percentage]] form, and is equal to the Gini coefficient multiplied by 100.

While the Gini coefficient is mostly used to measure income inequality, it can also be used to measure [[wealth]] [[Wealth condensation|inequality.]] This use requires that no one has a negative net wealth.

== Calculation ==
[[Image:Economics_Gini_coefficient.png|frame|right|Graphical representation of the Gini coefficient]]

The Gini coefficient is calculated as a [[ratio]] of the areas on the [[Lorenz curve]] diagram. If the area between the line of perfect equality and Lorenz curve is A, and  the area underneath the Lorenz curve is B, then the Gini coefficient is A/(A+B).  This ratio is expressed as a percentage or as the numerical equivalent of that percentage, which is always a number between 0 and 1. 

The Gini coefficient is often calculated with the more practical Brown Formula shown below:

&lt;math&gt;G = | 1 - \sum_{k=1}^{n} (X_{k} - X_{k-1}) (Y_{k} + Y_{k-1}) |&lt;/math&gt;

G: Gini coefficient&lt;br&gt;
X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;: cumulated proportion of the population variable, for k = 0,...,n, with X&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 1&lt;br&gt;
Y&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;: cumulated proportion of the income variable, for k = 0,...,n, with Y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 1&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br clear=&quot;both&quot; /&gt;

The small sample variance properties of G are not known, and large sample approximations to the variance of G are poor. In order for G to be an unbiased estimate of the true population value, it should be multiplied by n/(n-1).

&lt;br clear=&quot;both&quot; /&gt;
While most developed European nations tend to have Gini coefficients between 0.24 and 0.36, the United States Gini coefficient is above 0.4, indicating that the United States has greater inequality. Using the Gini can help quantify differences in [[welfare]] and [[living wage|compensation]] policies and philosophies. However it should be borne in mind that the Gini coefficient can be misleading when used to make political comparisons between large and small countries (see [[Gini coefficient#Disadvantages of the Gini coefficient as a measure of inequality|criticisms]] section).

[[Image:Gini_since_WWII.gif|thumb|right|600px|Gini coefficients over time for selected countries]]

=== Development of Gini coefficients in the US over time ===
Gini coefficients for the [[United States of America|United States]] at various times, according to the [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]]:

*[[1970]]: 0.394
*[[1980]]: 0.403
*[[1990]]: 0.428
*[[2000]]: 0.462 {{ref|USAginicalc}}

==Advantages of the Gini coefficient as a measure of inequality==
* The Gini coefficient's main advantage is that it is a measure of inequality, not a measure of average income or some other variable which is unrepresentative of most of the population, such as [[gross domestic product]].

* Gini coefficients can be used to compare income distributions across different population sectors as well as countries, for example the Gini coefficient for urban areas differs from that of rural areas in many countries (though the United States' urban and rural Gini coefficients are nearly identical).

* The Gini coefficient is sufficiently simple that it can be compared across countries and be easily interpreted.  GDP statistics are often criticised as they do not represent changes for the whole population, the Gini coefficient demonstrates how income has changed for poor and rich.  If the Gini coefficient is rising as well as GDP, poverty may not be improving for the vast majority of the population.

* The Gini coefficient can be used to indicate how the distribution of income has changed within a country over a period of time, thus it is possible to see if inequality is increasing or decreasing. 

* The Gini coefficient satisfies four important principles:
**''Anonymity'': it doesn’t matter who the high and low earners are.
**''Scale independence'': the Gini coefficient does not consider the size of the economy, the way it is measured, or whether it is a rich or poor country on average.
**''Population independence'': it does not matter how large the population of the country is.
**''Transfer principle'': if income (less than the difference), is transferred from a rich person to a poor person the resulting distribution is more equal.

==Disadvantages of the Gini coefficient as a measure of inequality==
* The Gini coefficient measured for a large geographically diverse country will generally result in a much higher coefficient than each of its regions has individually. For this reason the scores calculated for individual countries within the E.U. are difficult to compare with the score of the entire U.S. 

* Comparing income distributions among countries may be difficult because benefits systems may differ.  For example, some countries give benefits in the form of money while others use [[food stamps]], which may not be counted as income in the Lorenz curve and therefore not taken into account in the Gini coefficient.

* The measure will give different results when applied to individuals instead of households. When different populations are not measured with consistent definitions, comparison is not meaningful.

* The Lorenz curve may understate the actual amount of inequality if richer households are able to use income more efficiently than lower income households. From another point of view, measured inequality may be the result of more or less efficient use of household incomes.

* As for all statistics, there will be systematic and random errors in the data. The meaning of the Gini coefficient decreases as the data become less accurate.  Also, countries may collect data differently, making it difficult to compare statistics between countries.

* Economies with similar incomes and Gini coefficients can still have very different income distributions. This is because the Lorenz curves can have different shapes and yet still yield the same Gini coefficient. As an extreme example, an economy where half the households have no income, and the other half share income equally has a Gini coefficient of &amp;frac12;; but an economy with complete income equality, except for one wealthy household that has half the total income, also has a Gini coefficient of &amp;frac12;.

* It is claimed that the Gini coefficient is more sensitive to the income of the middle classes than to that of the extremes.

* Too often only the Gini coefficient is quoted '''without''' describing the proportions of the quantiles used for measurement. As with other inequality coefficients, the Gini coefficient is influenced by the granularity of the measurements. For example, five 20% quantiles (low granularity) will yield a lower Gini coefficient than twenty 5% quantiles (high granularity) taken from the same distribution.

As one result of this criticism, additionally to or in competition with the Gini coefficient ''entropy measures'' are frequently used (e.g. the Atkinson and [[Theil Index|Theil]] indices).  These measures attempt to compare the distribution of resources by intelligent players in the market with a maximum [[information entropy|entropy]] [[random distribution]], which would occur if these players acted like non-intelligent particles in a closed system following the laws of statistical physics.

== Notes ==
*{{note|USAginicalc}} Note that the calculation of the index for the United States was changed in 1992, resulting in an upwards shift of about 0.02 in the coefficient.  Comparisons before and after that period may be misleading.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[intelligence agency]] responsible for providing [[signals intelligence]] (SIGINT) and [[information assurance]]. GCHQ provides the UK government and armed forces with signals intelligence as required under the guidance of the [[Joint Intelligence Committee]] in support of government policies. The '''Communications-Electronics Security Group (CESG)''' is the branch of GCHQ which works to secure the communications and information systems of government and critical parts of UK national infrastructure.

GCHQ was previously known as the '''Government Code and Cipher School (GC&amp;CS)''' before [[1946]].

GCHQ is the responsibility of the UK [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]].

==Government Code and Cipher School (GC&amp;CS)==
In early 1919, twenty-five officers from the wartime [[signals intelligence]] organisations of the Navy ([[Room 40]]) and the Army ([[MI1b]]) were merged into a single agency, the Government Code and Cipher School (GC&amp;CS) (a cover-name chosen by Victor Forbes of the [[Foreign Office]])&lt;ref&gt;Macksey, 2003, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Alastair Denniston]] was appointed the operational head with the title of Deputy Director. Initially, GC&amp;CS was under the control of the [[Admiralty]], but later, with its focus on diplomatic traffic, was placed under the control of the [[Foreign Office]] in [[1922]].

In the 1920s, GC&amp;CS was successfully reading Soviet Union diplomatic ciphers. However, the British government made details from the decrypts public prompting the Soviet to change their systems to more secure schemes, including the [[one-time pad]], in [[1927]].

Before [[World War II]], GC&amp;CS was a relatively small department, and staff included [[Alastair Denniston]], [[Oliver Strachey]], [[Dilly Knox]], [[John Tiltman]], [[Edward Travis]], [[Ernst Fetterlein]], [[Josh Cooper]] and [[Hugh Foss]].

During the [[Second World War]], GC&amp;CS was based largely at [[Bletchley Park]], reading German [[Enigma machine]] ciphers amongst a large number of other systems. In [[1940]], GC&amp;CS were working on the diplomatic codes and ciphers of 26 countries, tackling over 150 diplomatic cryptosystems&lt;!--David Alvarez, GC&amp;CS and American Diplomatic Cryptanalysis --&gt;.

GC&amp;CS was renamed the &quot;Government Communications Headquarters&quot; in June 1946&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1998, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;.

==After World War II==
GCHQ was at first based in [[London]], but in [[1953]]{{fact}} moved to the outskirts of [[Cheltenham]], setting up two sites there - Oakley and Benhall. It was not officially avowed until [[1983]].  The following year GCHQ was the centre of a political row when the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] prohibited its employees from joining a [[Trade Union]]. It was claimed that joining such a union would be in conflict with [[national security]].  The ban was eventually lifted by the incoming [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government in [[1997]].

==Post Cold War==
Since [[1994]], GCHQ activities have been subject to scrutiny by Parliament's [[Intelligence and Security Committee]].

Post-[[Cold War]], the aims of GCHQ were set out by the [[UK Intelligence Services Act of 1994|Intelligence Services Act]] (1994). 

At the end of 2003, GCHQ moved to a new 'doughnut' shaped HQ, at the time the second largest public sector building project in Europe with an estimated cost of £337 million&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designbuild-network.com/projects/gchq/]&lt;/ref&gt;. The new building is the base for all of GCHQ's [[Cheltenham]] operations. 

GCHQ gains its intelligence by monitoring a wide variety of communications and other electronic signals. For this a number of stations have been established in the UK and overseas which are run by the Composite Signals Organisation for GCHQ. The Composite Signals Organisation Station, at Morwenstow near [[Bude]], [[Cornwall]] is directly subordinate to GCHQ. The listening stations are at Cheltenham itself, GCHQ CSO Morwenstow, GCHQ CSO [[Ascension Island]], with the Americans at [[Menwith Hill]], and the [[Columbia Annex]] (CANX).

In addition to SIGINT, GCHQ provides assistance to Government Departments on their own communications security. This task is given to the '''Communications-Electronics Security Group (CESG)''' of GCHQ. CESG is the [[United Kingdom|UK]] national technical authority for [[information assurance]], including [[cryptography]]. CESG does not manufacture security equipment, but works with industry to ensure the availability of suitable products and services, while GCHQ itself can fund research into such areas, for example to the [[Centre for Quantum Computing]] at [[Oxford University]].

==ECHELON==
GCHQ, in combination with the equivalent agencies in the [[United States]] ([[NSA]]), [[Canada]] ([[Communications Security Establishment]]) and [[Australia]] ([[Defence Signals Directorate]]) and otherwise known as the [[UKUSA]] group, is believed to be responsible for, among other things, the operation of the [[ECHELON]] system. Its capabilities are suspected to include the ability to monitor a large proportion of the world's transmitted civilian telephone, fax and data traffic.

The public spotlight fell on GCHQ in late 2003 and early 2004 following the sacking of [[Katharine Gun]] after she leaked a confidential email from agents at the American [[National Security Agency]] to GCHQ agents about the wire-tapping of UN delegates in the run-up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 Iraq war]].

==GCHQ and the constitution==
GCHQ actually determined the scope of judicial review on prerogative (residual powers from common law) in a very controversial case. This occurred in &quot;Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service [1985] AC 347&quot;. In this case, a prerogative order in council was used by the Prime minister to ban trade union activities by civil servants working at GCHQ. This order was issued without consultation. The House of Lords had to decide whether this was reviewable by Judicial Review. It was held that executive action is not immune from Judicial Review because it is carried out in the pursuit of power derived from common law. (i.e. prerogative is reviewable). Controversially, they also held that though the failure to consult was unfair, it was overriden by concerns of national security.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Francis-Gary-Powers model nasm.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Francis Gary Powers with a model of the U-2.]]
'''Francis Gary Powers''' ([[August 17]], [[1929]] &amp;ndash; [[August 1]], [[1977]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[Aviator|pilot]] whose [[Lockheed U-2|U-2 spy plane]] was shot down while over the [[Soviet Union]], thus causing the [[U-2 Crisis of 1960]].

He was born in [[Jenkins, Kentucky]] and was raised in [[Pound, Virginia]], on the [[Virginia]]-[[Kentucky]] border. After graduating from Milligan College in Eastern [[Tennessee]], Gary enlisted in the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] in [[1950]]. Upon completing his training (52-H) he was assigned to the 468th Strategic Fighter Squadron at Turner Air Force Base, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as an [[F-84 Thunderjet]] pilot. He was assigned to operations in the [[Korean War]], but (according to his son) was recruited by the [[CIA]] because of his outstanding record in single engine [[jet aircraft]], soon after recovering from an illness. He left the Air Force with the rank of [[captain]] in [[1956]], to join the CIA [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] program.

U-2 pilots  carried out [[espionage]] missions over hostile countries including the [[Soviet Union]], systematically photographing military installations and other important intelligence targets. Powers' U-2, which was stationed at [[Incirlik Air Base]], [[Turkey]], was shot down by a [[surface-to-air missile]]  on [[1 May]] [[1960]] over [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]]; he was convicted of espionage against the Soviet Union and sentenced to 3 years imprisonment and 7 years of hard labor. However, on [[10 February]] [[1962]], twenty-one months after his capture, he was exchanged along with American student [[Frederic Pryor]] in a spy swap for Soviet [[KGB]] [[Colonel]] [[Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher|Vilyam Fisher]] (aka [[Rudolf Abel]]) at the [[Glienicke bridge]] in [[Potsdam]], [[Germany]].

[[Image:U2 Powers Senate model.jpg|thumb|right|Wooden U-2 model - one of two used by Powers when he testified to the Senate Committee. The wings and tail are detachable to demonstrate the aircraft's breakup upon impact.]]

On his return to the U.S., Powers was criticized for having failed to activate his aircraft's [[self-destruct]] charge to destroy the [[camera]], [[photographic film]], and related [[classified information|classified]] parts of his aircraft before capture. In addition, others criticized him for deciding not to use an optional CIA-issued [[suicide]] pin. This pin, which was concealed in a hollowed out [[silver dollar]], could be used to avoid pain and suffering in case of [[torture]]. After being debriefed extensively by the CIA, Lockheed, and the USAF, on [[6 March]] [[1962]] he appeared before a Senate Armed Services Select Committee hearing chaired by Senator [[Richard Russell, Jr.|Richard Russell]] and including Senators [[Prescott Bush]] and [[Barry Goldwater]], Sr. During the proceeding it was determined ggered the modern era of vehicles. For the first time everyone could own a car, the downside was that every Model T produced after 1913, (the year the assembly line was created) was painted black because the paint dried a lot faster than any other color. The Model T was a very simple car, as simple as it could be made. But that's what made it unique. Henry Ford's assembly line turned the Ford Motor Company into a giant (and eventually became a tool for every other industry). By 1928, there were about 30 million cars world wide. Half of these were Ford Model Ts.

=== The Model A and later ===
By 1926, flagging sales of the Model T convinced Henry of what Edsel had been suggesting for some time: a new model was necessary. The elder Ford pursued the project with a great deal of technical expertise in design of the engine, chassis, and other mechanical necessities, while leaving it to his son to develop the body design. Edsel also managed to prevail over his father's initial objections in the inclusion of a sliding-shift transmission. The result was the highly successful [[Ford Model A]], introduced December, 1927 and produced through 1931, with a total output of over four million automobiles. Subsequently, the company adopted an annual model change system similar to that in use by automakers today.

During the thirties, Ford also overcame his objection to finance companies, and the Ford-owned Universal Credit Company became a major car financing operation.

Henry Ford long had an interest in [[plastic]]s developed from agricultural products, especially [[soybean]]s. Soybean-based plastics were used in Ford automobiles throughout the 1930s in plastic parts such as car horns, in paint, etc. This project culminated in 1942, when, on [[January 13]], Ford patented an automobile made almost entirely of plastic, attached to a tubular welded frame. It weighed 30% less than a standard car of the same size, and was said to be able to withstand blows ten times greater than could steel. Furthermore, it ran on grain alcohol ([[ethanol]]) instead of gasoline.  Unfortunately, the design never caught on.

===Death of Edsel===
On [[May 26]], [[1943]], Edsel Ford died, leaving a vacancy in the company presidency. Henry Ford advocated long-time associate [[Harry Bennett]] to take the spot. Edsel's widow Eleanor, who had inherited Edsel's voting stock, wanted her son [[Henry Ford II]] to take over the position. The issue was settled for a period when Henry himself, at the age of 79, took over the presidency personally. Henry Ford II was released from the Navy and became an executive vice president, while Harry Bennett had a seat on the board and was responsible for personnel, labor relations, and public relations.

The company saw hard times during the next two years, losing $10 million a month. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] considered a federal bailout for Ford Motor Company so that wartime production could continue. By 1945, Henry Ford's senility was quite evident, and his wife and daughter-in-law forced his resignation in favor of his grandson, Henry Ford II.

=== Ford's labor philosophy ===
Henry Ford had very specific thoughts on relations with his employees. On [[January 5]], [[1914]] Ford announced his five-dollar a day program. The program called for a reduction in length of the workday from 9 to 8 hours and a raise in minimum daily pay from $2.34 to $5 for qualifying workers. Ford labeled the increased compensation as profit sharing rather than wages. The wage was offered to men over the age of 22, who had worked at the company for 6 months or more, and, importantly, conducted their lives in a manner of which Ford approved. The company established a Sociological Department complete with 150 investigators and support staff in order to verify this last point. Even with these requirements, a large percentage of workers were able to qualify for the profit sharing. 

In 1926, Ford instituted the five-day, forty-hour work-week, effectively inventing the modern [[weekend]]. In granting workers an extra day off, Ford ensured leisure time for the working class. The &quot;short week,&quot; as Ford called it in a contemporary interview, was required so that the country could &quot;absorb its production and stay prosperous.&quot;

Conversely, Ford was adamantly against [[labor union]]s in his plants. To forestall union activity, he promoted [[Harry Bennett]], a former Navy boxer, to be the head of the Service Department. Bennett employed various intimidation tactics to squash union organizing.  The most famous incident, in 1937, was a bloody brawl between company security men and organizers that became known as [[The Battle of the Overpass]].  

Ford was the last Detroit automaker to recognize the [[United Auto Workers]] union (UAW). A sit-down strike by the UAW union on [[April 2]], [[1941]] closed the [[River Rouge Plant]]. Under pressure from Edsel and his wife, Clara, Henry Ford finally agreed to [[collective bargaining]] at Ford plants, and the first contract with the UAW was signed in June 1941.

==Common misconceptions==
Henry Ford is sometimes credited with the invention of the automobile, generally attributed to [[Karl Benz]], and the assembly line, invented by [[Ransom E. Olds]].  Ford's employees did develop the first moving assembly line based on conveyor belts. Popular culture lends support to such misconceptions.

== Anti-Semitism and ''The Dearborn Independent'' == 
[[Image:1920 International Jew reprint from Dearborn Independent.jpg|thumb|''The International Jew, the World's Foremost Problem''. Articles from ''The Dearborn Independent'', 1920]]

Henry Ford began publication of a newspaper, ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'', in 1919. The paper ran for eight years, during which it republished &quot;[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion]],&quot; which has since been discredited as an [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] [[forgery]]. The [[American Jewish Historical Society]] describes the ideas presented in it as &quot;[[anti-immigrant]], anti-labor, anti-liquor, and anti-Semitic&quot;.

On [[February 17]], [[1921]], the [[New York World]] published an interview with Ford, in which he said &quot;''The only statement I care to make about the Protocols is that they fit in with what is going on. They are sixteen years old, and they have fitted the world situation up to this time. They fit it now.''&quot;

The ''Independent'' also published, in Ford's name, several anti-Jewish articles which were released in the early 1920s as a set of four bound volumes, cumulatively titled &quot;The International Jew, the World's Foremost Problem.&quot;  These volumes were distributed through Ford's car dealerships.  Denounced by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), the articles nevertheless explicitly condemned [[pogrom]]s and violence against Jews (Volume 4, Chapter 80), preferring to blame incidents of mass violence on the Jews themselves. None of this work was actually penned by Ford, though they required his tacit approval since he was the paper's publisher. &quot;The International Jew&quot; was one of only two books that [[Adolf Hitler]] read whilst in prison, and may have inspired his own book, [[Mein Kampf]].

[[Libel]] lawsuits in response to anti-Semitic remarks led Ford to close the ''Dearborn Independent'' in December 1927.  He later retracted the ''International Jew'' and the ''Protocols''. On [[January 7]], [[1942]], Henry Ford wrote a public letter to the ADL denouncing hatred against the Jews and expressing his hope that anti-Jewish hatred would cease for all time. Some claim that Ford neither wrote nor signed this letter and have questioned the sincerity of his apology. His writings continue to be used as propaganda by various groups, often appearing on [[anti-Semitic]] and [[neo-Nazi]] websites.

In researching his 2003 book, ''The American Axis'', investigative journalist Max Wallace discovered newly declassified documents in the US National Archives proving that Ford's principal secretary Ernst Liebold was identified by the American government as a German spy and later appears in FBI files as a known [[Nazism|Nazi]] agent. Drawing on this new material, Wallace identifies  Liebold  as the figure responsible for convincing Ford to launch his crusade against the Jews and later to support [[Hitler]] and the Nazi cause.

== Henry Ford and Nazism ==
[[Image:Ford.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Henry Ford, center, is awarded the Grand Cross of the German Eagle by Nazi diplomats.]]

Ford became interested in politics and, as a successful and powerful business leader, was sometimes a participant in world affairs. In 1915, he funded a trip to Europe, where World War I was raging, for himself and about 170 others. His group went to meet with German and other European leaders--without U.S. government support or approval--to seek peace. The war lasted another three years.{{ref|Odyssey}}

In the years between the wars, Henry Ford supported [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi]] regime. His support abated as the United States entered [[World War II]]. There is also some evidence that Henry Ford gave Adolf Hitler direct financial backing when Hitler was first starting out in politics. This can, in part, be traced to statements from Kurt Ludecke, Germany's representative to the U.S. in the 1920s, and [[Winifred Wagner]], daughter-in-law of [[Richard Wagner]], who said they requested funds from Ford to aid the National Socialist movement in [[Germany]]. However, a 1933 [[Congress of the United States|Congressional]] investigation into the matter was unable to substantiate whether contributions were actually sent. Regardless of whether direct financial support was provided, Ford repeatedly voiced his overt approval of Hitler's theories.

Ford's indirect financial backing of the Nazis was also undeniable, as Ford Motor Company was active in Germany's military buildup prior to World War II. In 1938, for instance, Ford assisted to construct an assembly plant in Berlin, the purpose of which was to supply trucks to the [[Wehrmacht]]. Forced labor was employed to produce 78,000 trucks and 14,000 track vehicles. In July of that year, Ford was awarded (and accepted) the Grand Cross of the German Order of the Eagle (''Großkreuz des Deutschen Adlerordens''). Ford was the first American and the fourth person given this award, at the time [[Nazi Germany]]'s highest honorary award given to foreigners. The decoration was given &quot;in recognition of [Ford's] pioneering in making motor cars available for the masses.&quot; The award was accompanied by a personal congratulatory message from Adolf Hitler.{{ref|Detroit}} A portrait of Ford was hung at the Nazi party's headquarters in [[Munich]]. In Max Wallace's 2003 book, ''The American Axis'', he recounts how a Detroit News columnist named Annetta Antona arrived at the headquarters to interview Hitler in 1931. When she asked the future [[Führer]] about the portrait, he told her, &quot;I regard Henry Ford as my inspiration.&quot;

Drawing on Ford's long-standing involvement with Nazi causes and anti-semitism, [[Philip Roth]] imagined him as Secretary of Interior in an imaginary (and Nazi-aligned) Lindbergh administration in his bestselling 2005 novel ''[[The Plot Against America]]''.

== Hobbies and interests ==
Ford had an interest in what today would be known as &quot;[[Americana]]&quot;.  In the 1920s, Ford began work to turn [[Sudbury, Massachusetts]] into an Americana-themed historical village. He moved the townhouse referred to in the [[nursery rhyme]] [[Mary had a little lamb]] from [[Sterling, Massachusetts]] and purchased the historical [[Wayside Inn]]. This plan never saw fruition, but Ford repeated it with the creation of [[Greenfield Village]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. It may have inspired the creation of [[Old Sturbridge Village]] as well. About the same time, he began collecting materials for his museum, which had a theme of practical technology. It was opened in 1929 as the Edison Institute and, although greatly modernized, remains open today.

Ford also had an interest in [[American folk music]], which he shared with his friend [[Lloyd Shaw|Dr. Lloyd Shaw]],  and frequently sponsored [[square dance]]s, one of his particular interests. 

Ford was an early promoter of aviation, building the [[Dearborn Inn]] as the first airport hotel. (The airfield was across the street and is now the site of a [[Ford Motor Company]] test track.)  He heavily sponsored the [[Stout Metal Airplane Company]], which developed the [[Ford Tri-Motor]], an early airliner.

Ford also maintained a vacation residence (known as the &quot;Ford Plantation&quot;) in [[Richmond Hill, Georgia]]. He contributed substantially to the community, building a chapel and schoolhouse and employing a large number of local residents. His knowledge of the Ontario town of the same name is believed to have led to the renaming of the Georgia town, formerly known as Ways Station.

== The Ford Foundation ==
Henry Ford, with his son Edsel, founded the [[Ford Foundation]] in 1936 as a local philanthropic organization with a broad charter to promote human welfare, as well as to commemorate life the way it was in the early 1900s. The Foundation has grown immensely and, by 1950, had become international in scope. The foundation no longer has any association with the [[Ford Motor Company]], nor with the family or descendants of Henry Ford.{{ref|FordFound}}

== Death ==
Ford suffered an initial [[stroke]] in 1938, after which he turned over the running of his company to Edsel. Edsel's 1943 death brought Henry Ford out of retirement. In ill health, he ceded the presidency to his grandson [[Henry Ford II]] on [[September 21]], [[1945]], and went into retirement. He died in 1947 of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] at the age of 83 in Fair Lane, his Dearborn estate, and is buried in the Ford Cemetery in Detroit.

==Quotations==
*&quot;History is more or less bunk. It's tradition. We don't want tradition. We want to live in the present, and the only history that is worth a tinker's damn is the history we make today.&quot;
*&quot;The international financiers are behind all war. They are what is called the International Jew -- German Jews, French Jews, English Jews, American Jews. I believe that in all these countries except our own the Jewish financier is supreme... Here, the Jew is a threat.&quot;
*&quot;Nothing is particularly hard, as long as you divide it into small jobs.&quot;
*&quot;Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young. The greatest thing in life is to keep your mind young.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Human geography''' is a branch of [[geography]] that focuses on the systematic study of patterns and processes that shape human interaction with the environment, with particular reference to the causes and consequences of the spatial distribution of human activity on the Earth's surface. It encompasses [[human]], [[political]], [[cultural]], [[social]], and [[economics|economic]] aspects of the [[social sciences]]. While the major focus of human geography is not the physical landscape of the Earth (see [[physical geography]]) it is hardly possible to discuss human geography without referring to the physical landscape on which human activities are being played out, and [[environmental geography]] is emerging as an important link between the two.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''[[Military]] of [[Honduras]]'''

Events during the [[1980s]] in [[El Salvador]] and [[Nicaragua]] led Honduras&amp;mdash;with [[United States|US]] assistance&amp;mdash;to expand its armed forces considerably, laying particular emphasis on its air force, which came to include a squadron of US-provided [[F-5 Freedom Fighter|F-5]]s. The resolution of the civil wars in El Salvador and Nicaragua and across-the-board budget cuts made in all ministries has brought reduced funding for the Honduran armed forces. The abolition of the draft has created staffing gaps in the now all-volunteer armed forces. The military now is far below its authorized strength, and further reductions are expected. In January 1999, the Constitution was amended to abolish the position of military commander-in-chief of the armed forces, thus codifying civilian authority over the military. President Flores also named the first civilian minister of defense in the country's history.

'''Military branches:'''
Army, Navy (includes Marines), Air Force

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Honduras]] is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), the [[Central American Parliament]] (PARLACEN), the [[Central American Integration System]] (SICA), and the [[Central American Security Commission]] (CASQ). During 1995-96, Honduras, a founding member of the United Nations, for the first time served as a non-permanent member of the [[UN Security Council]].

President Flores consulted frequently with the other [[Central America]]n presidents on issues of mutual interest. He continued his predecessor's strong emphasis on Central American cooperation and integration, which resulted in an agreement easing border controls and tariffs among Honduras, [[Guatemala]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[El Salvador]]. Honduras also joined its six Central American neighbors at the 1994 Summit of the Americas in signing the Alliance for Sustainable Development, known as the [[Conjunta Centroamerica-USA]], or CONCAUSA, to promote sustainable economic development in the region. Honduras held the 6-month SICA presidency during the second half of 1998.

In [[1969]], El Salvador and Honduras fought the brief &quot;[[Football War]]&quot; over disputed border areas and friction resulting from the 300,000 Salvadorans who had emigrated to Honduras in search of land and employment. The catalyst was nationalistic feelings aroused by a series of [[soccer]] matches between the two countries. The two countries formally signed a peace treaty on October 30, 1980, which put the border dispute before the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ). In September 1992, the court awarded most of the disputed territory to Honduras. In January 1998, Honduras and El Salvador signed a border demarcation treaty that will implement the terms of the ICJ decree. The treaty awaits legal ratification in both countries. Honduras and El Salvador maintain normal diplomatic and trade relations.

Honduras and Nicaragua had tense relations throughout 2000 and early 2001 due to a boundary dispute off the Atlantic coast. Nicaragua imposed a 35% tariff against Honduras due to the dispute, and the matter is currently awaiting a decision from the ICJ.

At the 17th Central American Summit in 1995, hosted by Honduras in the northern city of [[San Pedro Sula]], the region's six countries (excluding [[Belize]]) signed treaties creating confidence- and security-building measures and combating the smuggling of stolen automobiles in the isthmus. In subsequent summits (held every 6 months), Honduras has continued to work with the other Central American countries on issues of common concern.

In Costa Rica in May 1997, former President [[Carlos Roberto Reina]] met with former US President [[Bill Clinton]], his Central American counterparts, and the President of the [[Dominican Republic]] to reaffirm support for strengthening democracy, [[good governance]], and promoting prosperity through economic integration, free trade, and investment. The leaders also expressed their commitment to the continued development of just and equitable societies and responsible environmental policies as an integral element of sustainable development.

In Summer [[2003]] Honduras sent around 370 soldiers to Iraq as part of the [[USA]] coalition of countries that were engaging in [[war]] in this country. Immediately after [[21st April]] [[2004]] these troops were withdrawn by President [[Ricardo Maduro]] in the wake of a similar decision by [[Spain|Spanish]] prime minister [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]]. Honduras joining the coalition was largely an attempt to improve foreign relations with the United States over the issue of the [[illegal immigration]] of many thousands of Hondurans to the US. The money these illegal immigrants send back to their families in Honduras is a crucial factor in the Honduran economy, while any political strategy to help these illegal immigrants is a guaranteed vote winner.

The current Foreign Minister is [[Guillermo Pérez Cadalso Arias]].

Honduras maintains official relations with the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) instead of the [[People's Republic of China]].

==Disputes - international:==
The Honduras-El Salvador Border Protocol ratified by Honduras in May 1999 established a framework for a long-delayed border demarcation, which is currently underway; with respect to the maritime boundary in the Golfo de Fonseca, the ICJ referred to the line determined by the 1900 Honduras-Nicaragua Mixed Boundary Commission and advised that some tripartite resolution among El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua likely would be required; maritime boundary dispute with Nicaragua in the [[Caribbean Sea]].

== Illicit drugs: == 
Honduras is a transshipment point for [[illegal drug trade|drugs]] and [[narcotics]]; illicit producer of [[cannabis]], cultivated on small plots and used principally for local consumption; [[political corruption|corruption]] is a major problem.

The '''Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China''' ([[Traditional Chinese character|Traditional Chinese]]: 中華人民共和國香港特別行政區; [[Simplified Chinese character|Simplified Chinese]]: 中华人民共和国香港特别行政区 &lt;small&gt;[[Pronunciation of Hong Kong|pronunciation]]&lt;/small&gt;), is located on the southeastern coast of China.

'''Hong Kong''' (香港, in [[Yale_romanization#Cantonese|Cantonese Yale]], ''Hèung Góng'', also known as Hongkong, which was common in older English-language texts, or ''Xiānggǎng'', in [[Pinyin]]) has one of the world's most [[laissez-faire|liberal economies]] and is a major international centre of [[finance]] and [[trade]]. A former [[British overseas territory|British colony]] now administered by the PRC under the &quot;[[one country, two systems]]&quot; policy, Hong Kong is [[Hong Kong Basic Law|constitutionally entitled]] to a relatively high degree of [[autonomy]]; for example, it retains its own [[legal system]], [[currency]], [[Customs (tax)|customs]], treaty negotiating rights, such as air traffic and aircraft landing rights, and [[immigration]] laws. Hong Kong even maintains its own [[Rules of the road|road rules]], with [[traffic]] continuing to drive on the left. Only [[national defense|national defence]]&lt;!-- NOTE: &quot;Defence&quot; is commonwealth spelling. --&gt; and [[diplomatic relations]] are responsibilities of the [[central People's Government|central government]] in [[Beijing]].

Despite Hong Kong's reversion from British to Chinese rule, the region's English name remains &quot;Hong Kong&quot; (which sounds closer to the pronunciation in the local [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]] language), and not, as some sources suggest, Xiānggǎng (the [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] equivalent).[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronunciation_of_Hong_Kong]

==History==
{{main|History of Hong Kong}}

Though Hong Kong has been inhabited since the [[Palaeolithic Age]], the area now known as Hong Kong was an important trading region, and also a significant strategic location for the Chinese mainland during the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song Dynasty|Song]] [[Chinese dynasties|dynasties]] and the subsequent [[Mongol]] invasion.  After that, the prominence of Hong Kong fell, and only began to attract the attention of China again and the rest of the world in the 19th century when it was ceded to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] after the [[Opium Wars]]. Hong Kong was first visited by a European in 1513, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[mariner]] [[Jorge Álvares]]. Álvares began trading with the Chinese, and the Portuguese continued to make periodic trade stops at various locations up and down the coast.

[[Tea]], [[silk]], and other Asian [[luxury good]]s were introduced in Europe by the Portuguese, and by the mid-18th century, these items were in high demand, particularly tea. The British, challenging China's near monopoly on the tea industry, invaded China, winning the [[First Opium War]] in 1841. During the war, [[Hong Kong Island]] was first occupied by the British, and was formally ceded by the [[Qing Dynasty]] of China in 1842 under the [[Treaty of Nanking]].

Hong Kong became a [[crown colony]] in 1843. [[Kowloon Peninsula]] south of [[Boundary Street]] and [[Stonecutter's Island]] were ceded to the British in 1860 under the [[Convention of Peking]] after the [[Second Opium War]]. Various adjacent lands, known as the [[New Territories]] (including [[New Kowloon]] and [[Lantau Island]]), were then [[leasing|leased]] by Britain for 99 years, beginning on [[1 July]] [[1898]] and ending on [[30 June]] [[1997]]. For the first twenty years there was little contact between the European and Chinese communities. The first specially recruited Hong Kong civil servants to be taught [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] were recruited in 1862, markedly improving relations.

Hong Kong entered a dark age during the [[Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong|Japanese Occupation]] of [[World War II]], which lasted for three years and eight months.  Many Hong Kong people were executed by the Japanese army during the war. The Japanese subsequently surrendered on [[15 August]] [[1945]]. The port was quickly re-opened and welcomed a mass migration of Chinese [[refugee]]s in 1949 from the [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] and the new [[Communism|Communist]] government in China.

Hong Kong had been a trade port ever since the British occupation, but its position as an [[entrepot]] declined greatly after the [[United Nations]] ordered a trade embargo against the People's Republic of China as a result of the [[Korean War]]. In response, a [[textile]] industry was established, taking advantage of the new pool of workers from China who were willing to work for almost any wage. During this period, the economy grew extremely rapidly. Towards the 1970s, Hong Kong began to move away from the textile industry and develop its financial and banking economy. This led to even greater growth, and Hong Kong quickly became one of the wealthiest territories in the world. Its position as an entrepot was restrengthened since the [[Open Door Policy]] was adopted in the PRC in the late 1970s under [[Deng Xiaoping]].

In the 1980s, with the lease on the New Territories running out, the British government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] decided to negotiate the [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|question of the sovereignty of Hong Kong]]. Although the British would have been legally required to transfer only the New Territories to the PRC, Whitehall decided that maintaining a rump colony would not be worthwhile - the majority of Hong Kong's land was in the New Territories, and failure to return the entire colony would doubtless have generated political friction between the UK and PRC.
[[Image:Flag of Hong Kong 1959.svg|thumb|200px|Flag of colonial Hong Kong, a [[Blue Ensign]] with the colony's coat of arms.]]
Pursuant to an agreement known as the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], signed by the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[United Kingdom]] on [[19 December]] [[1984]], the whole territory of Hong Kong under British [[colonial]] rule became the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the PRC on [[1 July]] [[1997]]. In the Joint Declaration, the PRC promised that under the &quot;[[One Country, Two Systems]]&quot; policy proposed by [[Deng Xiaoping]], the [[socialism|socialist]] [[economy of the People's Republic of China|economic system in mainland China]] would not be practised in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong's previous [[capitalism|capitalist system]] and life-style would remain unchanged for 50 years, or until 2047. Hong Kong would enjoy a high degree of autonomy in all matters except diplomatic affairs and national defence&lt;!--defen*c*e is commonwealth spelling--&gt;. Hong Kong was transferred to the PRC at the stroke of midnight on [[1 July]] [[1997]], with the last governor, [[Chris Patten]] leaving on the [[HMY Britannia|royal yacht]]. Soon after the handover in July, land values in Hong Kong collapsed substantially and expedited the burst of the [[bubble economy]], as part of the [[Asian financial crisis]].  This was exacerbated by [[Tung Chee Hwa]]'s unsubstantiated pledge to supply 85,000 new flats annually[http://www.tdctrade.com/econforum/sc/sc000701.htm]; which essentially manipulated the region's real estate prices.  In some areas, land values fell by over half; and the [[Hang Seng Index]] fell by over 1,500 points on [[28 October]], losing 22.8% of its value in a week. Exacerbating the region's economic problems, Hong Kong was hit badly by the [[SARS]] virus beginning in mid-March through the summer of 2003, especially in the effect that it had on travel to and from Hong Kong.

On [[1 July]] the same year, half a million people marched in the largest protest rally ever aimed at the government of Hong Kong, voicing concerns about a proposed anti-subversion bill that would have eroded freedom of the press, of religion and of association arising from [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23|Article 23]] of the Hong Kong Basic Law, as well as dissatisfaction with the poor state of the economy. [[Regina Ip]], then [[Secretary for Security]], and [[Antony Leung]], then [[Financial Secretary (Hong Kong)|Financial Secretary]], were forced to leave office in 2003 under public pressure (though Antony Leung left office for reason unrelated to the SARS and Article 23 crisis).

On [[10 March]] [[2005]], Tung Chee Hwa submitted his [[Tung Chee Hwa's resignation|resignation]] as chief executive of Hong Kong. [[Donald Tsang]], the [[Chief Secretary for Administration of Hong Kong]], served as Acting Chief Executive until [[25 May]], when he, too, resigned from his post to take part in the campaign for the new Chief Executive election. Following an interim government headed by [[Henry Tang]], Tsang was eventually elected as Chief Executive.

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is headed by its [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], the [[head of government]]. This office is currently held by [[Donald Tsang]], who was elected {{ref|elected}} on [[16 June]] [[2005]].  Tsang had held the post of [[Chief Secretary for Administration of Hong Kong|Chief Secretary for Administration]] prior.  Donald Tsang assumed his post on [[24 June]] 2005 in [[Beijing]], China; he will finish the remaining portion of [[Tung Chee Hwa]]'s last term which ends on [[30 June]] [[2007]], according to the interpretation of [[Hong Kong Basic Law Annex One|Annex I]] and [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 46|Article 46]] by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]].

The election of a new Chief Executive by the 800-member [[Election Committee]] was expected to be held on [[10 July]] [[2005]].  On [[16 June]] [[2005]], [[Donald Tsang]] was acclaimed the winner, as the only candidate securing the required 100 nominations from members of the election committee. Tung Chee Hwa, the first Chief Executive, assumed office on [[1 July]] [[1997]], following his election by a 400-member [[Election Committee|electoral college]].  For the second oined in late 2004. 

Prior to the change of regime in 1989, 65% of Hungary's trade was with [[Comecon]] countries. By the end of 1997, Hungary had shifted much of its trade to the West. Trade with [[EU]] countries and the OECD now comprises over 70% and 80% of the total, respectively. [[Germany]] is Hungary's single most important trading partner. The [[United States|U.S.]] has become Hungary's sixth-largest export market, while Hungary is ranked as the 72d largest export market for the U.S. Bilateral trade between the two countries increased 46% in 1997 to more than $1 billion. The U.S. has extended to Hungary most-favored-nation status, the Generalized System of Preferences, Overseas Private Investment Corporation insurance, and access to the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]].

With about $18 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) since 1989, Hungary has attracted over one-third of all FDI in central and eastern Europe, including the former Soviet Union. Of this, about $6 billion came from American companies. Foreign capital is attracted by skilled and relatively inexpensive labor, tax incentives, modern infrastructure, and a good telecommunications system.

== Ancient and medieval military ==

The Hungarian tribes of ''[[Árpád]] vezér'' who came to settle in the Carpathian Basin were noted for their fearsome horse-mounted warriors, who conducted frequent [[looting]] campaigns throughout much of [[Western Europe]] (once as far as [[Spain]]), terrorizing the entire population with their long range and rapid-firing [[reflex bow]]s. Not until the introduction of well-regulated, plate-armored knight heavy cavalry could German monarchs stop the magyar (onugor) armies. Hence came the term ''[[ogre]]'', a man-eating monster of child tales.

Founding king of Hungary, [[Stephen I of Hungary]] abandoned light cavalry and acquired a western-style, knight and infantry based army. This principle worked well for Szent László, the late [[11th century]] knight-king who pacified the [[kun]] tribes, but failed disastrously 150 years later when the un-disciplined Hungarian [[feudal]] knight army was totally destroyed by [[mongol]] invaders in the Battle of Muhi in [[1241]]. The Mongol herds used almost exactly the same kind of weaponry and tactics as brandished by Hungarian tribes two centuries earlier.

The Hungarian knight army had its golden age under king [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]], who himself was a famed warrior and conducted semi-successful campaigns in [[Italy]] due to family matters (his younger brother married Joan I, Queen of Naples who murdered him later.) King [[Matthias Corvinus]] maintained very modern mercenary-based royal troops, called the ''Black Army''. King Matthias favoured ancient artillery (catapults) as opposed to cannons, which were the favourite of his father, [[Johannes Hunyadi]] the ''ottoman-beater'', who defended [[Belgrade]] in [[1456]].

During the Ottoman invasion of Central Europe (between late 1300s and circa 1700) Hungarian soldiers protected fortresses and launched light cavalry attacks against the Turks (see [[hussar]]s). The northern fortress of [[Eger]] was famously defended in the autumn of [[1552]] against the combined force of two ottoman armies numbering circa 120,000 men and 16 ultra-heavy siege guns. The victory was very important, because two much stronger forts of [[Szolnok]] and [[Temesvár]] had fallen quickly during the summer. Public opinion attributed Eger's success to the all-Hungarian garrison, as the above two forts have fallen due to treason by the foreign mercenaries manning them. In [[1596]], Eger fell to the Ottomans for the same reason.

In the [[1566]] [[Battle of Szigetvár]], [[Zrínyi Miklós|Nicholas Šubić Zrinski]] defended [[Szigetvár]] for 30 days against the largest Ottoman army ever seen up to that day, and died leading his remaining few soldiers on a final suicide charge to become one of the best known national heroes. His great-grandson, [[Nicholas Zrinski]], poet and general became of the better known stratagems of 1660s. In [[1686]], the capital city [[Buda]] was freed from the ottomans by an allied Christian army composed of Hungarian, Austrian and Western European troops, each roughly 1/3rd of the army. The Habsburg then annexed Hungary.

==Habsburg Hungarian military==

Under Habsburg rule, Hungarian hussars rose to international fame and served as a model for light cavalry in many European countries. Hundreds of thousands of forcibly enrolled Hungarian males served 12 years or more as line infantry during the 1700s-1800s in the Austrian Imperial Army.

Two independence wars interrupted this era, that of Prince [[Francis II Rákóczi]] between [[1703]] and [[1711]] and that of [[Lajos Kossuth]] in [[1848]]&amp;ndash;[[1849]]. Both time Hungarian armies were crushed by the Habsburgs, but the second time not until the help of mighty Czarist Russian armies was summoned to purge [[Józef Bem]]'s second army from Transylvania, opening the path into the heart of Hungary. [[Sándor Petőfi]], the great Hungarian poet became a [[missing in action|MIA]] in the [[Battle of Segesvár]].

Huge numbers of Hungarians served and fell in [[World War I]], especially at the battlefield of [[Isonzo]] and on the Russian front. After the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire in late [[1918]], the Red Army of the Hungarian commune-state conducted successful campaigns to protect the borders, until eventually crushed by a coalition of [[Romania]]n, [[Yugoslavia]]n and [[France|French]] troops.

==Mid-twentieth century==

During the 1930s and early 1940s, Hungary was totally preoccupied with the idea of regaining the vast territories and huge amount of population lost in the [[Trianon peace treaty]] at [[Versailles]] in [[1920]]. This required strong armed forces to defeat the neighbouring states, something Hungary couldn't afford. Instead, governor [[Miklós Horthy]] made an alliance with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Third Reich]] and got temporary territorial gains in exchange, for which Hungary had to pay very dearly during and after [[World War II]].

The [[Hungarian Second Army]] was totally devastated at banks of the Don River in January [[1943]], a supplement of the battle for [[Stalingrad]]. Many Hungarian cities received severe damage during allied carpet bombing. The Soviets occupied Hungary during the turn of [[1944]]&amp;ndash;[[1945]], and even though they freed the country from the Nazis, they brought suffering and kept the country occupied. All the bridges were destroyed, cattles looted, women raped, men kidnapped for slave labour in the [[gulag]]s. After the fall of Hungary, [[Magyars|Magyar]] troops of [[Ferenc Szálasi]] continued to fight alongside the [[Wehrmacht]] until the very last day. The Hungarian Danube Flottila fired the last shells in anger on the morning of 8th of May, 1945 and the last Hungarian fighter squadrons torched their remining [[Me-109]]s on the 6th of May, deep inside Germany. Allies thus badged Hungary the ''last [[vassal]]'' of [[Hitler]] and imposed severe retributions on the country.

==Warsaw Pact==

During the Socialist and the [[Warsaw Pact]] era ([[1955]]&amp;ndash;1989), the entire 200,000 strong ''Soviet South Army Group'' was garrisoned in Hungary, complete with artillery, tank regimens, air force and missile troops (with nukes). It was by all means a very capable force, that made little contact with the local population. Between [[1949]] and 1955 there was also a huge effort to build a big Hungarian army. All procedures, disciplines, equipment were exact copies of the soviet Red Army in methods and material, but the huge costs collapsed the economy by [[1956]].

After the autumn 1956 anti-communist revolution was crushed in [[Budapest]], the Soviets took away most of the Hungarian army's equipment. A few years later, when offered a choice of pull-back, the new Hungarian leader [[János Kádár]] asked for all the 200,000 Soviet troops to stay, because it allowed the [[socialist]] [[Hungarian People's Republic]] to neglect its own draft-based armed forces, quickly leading to deterioration of the military. Large sums of money were saved that way and spent on feel-good measures for the population, thus Hungary could become &quot;[[the happiest barrack]]&quot; in the [[Soviet Bloc]].

Training for army conscripts was poor and most of those drafted were actually used as a free labour force (esp. railway track construction and agricultural work) after just a few weeks of basic rifle training. Popular opinion grew very negative towards the Hungarian army and most young man tried to avoid the draft with bogus medical excuses. By the late-1980s garrisons were in bad shape, often worse than slums or barns. There were several dozens of [[meningitis]] cases with some dead among the conscripts and nearby population, due to poor facilities at the garrisons (this was during the mid-1990s).

==After the Cold War==

[[Hungary]] spearheaded the movement to dissolve the [[Warsaw Pact|Warsaw Pact Treaty Organization]] in [[1990]]. The country's new democratic leaders quickly realized the disastrous shape of the domestic military and how it may block their ambitions towards a NATO alliance, but right-wing patriotic sentiments of the FIDESZ and MDF parties blocked the abolishment of conscription that time. Stuck with an obsolete organisational model and very limited funding, the draft-based Hungarian military constantly struggled for most of the 1990s. It was mostly due to pure chance (namely Hungary's location at the edge of the [[Balkan crisis]]) that Hungary was allowed to join the NATO. The country was in no way prepared for NATO membership.

Hungary has since worked to modernize and Westernize its armed forces. The effort is half-hearted at best. The prospect of imminent [[NATO]] membership has led the government to focus on assuring the interoperability of the Hungarian Home Defense Forces (Honvédség) with those of its future allies. This shall require not only a slow, expensive overhaul of military hardware but also a major restructuring of organization, military doctrine, and training. Hungary has been an active participant in the [[Partnership for Peace]] since [[1994]], as well as the NATO-led IFOR/SFOR operations in Bosnia, and regularly contributes to UN peacekeeping missions.

The Honvédség's largest service is the army, followed by the air force and a small naval contingent that patrols the [[Danube]] River, now essentially defunct. The size of the armed forces is now 45,000, down from over 130,000 in 1989. The aim is to reach 40,000 until end of 2006. The draft no longer exists, as the Constitution was modified to abolish mandatory armed service for males in late 2004, after 136 years of continuous conscription. The government has also pledged to increase defense spending to 2% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] until 2006 to bring Hungary's military budget in line with those of [[NATO]] countries. This promise will not be kept because of [[EU]] imposed budget restrictions for 2005-2006, thus Hungary must bear frequent [[NATO]] criticism for failing to meet its mutual defence obligations. The negative domestic opinion towards armed forces did not change significantly in the past decade.

==Current military==

The Hungarian armed forces has severely reduced the number of [[battle tank]]s in service, surplused all tracked [[IFV]]s and limits the number of flight hours available to rotary and fixed wing aircraft crews. A large number of [[garrison]]s were shut down, some of them sold to municipal authorities for peaceful uses.

In [[1997]], Hungary spent about 123 billion HUF ($560 million) on defense. Hungary became a member of NATO on [[March 12]], [[1999]]. Hungary provided airbases and support for [[NATO]]'s air campaign against [[Serbia]] and has provided military units to serve in [[Kosovo]] as part of the NATO-led KFOR operation. Hungary has sent a 300 strong logistics unit to [[Iraq]] in order to help the US occupation with armed transport convoys, though public opinion opposed the country's participation in the war. One soldier was KIA due to a roadside bomb in Iraq. The parliament refused to extend the one year mandate of the logistics unit and all troops have returned from Iraq as of mid-January 2005. Hungarian troops are still in Afghanistan as of early 2005 to assist in peace-keeping and de-[[taliban]]ization.

In a significant move for modernization, the first Saab [[Gripen]] light fighter jets shall arrive in Hungary during early [[2006]] to replace the aging [[MiG-29]] fighter interceptors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Except for the short-lived [[neutrality]] declared by [[Imre Nagy]] in November [[1956]], [[Hungary]]'s foreign policy generally followed the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] lead from [[1947]] to [[1989]]. During the [[Communism|Communist]] period, Hungary maintained treaties of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance with the [[Soviet Union]], [[Poland]], [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[German Democratic Republic]], [[Romania]], and [[Bulgaria]]. It was one of the founding members of the Soviet-led [[Warsaw Pact]] and [[Comecon]], and it was the first central European country to withdraw from those organizations, now defunct.

As with any ''country'', Hungarian security attitudes are shaped largely by history and geography. For Hungary, this is a history of more than 400 years of domination by great powers--the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], the [[Habsburg]]s, the [[Germany|Germans]] during [[World War II]], and the Soviets during the [[Cold War]]--and a geography of regional instability and separation from Hungarian minorities living in neighboring countries. Hungary's foreign policy priorities, largely consistent since [[1990]], represent a direct response to these factors. Since 1990, Hungary's top foreign policy goal has been achieving integration into Western economic and security organizations. Hungary joined the [[Partnership for Peace]] program in [[1994]] and has actively supported the [[IFOR]] and [[SFOR]] missions in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina | Bosnia]]. The Horn government achieved Hungary's most important foreign policy successes of the post-communist era by securing invitations to join both [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]] in [[1997]]. Hungary became member of NATO in [[1999]], and member of the EU in [[2004]].

Hungary also has improved its often-chilled neighborly relations by signing basic treaties with [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Ukraine]]. These renounce all outstanding territorial claims and lay the foundation for constructive relations. However, the issue of ethnic Hungarian minority rights in Slovakia and Romania periodically causes bilateral tensions to flare. Hungary was a signatory to the [[Helsinki Final Act]] in [[1975]], has signed all of the CSCE/[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] follow-on documents since [[1989]], and served as the OSCE's Chairman-in-Office in [[1997]]. Hungary's record of implementing CSCE '''Helsinki Final Act''' provisions, including those on reunification of divided families, remains among the best in eastern Europe. Hungary has been a member of the [[United Nations]] since December [[1955]].

'''Disputes - international:'''

'''Illicit drugs:'''
major transshipmentins and place of manufacture, it was marketed in New Zealand as 'American'.

In the late 1980s, General Motors New Zealand attempted to use many makes and have 'GM' as the main brand. Therefore, the mainstream range in 1989 consisted of:

* [[Holden Barina]] (a rebadged [[Suzuki]] Cultus/Swift)
* [[Pontiac LeMans]] (imported from [[Daewoo]] of Korea)
* [[Opel Vectra]]
* [[Opel Calibra]]
* [[Holden Commodore]] and Calais
* [[Holden Statesman]]
* [[Holden Holden YB Piazza|Holden Piazza]]

Commercials bore the Isuzu name. This, however, created little brand loyalty and consumers did not accept 'GM' as a brand.

It was only in [[1994]], with Holden's future more secure, that General Motors New Zealand finally became Holden New Zealand. The Opel name was dropped, and the [[Opel Vectra|Vectra]] was rebadged as a Holden, even though it was then not available in Australia. The [[General Motors Astra|Astra]] was introduced the following year, identical Opel-badged models, [[grey import|imported second hand]] from [[Japan]], already being sold locally. 

Early models of the Holden Astra and Vectra in New Zealand differed from those sold in Australia, in that they had a distinctive grille with a 'V' containing the Holden badge, similar to that used by Vauxhall in the UK. Later on this was changed to bring the New Zealand model range in line with Australia. 

Similarly, the [[Isuzu Trooper]] off-road vehicle was rebadged the Holden Jackaroo, as in Australia, although owing to the widespread availability of the identical Isuzu Bighorn as a used Japanese import, that name was used on brand new models imported by Holden New Zealand. For a very brief, and with hindsight anomalous, period during 1998-1999, the [[Holden Frontera]] was sold new in New Zealand as the Isuzu Wizard, though things have now been brought into line with Australia.

There are still differences between the Holden model ranges in Australia and New Zealand. It was only in August 2005 that the wagon version of the Holden Astra went on sale in Australia, while in New Zealand, the Astra wagon is to be dropped, like the [[Opel Zafira|Zafira]] in 2004. The Astra Turbo, and Tigra have also been released in Australia, but will not be sold in New Zealand.

==Export markets==

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:MonaroPoliceCar.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Holden Monaro Police Car. Melbourne, Victoria in Australia.]] --&gt;The Holden Commodore is as popular in [[New Zealand]] (where it has hit the number-one slot in the sales' charts from time to time) as it is in Australia, often being used as a police car.  It is also sold in [[South Africa]], [[Thailand]], and parts of the [[Middle East]] badged as a [[Chevrolet Lumina]], and in [[Brazil]] as the [[Chevrolet Omega]]. Holden's exports to the Middle East and Brazil were the first [[left hand drive]] cars built since the [[1960s]], when it sold cars in [[Hawaii]]. HSV's modified vehicles are also sold in the [[United Kingdom]]. A modified version of the Holden Monaro is sold in the [[United States]] as the [[Pontiac GTO]]. The Holden Monaro is sold under that name through [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] dealerships in the [[United Kingdom]]. Holden also exports its Statesman sedan to the [[Middle East]] as the [[Chevrolet Caprice]], to [[South Korea ]]as the [[Daewoo]] Statesman, and [[China]] as the [[Buick]] Royaum. [[Fiji]], [[Singapore]], [[Brunei]] and [[Indonesia]] have also been Holden export markets.

==Sports vehicles==

Between 1968 and 1974, GMH sold a two-door variant of their full-size Holden sedan as the [[Holden Monaro|Monaro]], with great success. A revived Monaro, based on the previous model Commodore, has attracted wide attention since being shown as a [[concept car]] at Australian [[motor show]]s, and a large waiting list after it was put into production. The revived [[Holden Monaro|Monaro]] was released in the Australian market in October 2001. Starting with the [[2004]] model year, the [[Holden Monaro|Monaro]] has been exported to the [[United States]], rebadged as the [[Pontiac]] [[Pontiac GTO|GTO]], and the [[Middle East]], rebadged as the Chevrolet Lumina Coupe. It is sold in limited numbers in the UK as the [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] Monaro.

[[Holden Special Vehicles]] ('''HSV''') is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holden selling extensively modified, high-performance Commodore variants (including the Monaro and the Statesman).  . Holdens have been a staple of domestic [[touring car racing]] since the 1960s, and the quasi-factory Holden Racing Team has been dominant in [[V8 Supercar]] racing.

:''This article is about the baseball player. For the insurance mogul nicknamed Hank Greenberg, see [[Maurice R. Greenberg]].''
'''Henry Benjamin &quot;Hank&quot; Greenberg''' ([[January 1]], [[1911]] - [[September 4]], [[1986]]), nicknamed &quot;Hammerin' Hank&quot;, was an [[United States|American]] player in [[Major League Baseball]].  

==Early Life==

{{MLB HoF}}
He was born in [[New York City]] to an [[Orthodox Jew]]ish family and attended [[James Monroe]] High School in [[the Bronx]], where he was an outstanding all-around athlete.  His preferred sport was baseball, and his preferred position was [[First baseman|first base]].  In 1929, he was recruited by the [[New York Yankees]], who already had a capable first baseman:  [[Lou Gehrig]].  Greenberg turned them down and attended [[New York University]] for a year, after which he signed with the [[Detroit Tigers]].

==Early career==

He played [[minor league baseball]] for three years, and was named [[Most Valuable Player]] in the [[Texas League]].  

In 1933, he joined the Tigers and [[batting average|hit]] .301 while [[RBI|driving]] in 87 runs.

Starring as a first baseman and [[outfielder]] with the [[Detroit Tigers]] (1930, 1933-1946), and briefly with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] (1947), he played only nine full seasons.  He missed three full seasons and most of two others to military service during [[World War II]], and missed most of another season with a broken wrist.  In seven of the nine years in which he was active, he was one of the dominant players in the game, beginning in [[1934]], his second major-league season, in which he won his first MVP award and helped the Tigers reach their first World Series in 25 years.

As a fielder, the 6'4&quot; Greenberg was awkward and unsure of himself early in his career, but he mastered his first-base position through countless hours of practice.  When he was asked to move to the outfield in 1940 to make room for Rudy York, he worked tirelessly to master that position as well.

==Records and Baseball style==

A prodigious home-run hitter, he narrowly missed breaking [[Babe Ruth]]'s single-season home-run record in [[1938]] when he hit 58 home runs.  The story goes that several pitchers intentionally walked Greenberg towards the end of the season rather than give a Jewish man a chance to break Babe Ruth's record.  (There is some reason to dispute this as a motive.  It is true that the Cleveland Indians did not give Greenberg good pitches to hit during the last week of the season; it is also true that Detroit and Cleveland were battling for third place, which in those days carried with it a share of World Series profits, so Cleveland players had a financial interest in keeping Greenberg from hitting home runs.)

For his own part, Greenberg felt that runs batted in were more important than home runs.  He would tell his teammates, &quot;just get on base&quot;, or &quot;just get the runner to third&quot;, and he would do the rest.  He batted in 170 runs in 1935 and in 1937 topped that with 183 (third all-time behind [[Hack Wilson]] in 1930 and [[Lou Gehrig]] in 1931).

After moving to the outfield in [[1940]], Greenberg led the Tigers to a pennant and won his second MVP award, becoming at the time, only the second player ever to win the MVP award at two different positions.

==WWII Service==

The Detroit [[draft board]] initially classified Greenberg as [[4F]] for &quot;flat feet.&quot;  Rumors that he had bribed the board and concern that he would be likened to [[Jack Dempsey]], who received negative publicity for failure to serve in World War I, led Greenberg to be reexamined, and he was found fit to serve.  

Although drafted in 1940, he was honorably discharged after Congress released men aged 28 years or older from service, being released on December 5, 1941, two days before the Japanese bombed [[Pearl Harbor]].  Greenberg re-enlisted and volunteered for service in the [[United States Army Air Corps]].  He graduated from [[Officer Candidate School]] and was commissioned as a [[first lieutenant]].  He eventually served overseas in the China-Burma-India theater, scouting locations for B-29 bases.

==Return to Baseball==

Greenberg remained in uniform until the summer of 1945.  Without the benefit of spring training, he returned to the Tigers and helped lead them to a come-from-behind American League pennant, clinching it with a grand-slam home run on the final game of the season.  In [[1946]] he returned to peak form.

It is often estimated that Greenberg, had he played in another era uninterrupted by war, would have amassed between 500 and 600 home runs and 1,800 to 2,000 RBI.  As it is, his totals of 331 home runs and 1,276 RBI are amazing for a 1,394-game career.  He also hit for average, batting .313.

In [[1947]], Greenberg and the Tigers had a lengthy salary dispute.  When Greenberg decided to retire rather than play for less, Detroit traded him to the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]].  To persuade him not to retire, Pittsburgh made Greenberg the first baseball player to earn over $100,000 in a season (though the exact amount is a matter of some dispute).  Team co-owner [[Bing Crosby]] recorded a song, &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Ball, Goodbye&quot; with [[Groucho Marx]] and Greenberg, to celebrate Greenberg's arrival.  The Pirates also moved in the seats in Forbes Field's cavernous left field, renaming the section &quot;Greenberg's Gardens&quot;, to accommodate Greenberg's pull-hitting style.  Greenberg played first base for the Pirates for 1947, and was one of the few opposing players to publicly welcome [[Jackie Robinson]] to the majors.

==Coaching and ownership==
The following year, Greenberg retired from the field to become the [[Cleveland Indians]]' farm system director and two years later, their general manager.  His contributions in finding and developing talent contributed to that team's successes through the 1950s.  He followed [[Bill Veeck]] to the [[Chicago White Sox]], as part-owner, and then retired from baseball in 1963 to go into investment banking.

==Family==
He married Coral [[Gimbel's|Gimbel]] (of the New York department store family) on [[February 18]], [[1946]], three days after signing a $60,000 contract with the Tigers. Their son, Steven, played five years in the Washington Senators and [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] organizations.  In [[1995]], Steve Greenberg founded Classic Sports Network, which was purchased by [[ESPN]] and became [[ESPN Classic]].

==Honors==
* [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|American League Most Valuable Player]], [[1934]] and [[1940]].
* American League All-Star team, [[1937]]-[[1940]].
* First Jewish player elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]], in [[1956 in sports|1956]].
* In [[1999]], despite injuries and wartime service that essentially limited him to half a career, he ranked Number 37 on ''[[The Sporting News]]''' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was nominated as a finalist for the [[Major League Baseball]] All-Century Team.

Greenberg died in [[Beverly Hills, California]] and his remains were entombed at [[Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Culver City, California]].

Autobiography: ''The Story of My Life'', ISBN 1892049236

In 2006, Greenberg will be featured on a [[United States]] [[postage stamp]] [http://www.usps.com/communications/news/stamps/2005/sr05_054.htm].  The stamp is one of a block of four honoring Baseball Sluggers.

==Legacy==
Greenberg was considered a sports icon in the [[Jewish American]] community.

Greenberg was not the first [[Jew]]ish man to play major-league baseball, but by the end of his career he had become by far the best Jewish player ever, and the first major Jewish star.  In the 50 years since Greenberg's retirement, only [[Sandy Koufax]] achieved similar success among Jewish players. Greenberg was subject to the most vicious ethnic taunting seen in the sport prior to the arrival of [[Jackie Robinson]] in [[1947 in sports|1947]], yet Greenberg nevertheless became a first-rank ballplayer and an icon among Jews in the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Heinrich_schliemann_portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait of Heinrich Schliemann.]]
'''Heinrich Schliemann''' ([[January 6]], [[1822]] &amp;ndash; [[December 26]], [[1890]]) was a [[Germany|German]] classical [[archaeologist]], an advocate of the historical reality of places mentioned in the works of [[Homer]], and an important excavator of [[Mycenaean]] sites, such as [[Troy]], [[Mycenae]] and [[Tiryns]].

==Childhood==

Heinrich was born at [[Neubukow]], in [[Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], to Ernst Schliemann, a poor Protestant minister, and Luise Therese Sophie. He was one of a large family. In 1831, when he was 9, his mother died. There is no question that this was a traumatic event for him. Later in life he seemed attracted to women named Sophie.

He went to live with his uncle, Friederich Schliemann, perhaps because of an educational opportunity. He enrolled in the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] at [[Neustrelitz]] at age 11. His attendance was paid for by his father.

He was at the Gymnasium for at least a year. Later he claimed that, as a boy, his interest in history was encouraged by his father, who, he said, had schooled him in the tales of The [[Iliad]] and The [[Odyssey]] and had given him a copy of Ludwig Jerrer's ''Illustrated History of the World'' for Christmas, 1829.
Schliemann also later claimed that at the age of eight he declared he would one day excavate the city of [[Troy]].

It is unknown whether his childhood interest in and connection with the classics continued during his time at the Gymnasium, but it is likely that he would have been further exposed to Homer. It may be that he had just enough of a classical education to endow him with a yearning for it when it was snatched from him; he was transferred to the vocational school, or [[Realschule]], after his father was accused of embezzling church funds, and had to quit the vocational school in 1836, when his father had no funds to pay for it.  According to his diary, his interest in ancient Greece was conceived when he overheard drunken university student citing the [[Odyssey]] of Homer in classical Greek and so Heinrich was taken by the language's beauty.  However, the accuracy of that information remains questionable, as do many details in his diary, given his lack of providing the whole truth as he did by forging documents to divorce his wife and lied, later on, in his papers to obtain US citizenship.

This established the fundamental character of his later life. He wanted to return to the educated life, to reacquire all the things of which he was deprived in childhood. In his archaeological career, there was always a dichotomy between the educated professionals and Schliemann. Heinrich developed a certain tendency to pose as something he was not. Moreover, the experiences of his father gave him a sympathy to means that were not always legal or aboveboard.

After leaving Realschule, Heinrich became a grocer's apprentice at age fourteen, for Herr Holtz's grocery in Furstenburg. He labored in the grocery for five years, reading voraciously whenever he had a spare moment. In 1841 Schliemann fled to [[Hamburg]] and became a cabin boy on the '''Dorothea''', a steamer bound for [[Venezuela]]. After twelve days at sea the ship foundered in a gale, and the survivors washed up on the shores of [[Holland]].

==Career as a businessman==

After his shipwreck, Schliemann seems to have undergone a brief period of being footloose in [[Amsterdam]] and Hamburg, at age 19. This circumstance came to an end with his employment, in 1842, at the commodities firm of F. C. Quien and Son. (Some say this was in Amsterdam; others say [[Prussia]].) He became a messenger, office attendant and then book-keeper there. As messenger, he would stamp bills of exchange and cash them. 

On March 1, 1844, he changed jobs, going to work for B. H. Shröder &amp; Co., an import/export firm. There he evidenced such judgement and talent for the work that they sent him as a general agent in 1846 to [[St. Petersburg]], where the markets were favorable. He represented a number of companies. He prospered there, but how well is not known. In view of his later experiences with his first wife, he probably did not become rich at that time. He did learn Russian and Greek, employing a system that he used his entire life to learn languages -- Schliemann wrote his diary in the language of whatever country he happened to be in.

Schliemann had a gift for languages and by the end of his life he was conversant in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] as well as his native [[German language|German]]. Schliemann's ability with languages was an important part of his career as a businessman in the importing trade. How well he actually knew those languages is another question, but he seemed reasonably at home in many nations.

In 1850 Heinrich learned of the death of his brother, Ludwig, who had become wealthy as a speculator in the California gold fields. Taking the cue, Schliemann went to California in early 1851 and started a bank in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. The bank bought and resold over a million dollars in gold dust in just six months. The prospectors could mine or pan for the gold, but they had no way to sell it except to middle men such as Schliemann, who made quick fortunes on it.

Later Heinrich claimed to have acquired [[United States]] citizenship when California was made a state. According to his memoirs, before arriving in California he had dined in Washington with President [[Millard Filmore]] and family. He also published an account of the San Francisco fire of 1851.

He wasn't in the United States long. On [[April 7]], [[1852]], he sold his business rather suddenly (due to fever, he said) and returned to Russia. There he attempted to live the life of a gentleman, which brought him into contact with Ekaterina Lyschin, the niece of one of his wealthy friends. Previously he had learned that his childhood sweetheart, Minna, had married. He was now 30.

Heinrich and Ekaterina were married on [[October 12]], [[1852]]. The marriage was troubled from the start. Ekaterina wanted him to be richer than he was and witheld conjugal rights until he made a move in that direction, which he did. The canny Schliemann cornered the market in indigo and then went into the indigo business, turning a good round profit. This move won him Ekaterina's intnational economists predicted that they would have to either get a new loan from the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and institute [[Shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]], or else hyperinflate. Currency controls were imposed, tariffs instituted, and the economy was allowed to fall into a severe recession: unemployment hit 25%; homelessness and crime spiraled upwards, and the poverty rate peaked at over 50%. 

It has been argued that the hyperinflation of [[1920s]] [[Germany]] was fostered by the government in order to wipe out domestic debt accrued during the [[First World War]], citing the apparent ease with which the currency was changed.

In general, hyperinflation is associated with [[fiat money]] and/or very rapid [[debasement]] of currency, such as the 1834-1839 debasement of the [[akçe]], the standard silver coin of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which saw its value drop by fivefold, increasing the nominal amount of circulating medium. Episodes of hyperinflation produce staggering increases in price — and bank notes denominated in millions, billions, and trillions, coins denominated in the millions, or withdrawn from circulation altogether. The vicious cycle of borrowing to meet all expenses begins, and the monetary authority does not act to contain the cycle and may indeed accommodate it.  Hyperinflation is often the result of governments using unbacked currency during war time to pay the expenses of the conflict, such as the [[United States]] in the 1770s and the [[Republic of China]] in the 1940s. 

The root cause is a matter of more dispute. For both economists of the [[classical economics|classical school]] as well as [[monetarism|monetarist]]s, it is always the result of the monetary authority's irresponsibility (or stupidity), &quot;running the printing presses.&quot; These models focus on the unrestrained [[seignorage]] of the monetary authority, and the gains from the [[inflation tax]]. For [[neoliberalism|neo-liberal]] economists, hyperinflation is considered to be the result of a crisis of confidence, where the monetary base of the country flees, producing widespread fear that individuals will not be able to convert local currency to some more transportable form — for example gold, or an internationally recognized [[hard currency]] such as the [[US dollar]]. [[#Money matters|See below]] for more discussion. These models are based on the [[neo-classical economics|neo-classical synthesis]] and chart the drop in the country's [[money stock]] against hyperinflation.

Inflation can also occur in the absence of a central bank. One case is when there is &quot;free banking&quot; but banks are allowed suspend convertibility in violation of their contracts with their customers. These episodes are often brief, as there is then a run on banks, a panic, and a collapse in the money supply leading to a depression and deflation.

Less commonly, hyperinflation may occur when there is [[debasement]] of the coinage — wherein coins are consistently shaved of some of their silver and gold, increasing the circulating medium and reducing the value of the currency. The &quot;shaved&quot; specie is then often restruck into coins with lower weight of gold or silver.  Historical examples include Ancient Rome and China during the Song Dynasty.  

One common cause of hyperinflation is warfare, civil war, or intense internal conflict of other kinds: governments needing to do whatever is necessary to continue fighting, since the alternative is defeat. They cannot cut outlays, because the main outlay is for armaments to fight the war itself. Further, a civil war may make it difficult to raise taxes or to collect the existing taxes. In normal times, a deficit is financed by borrowing, that is selling government bonds. But under conditions of war or civil war, it is typically difficult and expensive to borrow, especially if the war is going poorly for the government in question. The banking authorities, whether central or not, &quot;monetize&quot; the deficit, printing money to pay for the government's efforts to survive. The hyperinflation under the Chinese Nationalists from 1939-1945 is a classic example of a government printing money to pay civil war costs. By the end, currency was flown in over the [[Himalaya]], and then old currency was flown out to be
destroyed.

In the United States, hyperinflation was seen during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], especially on the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] (losing) side. Many other cases of extreme social conflict encouraging hyperinflation can be seen, as in [[Germany]] after [[World War I]], [[Hungary]] at the end of [[World War II]] and in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] after the death of [[Josip Broz Tito|Marshall Tito]].

==The Weimar Inflation in Germany==
[[Image:billionmarks.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A 1000 Mark banknote, over-stamped in red with 1,000,000,000 (1 billion) Marks, issued in Germany during the hyperinflation of 1923]]
The hyper-inflation episode in the Weimar Republic in the 1920's is, in many respects, the paradigmatic example, and the one which made economists and others aware of hyper-inflation as a phenomenon unto itself, it was not the first example of hyper-inflation, but it was the first one that was recognized as such.

Following the [[First World War]], the [[Treaty of Versailles]] forced Germany to pay significant reparations (compensation) to the nations that won the war, starting in 1919. However, Germany had a very weak economy at this time: in effect, the young republic of Weimar had no money. To pay its reparations and rebuild the economy, the German government printed  money. However, there was no faith in this money, and the hyperinflation began. The inflation reached its peak by November 1923, but ended when a new currency (the [[Rentenmark]]) was introduced. The government stated this new currency had a fixed value, and this was accepted. 

Hyperinflation did not directly bring about the [[Nazi]] takeover of Germany; the inflation ended with the introduction of the Rentenmark and the [[Weimar Republic]] continued for a decade afterward. The inflation did, however, call into question the competence of [[Liberalism|liberal]] institutions, especially amongst a middle class who had held cash savings and bonds. It also produced resentment of Germany's bankers and speculators (many of them [[Jewish]]) who were blamed for the inflation.

== Models of hyperinflation ==

Since hyperinflation is visible as a monetary effect, models of hyperinflation center on the demand for money. Economists see both a rapid increase in the [[money supply]] and an increase in the [[Quantity Theory of Money|velocity of money]]. Either one or both of these encourage inflation and hyperinflation. A dramatic increase in the velocity of money as the cause of hyperinflation is central to the &quot;crisis of confidence&quot; model of hyperinflation, where the risk premium that sellers demand for the paper currency over the nominal value grows rapidly. The second theory is that there is first a radical increase in the amount of circulating medium, which can be called the &quot;monetary model&quot; of hyperinflation. In either model, the second effect then follows from the first — either too little confidence forcing an increase in the money supply, or too much money destroying confidence.

In the ''confidence model'', some event, or series of events, such as defeats in battle, or a run on stocks of the specie which back a currency, removes the belief that the authority issuing the money will remain solvent — whether a bank or a government. Because people do not want to hold notes which may become valueless, they want to spend them in preference to holding notes which will lose value.  Sellers, realizing that there is a higher risk for the currency, demand a greater and greater premium over the original value. Under this model, the method of ending hyperinflation is to change the backing of the currency — often by issuing a completely new one. War is one commonly cited cause of crisis of confidence, particularly losing in a war, as occurred during Napoleanic Vienna, and capital flight, sometimes because of &quot;contagion&quot; is another. In this view, the increase in the circulating medium is the result of the government attempting to buy time without coming to terms with the root cause of the lack of confidence itself.

In the ''monetary model'', hyperinflation is a [[positive feedback]] cycle of rapid monetary expansion. It has the same cause as all other inflation: money-issuing bodies, central or otherwise, produce currency to pay spiralling costs, often from lax fiscal policy, or the mounting costs of warfare. When businesspeople perceive that the issuer is committed to a policy of rapid currency expansion, they start factoring the decay of the currency's value into prices. The issuer must then accelerate its expansion to cover these prices, which pushes the currency value down even faster. According to this model the issuer cannot &quot;win&quot; and the only solution is to abruptly stop expanding the currency. Unfortunately, the end of expansion can cause a severe financial shock to those using the currency as expectations are suddenly adjusted. This policy, combined with reductions of pensions, wages, and government outlays, formed part of the [[Washington consensus]] of the 1990s.

Whatever the cause, hyperinflation involves both the supply and velocity of money. Which comes first is a matter of debate, and there may be no universal story that applies to all cases. But once the hyperinflation is established, the pattern of increasing the money stock, by which ever agencies are allowed to do so, is universal. Because this practice increases the supply of currency without any matching increase in demand for it, the price of the currency, that is the exchange rate, naturally falls relative to other currencies. Inflation becomes hyperinflation when the increase in money supply turns specific areas of pricing power into a general frenzy of spending quickly before money becomes worthless. The purchasing power of the currency drops so rapidly that holding cash for even a day is an unacceptable loss of purchasing power. As a result, no one holds currency, which increases the velocity of money, and worsens the crisis.

That is, rapidly rising prices undermine money's role as a store of value, so that people try to spend it on real goods or services as quickly as possible. Thus, the monetary model predicts that the velocity of money will rise [[endogenous | endogenously]] as a result of the excessive increase in the money supply. At the point where ordinary purchases are affected by inflation pressures, hyperinflation is out of control, in the sense that ordinary policy mechanisms, such as increasing reserve requirements, raising interest rates or cutting government spending will all be responded to by shifting away from the rapidly dwindling currency and towards other means of exchange.

During a period of hyperinflation, bank runs, loans for 24 hour periods, switching to alternate currencies, the return to use of gold or silver or even [[barter]] becomes common. Many of the people who hoard gold today expect hyperinflation, and are hedging against it by holding specie.  There is, also, extensive [[capital flight]] or flight to a &quot;hard&quot; currency such as the U.S. dollar. These are sometimes met with [[capital controls]], an idea which has swung from standard, to anathema, and back into semi-respectability. All of this constitutes an economy which is operating in an &quot;abnormal&quot; way, which may lead to decreases in real production. If so, that intensifies the hyperinflation, since it means that the amount of goods in &quot;too much money chasing too few goods&quot; formulation is also reduced. This is also part of the [[vicious circle]] of hyperinflation.

Once the vicious circle of hyperinflation has been ignited, dramatic policy means are almost always required, simply raising interest rates is insufficient.  [[Bolivia]], for example, underwent a period of hyperinflation in 1985, where prices increased 12,000% in the space of less than a year. The government raised the price of gasoline, which it had been selling at a huge loss to quiet popular discontent, and the hyperinflation came to a halt almost immediately, since it was able to bring in hard currency by selling its oil abroad. The crisis of confidence ended, and people returned deposits to banks. The German hyperinflation of the 1920s was ended by producing a currency based on assets loaned against by banks, called the [[rentenmark]]. Hyperinflation often ends when a civil conflict ends with one side winning. Though sometimes used, [[incomes policies|wage and price controls]] to control or prevent inflation, no episode of hyperinflation has been ended by the use of price controls alone, though they have sometimes been part of the mix of policies used to halt hyperinflation.

==Hyperinflation and the currency ==
[[Image:Goldkey logo removed.jpg|thumb|200px|In times of hyperinflation, [[gold]] is a store of value which can not be printed out of existence]]
[[Image:3sovriegns.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Krugerrand]] and three [[Gold sovereign|Sovereigns]]. Gold coins are hoarded to escape inflation.  In times of inflation, the price of gold rises by roughly the devaluation of the paper currency.]]
As noted, in countries experiencing hyperinflation, the [[central bank]] often prints money in larger and larger denominations as the smaller denomination notes become worthless. This can result in the production of some interesting [[banknote]]s, including those denominated in amounts of 1,000,000,000 or more.

* By late [[1923]], the [[Weimar Republic]] of Germany was issuing fifty-million-mark banknotes and postage stamps with a face value of fifty billion marks. The highest value banknote issued by the Weimar government's Reichsbank had a face value of 100 Billion marks (100,000,000,000,000) {100 Trillion US/UK}.  [http://www.sammler.com/coins/inflation.htm]. One of the firms printing these notes submitted an invoice for the work to the Reichsbank for 32,776,899,763,734,490,417.05 (3.28&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;, or 33 [[quintillion]]) Marks.

* The largest denomination banknote ever officially issued for circulation was in 1946 by the [[Hungarian National Bank]] for the amount of 100 quintillion Peng&amp;#337; (100,000,000,000,000,000,000, or 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;). [http://bankjegy.szabadsagharcos.org/xxcentury/p136.htm image] (There was even a banknote worth 10 times more, i.e. 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; Peng&amp;#337;, printed, but not issued [http://bankjegy.szabadsagharcos.org/xxcentury/p137.htm image].) The Post-WWII hyperinflation of Hungary holds the record for the most extreme monthly inflation rate ever — 41,900,000,000,000,000% ({{sn|4.19|16}}%) for July, 1946, amounting to prices doubling every fifteen hours.

One way to avoid the use of large numbers is by declaring a new unit of currency (so, instead of 10,000,000,000 Dollars, a bank might set 1 New Dollar = 1,000,000,000 old Dollars, so the new note would read &quot;10 New Dollars&quot;.) While this does not lessen actual value of a currency, it is called [[revaluation]] and also happens over time in countries with standard inflation levels.  During hyperinflation, currency inflation happens so quickly that bills reach large numbers before revaluation.

Some banknotes were stamped to indicate changes of denomination. This is because it would take too long to print new notes. By time the new notes would be printed, they would be obsolete (that is, they would be of too low a denomination to be useful).

Metallic coins were rapid casualties of hyperinflation, as the scrap value of metal enormously exceeded the face value.  Massive amounts of coinage were melted down, usually illictly, and exported for hard currency.

Governments will often try to disguise the true rate of inflation through a variety of techniques.  These can include the following:
*Outright lying as to official statistics such as money supply, inflation or reserves.
*Suppression of publication of money supply statistics, or inflation indices.
*Price and wage controls.
*Forced savings schemes, designed to suck up excess liquidity.  These savings schemes may be described as pensions schemes, emergency funds, war funds, or similar.
*Adjusting the components of the Consumer Price Index, to remove those items whose prices are rising the fastest.

==Hyperinflation around the world==
;[[Angola]]:Angola went through the worst inflation from 1991 to 1995. In early 1991, the highest denomination was 50,000 Kwanzas. By 1994, it was 500,000 Kwanzas. In the 1995 currency reform, 1 Kwanza Reajustado was exchanged for 1,000 Kwanzas. The highest denomination in 1995 was 5,000,000 Kwanzas Reajustados. In the 1999 currency reform, 1 new Kwanza was exchanged for 1,000,000 Kwanzas Reajustados. The overall impact of hyperinflation: 1 new Kwanza = 1,000,000,000 pre 1991 Kwanzas. 

;[[Argentina]]:Argentina went through steady inflation from 1975 to 1991. At the beginning of 1975, the highest denomination was 1,000 Pesos. In late 1976, the highest denomination was 5,000 Pesos.

;[[Brazil]]: Since 1986 every few years the currency has been renamed, and three zeros dropped from the bank notes. A 1960's Cruzeiro was, in 1994, worth less than one trillionth of a US cent, after adjusting for multiple devaluations and note changes. A new currency called Real was adopted in 1994, after the use of a transitional unit during some months, the URV, and since then inflation was under control.

;[[China]]:China went through the worst inflation 1948-49. In 1947, the highest denomination was 50,000 Yuan. By mid-1948, the highest denomination was 180,000,000 Yuan. The 1948 currency reform replaced the Yuan by the Gold Yuan at an exchange rate of 1 Gold Yuan = 3,000,000 Yuan. In less than 1 year, the highest denomination was 10,000,000 Gold Yuan. The highest denomination by a regional bank was 6,000,000,000 Yuan issued by Sinkiang Provincial Bank in 1949

In the 1944 currency reform, 1 new Drachma was exchanged for 50,000,000,000 Drachmai. Another currency reform in 1953 replaced the Drachma at an exchange rate of 1 new Drachma = 1,000 old Drachma. The overall impact of hyperinflation: 1 (1953) Drachma = 50,000,000,000,000 pre 1944 Drachmai.  The Greek inflation rate reached 8.5 billion percent.

;[[Hungary]]:Hungary went through the worst inflation in modern history in 1945-46. Before 1945, the highest denomination was 1,000 Pengo. By the end of 1945, it was 10,000,000 Pengo. The highest denomination in mid-1946 was 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 Pengo. [http://tomchao.com/hb12.html Banknotes] The rate of inflation was 4.19 quintillion percent. The 1946 currency reform changed the currency to Forint. Previously, between 1922 and 1924 inflation in Hungary reached 98%.

;[[Israel]]: Inflation accelerated in the 1970s, rising steadily from 13% in 1971 to 111% in 1979.From 133% in 1980, it leaped to 191% in 1983 and then to 445% in 1984, threatening to become a four-digit figure within a year or two. In 1985 Israel froze all prices by law.  In 1985, inflation fell to 185% (less than half the rate in 1984).  Within a few months, the authorities began to lift the price freeze on some items; in other cases it took almost a year. In 1986, inflation was down to just 19%.

;[[Republic of Serbian Krajina|Krajina]]:Krajina went through the worst inflation in 1993. In 1992, the highest denomination was 50,000 Dinara. By 1993, the highest denomination was 50,000,000,000 Dinara.  Note that this unrecognized country was reincorporated into Croatia in 1998.

;[[Madagascar]]: The [[Malagasy franc]] had a turbulent time in 2004, losing nearly half its value and sparking rampant inflation.  On 1st January 2005 the [[Malagasy ariary]] replaced the previous currency at a rate of 0.2 ariary for one Malagasy franc.  In May 2005 there were riots over rising inflation, although falling  prices have since calmed the situation.

;[[Nicaragua]]:Nicaragua went through the worst inflation from 1987 to 1990. Before 1987, the highest denomination was 1,000 Cordobas. By 1987, it was 500,000 Cordobas.

;[[Romania]]:Romania is still working through steady inflation. The highest denomination in 1998 was 100,000 Lei. By 2000 it was 500,000 Lei. In early 2005 it was 1,000,000 Lei. In July 2005 the Leu was replaced by the new Leu at 10,000 old Lei = 1 new Leu. Inflation in 2005 was about 10%. In 2006 the highest denomination is 500 Lei (= 5,000,000 old Lei).

;[[Russia]]: Between 1921 and 1922, during the civil war, inflation in Russia reached 213%.

:In 1992, the first year of post-Soviet economic reform, inflation was 2,520%, the major cause being the decontrol of most prices in January. In 1993 the annual rate was 840%, and in 1994, 224%.  The ruble devalued from about 100 r/$ in 1991 to about 30,000 r/$ in 1999.

;[[Taiwan]]: Severe inflation existed in the late 1940s due to factors such as corruption and the [[228 Incident]].  Increasingly higher denominations were issued on the island, up to one million Yuan. Inflation was eventually controlled after the [[New Taiwan Dollar]] was issued in 1949 at a ratio of 40,000-to-1 against the Old Taiwan Nationalist Yuan. 

;[[Turkey]]:Turkey is still working through steady inflation. The highest denomination in 1995 was 1,000,000 Lira. By 2000 it was 20,000,000 Lira. In the 2005 currency reform, 1 new Lira was exchanged for 1,000,000 old Lira. 

;[[Ukraine]]:Ukraine went through the worst inflation between 1993 and 1995. Before 1993, the highest denomination was 1,000 Karbovantsiv. By 1995, it was 1,000,000 Karbovantsiv. 

;[[United States]]:During The Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress authorized the printing of paper &quot;money&quot; called &quot;Continentals&quot;, which depreciated in perceived value [inflated] so quickly and so badly that, soon, they were &quot;not worth a Continental&quot;. Between January 1861 and April 1865, the Lerner Commodity Price Index of leading cities in the Eastern Confederacy increased from 100 to over 9000.

[[image:Yap_Stone_Money.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A large (approximately 8 feet in height) example of Yapese stone money]]

;[[Yap]]: The island of Yap in the Pacific ocean used varying sized stones as money, of which the largest weighing several tons were the most valuable.  The stones had been brought by sea from the Island of Palau 210km away.  The journey was very perilous given the length of the voyage and the rough seas between the islands of Palau and Yap. Many of the stones were lost at sea. The risk associated with  procurement of the &quot;money stones&quot; initially made them highly valuable.  The Yapese valued them because large stones were quite difficult to steal and were in relatively short supply.  However, in 1874, an enterprising Irishman called David O’Keefe hit upon the idea of employing the Yapese to import more &quot;money&quot; in the form of shiploads of large stones, also from Palau.  O'Keefe then traded these stones with the Yapese for other commodities such as sea cucumbers and copra.  Over time, the Yapese brought thousands of new stones to the island, debasing the value of the old ones.  Today they are almost worthless, except as a tourist curiosity.

;[[Yugoslavia]]:Yugoslavia went through a period of hyperinflation and subsequent currency reforms from 1989 to 1994. The highest denomination in 1988 was 50,000 Dinara. By 1989 it was 2,000,000 Dinara. In the 1990 currency reform, 1 new Dinar was exchanged for 10,000 old Dinara. In the 1992 currency reform, 1 new Dinar was exchanged for 10 old Dinara. The highest denomination in 1992 was 50,000 Dinara. By 1993, it was 10,000,000,000 Dinara. In the 1993 currency reform, 1 new Dinar was exchanged for 1,000,000 old Dinara. But before the year was over, the highest denomination was 500,000,000,000 Dinara. In the 1994 currency reform, 1 new Dinar was exchanged for 1,000,000,000 old Dinara. In another currency reform a month later, 1 Novi Dinar was exchanged for 12,000,000 Dinara. The overall impact of hyperinflation: 1 Novi Dinar = {{sn|1.2|27}} pre 1990 Dinara.

;[[Zaire]]:Zaire went through a period of inflation between 1989 and 1996. In 1988, the highest denomination was 5,000 Zaires. By 1992, it was 5,000,000 Zaires. In the 1993 currency reform, 1 Nouveau Zaire was exchanged for 3,000,000 old Zaires. The highest denomination in 1996 was 1,000,000 Nouveaux Zaires. In 1997, Zaire was renamed the Congo Democratic Republic and changed its currency to Francs.  1 franc was exchanged for 100,000 Nouveaux Zaires. The overall impact of hyperinflation: 1 Franc = {{sn|3|11}} pre 1989 Zaires.

;[[Zimbabwe]]: The Zimbabwean dollar was formerly known as the [[Rhodesian dollar]] (R$), which was adopted in [[1970]] following [[decimalisation]] and the replacement of the [[Pound (currency)|pound]] as the currency, at a rate of 2 Rhodesian Dollars = 1 Pound (R$ 0.71 = USD $1.00).   At the time of independence in [[1980]], one Zimbabwean dollar (of 100 cents) was still worth more than the US Dollar  (Z$ 0.68 = USD $1.00), but rampant [[inflation]] and the collapse of the economy have severely devalued the currency, with many organisations using the [[US dollar]] instead.   According to the [[Guinness Book of Records]], Zimbabwe has the highest annual inflation rate in the world:[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/gwr5/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=46680].   (385% in 2003, 624% in January 2004, 360% (average) in 2004 and 585% in 2005.  Zimbabwe's annual rate of inflation is expected to reach a peak of between 700 and 800 percent in the first quarter of 2006.)   By January 25, 2006, there were 100,000 Zimbabwe Dollars per US Dollar (official exchange rate).  The highest denomination regular issue banknote is Z$1,000.00 (about 1c US) but the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has issued Bearer Cheques of Z$5,000; Z$10,000; and Z$20,000 to ease the money supply problem. Effective Feb. 1, 2006, new Z$50,000 Bearer Cheques were issued.

'''Herbert Clark Hoover''' ([[August 10]], [[1874]] &amp;ndash; [[October 20]], [[1964]]), the 31st [[President of the United States]] (1929-1933), was a successful [[mining engineer]], [[humanitarian]], and [[administration|administrator]]. He exemplified the [[Efficiency Movement]] component of the [[Progressive Era]], arguing there were engineering-like technical solutions to all social and economic problems--a position that was challenged by the [[Great Depression]] that began while he was President.

==Family background==
Hoover was born into a [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] family of distant [[Germany|German]] (Pfautz, [[Wehmeyer]]) and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] (Huber, Burkhart) descent, in [[West Branch, Iowa|West Branch]], Iowa. He was the first President to be born west of the Mississippi River. Both of his parents, Jesse Hoover and Hulda Minthorn, died when Hoover was young. His father died in 1880, and his mother in 1884.  

In 1885, eleven-year-old &quot;Bert&quot; Hoover went to [[Newberg, Oregon]] to become the ward of his Uncle John Minthorn, a doctor and real estate developer whom Hoover recalled as &quot;a severe man on the surface, but like all Quakers kindly at the bottom.&quot; 
[[Image:1930-25B-tn.jpg|right|thumb|Hoover lived with his Uncle John Minthorn in this [[Newberg, Oregon]] house from 1885-91.]]

At a young age, Hoover was self-reliant and ambitious. &quot;My boyhood ambition was to be able to earn my own living, without the help of anybody, anywhere,&quot; he once reported. As an office boy in his uncle's Oregon Land Company he mastered bookkeeping and typing, while also attending business school in the evening. Thanks to a local schoolteacher, Miss Jane Gray, the boy's eyes were opened to the novels of [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Sir Walter Scott]]. ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', the story of another orphan cast into the world to live by his wits, would remain a lifelong favorite.

==Education==
[[Image:1893-7-tn.jpg|left|thumb|Hoover (seated, left) and other members of the Stanford surveying squad, [[1893]].]]
In the fall of 1891, Hoover was a member of the first entering class of students at the new [[Stanford University|Leland Stanford Junior University]] in California. Cutting a wider swath outside the classroom than in, Hoover managed the baseball and football teams, started a laundry, and ran a lecture agency. Teaming up with other students from less wealthy backgrounds against campus &quot;swells,&quot; the reluctant candidate was elected student body treasurer on the &quot;Barbarian&quot; slate, then wiped out a student-government debt of $2,000.

Hoover [[Academic major|majored]] in [[geology]] and studied with Professor [[John Casper Branner]], who also got him a summer job mapping terrain in Arkansas' [[Ozark Mountains]]. It was in Branner's lab that he met [[Lou Henry Hoover|Lou Henry]], a banker's daughter born in [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], Iowa, in 1874. Lou shared her fellow Iowan's love of the outdoors and self-reliant nature. &quot;It isn't so important what others think of you as what you feel inside yourself&quot;, she told college friends.

Hoover graduated in May 1895.  In 1899, he married Lou Henry and they had 2 sons. 

[[Image:boxer.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Boxer forces in Tianjin.]] 
He worked as a mining engineer in [[Coolgardie]] and [[Kalgoorlie]]'s [[gold]] mines in [[Australia]] for [[mine]] owners [[Bewick, Moreing and Company]] of London.  They went to [[China]], where he developed coal mines. In June 1900, the [[Boxer Rebellion]] caught the Hoovers in [[Tianjin]]. For almost a month, the settlement was under heavy fire. While his wife worked in the hospitals, Hoover directed the building of barricades, and once risked his life rescuing Chinese children.

Between 1907 and 1912, Lou and Hoover combined their talents to create a translation of one of the earliest printed technical treatises: [[Georg Agricola]]'s '''De re metallica''', originally published in 1556. At 670 pages, with 289 [[woodcuts]], the Hoover translation remains the definitive English language translation of Agricola's work.

==Humanitarian years==
Bored with making money, the Quaker side of Hoover yearned to be of service to others. When [[World War I]] started in August 1914, he helped organize the return home of 120,000 American tourists and businessmen from Europe. Hoover led five hundred volunteers to distribute food, clothing, steamship tickets and cash. &quot;I did not realize it at the moment, but on August 3, 1914 my engineering career was over forever. I was on the slippery road of public life.&quot;  The difference between dictatorship and democracy, Hoover liked to say, was simple: dictators organize from the top down, democracies from the bottom up.

[[Image:HerbertHooveratOWU.jpg|left|thumb|Hoover seated (left) with [[Arthur Flemming]] at [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] ]]
Invaded by Germany, [[Belgium]], in the fall of 1914, faced a food crisis. Hoover undertook an unprecedented relief effort as head of the [[Commission for the Relief of Belgium]] (CRB).  The CRB became, in effect, an independent republic of relief, with its own flag, navy, factories, mills and railroads. Its $12-million-a-month budget was supplied by voluntary donations and government grants. In an early form of shuttle diplomacy, he crossed the North Sea 40 times seeking to persuade the enemies in London and Berlin to allow food to reach the war's victims. Long before the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice of 1918]], he was an international hero. The Belgian town of [[Leuven]] named a prominent square after him.

After the United States entered the war in April 1917, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] appointed Hoover head of the American [[Food Administration]], with headquarters in Washington. He succeeded in cutting consumption of food needed overseas and avoided rationing at home, yet kept the [[Allies]] fed. After the end of the war, Hoover, a member of the [[Supreme Economic Council]] and head of the [[American Relief Administration]], organized shipments of food for starving millions in [[Central Europe]]. To this end, he employed a newly formed Quaker organization, the [[American Friends Service Committee]] to carry out much of the logistical work in Europe. He extended aid to famine-stricken [[Bolshevist Russia]] in 1921. When a critic inquired if he was not thus helping [[Bolshevism]], Hoover retorted, &quot;Twenty million people are starving. Whatever their politics, they shall be fed!&quot;

In 1919, Hoover co-founded the [[Hoover Institute|The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace]] at Stanford.  The Institute is a conservative/libertarian public policy think tank and library that, over time, has amassed a huge archive of documentation related to Hoover, World War I, and World War II, specifically focusing on the root causes of these wars.

==Commerce Secretary==
Hoover was touted as a possible Democratic presidential candidate in 1920, but he announced his support for [[Warren G. Harding]]. As [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]], Hoover became one of the most visible men in the country, often overshadowing presidents Harding and [[Calvin Coolidge]].  His major achievement was in pushing progressive ideals in the business world, especially in the areas of standardization and international trade. He led relief efforts in the wake of the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]].

==Election of 1928==
Hoover won the [[U.S. presidential election, 1928|Republican Presidential nomination in 1928]]. He campaigned against [[Al Smith]] on the basis of efficiency and prosperity.  Although Smith was the target of anti-Catholicism from the Baptist and Lutheran communities, Hoover avoided the religious issue. (Quakers for that matter were under some attack as pacifists.) He supported prohibition tentatively (calling it a &quot;noble experiment&quot;). Historians agree that Hoover's national reputation, and the booming economy, combined with the deep splits in the Democratic party over religion and prohibition, guaranteed his landslide victory.

On poverty he promised: &quot;We in America today are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the history of any land.&quot; Within months, the [[Stock Market Crash of 1929]] occurred, and the nation's economy spiraled downward into what became known as the [[Great Depression]].

==Presidency 1929-1933==
===Policies===
Even if the Hoover presidency has a negative imprint on it, it must be noted that there were some important reforms under the Hoover administration. 

The President expanded civil service protection, cancelled private oil leases on government lands and led the way for the prosecution of gangster [[Al Capone]]. He appointed a commission which set aside 3 million acres (12,000 km²) of [[national park]]s and 2.3 million of national forests; he appointed a [[Federal Farm Board]] that tried to fix farm prices; advocated tax reduction for low-income Americans; doubled the numbers of veteran hospital facilities; negotiated a treaty on St. Lawrence Seaway (which failed in the Senate); signed an act that made ''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]'' the [[national anthem]]; wrote a Children's Charter that advocated protection of every child regardless of race or gender; built the [[San Francisco Bay Bridge]]; created an antitrust division in the [[Justice Department]]; required air mail carriers to improve service; proposed federal loans for urban slum clearances; organized the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]; reorganized the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]; proposed a federal Department of Education; advocated fifty-dollar-a-month [[pension]]s for Americans over 65; chaired White House conferences on child health, protection, homebuilding and homeownership. He also signed the [[Norris-La Guardia Act]] that limited judicial intervention in labor disputes. 

In the foreign arena, he helped to pave the way for [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s &quot;Good Neighbor Policy&quot; by withdrawing American troops from [[Nicaragua]] and [[Haiti]]; he also proposed an arms embargo on Latin America and a one-third reduction in the world's naval forces--the [[Hoover Plan]]. He and Secretary of State [[Henry Stimson]] outlined the [[Stimson Doctrine|Hoover-Stimson Doctrine]] that said the United States would not recognize territories gained by force.

===Hoover and the economy===
{{main|Great Depression}}
After the crash, Hoover announced that while he would keep the Federal budget balanced, he would cut taxes and expand public-works spending. However, he signed the [[Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act]], which raised tariffs on over 20,000 dutiable items, and, later, the 1932 Revenue Act, which hiked taxes and fees (including postage rates) across the board. These acts are often blamed for deepening the depression, and being Hoover's biggest political blunders. Moreover, the Federal Reserve System's tightening of the money supply (for fear of inflation) is also regarded by most modern economists as a mistaken tactic, given the situation. Hoover's [[Secretary of the Treasury]] was [[Andrew Mellon]], a holdover from the Coolidge administration. 

Hoover's stance on the economy was based on [[volunteerism]]. From before his entry to the presidency, he was among the greatest proponents of the concept that public-private cooperation was the way to achieve high long-term growth. Hoover feared that too much intervention or coercion by the government would destroy individuality and self-reliance, which he considered to be important [[American values]]. Though he was not averse to taking action which he considered was in the public good, such as regulating radio broadcasting and aviation, he preferred a voluntary, non-government approach.

In June 1931, to deal with a very serious banking collapse in [[Central Europe]] that threatened to cause a worldwide financial meltdown, Hoover issued the so-called [[Hoover Moratorium]] that called for a one-year halt in [[reparations]] payments by Germany to France and in the payment of Allied war debts to the United States. The Hoover Moratorium had the effect of temporarily stopping the banking collapse in Europe. In June 1932, a conference canceled all reparations payments by Germany.

Hoover's economy was put to the test with the onset of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929. It was his vocal stance on non-intervention that led to public perception that he was a [[laissez-faire]], 'do nothing' president, which his supporters deny. His pro-free-market opponents also deny he was a laissez-faire president and condemn him for being intervenionist.

The following is an outline of other actions Hoover took to try to help end the Depression through government taxing and spending:  

#Signed the [[Emergency Relief and Construction Act]], the nation's first Federal [[unemployment]] assistance.
#Increased public works spending. Some of Hoover's efforts to stimulate the economy through public works are as follows:
##Asked Congress for a $400 million increase in the Federal Building Program
##Directed the [[Department of Commerce]] to establish a Division of Public Construction in December 1929
##Increased subsidies for ship construction through the Federal Shipping Board
##Urged the state governors to also increase their [[public works]] spending, though many failed to take any action.
#Signed the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Act]] establishing the [[Federal Home Loan Bank]] system to assist citizens in obtaining financing to purchase a home.
#Increased subsidies to the nation's struggling farmers with the [[Agricultural Marketing Act]], but with only limited impact.
#Established the President's [[Emergency Relief Organization]] to coordinate local, private relief efforts resulting in over 3,000 relief committees across the U.S.
#Urged bankers to form the [[National Credit Corporation]] to assist banks in financial trouble and protect depositors' money.
#Actively encouraged businesses to maintain high wages during the Depression, in line with the philosophy, called [[Fordism]], that high wages create prosperity.  Most corporations maintained their workers' wages early in the Depression in the hope that more money into the pockets of consumers would end the economic downturn. 
#Signed the [[Reconstruction Finance Act]]. This act established the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]], which made loans to the states for public works and unemployment relief. In addition, the RFC made loans to banks, railroads and agriculture credit organizations. 
#Raised tariffs.  After hearings held by the [[House Ways and Means Committee]] generated more than 20,000 pages of testimony regarding tariff protection, Congress responded with legislation that Hoover signed despite some misgivings. Instead of protecting American jobs, the [[Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act|Smoot-Hawley tariff]] is widely blamed for setting off a worldwide trade war which only worsened the country's (and the world's) economic ills.

[[Image:Hhover.gif|right|thumb|Hoover's White House portrait]]

In order to pay for these and other government programs, Hoover agreed to one of the largest tax increases in American history. The [[Revenue Act of 1932]] raised taxes on the highest incomes from 25% to 63%. The [[estate tax]] was doubled and [[corporate tax]]es were raised by almost 15%. Also, a &quot;check tax&quot; was included that placed a 2-cent tax (over 30 cents in today's dollars) on all bank checks. Economists William D. Lastrapes and George Selgin, in ''The Check Tax: Fiscal Folly and The Great Monetary Contraction'', conclude that the check tax was &quot;an important contributing factor to that period's severe monetary contraction.&quot; [http://www.terry.uga.edu/~

(in Japanese: 本田技研工業株式会社, in romaji: ''Honda Giken K&amp;#333;gy&amp;#333; Kabushiki Kaisha'') {{tyo|7267}} ({{nyse|HMC}}), is a [[Japan]]ese [[manufacturer]] of [[automobile|automobiles]], [[truck|trucks]], [[motorcycle|motorcycles]], and [[scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]]s.  They also make [[all-terrain vehicle|ATVs]], water craft, [[electrical generator|electrical generators]], marine engines, and lawn and garden equipment. With more than 14 [[million]] [[internal combustion engine]]s built each year, Honda is the largest engine-maker in the world. In [[2004]], the company began to produce [[diesel]] motors, which were both very quiet whilst not requiring particulate filters to pass pollution standards.  Honda's high-end line of cars are branded [[Acura]] in [[North America]]. It is arguable, however, that the foundation of Honda's success is the motorcycle division, for which the name is still probably the best known.

Honda is headquartered in [[Tokyo]]. Their shares trade on the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]], the [[New York Stock Exchange]], as well as exchanges in [[Osaka, Osaka|Osaka]], [[Nagoya]], [[Sapporo]], [[Kyoto]], [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]], [[London]], [[Paris]] and [[Switzerland]]. American Honda Motor Co., is based in  Torrance, CA. Honda Canada is based in [[Alliston, Ontario]].

==Company history==

[[image:honda.rune.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 1832cc Honda Rune motorcycle]]

[[Soichiro Honda]] began by manufacturing [[piston]] rings in [[November]] [[1937]].  He quickly became a sub-contractor to [[Toyota]], and then expanded into other engine parts.  

On [[September 24]], [[1948]] the Honda Motor Co. was founded. Soichiro Honda took advantage of a gap in the Japanese market that was decimated by [[World War II]], Japan was starved of money and fuel, but still in need of basic [[transport]].  Honda, utilizing his manufacturing facilities, attached an engine to a bicycle, creating the cheap and efficient transport that was required.

The Honda piston manufacturing facilities were almost completely destroyed. Soichiro Honda created a new company with what he had left, giving it the unusual name of &quot;Honda Giken Kōgyō Kabushiki Kaisha&quot; which translates to &quot;Honda Research Institute Co. Ltd.&quot; Despite its grandiose name, the first facility bearing that name was a simple wooden shack where Mr. Honda and associates would fit engines to bicycles. Interestingly, the official Japanese name for Honda Motor Co. Ltd. remains the same, in honor of Soichiro Honda's efforts.

Honda quickly began to produce a range of scooters and motorcycles and Soichiro Honda quickly recovered from the losses incurred during the war.  By the late [[1960s]], Honda had conquered most world markets. The [[United Kingdom|British]] were especially slow to respond to the Honda introduction of [[electric starter]]s to motorcycles.  By the [[1970s]], Honda was the largest producer of motorcycles in the world, a title it has never relinquished.

Honda began producing road cars in [[1960]], mostly intended for the Japanese market.  Though participating in international [[motorsport]] (see [[#Racing history|Racing]]), Honda was having difficulty selling its automobiles in the [[United States]].  Built for Japanese buyers, Honda's small cars had failed to gain the interest of American buyers.

Honda finally established a foothold in the American market in [[1972]] with the introduction of the [[Honda Civic|Civic]]&amp;mdash;larger than their previous models, but still small compared to the typical American car&amp;mdash;just as the [[1970s]] [[energy crisis]] was impacting worldwide economies.  New emissions laws in the US, requiring American car makers to affix expensive [[catalytic converter]]s to exhaust systems, noticeably increased sticker prices.  However, Honda's introduction of the 1975 Civic [[CVCC]], CVCC being a variation on the [[stratified charge engine]], allowed the Civic to pass emissions tests without a catalytic converter.

In [[1976]], the [[Honda Accord|Accord]] was immediately popular because of its economy and fun-to-drive nature; Honda had found its niche in the United States.  In [[1982]], Honda was the first Japanese car manufacturer to build [[factory|car plants]] in the US, starting with an Accord plant in [[Marysville, Ohio]].  They now have plants in [[Marysville, Ohio|Marysville]], [[Anna, Ohio|Anna]], and [[East Liberty, Ohio|East Liberty]], as well as in [[Lincoln, Alabama|Lincoln]], [[Alabama]] ([[Honda Manufacturing of Alabama]]), and [[Timmonsville, South Carolina|Timmonsville]], [[South Carolina (U.S. state)|South Carolina]], and plan to open a new plant in [[Tallapoosa, Georgia|Tallapoosa]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  Honda's North American and U.S. headquarters are located in [[Torrance, California]]. Honda's Canadian and many US-market Civics are manufactured in their plant in [[Alliston, Ontario]] since [[1985]].

Honda was also the first Japanese automaker to introduce a separate luxury line of vehicles.  Created in 1986 and known as [[Acura]], the line is made up of modified versions of Honda vehicles usually with more power and sportiness than their Honda counterparts.  

In [[1989]]  Honda launched their [[VTEC]] [[variable valve timing]] system in its production car engines, which gave improved efficiency and performance across a broader range of engine speeds. One of the first of its kind in passenger vehicles, it worked on the premise of tuning one engine to operate at two different 'settings' depending on load. Normal driving would use a &quot;shorter&quot; cam lobe that resulted in more efficient operation. A more aggressive, longer duration, cam  engages when engine RPM reaches a set point resulting in more power during hard acceleration.

For the [[2007]] model year, Honda plans to improve the safety of its vehicles by providing front-seat side [[airbag]]s, side-curtain airbags, and [[anti-lock brakes]] as standard equipment in all automobiles available in North America (except the [[Honda Insight|Insight]], [[Honda S2000|S2000]], and [[Acura NSX]], which will not have side-curtain airbags).  By [[2006]], Honda plans to have as standard equipment Vehicle Safety Assist and rollover sensors in all light trucks, including the [[Honda CR-V|CR-V]], [[Honda Odyssey|Odyssey]], and [[Acura MDX]]. Honda also plans to make its vehicles safer for pedestrians, with more safely-designed hoods, hinges, frame constructs, and breakaway wiper pivots.

==Racing history==
:''See also [[Honda F1]]''

Soichiro Honda, being a race driver himself, could not stay out of international [[motorsport]].  In [[1959]], Honda entered five motorcycles into the [[Isle of Man TT]] race, the most prestigious motorcycle race in the world.  While always having good power, it took until [[1961]] for Honda to tune their chassis well enough to allow [[Mike Hailwood]] to claim their first race victories in the 125 and 250 [[Cubic centimetre|cc]] classes.  Hailwood would later pick up their first senior TT win in [[1966]].

In [[1968]], [[Jo Schlesser]] was killed in a Honda RA302 at the [[1968 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]].  This racing tragedy, coupled with their commercial difficulties selling automobiles in the [[United States]], prompted Honda to withdraw from all international motorsport that year.

In [[2003]], Honda became an engine supplier to the [[Indy Racing League]]. In 2004, Honda-powered cars won 14 of 16 IRL events, including the Indianapolis 500, and claimed the IRL Manufacturers' Championship, Drivers' Championship and Rookie of the Year titles.

==Honda's strategy==
[[image:goldwing.rally.bristol.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Honda Goldwing]]]]
During the 1960s, when it was a small manufacturer, Honda broke out of the Japanese motorcycle [[market]] and began exporting to the US. Taking Honda&amp;rsquo;s story as an archetype of the smaller manufacturer entering a new market already occupied by highly dominant competitors, the story of their market entry, and their subsequent huge success in the US and around the world, has been the subject of some academic controversy. Competing explanations have been advanced to explain Honda&amp;rsquo;s strategy and the reasons for their success.

The first of these explanations was put forward when, in 1975, [[Boston Consulting Group]] (BCG) was commissioned by the [[United Kingdom|UK]] government to write a report explaining why and how the British motorcycle industry had been out-competed by its Japanese competitors. The report concluded that the Japanese firms, including Honda, had sought a very high scale of production (they had made a large number of motorbikes) in order to benefit from [[economies of scale]] and [[learning curve]] effects. It blamed the decline of the British motorcycle industry on the failure of British managers to invest enough in their businesses to profit from economies of scale and [[economies of scope|scope]].

The second story is told in [[1984]] by [[Richard Pascale]], who had interviewed the Honda executives responsible for the firm&amp;rsquo;s entry into the US market. As opposed to the tightly focused strategy of low cost and high scale that BCG accredited to Honda, Pascale found that their entry into the US market was a story of &amp;ldquo;miscalculation, serendipity, and organizational learning&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; in other words, Honda&amp;rsquo;s success was due to the adaptability (and hard work) of its staff, rather than any long term strategy. For example, Honda&amp;rsquo;s initial plan on entering the US was to compete in large motorcycles, around 300cc. It was only when the team found that the scooters they were using to get themselves around their US base of [[San Francisco]] attracted positive interest from consumers that they came up with the idea of selling the [[Supercub]].

The most recent school of thought on Honda&amp;rsquo;s strategy was put forward by [[Gary Hamel]] and [[C. K. Prahalad]] in [[1989]]. Creating the concept of [[core competency|core competencies]] with Honda as an example, they argued that Honda&amp;rsquo;s success was due to its focus on leadership in the technology of internal combustion engines. For example, the high power-to-weight ratio engines Honda produced for its racing bikes provided technology and expertise which was transferable into mopeds.

Honda's entry into the US motorcycle market during the 1960s is used as a [[case study]] for teaching introductory strategy at many [[business school]]s worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Redirect|Handball}}
'''Handball''' (also known as '''team handball''', '''field handball''' or '''Olympic handball''') is a [[team sport]] where two teams of seven players each (six players and a goalkeeper) pass and bounce a ball trying to throw it in the goal of the opposing team.

The game is similar to [[football (soccer)|football]] (soccer), regardless of the basic method of handling the ball which is inverse from football. It has been played internationally since the first half of the 20th century.

==Field and ball== 
Handball is played on a field forty meters long by twenty meters wide, with a dividing line in the middle and a goal in the center of either end. The goals are surrounded by a near-semicircular line that is generally six meters away from the goal. There is also a dashed near-semicircular line that is nine meters away from the goal.

Only the defending [[goalkeeper]] is allowed to step inside the six meter perimeter, though any player may attempt to catch and touch the ball in the air within it. If a player should find himself in contact inside the goal perimeter he must immediately take the most direct path out of it. Should a defender make contact with an attacker while in the goal perimeter, their team is penalized with a direct attempt at the goal, with only one attacker on the seven-meter line and the defending goalkeeper involved.

The ball is smaller than a [[football (ball)|football]] in order for the players to be able to hold and handle it with a single hand (though contact with both hands is perfectly allowed). It is transported by bouncing it between hands and floor &amp;mdash; much as in [[basketball]]. A player may only hold the ball for three seconds and may only take three steps with the ball in hand.

==Game play==
A standard match duration consists of two periods of 30 minutes each, during which each team may call one time-out. Normal league games are usually allowed to end in a draw, but in knockout tournaments, such as the final stages of the Olympics etc, if a game ends in a tie, two extension periods of 10 minutes are played, and if each of them ends in a tie as well, the tie-break is an individual shootout from the 7-meter line.

The game is quite fast and includes much contact as the defenders try to bodily stop the attackers from approaching the goal. Only frontal contact by the defenders is allowed; when a defender stops an attacker with their arms on the side, the play is stopped and restarted from the nine meter line, with the attacking team in possession. If the contact between the players is particularly rough (even if it is indeed frontal), the [[referee]]s may award a nine-meter penalty to the attacking team, or a seven-meter penalty. In more extreme cases, they give the defender a [[yellow card|yellow]] (warning) or a [[red card]] (permanent expulsion). For rough fouls they can also order two-minute expulsions, and the third two-minute punishment for the same player automatically leads to a red card expulsion.

Conversely, if the attacker is at fault the possession of the ball can be awarded to the defending team. Players may also cause the possession to be lost if they make more than three steps per one bounce of the ball off the floor.

The usual formations of the defense are the so-called 6-0, when all the defense players are within the 6 meter and 9 meter lines; the 5-1, when one of the players cruises outside the 9 meter perimeter, usually targeting the center forwards; and the least common 4-2 when there are two such defenders. The usual attacking formation includes two wingmen, a center-left and a center-right which usually excel at high jumps and shooting over the defenders, and two centers, one of which tends to intermingle with the defense (somewhat similar to the hole set (anchor) in [[water polo]]), disrupting the defense formation, and the other being the playmaker (similar to basketball).

==History==
Team handball has origins reaching as far back as the [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]: ''urania'' in [[ancient Greece]], ''harpaston'' in [[ancient Rome]], ''fangballspiel'' in medieval [[Germany]], etc. There are also records of handball-like games in medieval [[France]], and among the [[Inuit]]s on [[Greenland]], in the [[Middle Ages]]. By the 19th century, there existed similar games of ''haandbold'' from [[Denmark]], ''hazena'' in [[Bohemia]] and [[Slovakia]], ''gandbol'' in [[Ukraine]], ''torball'' in [[Germany]], as well as versions in [[Ireland]] and [[Uruguay]].

The team handball game as we know it today was formed by the end of the [[19th century]] in northern [[Europe]], primarily [[Denmark]], [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]]. The Dane Holger Nielsen drew up rules for a handball game (''håndbold'') in [[1898]] (and published them in [[1906]]), and R.N. Ernst did something similar in [[1897]].

The first set of team handball rules was published on [[October 29]], [[1917]] by Max Heiser, Karl Schelenz and Erich Konigh from Germany. After [[1919]] these rules were further improved by Karl Schelenz. The first international games were played under these rules, between Germany and Belgium for men in [[1925]] and Germany and Austria for women in [[1930]].

In [[1926]], the Congress of the International Amateur Athletics Federation nominated a committee to draw up international rules for field handball. The International Amateur Handball Federation was formed in [[1928]]. The International Handball Federation was formed later in [[1946]]

Men's field handball was played at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in [[Berlin]] at the special request of [[Adolf Hitler]]. It was removed from the list of sports, to return as team handball in [[1972]] for the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]]. Women's team handball was added as an Olympic discipline in [[1976]], at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]].

The International Handball Federation has organized Men's World Championships in 1938, and then every two, three or sometimes four years since the [[World War II]]. The Women's World Championships have been played since [[1957]]. The IHF also organizes Women's and Men's Junior World Championships.

The IHF reports to have 150 member federations representing approximately 800,000 teams and more than nearly 19 million sportsmen and women.

==DECISIONS==
{{cleanup-section}}

''Administrative Behavior''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;was Herbert Simon’s doctoral dissertation and his first book. It served as the foundation for his lifetime of work. The centerpiece of  this book  is the behavioral and cognitive processes of making rational human choices, that is, decisions. An operational administrative decision should be correct and efficient, and it must be practical to implement with a set of coordinated means.

Any decision involves a choice selected from a number of alternatives, directed toward an organizational goal or subgoal. Realistic options will have real consequences consisting of personnel actions or non-actions modified by environmental facts and values. In actual practice, some of the alternatives may be conscious or unconscious; some of the consequences may be unintended as well as intended; some of the means and ends may be imperfectly differentiated,incompletely related,or poorly detailed.

The task of rational decision making is to select the alternative that results in the more preferred set of all the possible consequences. This task can be divided into three required steps:(1)the identification and listing of all the alternatives; (2)the determination of all the consequences  resulting from each of the alternatives; and(3)the comparison of the accuracy  and efficiency  of each of these sets of consequences.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Any given individual or organization attempting to implement this model in a real situation would be unable to comply with the three requirements.To have the knowledge of all the alternatives,or of all the consequences to follow each alternative is a highly improbable situation. Even much less likely will be the capacity to make an evaluation of all the consequences.

The terrifying question that presents itself at this point is : Given the inevitable limits on rational decision making,what other techniques or behavioral processes can a man,woman,group or organization bring to bear to achieve the approximately best result?  Simon writes:“The human being striving for rationality and restricted within the limits of his knowledge has developed some working procedures that partially overcome these difficulties. These procedures consist in assuming that he can isolate from the rest of the world a closed system containing a limited number of variables and a limited range of consequences.”&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

Administrative Behavior, as a text, addresses a wide range of human behaviors, cognitive abilities, management techniques, personnel policies, training goals and procedures, specialized roles, criteria for evaluation of accuracy and efficiency, and,of course, all of the ramifications of communication processes.  Simon is particularly interested in how these factors directly and indirectly influence the making of decisions.

Weaving in and out of the practical functioning of all of these organizational factors are two universal elements of human social behavior that Simon addresses in Chapter VII—The Role of Authority&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and in Chapter X—Loyalities, and Organizational Identification.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; 

Authority is a well studied, primary mark of organizational behavior, and is straightforwardly defined in the organizational context as the ability and right of an individual of higher rank to determine the decision of an individual of lower rank. The actions, attitudes, and relationships of the dominant and subordinate individuals constitute components of role behavior that can vary widely in form,style,and content,but do not vary in the expectation of obedience by the one of superior status, and willingness to obey from the suborninate. Authority is highly influential on the formal structure of the organization, including patterns of communication, sanctions,and rewards as well as on establishing the goals, objectives , and values of the organization. 

Decisions can be complex admixtures of facts and values. Information about facts, especially empirically proven facts,or facts derived from specialized experience are more easily transmitted in the exercise of authority than are the expressions of values.Simon is primarily interested in seeking identification of the individual employee with the organizational goals and values. Following Lasswell&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; he states that “a person identifies himself with a group when, in making a decision, he evaluates the several alternatives of choice in terms of their consequences for the specified group”&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;. A person may identify himself, or herself with any number of social, geographic, economic, racial, religious, familial, educational, gender, political, and sports groups. Indeed, the number and variety are unlimited, and ubiquitous. The fundamental problem for organizations is to recognize that personal and group identifications can either facilitate or obstruct correct decision making for the organization. A specific organization has to deliberately determine and specify in appropriate detail and clear language its own goals, objectives, means, ends, and values.
It is further desired that these important factors be internalized in the psychology of the individual participants. 

Chester Bernard is cited as responsible for pointing out that “the decisions that an individual makes as a member of an organization are quite distinct from his personal decisions”&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;. Personal choices may determine whether an individual joins a particular organization, and continue to be made in his or her extra–organizational private life. But,as a member of an organization, that individual makes decisions not in relationship to personal needs and results, but in an impersonal sense as part of the organizational intent, purpose, and effect. Organizational inducements, rewards, and sanctions are all designed to form, strengthen, and maintain this identification.

The correctness of decisions are measured by two major criteria:1.adequacy of achieving the desired objective; and 2.the efficiency with which the result was obtained. Many members of the organization may focus on adequacy,but the overall administrative management must pay particular attention to the efficiency with which the desired result was abtained with the utilization or expenditure of minimum resources.

==Interesting quotes==
* Most producers are employees, not owners of the firms..... Viewed from the vantage point of classical [economic] theory, they have no reason to maximize the profits of the firms, except to the extent that they can be controlled by owners.... Moreover, there is no difference, in this respect, among profit-making firms, non-profit organizations, and bureaucratic organizations. All have exactly the same problem of inducing their employees to work toward the organizational goals. There is no reason, a priori, why it should be easier (or harder) to produce this motivation in organizations aimed at maximizing profits than in organizations with different goals. The conclusion that organization motivated by profits will be more efficient than other organizations does not follow the organizational economy from the neo-classical assumptions. If it is empirically true, other axioms will have to be introduced to account for it.

* &quot;What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. '''Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention''', and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.&quot; (''Computers, Communications and the Public Interest'', pages 40-41, Martin Greenberger, ed., The Johns Hopkins Press, 1971.)

'''Hematite''' ([[American English|AE]]) or '''haematite''' ([[British English|BE]]) is the [[mineral]] form of [[Iron (III) oxide]], (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), one of several [[iron oxide]]s. The [[ore]] sometimes contains slight amounts of [[titanium]]. When shaped into ornaments, it is often called black diamond.

[[Image:Hematite.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Hematite (kidney ore) from Michigan]]

Hematite is a very common mineral, coloured black to steel or silver-gray, brown to reddish brown, or red. It is [[mining|mined]] as the main ore of iron. Varieties include Bloodstone, Iron Rose, Kidney Ore, Martite, Paint Ore, Specularite (Specular Hematite), Rainbow Hematite and Titano-hematite. While the forms of hematite vary, they all have a rust-red streak. Hematite is harder than pure iron, but much more brittle.

Deposits of grey hematite are typically found in places where there has been standing water or mineral [[hot spring]]s, such as those in [[Yellowstone]]. The mineral can [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] out of water and collect in layers at the bottom of a lake, spring, or other standing water. But hematite can also occur without water, as the result of [[Volcano|volcanic]] activity.

[[Clay]]-sized hematite crystals can also occur as a secondary mineral formed by weathering processes in [[soil]], and along with other iron oxides or oxyhydroxides such as [[goethite]], is responsible for the red color of many tropical, ancient, or otherwise highly weathered soils.

The name hematite is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for blood, since sometimes hematite can be red, as in [[Rouge]], a powderized form of hematite. It shares this root with the word [[hemoglobin]]. Hemoglobin is the oxygen-transporting molecule in [[red blood cell]]s, the iron of which causes blood to be red. The color of hematite lends it well in use as a pigment.

[[Image:Rainbow_hematite_MG.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Rainbow Hematite from Brazil]]

Especially nice specimens of hematite come from [[England]], [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], [[Australia]] and the [[Lake Superior]] region of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

Hematite is an [[antiferromagnetic]] material below the Morin transition at 260K, and a canted antiferromagnet or weakly [[ferromagnetic]] above the Morin transition.

==Hematite on Mars==

Hematite can be formed by aqueous processes, [[weathering]] processes, or without water. In 2004, NASA's [[Mars Exploration Rover Mission|Mars rover]] ''[[MER-B|Opportunity]]'' discovered small spheres believed to be made partly or mostly of hematite. The spheres are only a few millimeters in diameter and are believed to have formed as rock deposites under watery conditions billions of years ago when [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] was a wetter world. The rover used its instruments (a [[Mössbauer spectrometer|Mössbauer spectrometer]]) to test how the hematite found on Mars at Meridiani Planum was formed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Holocene extinction event''' is a name customarily given to the widespread, ongoing [[extinction]] of species occurring in the modern [[Holocene]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]]. The extinctions vary from [[mammoth]]s to [[Dodo]]s, to countless species in the rainforest dying every year.  Because some believe  the rate of this [[extinction event]] is comparable to the &quot;Big Five&quot; mass extinctions, it is also known as the '''Sixth Extinction''', though the actual numbers of extinct species are not yet similar to the major mass extinctions of the geologic past.

In broad usage, the Holocene extinction event includes the remarkable disappearance of large mammals, known as [[megafauna]], near the end of the [[last ice age]] between 9,000 and 13,000 years ago.  Such disappearances have been considered as either a response to climate change, a result of the spread and proliferation of [[modern human]]s, or both.  These extinctions, occurring near the [[Pleistocene]] / Holocene boundary, are sometimes referred to as the '''Pleistocene extinction event''' or Ice Age extinction event.  

The observed rate of extinction has risen dramatically in the last 50 years.  There is no general agreement on whether to consider more recent extinctions as a distinct event or merely part of a single escalating process.  Only during these most recent parts of the extinction have [[plant]]s also suffered large losses. Overall, the Holocene extinction event is most significantly characterised by the presence of man-made driving factors and its very short [[geological timescale]] (tens to thousands of years) compared to most other extinction events.

==The prehistoric extinction events==
The current ongoing extinction event seems more outstanding if we follow tradition and separate the recent extinction (approx. since the [[industrial revolution]]) from the extinction near the end of the last ice age. In [[caveman|popular imagination]] the latter is exemplified by the extinction of the woolly [[mammoth]] and, incorrectly, the [[Neanderthal]] people. 

However, it is worth remembering that modern [[climatology]] suggests the Holocene epoch we live in is no more than the latest in a series of [[interglacial]] intervals between [[glaciation]] events, one that will perhaps become artificially extended by [[global warming]]. Furthermore, there is a continuum of extinctions between 13,000 years ago and now. If only considering human impact, the vulnerability and extinction rate of species simply rises with the rise of technology, so there would be no need to separate both events. Nevertheless, the Pleistocene extinction event is large enough and hasn't been resolved completely.

===The Pleistocene or Ice Age extinction event===

The Ice Age extinction event is characterised by the extinction of large mammals weighing more than 40 kg. In [[North America]] around 33 of 45 [[genus|genera]] of large mammals went extinct, in [[South America]] 46 of 58, in [[Australia]] 15 of 16, in [[Europe]] 7 of 23, and in [[Subsaharan Africa]] only 2 of 44. The South American extinction witnessed the aftermath of the [[Great American Interchange]]. Only in South America and Australia did the extinction occur at family-level or higher.

There are two main hypotheses concerning this extinction:
*The animals died off because of [[climate change]]: the retreat of the [[ice cap]]
*The animals were exterminated by humans: the &quot;prehistoric overkill hypothesis&quot; (Martin, 1967)

The prehistoric overkill hypothesis is not universally applicable, and is imperfectly confirmed. For instance, the timing of sudden megafaunal extinctions of large [[Australia]]n [[marsupial]]s and a giant lizard, events that followed the arrival of human beings in Australia by many thousand years, need examining. Biologists note that comparably scaled extinctions have not occurred in [[Africa]] either, where the fauna evolved with hominids. Post-glacial megafaunal extinctions in Africa have been spaced over a longer interval.

An alternative to the theory of human responsibility is [[Tollmann's hypothetical bolide|Alexander Tollmann's bolide theory]], a more controversial hypothesis that claims that the [[Holocene]] was initiated by an [[extinction event]] caused by [[bolide]] impacts.

====Major megafaunal extinctions====
=====Europe=====
(circa 15,000 years ago)
* [[Woolly Mammoth]]
* [[Woolly Rhinoceros]]
* [[Irish Elk]]
* [[Cave Lion]]
* [[Cave Bear]]
* [[Giant Hyaena]]

=====Mediterranean Islands=====
(by 9000 years ago)
* a pygmy [[hippopotamus]] (''Phanourios minutus'') of [[Cyprus]]
* the Balearic Islands Cave Goat (''[[Myotragus_balearicus|Myotragus balearicus]]'') of [[Majorca]] and [[Minorca]]
* [[dwarf elephant]]s: ''Palaeoloxodon cypriotes'' of Cyprus, ''P. falconeri'' of [[Sicily]] and [[Malta]]
* Giant [[Swan]] (''Cygnus falconeri'') of Malta
* Giant [[Rat]] of Majorca

=====North America=====
(circa 12,000-9000 years BP), 35 to 40 species of large mammals (and only about half a dozen small mammals, such as mice and rats) disappeared. Previous North American extinction pulses had occurred at the end of glaciations, but not with such an imbalance between large mammals and small ones. The megafaunal extinctions include twelve genera of edible grazers ('''G'''), and five large, dangerous carnivores ('''C'''). North American extinctions included

&lt;!--please substantuate this general list--&gt;
* American [[Horse]]s, five species (Asian horses survived) ('''G''') 
* a few species of  Western [[Camel]]s ('''G''')
* North American [[llama|llamas]] ('''G''')
* Deer, two genera ('''G''')
* Pronghorn, two genera (one survived) ('''G''')
* Stag-Moose, Shrub-Oxen, Woodland Muskoxen (an Arctic one survived) ('''G''')
* Giant Beaver
* Shasta [[Ground Sloth]] and other Ground Sloths
* [[Arctodus|Short-Faced Bear]]s (larger than the present [[Grizzly Bear]]), ''cf'' [[Cave Bear]] ('''C''')
* [[Saber-toothed cat]]s ('''C''')
* American Lion (larger than the current African [[Lion]] but probably a fairly recent immigrant through [[Beringia]]) ('''C''')
* American Cheetah ('''C''')
* [[Dire Wolf]] ('''C''')
* [[Mammoth]], several species 
* American [[Mastodont]], ''Mammut americanum''
* The giant progenitor sub-species of the surviving [[Bison]]
* Giant [[Peccary]]

The survivors are as significant as the losses: [[Bison]], [[Moose]] (recent immigrants through [[Beringia]]), [[Wapiti]] ([[Red Deer|Elk]]), [[Caribou]], [[Deer]], Pronghorn, Muskox, Bighorn Sheep, Mountain Goat. All save the Pronghorns descended from Asian ancestors that had accommodated with human predators. This connection has recently been expanded upon and supported in detail by R. D. E. MacPhee, ''Extinctions in Neartime,'' 1999, an outgrowth of an [[American Museum of Natural History]] conference on extinctions, 1997.

The culture that has been connected with the wave of extinctions in North America is the paleo-Indian culture associated with the [[Clovis culture|Clovis people]] (''q.v.''), which was thought to use [[atlatl|spear thrower]]s to kill large animals. The chief opposition to the 'prehistoric overkill' hypothesis has been that population of humans such as the Clovis culture were too small to be ecologically significant. Other generalized evocations of climate change fail under detailed scrutiny.

According to [[Jared Diamond]]'s ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel]]'', the lack of tameable megafauna was one of the reasons why [[Native American (Americas)|Amerindian civiness'']

'''Hunter Stockton Thompson''' ([[July 18]], [[1937]] &amp;ndash; [[February 20]], [[2005]]) &amp;ndash; was an [[United States|American]] [[journalist]] and [[author]].  He was known for his flamboyant writing style, most notably in his novel ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'', which blurred the distinctions between writer and subject, fiction and nonfiction. He was the creator of [[gonzo journalism]] and, as such, is widely imitated.

==Early years==
A [[Louisville, Kentucky]] native, Thompson grew up in the [[Cherokee Triangle]] neighborhood of the [[Highlands]] and attended [[Louisville Male High School]]. His parents, Jack (d. [[1952]]) and Virginia (d. [[1999]]), married in [[1935]]. Jack's death left three sons&amp;mdash;Hunter, Davison, and James&amp;mdash;to be brought up by their mother, who was a heavy drinker.{{fn|1}} Thompson's difficult youth, and its influence on his behavior and the development of his misanthropic [[worldview]], awaits serious literary analysis.

After early trouble with the law, including an arrest in [[1956]] for robbery, he enlisted in the [[Air Force]] as part of his sentence. At [[Eglin Air Force Base]], [[Florida]], in [[1956]], he began working as a [[sports]] journalist, writing for the base [[newspaper]] and moonlighting for various local newspapers on the side, despite regulations.  He was discharged in [[1958]] and claimed to have been issued a &quot;totally unclassifiable&quot; status. On the [[GI Bill]] Thompson attended the [[Columbia University]]'s School of General Studies where he took classes on short story writing, while maintaining a [[Beat generation|beat]]-inspired lifestyle in [[New York City]]. 

During this time he also worked briefly for [[Time Magazine]] as a copyboy for $50 a week. While at Time he also copied two novels in their entirety on a typewriter in order to learn about the writing styles of the authors. They were [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' and [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[A Farewell To Arms]]''. He was fired from the job at Time in early [[1959]] for insubordination. Later that year, he also worked briefly as a reporter for the [[Middletown Daily Record]] in upstate [[New York]]. He was fired from this job after damaging an office candy machine and, separately, arguing with the owner of a local restaurant who happened to be an advertiser with the paper.

In [[1960]] Thompson moved to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] to take a job with the sporting magazine ''[[El Sportivo]]'' which soon folded. However the move to Puerto Rico was the beginning of a period during which Thompson was to travel extensively in the [[Caribbean Islands|Caribbean]] and [[South America]] writing [[freelancer|freelance]] articles for a number of U.S. daily newspapers. While in [[Puerto Rico]] he befriended noted journalist [[William Kennedy (author)|William Kennedy]]. Thompson also spent time as a [[South America]]n correspondent for a [[Dow Jones and Company|Dow Jones]]-owned weekly newspaper, the ''[[National Observer]]''. In the early 1960s he lived and worked as a security guard at [[Big Sur]] Hot Springs at the time it became the [[Esalen Institute]].

[[Image:Gonzo_quote.PNG|left|thumbnail|A modification of one of Thompson's original [[Gonzo]] flyers during his bid for [[sheriff]] of [[Aspen, Colorado]].]]

In these years Thompson wrote two serious novels (''[[Prince Jellyfish]]'' and ''[[The Rum Diary]]'') and many [[short stories]], submitting them to many publishers. ''The Rum Diary'' was only published in [[1998]] long after Thompson had become a celebrity. Kennedy later remarked that he and Thompson were both failed novelists who had turned to journalism in order to make a living.

He married his long-time girlfriend Sandra Dawn Conklin (a.k.a. Sandy Conklin Thompson, now Sondi Wright) on [[May 19]], [[1963]]. The couple had one son, Juan Fitzgerald Thompson, born [[March 23]], [[1964]]. The couple conceived five more times together, however, three were miscarriages, and two died shortly after birth.  In [[Rolling Stone]] issue 970, a tribute issue for Hunter, Sandy wrote, &quot; I ... want to acknowledge the five children Hunter and I lost &amp;mdash; two full term babies, three miscarriages....  I had so wanted more Hunters! One of the most beautiful gifts that Hunter ever gave me ... Sarah, our full term, eight-pound baby, lived about twelve hours. I lay there in Aspen Valley Hospital waiting, and when I saw the doctor's face it was unbearable. I thought I might go mad. Hunter leaned over the bed and said, '''Sandy, if you want to go out there for awhile &amp;mdash; do that, just know that Juan and I really need you''.'  I was back.&quot;  After nineteen years together and seventeen years of marriage, Hunter and Sandy divorced in [[1980]]; the two remained close friends until Hunter's death.

Thompson got his big break in [[1965]] when he was approached by ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'' editor [[Carey McWilliams (journalist)|Carey McWilliams]] with an idea for a story based upon his experience with the notorious [[Hells Angels]] motorcycle gang. Thompson had spent a year living and riding with the Hells Angels, but the relationship broke down when the bikers suspected that Thompson was making money from his writing, and they demanded a share of the profits. The author ended up with a savage beating, or 'stomping' as the Angels referred to it. After the article was published by ''The Nation'' ([[May 17]], [[1965]]), numerous book offers on the subject came his way, and [[Random House]] published the hard cover ''[[Hells Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs]]'' in [[1966]]. 

In the late 1960s, Thompson received a &quot;doctorate&quot; in Divinity from a mail-order church while living in [[San Francisco]].  He was jocularly referred to as &quot;the Good Doctor&quot; on account.

==Middle years==
Thompson went on to work for [[Rolling Stone magazine|''Rolling Stone'' magazine]] where his next two books, ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' and ''[[Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail 1972]]'', were first serialized.

Published in [[1971]], ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream'' is a first-person account by a journalist (Thompson himself, under the pseudonym &quot;Raoul Duke&quot;) on a trip to [[Las Vegas]] with his &quot;300-pound [[Samoa]]n&quot; [[attorney]], &quot;[[Dr. Gonzo]]&quot; (a character inspired by Thompson's friend, [[Chicano]] lawyer [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]]) to cover a [[narcotics]] officers' convention and the &quot;fabulous [[Mint 400]]&quot; [[motorcycle]] race. During the trip, he and his lawyer become sidetracked by a search for the [[American dream]], with the aid of copious amounts of [[alcohol]], [[LSD]], [[Diethyl ether|ether]], [[adrenochrome]], [[mescaline]], [[cocaine]], [[marijuana]] and other drugs. [[Ralph Steadman]], who collaborated with Thompson on several projects, contributed [[expressionism|expressionist]] pen and ink illustrations. 

''Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72'' is a collection of ''Rolling Stone'' articles he wrote while covering the [[U.S. presidential election, 1972|election campaigns]] of President [[Richard M. Nixon]] and his unsuccessful opponent, Senator [[George McGovern]].  The book focuses largely on the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s primaries and its breakdown due to splits between the different candidates; McGovern was extolled while [[Ed Muskie]] and [[Hubert Humphrey]] were ridiculed.  Thompson would go on to become a fierce critic of Nixon, both during and after his presidency.  After Nixon's death in [[1994]], Thompson famously described him in ''Rolling Stone'' as a man who &quot;could shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time&quot; and said &quot;his casket [should] have been launched into one of those open-sewage canals that empty into the ocean just south of Los Angeles.  He was a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president.&quot;   

Thompson debuted in ''Rolling Stone'' with an article describing his [[1970]] bid for [[sheriff]] of [[Pitkin County, Colorado]] on the &quot;Freak Power&quot; ticket. Thompson narrowly lost the election, having run on a platform promoting drugs decriminialization (but for use only, not trafficking, as he disapproved of profiteering), tearing up the streets and turning them into [[bike path]]s, and renaming [[Aspen, Colorado]] to &quot;Fat City&quot; &amp;mdash; . The incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] sheriff whom he ran against had a crew cut, prompting Thompson to shave his head bald and refer to his opposition as &quot;my long-haired opponent.&quot;

==Later years==
One of Thompson's last books, ''[[Kingdom of Fear]]'', is an angry commentary on the passing of the [[American Century]]. Thompson also wrote a web column, &quot;Hey Rube,&quot; for [[ESPN]] &quot;Page 2,&quot; which was later compiled into a book of the same name. He had at times also toured on the lecture circuit, once with [[John Belushi]]. 

Thompson was fond of [[firearms]] and was known to keep a keg of [[gunpowder]] in his basement.

Thompson's brother James (born [[1949]] and died from [[AIDS]] complications in [[1994]]) claimed Thompson  was offended by his [[homosexuality]], and the two were never close.  James complained how the burden of caring for their drunken mother fell to him over the many years Hunter was away, including sometimes having to take a taxi to pick her up off the pavement where she had passed out. 

Hunter married Anita Bejmuk, his long-time assistant, on [[24 April]], [[2003]].

==Death==
Thompson died at his fortified compound in [[Woody Creek, Colorado|Woody Creek]], [[Colorado]], at 5:42 pm on [[February 20]], [[2005]] from a [[suicide|self-inflicted]] gunshot wound to the head.  He was 67 years old.

Thompson's son (Juan), daughter-in-law (Jennifer Winkel Thompson), and grandson (Will Thompson) were visiting for the weekend at the time of his suicide. Will and Jennifer were in the adjacent room when they heard the gunshot. They reported to the press that they do not believe his suicide was out of desperation, but was a well thought out act resulting from Thompson's many painful medical conditions.{{fn|2}}  Thompson's wife, Anita, who was at the gym at the time of her husband's death, was on the phone with Thompson when he ended his life.

Artist and friend [[Ralph Steadman]] wrote: 
:&quot;...He told me 25 years ago that he would feel real trapped if he didn't know that he could commit suicide at any moment.  I don't know if that is brave or stupid or what, but it was inevitable. I think that the truth of what rings through all his writing is that he meant what he said. If that is entertainment to you, well, that's OK. If you think that it enlightened you, well, that's even better. If you wonder if he's gone to Heaven or Hell &amp;mdash;rest assured he will check out them both, find out which one Richard Milhous Nixon went to &amp;mdash;and go there. He could never stand being bored. But there must be Football too &amp;mdash;and Peacocks...&quot; {{fn|3}}

Three months later, ''Rolling Stone'' released what was claimed to be Thompson's final written words, written with a marker four days before his death, The title was &quot;Football Season is over&quot;:
:&quot;No More Games. No More Bombs. No More Walking. No More Fun. No More Swimming. 67. That is 17 years past 50. 17 more than I needed or wanted. Boring. I am always bitchy. No Fun&amp;mdash;for anybody. 67. You are getting Greedy. Act your old age. Relax&amp;mdash;This won't hurt.&quot;

===Funeral===
On [[August 20]], [[2005]], in a private ceremony, Thompson's ashes were fired from a cannon atop a 153-foot tower of his own design (in the shape of a double-thumbed fist clutching a [[peyote]] button) to the tune of [[Bob Dylan]]'s &quot;[[Mr. Tambourine Man]],&quot; known to be the song most-respected by the late writer. Red, white, blue and green fireworks were launched along with his ashes.  As the city of Aspen would not allow the cannon to remain for more than a month, the cannon has been dismantled and put into storage until a suitable permanent location can be found. There is talk of a public party sometime in the summer of [[2006]]. [[Johnny Depp]], a close friend of Thompson (and who portrayed Thompson in the movie adaptation of [[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]), financed the funeral, according to widow Anita Thompson. Depp told the [[Associated Press]], ''&quot;All I'm doing is trying to make sure his last wish comes true. I just want to send my pal out the way he wants to go out.&quot;''   [http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001018730] 
Other famous attendees at the funeral included US [[Senator]] [[John Kerry]] and former-US Senator [[George McGovern]]; [[60 Minutes]] correspondent [[Ed Bradley]]; actors [[Bill Murray]] (who portrayed Hunter S. Thompson in the movie  [[Where the Buffalo Roam]]), [[Sean Penn]], and [[Josh Hartnett]]; singers [[Lyle Lovett]] and [[John O fund'' has come to mean a relatively unregulated investment fund, often a [[partnership]] rather than a [[corporation]] in form, and characterized by unconventional strategies (i.e., strategies other than investing long only in [[bonds]], [[equities]] or [[money market]]s).

For U.S.-based managers and investors, hedge funds are simply structured as limited partnerships. The hedge fund manager is the general partner and the investors are the limited partners. The funds are pooled together in the partnership and the general partner (hedge fund manager) makes all the investment decisions based on the strategy the hedge fund manager has outlined in their offering documents. In return for managing these funds, the hedge fund manager will receive a management fee and an incentive fee.

Research shows that incentive fees correlate to higher returns in mutual funds [http://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jfinan/v58y2003i2p779-804.html (Elton, Gruber, and Blake, 2003)], perhaps suggesting the attractiveness of hedge funds, where incentive fees can be much higher and restrictions on trading are less.

The fee structures of these limited partnerships (U.S. based hedge funds) vary but typically the management fee ranges from 1-2% of the [[asset]]s under management and an additional fee called an &quot;incentive fee&quot; will be charged on the profits of the fund at a specified date. The incentive fee is usually 20% of the profits of the fund and can include &quot;hurdles&quot; or other items.

[[Offshore investment|Offshore]] hedge funds are usually domiciled in a [[tax haven]] and are designed for U.S.-based hedge fund managers to manage the assets of foreign investors and [[Tax exemption|tax exempt]] U.S. investors. In this structure, the manager will receive a management and incentive fee and will also be invested in the fund as an investment manager.

The typical hedge fund asset management firm includes both the domestic U.S. hedge fund and the offshore hedge fund. This allows hedge fund managers to attract capital from all over the world. Both funds will trade '[[Pari passu]]' based on the strategy outlined in the offering documents.

==Flows and levels==
The number of hedge funds increased from less than 1,000 in 1990 to over 8,000 in 2004. During this period assets under management grew from $25bn to $934bn. In 2004 alone, hedge funds assets increased by $139bn, $75bn from net inflows and $64bn from positive performance. It is estimated that funds increased to over $1.1 trillion by the end of 2005. Recent years have been characterised by increased investment from institutional investors such as pension funds, universities, endowments and charitable organisations. Because hedge funds typically use leverage, the positions that they can take in the financial markets are larger than their assets under management. 

The US was by far the leading source of hedge fund investments accounting for 69% of the total stock of hedge fund assets under management at the end of 2004. Europe was the source of 23% of assets and Asia 5%. New York is the world’s leading location for hedge fund managers with about twice as many hedge fund managers as the next largest centre, London. 
Other important centres in the US for hedge fund managers include California and Connecticut.
London is Europe’s leading centre for the management of hedge funds. At the end of 2004, nearly three-quarters of European-based hedge funds’ assets totalling $256bn were managed out of the UK, the vast majority from London. Japan was the most important centre for Asia-Pacific hedge fund managers. Managers located there accounted for nearly a quarter of the $47.4bn in Asia-Pacific hedge funds’ assets in June 2004.

== Administration of hedge fund assets ==
In mid-2004, 39 firms provided either on-shore or offshore &quot;Administration Services&quot; to hedge funds that were managing $1.1 trillion, up from 30 firms managing $745bn a year before. &quot;Taking into account [[fund of funds]] `double-counting,'&quot; the review said that &quot;average assets under administration for a hedge fund administrator is US$29bn&quot;. &quot;The total number of funds has broken the 10,000 barrier, though the grand total of 11,362 does include both [[master-feeder]]s and [[separate feeder]] and [[sub-funds]].&quot; The 39 Administrators tracked for the mid-2004 number were:

==Strategies==
Hedge funds use alternative strategies such as [[Short selling|selling short]], [[arbitrage]], trading [[options]] or [[Derivative_(finance)|derivatives]], using [[leverage]], investing in seemingly undervalued securities, trading commodity and FX contracts, and attempting to take advantage of the spread between current market price and the ultimate purchase price in situations such as mergers.  When strategies become extremely complex they may acquire potential and unanticipated risk of catastrophic losses as in the case of [[Long-Term Capital Management]].

===Risk arbitrage===
{{Main|Risk arbitrage}}
One very common hedge strategy is to buy shares of a company that is in the process of a [[mergers and acquisitions|merger and acquisition]]. The company's stock has an announced price that it will be worth on the date of the merger, so if the stock is under that value prior to the merger, it is a safe investment to purchase the stock and wait. This strategy can be risky, as there is a possibility that the merger will not go through and the stock will be left at its current value.  Frequently, the trader will also short sell the stock of the acquiring company in addition to buying the stock of the target.

Most of the early hedge funds did just this. They became very popular as a way of seeing gains better than the investment grade bond market, while still having low risk.

However the side effect of this popularity was to dramatically increase the interest in all of the non-standard investment strategies, and soon other funds were being set up with new strategies aimed primarily at high growth. Although there is no hedging in these cases, the term is still used for these funds as well.

==Regulation==
Investment companies registered with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) are subject to strict limitations on the short-selling and use of leverage that are essential to many hedge fund strategies.  For this and other reasons, hedge funds elect to operate as unregistered investment companies.  As a result, interests in a hedge fund cannot be offered or advertised to the general public, and are limited to individuals who are both &quot;accredited investors&quot; (who have total incomes of over US$200,000 per year or a net worth of over US$1,000,000) and &quot;qualified purchasers&quot; (who own at least US$5,000,000 in qualified investments).  For the funds, the trade off is that they have fewer investors to sell to, but they have few government imposed restrictions on their investment strategies.  The presumption is that hedge funds are pursuing more risky strategies, which may or may not be true depending on the fund, and that the ability to invest in these funds should be restricted to
wealthier investors who are presumed to be more sophisticated and who
have the financial reserves to absorb a possible loss.

===Recent regulatory developments US ===

Unlike mutual funds, however, hedge funds are not required to register with the SEC. This means that hedge funds are subject to very few regulatory controls. Because of this lack of regulatory oversight, hedge funds historically have generally been available solely to accredited investors and large institutions. Most hedge funds also have voluntarily restricted investment to wealthy investors through high investment minimums (e.g., $1 million).

Historically, hedge funds have not been subject to regular SEC oversight.  
In October [[2004]], the SEC approved a rule change, finalized in December, [http://sec.gov/rules/final/ia-2333.htm final rule and rule amendments], implemented on February 1, [[2006]], that requires most hedge fund advisers to register with the SEC as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act. The requirement will apply to hedge funds managing $25 million dollars or more. The SEC is adopting a &quot;risk-based approach&quot; to monitoring hedge funds as part of its evolving regulatory regimen for the burgeoning industry, according to the SEC.

The SEC has neither the staff nor expertise to comprehensively monitor the estimated 8,000 U.S. and international hedge funds.

One of the commissioners, [[Roel Campos]], has said that the SEC is forming internal teams that will identify and evaluate irregular trading patterns or other phenomena that may threaten individual investors, the stability of the industry or the financial world.

&quot;It's pretty clear that we will not be knocking on (hedge fund) doors very often,&quot; Campos told several hundred hedge fund managers, industry lawyers and others. And even if it did, &quot;the SEC will never have the degree of knowledge or background that you do.&quot;

=== Recent regulatory developments UK === 

In recent years, HM Revenue and Customs, formerly Inland Revenue, has adopted interpretations of the tax laws that seem likely to keep many funds offshore.

In [[June 2005]], The United Kingdom's [[Financial Services Authority]] published two discussion papers about hedge funds -- one concerning systemic risks, the other on consumer protection.

Due to the same concerns, later in the year the FSA created an internal team to supervise the management of 25 particularly high-impact hedge funds doing business within the UK. 

Another regulatory body, the Takeover Panel, is reportedly concerned about the use by hedge funds of instruments known as [[contracts for difference]], which it worries may have opaque effects on mergers and acquisitions. 

More to come.

==Funds of funds==
A special type of investment vehicle called a ''fund of funds'', a fund which invests in other hedge funds rather than trading assets itself.  Because some U.S. funds of funds may be specially registered with the SEC, they can accept investments from individuals who are not accredited investors or qualified purchasers, and often have lower investment minimums (sometimes as low as $25,000)..

Funds of funds carry an additional layer of fees, typically a 1% management fee and, optionally, a 10% incentive (performance) fee, in return for their due diligence on and selection of hedge fund managers. Besides lower mininum investment hurdle and diversification, some funds of funds also add value (or &quot;justifying&quot; the extra layer of performance fee) by dynamic allocation to different hedge funds strategies, such as Long/Short Equities, Event Driven, Disstressed Debt, Convertible Arbitrage, Statistical Arbitrage, Macro and Multi-Strategies.

==Comparison to Private Equity funds==
Hedge funds are similar to private equity funds, such as [[venture capital]] funds, in many respects. Both are lightly regulated, private pools of capital that invest in securities and compensate their managers with a share of the fund's profits. Most hedge funds invest in very liquid assets, and permit investors to enter or leave the fund easily. Private equity funds invest primarily in very illiquid assets, such as early-stage companies and consequentially, investors are &quot;locked in&quot; for the entire term of the fund.

Hedge funds are regular investors in private equity companies' acquisition funds.

Between 2004 and February 2006, some U.S. hedge funds adopted 25 month lock-up rules expressly to exempt themselves from the SEC's new registration requirements. They now fall under the registration exemption drafted to exempt private equity funds.

==Comparison to Mutual funds==
Like hedge funds, [[mutual fund]]s are pools of investment capital. However, mutual funds are highly regulated by the SEC. One consequence of this regulation is that mutual funds cannot compensate managers based on the performance of the fund, which many believe dilutes the incentive of the fund managers to perform.

==Hedge fund privacy ==
As private, lightly regulated partnerships, hedge funds do not have to disclose their activities to third parties. This is in contrast to a fully regulated [[mutual fund]] (or unit trust) which will typically have to meet regulatory requirements for disclosure.  The hedge funds are typically domiciled in an  offshore jurisdiction, e.g. [[Bermuda]], [[Cayman Islands]], [[Virgin Islands]], where regulation of investment funds permits wider powers of investment. Hedge funds have to file accounts and conduct their business in compliance with the less onerous requirements of these offshore centres. Investors in hedge funds enjoy a higher level of disclosure than investors in mutual funds including detailed discussions of risks assumed, significant positions, and investors usually have direct access to the investment advisors of the funds. This high level of disclosure is not available to non-investors, hence the notion of privacy attached to hedge funds.

A byproduct of this privacy and the lack of regulation is that there are no official hedge fund statistics.  An industry consulting group, HFR (hfr.com), reported at the end of the second quarter [[2003]] there are 5660 hedge funds world wide managing $665 billion.  To put that in perspective, at the same time the US mutual fund sector held assets of $7.818 trillion (according to the Investment Company Institute).  

The combination of privacy and rich investors means that hedge funds are a target for criticism whenever markets move against some group's interests.  For example, hedge funds were widely blamed for the speculative run-up in the bond market that preceded the global bond crisis of [[1994]], although the major players in the bond spree were actually large commercial and [[investment bank]]s.

[[Institutional Investor]] magazine annually ranks top-earning hedge fund managers. Earnings from a hedge fund is simply 100% of the capital gains on the managers own equity stake in the fund and 20% to 50% (depending on policy) of the gains on the other investor's capital.

The 2004 top earner was [[Edward Lampert]] of [[ESL Investments]] Inc. who earned $1.02 billion during the year ([http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&amp;STORY=/www/story/05-27-2005/0003695485&amp;EDATE= PR Newswire link]).

'''Hydrocodone''' or '''dihydrocodeinone''' (marketed as '''Vicodin''', '''Anexsia''', '''Dicodid''', '''Hycodan''', '''Hycomine''', '''Lorcet''', '''Lortab''', '''Norco''', '''Tussionex''', '''Vicoprofen''') is an [[opioid]] derived from either of the naturally occurring [[opiates]] [[codeine]] or [[thebaine]]. Hydrocodone is an orally active [[narcotic]] [[analgesic]] and [[antitussive]]. The typical therapeutic dose of 5 to 10 [[Milligram|mg]] is [[Pharmacology|pharmacologically]] equivalent to 30 to 60 mg of oral [[codeine]].{{ref|tarascon}} Sales and production of this [[medication|drug]] have increased significantly in recent years, as have diversion and illicit use. 
Hydrocodone is commonly available in tablet, capsule and syrup form. 

As a [[narcotic]], hydrocodone relieves [[pain]] by binding to [[Opioid receptor|opioid receptors]] in the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]].  It may be taken with or without food, but should never be combined with alcohol.  It may interact with [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]], as well as other drugs that cause drowsiness.  It is in [[Food and Drug Administration | FDA]] [[pregnancy category]] C:  its effect on an unborn [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] is not clearly known and pregnant women should consult their physicians before taking it.  Common [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]] include [[dizziness]], [[lightheadedness]], [[nausea]], [[sedative | drowsiness]], [[euphoria]], [[vomit | vomiting]], and [[constipation]].  Some less common side effects arad moved toward private provision of public infrastructure, including electric power, tollroads, and telecommunications. The financial crisis brought to light serious weaknesses in the process of dispute resolution, however, particularly in the area of private infrastructure projects. Although Indonesia continued to have the advantages of a large labor force, abundant natural resources and modern infrastructure, private investment in new projects largely ceased during the crisis.

In May [[2004]], an Indonesian court may have compounded the country's troubles attracting foreign investment when it ruled in favor of a petition by Indonesian chemical company, [[Tri Polyta]], that a bond issue be declared illegal and nullified, freeing that company of its obligation to repay its debts. 

==Economic relations with the United States==
U.S. exports to Indonesia in 1999 totaled $2.0 billion, down significantly from $4.5 billion in 1997. The main exports were [[construction]] equipment, machinery, [[aviation]] parts, chemicals, and agricultural products. U.S. imports from Indonesia in 1999 totaled $9.5 billion and consisted primarily of clothing, machinery and transportation equipment, petroleum, natural rubber, and footwear. Economic assistance to Indonesia is coordinated through the [[Consultative Group on Indonesia]] (CGI), formed in 1989. It includes 19 donor countries and 13 international organizations that meet annually to coordinate donor assistance. The 2000 CGI meeting is to be held [[17 October]]-18 in [[Tokyo]].

The [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] (USAID) has provided development assistance to Indonesia since 1950. Initial assistance focused on the most urgent needs of the new republic, including food aid, infrastructure rehabilitation, health care, and training. Through the 1970s, a time of great economic growth in Indonesia, USAID played a major role in helping the country achieve self-sufficiency in rice production and in reducing the birth rate.

USAID's current program aims to support Indonesia as it recovers from the financial crisis by providing food aid, employment generating activities, and maintaining critical public health services. USAID is also providing technical advisers to help the Indonesian Government implement economic reforms and fiscal decentralization and is supporting democratization and civil society development activities through non-governmental organizations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Indonesia's transport system has been shaped over time by the economic resource base of an archipielago with thousands of islands, and the distribution of its more than 220 milion people highly concentrated on a single island.

All transport modes play a role in the country’s transport system and are generally complementary rather than competitive.
Road transport is the predominant mode with a total length of 370,500 km in 2003.
The railway system has four unconnected networks in Java and Sumatra primarily dedicated to transport bulk commodities and long-distance passenger traffic.
Sea transport is extremely important for economic integration and for domestic and foreign trade; and well developed, with each of the major islands having at least one significant port city.
The role of inland waterways is relatively minor and is limited to certain areas of Eastern Sumatra and Kalimantan.
The function of air transport is significant, particularly where land or water transport is deficient or non-existent; and already established, based on an extensive domestic airline network where all major cities can be reached by passenger plane.

Common modes of '''transportation in Indonesia''' include many [[ferry|ferries]] and other [[ship]]s, a wide variety of [[road]] vehicles, limited [[railroad]] service, and extensive commercial [[aviation]].

==Marine transportation==

Because [[Indonesia]] encompasses a sprawling [[archipelago]], [[ship transport|maritime shipping]] provides essential links between different parts of the country.  Boats in common use include large container ships, a variety of ferries, passenger ships, sailing ships, and smaller motorized vessels.

Frequent ferry services cross the straits between nearby islands, especially in the chain of islands stretching from [[Sumatra]] through [[Java (island)|Java]] to the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]. On the busy crossings between Sumatra, Java, and [[Bali]], multiple car ferries run frequently twenty-four hours per day. There are also international ferry services between across the [[Straits of Malacca]] between Sumatra and [[Malaysia]], and between [[Singapore]] and nearby Indonesian islands, such as [[Batam]].

A network of passenger ships makes longer connections to more remote islands, especially in the eastern part of the archipelago. The national shipping line, [[Pelni]], provides passenger service to [[port]]s throughout the country on a two to four week schedule.  These ships generally provide the least expensive way to cover long distances between islands.  Still smaller privately-run boats provide service between islands.  

On some islands, major rivers provide a key transportation link in the absence of good roads. On [[Kalimantan]], [[longboat]]s running on the rivers are the only way to reach many inland areas. Indonesia has  21,579 km of navigable waterways ([[As of 2004|2004]]), of which about one half are on Kalimantan, and a quarter each on Sumatra and [[Papua]]. 

Major ports and harbors include [[Cilacap]], [[Cirebon]], [[Jakarta]], [[Kupang]], [[Palembang]], [[Semarang]], [[Surabaya]], and [[Makassar]]. Ports are managed by the various [[Indonesia Port Corporation|Indonesia Port Corporations]], of which there are four, numbered I through IV. Each has jurisdiction over various regions of the country, with I in the west and IV in the east.

== Roads and highways ==
[[Image:Bemo.jpg|thumb|right|Loading cargo onto a minibus]]A wide variety of vehicles are used for transportation on Indonesia's roads. 

[[Bus]] services are available in most areas connected to the road network.  Between major cities, especially on Sumatra, Java, and Bali, services are frequent and direct; many services are available with no stops until the final destination.  In more remote areas, and between smaller towns, most services are provided with [[minibus]]es or small vans.  Buses and vans are also the primary form of transportation within cities.

Many cities and towns have some form of transportation for hire available as well, such as [[Taxicab|taxi]]s and motorized [[autorickshaw]]s. [[Cycle rickshaw]]s, called ''becak'' in Indonesia, are common in many cities, and provide an inexpensive form of in-town transportation. They have been blamed for causing [[traffic congestion]] and banned from most parts of central [[Jakarta]]. [[Horse]]-drawn carts are found in some cities and towns.

Private [[automobile|car]]s are far too expensive for the majority of the population, and are uncommon except in larger cities.

Indonesia has about 158,670 km of paved highways and about 184,000 km of unpaved highways ([[As of 1999|1999]] estimate).

== Railways ==
{{main|Rail transport in Indonesia}}
Most railways in Indonesia are on Java, which has two major rail lines that run the length of the island, as well as several minor lines. Passenger and freight service runs on all of the lines. There is also [[commuter rail]] service in the Jakarta metropolitan area, and a [[monorail]] mass transit system is under construction in the city.

The only other areas in Indonesia having railroads are two separate regions of [[Sumatra]], one in the north around [[Medan, Indonesia|Medan]], and one near the southern tip.

[[Image:img_index3.jpg|200px|thumb|left|]][[Indonesia]]'s [[armed force]]s ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Tentara Nasional Indonesia'', abbreviated as TNI, formerly ''Angkatan Bersenjata Republik Indonesia'', abbreviated as ABRI) total about 250,000 members, including the [[Indonesian Army|Army]], [[Indonesian Navy|Navy]], [[Indonesian Marine Corps|marines]], and [[Indonesian Air Force|air force]]. The army is by far the largest, with about 196,000 active-duty personnel. Defence spending in the national budget is only 3% of GDP but is supplemented by revenue from many military-run businesses and foundations.

The Indonesian National Police were for many years a branch of the armed forces. The police were formally separated from the military in April [[1999]], a process which was formally completed in July [[2000]]. With 150,000 personnel, the police form a much smaller portion of the population than in most nations.  The total number of national and local police in [[2002]] was approximately 270,000.

==Political role of the military==
During the [[Suharto]] era, the military was sometimes said to have a &quot;dual function&quot; (''dwifungsi'') in Indonesia; first, it would preserve the internal and external security of the country, preserving it as a ''unified nation'', and second, it would insure that government policy followed a path that the military leadership felt was wise. 

This justified substantial military interference in politics. Long-time president Suharto was an army general, and was strongly supported by most of the military establishment. Traditionally a significant number of cabinet members had military backgrounds, while active duty and retired military personnel occupied a large number of seats in the parliament. Commanders of the various territorial commands played influential roles in the affairs of their respective regions. 

Indonesia has not had a substantial conflict with its neighbours since the 1963-1965  [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation|confrontation]] with [[Malaysia]], although competing [[South China Sea]] claims, where Indonesia has large natural gas reserves, concern the Indonesian government. Without a credible external threat in the region, the military's primary role in practice has been to assure internal security. Military leaders now say they wish to transform the military to a professional, external security force but acknowledge that the armed forces will continue to play an internal security role for some time.

In the post-Suharto period since 1998, civilian and military leaders have advocated removing the military from politics (for example, the military's representatives in parliament have been much reduced), but the military's political influence remains extensive.  The TNI has been notorious since the alleged massacre of pro-communist ethnic Chinese in 1965-6 and the East Timor Crisis, which in both events, the TNI allegedly neglected and killed hundreds and thousands of people.

==Military equipment==
[[Image:img_index4.jpg|200px|thumb|left|]]The Indonesian Navy purchased a number of ships of the former [[East Germany|East German]] navy in the 1990s.

In [[2005]] the Indonesian Air Force experienced a logistics crisis, especially in regard to the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]s and [[A-4 Skyhawk]]s that account for almost 80% of the total number of Indonesian combat aircraft. The supply of spare parts for these aircraft from the [[United States]] was stopped due to an embargo imposed on Indonesia following a number of violations against civil and human rights in [[East Timor]]. This led to the grounding of most of the Western-made fighters. 

In response to this embargo, in [[2003]] the Indonesian Air Force bought two Sukhoi Aerospace [[Sukhoi_Su-27|Su-27]] Flankers and two Sukhoi Aerospace Su-30 Flanker-Ds. Along with the fighters came the armament, the AA-10 Alamo air-to-air missile. Also, by cooperating with local military equipment manufacturers such as [[PT_Pindad|Pindad]] and [[PT_Hoverindo_Nusa_Persada|Hoverindo Nusa Persada]], the Indonesian military is now capable of manufacturing its own military equipment, ranging from sub-machine guns to armored cavalry vehicles, reconnaissance aircraft, helicopter-carrying corvettes, submarines and even hovercraft, types of which are now under research.

Following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|2004 tsunami in Aceh]] the American government suspended the spare parts embargo for non-lethal equipment and military vehicles to support the humanitarian effort in the tsunami-devastated Indonesian regions of [[Aceh]] and [[Nias]].

On [[22 November]] [[2005]], the U.S. announced that military ties with Indonesia would be restored. The decision would end the six-year U.S. ban on arms sales. [http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticleSearch.aspx?storyID=277361]

{{Politics of Indonesia}}
Since independence, [[Indonesia]] has espoused a &quot;free and active&quot; foreign policy, seeking to play a role in regional affairs commensurate with its size and location but avoiding involvement in conflicts among major powers. Indonesian foreign policy under the &quot;New Order&quot; government of President [[Suharto]] moved away from the stridently anti-Western, anti-American posturing that characterized the latter part of the [[Sukarno]] era. Following Suharto's ouster in [[1998]], both Presidents [[Jusuf Habibie]] and [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] have preserved the broad outlines of Suharto's independent, moderate foreign policy. Preoccupation with domestic problems has not prevented President Wahid from frequently traveling abroad and continuing to participate vigorously, though peripatetically, in many international fora. The traumatic separation of [[East Timor]] from Indonesia after an August 1999 East Timor referendum, and subsequent events in East and West Timor, strained Indonesia's relations with the international community.

A cornerstone of Indonesia's contemporary foreign policy is its participation in the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), of which it was a founding member in 1967 with [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and the [[Philippines]]. Since then, [[Brunei]], [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], [[Burma]], and [[Cambodia]] also have joined ASEAN. While organized to promote common economic, social, and cultural goals, ASEAN acquired a security dimension after Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in 1979; this aspect of ASEAN expanded with the establishment of the ASEAN Regional Forum in 1994, which comprises 22 countries, including the U.S. Indonesia's continued domestic troubles have distracted it from ASEAN matters and consequently lessened its influence within the organization.

Indonesia also was one of the founders of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (NAM) and has taken moderate positions in its councils. As NAM Chairman in 1992-95, it led NAM positions away from the rhetoric of North-South confrontation, advocating instead the broadening of North-South cooperation in the area of development. Indonesia continues to be a prominent, and generally helpful, leader of the Non-Aligned Movement.

Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population, and is a member of the [[Organization of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC). It carefully considers the interests of Islamic solidarity in its foreign policy decisions but generally has been an influence for moderation in the OIC. President Wahid has pursued better relations with Israel, and in August 2000 he met with former Israeli Prime Minister Peres. However, as of January of 2006, there's no formal diplomacy link between Indonesia and Israel.

After 1966, Indonesia welcomed and maintained close relations with the donor community, particularly the [[United States]], western Europe, [[Australia]], and [[Japan]], through the Intergovernmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) and its successor, the [[Consultative Group on Indonesia]] (CGI), which have provided substantial foreign economic assistance. Problems in Timor and Indonesia's reluctance to implement economic reform, have complicated Indonesia's relationship with donors.

Indonesia has been a strong supporter of the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) forum. Largely through the efforts of President Suharto at the 1994 meeting in [[Bogor]], Indonesia, APEC members agreed to implement free trade in the region by 2010 for industrialized economies and 2020 for developing economies.

{{Economy of Ireland table}}
The '''[[economic system|economy]] of the [[Republic of Ireland]]''' is modern, relatively small, and trade-dependent with growth averaging a robust 10% in [[1995]]&amp;ndash;[[2000]]. [[Agriculture]], once the most important sector, is now dwarfed by [[industry]], which accounts for 46% of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]], about 80% of [[export]]s, and employs 29% of the [[labour force]]. Although exports remain the primary engine for the Republic's robust growth, the economy is also benefiting from a rise in [[consumer spending]] and recovery in both [[construction]] and business [[investment]]. The annual rate of [[inflation]] stands at 2.3% [[as of 2005]], down from recent rates of between 4% and 5%. House price inflation has been a particular economic concern (average house price was €251,281 in February [[2005]]).  Unemployment is very low and incomes have been rising rapidly although costs have also been rising [http://www.rte.ie/business/2005/0323/housing.html]) as well as service charges ([[public utility|utilities]], [[insurance]], [[healthcare]], [[Lawyer|legal representation]], etc.). [[Dublin]], the nation's [[capital]], was ranked 22nd in a worldwide cost of living survey in [[As of 2004|2004]] [http://www.finfacts.com/costofliving4.htm] - a rise of two places on [[2003]]. Ireland has been reported to have the second highest per capita income of any country in the EU (if not Europe) next to Luxembourg, and fourth highest in the world.

==History==
''Main article: [[Economic history of the Republic of Ireland]]''

The state known today as the Republic of Ireland seceded from the [[United Kingdom]] in [[1922]]. The state was plagued by poverty and [[emigration]] until the 1990s. That decade saw the beginning of unprecedented economic success, in a phenomenon known as the &quot;[[Celtic Tiger]]&quot;. Over the past decade, the Irish government has implemented a series of national economic programmes designed to curb [[inflation]], ease tax burdens, reduce government spending as a percentage of [[gross domestic product|GDP]], increase labour force skills, and promote foreign investment. The Republic joined in launching the [[euro]] currency system in January [[1999]] along with ten other [[European Union]] nations. The economy felt the impact of the global economic slowdown in [[2001]], particularly in the high-tech export sector &amp;ndash; the growth rate in that area was cut by nearly half. GDP growth continued to be exceptionally high in international terms, with a rate of about 6% in [[2001]] and [[2002]] &amp;ndash; and it is expected to continue at more than 4 per cent (2006 onwards). Since 2001, GNI (which measures income to Irish residents rather than output) growth has been much worse, with an almost three-fold decrease in 2001 from the previous year. After a near stagnant year in 2002, growth started to pick up once again in [[2003]] has been very buoyant since.[http://www.finance.gov.ie/documents/publications/other/bes_04.pdf].

==Infrastructure==
Ireland's transport [[infrastructure]] varies substantially in quality. On the East coast, the country is served by a modern road network which includes a north-south [[motorway]] (the [[M1 motorway (Republic of Ireland)|M1]]), various by-passes and several [[dual carriageway]]s. The rest of the country however is still served by a relatively poor standard of road. The main national routes are centred on Dublin, leading to other population centres. There is only one major non-Dublin route (or series of routes), extending through the western half of Ireland from Cork through Limerick to Galway, Sligo and Donegal. The nationwide road network is currently being upgraded and improved by the [[National Development Plan]]. The [[Dublin]] area - the best connected area in the country - is served by a light rail network (the [[Luas]]), the [[Dublin Port Tunnel]] the [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50]], [[Dublin Airport]], [[commuter rail]] and the [[DART]]. Also most major national road and rail routes converge on the city.

[[Image:DART Unit 8203.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|DART]] is a key piece of infrastructure in [[Dublin]] for commuters]]

Ireland's rail network is run by the semi-state body [[Iarnród Éireann]], a subsidiary of [[Córas Iompair Éireann|CIÉ]] and is made up of 9 national lines and several regional commuter lines such as the [[DART]]. CIÉ retain some freight customers, though few new freight services have started in recent years. Only some major ports remain technically freight-connected, the connection at [[Sligo]] for example was removed in [[2003]], while the link to [[Foynes]] has remained unused since [[1999]]. The efficiency of the train network is poor, with regular delays and overcrowding on major routes ([http://www.thepost.ie/web/Home/Document%20View%20Business/did-889012424-pageUrl--2FBusiness-2FNews-2FAll-News.asp]). Some regional routes have few services, and as a result, struggle to achieve passengers. Much new rolling stock has been acquired since [[1994]], and [[as of 2004]], this is finally beginning to expand capacity rather than just replacing old stock. Most major routes have been relaid with continuous welded rail, and signalling has in most cases been upgraded from the more than century-old mechanical semaphores.

The country has a total of 36 airports and airfields, of which 3 - [[Dublin Airport]], [[Shannon International Airport]] and [[Cork International Airport]] are of a substantial size. The country is served by several airlines, most notably [[Aer Lingus]], [[Ryanair]], [[Aer Arann]], and [[Cityjet]]. Air transport is relatively cheap. The main ports are [[Rosslare Europort]], [[Limerick]], [[Dublin]], [[Cork]] and [[Waterford]]. There are daily ferry services to Britain [http://www.infrastructure.ie/].

The telecommunications network is slowly improving, admittedly from a low base. [[As of 2004]] broadband is available to approximately 50% of homes and businesses, with about 15% geographic coverage - however it remains relatively expensive. Coverage may expand if the telephone network is refurbished - currently 25% of lines connected to broadband-enabled exchanges cannot avail of broadband, due to bad line quality. The former state telecoms giant, [[Eircom]], is on the record as not keeping up with line degradation in their network maintenance. The mobile market has four providers - [[3 (telecommunications)|3 Ireland]], [[O2 Ireland]], [[Meteor Mobile Communications|Meteor]] and [[Vodafone Ireland]]. The electricity transmission system is run by the [[Electricity Supply Board]] and is available nationwide. The gas network is currently being expanded.

==Natural resources==
[[Image:Killybegs harbour ireland.jpg|thumb|250px|Trawlers sit in [[Killybegs]] harbour, in [[County Donegal]], one of Ireland's biggest fishing ports. Over fishing has depleted Ireland's [[cod]] stocks in particular.]]
Ireland's main economic resource is its large fertile pastures. Most of Ireland, particularly the midland and southern regions are suitable for agriculture. Ireland also contains some forestry - mainly pine. Its coastline - once abundant in fish, particularly [[cod]] - has been overfished for several years and fish stocks have yet to recover. However Ireland's waterways remain plentiful in [[salmon]] and [[trout]]. As for mineral resources, the country has large quantities of [[lead]], [[gypsum]], [[limestone]] and [[zinc]], and smaller (unviable) quantities of [[copper]], [[silver]], [[gold]], [[barite]], and [[dolomite]]. In the midlands, Ireland has huge reserves of [[peat]] - however its economic usefulness as a fuel resource has diminished in recent years due to environmentalist calls for the protection of Irish [[bog|bogs]]. To the south of the country and to the west, Ireland has significant exploitable reserves of natural gas (current proven reserves of 9.911bn cubic metres).

==Energy==
The vast majority of Irish energy needs are met by fossil fuels. About 98% of the Republic of Ireland's final energy demand is produced by burning [[coal]], [[petroleum]], [[peat]], or [[natural gas]] [http://www.irish-energy.ie/content/content.asp?section_id=454].  This over reliance on fossil fuels - particularly oil - has left the Republic vulnerable to international price fluctuations - the state imports all of its oil needs. Renewable energy is increasing in the Republic - [[Airtricity]] and Hibernia Wind Energy (a subsidiary of the [[Electricity Supply Board|ESB]])and many other companies are developing wind farms across the country. As of December [[2005]], there were fifty wind farms operational in the state, with a combined capacity of 500MW - generating enough energy for 300,000 homes, depending on wind conditions. In addition, a further 600MW of wind farms (40 more) have signed connection agreements to link to the power system at high voltage or low voltage, and up to 200MW of wind farms have received connection offers.  This means that Ireland is on target to exceed its EU target of 13.2 per cent of electricity generated from renewable sources by 2010.  In addition to wind farms, electricity is also generated at large scale hydro schemes on the Shannon, Erne, Liffey and Lee rivers, and at mini-hydro stations, as well as landfill gas generating plants in Cork and Dublin cities.

It has been stated that the Republic could eventually become an exporter of [[wind energy]]. [http://www.irish-energy.ie/home/index.asp]. However, a report by consultants Garrad Hassan estimated that when there were large quantities of wind power being generated in Ireland due to windy condition, it was also likely that there would be large quantities of wind being generated in Great Britain and therefore less demand for imports, because the same weather systems tend to affect both islands.  More interconnection (links between Ireland and Britain), future technological breakthroughs in energy storage, flexible fossil fuel generation and controllability of wind output, will all play a part in the increasing integration of wind onto the Irish power system.  Targets beyond the 13.2 per cent figure are currently being looked at.

==Monetary system==
The national currency is the [[euro]] (Ireland is a member of the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|EMU]]). The banking system is dominated by the [[Big Four]] - [[Allied Irish Banks|AIB Bank]], [[Bank of Ireland]], [[Ulster Bank]] and [[National Irish Bank]]. The banking system is generally quite expensive and uncompetitive. There is a large [[Credit Union]] movement within the country which offers an alternative to the banks. There is a stock exchange (the [[ISEQ]]) in [[Dublin]], however, due to its small size, many firms also maintain listings on either the [[AIM]], [[FTSE]] or [[NASDAQ]]. The insurance industry is poorly regulated and dominated by a handful of foreign players. Premiums are very high, particularly for motor insurance. Because Ireland is a member of the EMU, it cannot dictate its own [[interest rate|interest rates]], these are set by the [[ECB]]. At present the ECB has set a very low interest rate - to try and stimulate the German and French economies - however Ireland's economy is already growing at a very fast rate. This has led to increased house price inflation as many, especially young couples, take on large mortgages, and the wealthy buy investment properties. [[As of 2004]], average Irish house prices stand at €220,000 (this compares to IRE£9,000 (€11,430) in [[1973]]).

==Economic makeup==
[[Image:Irish economy.png|thumb|300px|The chart displays the make up of Irish GDP]]
The Irish economy's secondary and tertiary sectors are of a similar size in fiscal terms however in terms of labour, the tertiary sector is far larger. Similarly in fiscal terms the primary sector appears small, however it still employs about 8% of the workforce.

===Primary sector===
The primary sector constitutes 5% of Irish GDP, and 8% of Irish employment. It is largely made up of [[cattle]] grazing, [[dairy]] production, [[fishing]] and [[tillage]] farming; particularly of [[turnips]], [[barley]], [[potatoes]], [[sugar beet]], and [[wheat]]. [[Forestry]] has become a sizeable part of the Irish Economy under the incentivisation of state body ''Coillte''. [[Zinc]] and [[Lead]] are mined in [[County Meath]] by ''Tara Mines''. Quarrying is generally only for the internal market. In recent years, [[natural gas]] exploration has become a significant contributor to the economy - there is gas off the south of [[County Cork]] and to the West of [[County Mayo]]. [[Peat]] exploitation in the midlands provided large employment and a valuable contribution to the energy needs of the country for much of the 20th century, however its significance has dwindled in recent years. Other natural resources include Gold deposits in the Wicklow Mountains, which however are at present not exploited due to their commercial unviability.

===Secondary sector===
The secondary sector constitutes 46% of Irish GDP &amp;mdash; but only 29% of the labour force. Dominated for many years by textile companies like [[Fruit of the Loom]], the sector is now largely made up of high-tech/high value multi-nationals such as [[Dell, Inc.|Dell]], [[Intel]], [[Pfizer]] and [[IBM]]. The secondary sector in Ireland manufactures products such as [[computers]] (25% of Europe's computers are made in Ireland, the European Headquarters of [[Apple Computer]] are in [[Cork]] City), computer parts (Intel processors are made in Ireland), [[medication|drugs]] (much of Europe's supply of [[Viagra]] is made in Cork), [[confectionery]] ([[HB]], [[Jacobs]] and [[Cadbury-Schweppes]] all have significant Irish operations), [[beer]] (the [[Guinness]] and [[Smithwicks]], and [[Harp lager]] breweries are located in Ireland), high quality [[glass]] and [[crystal]] ([[Waterford Crystal]] is made in [[County Waterford]]), [[software]] (Ireland is the world's largest exporter of software - [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] and [[Microsoft]] both have large operations in Dublin) and [[machinery]]. The sector faces increasing competition from cheaper Eastern European countries such as [[Poland]] and many Asian countries such as [[China]], particularly in the lower skill areas such as [[confectionery]] manufacturing. The industrial production growth rate in [[As of 2003|2003]] was 6.7%.
[[Image:Newgrange ireland 280px.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Tourist sites such as [[Newgrange]], [[County Meath]] are vital to the Irish economy]]

===Tertiary sector===
The tertiary sector constitutes 49% of Irish GDP and 64% of Irish employment. The tertiary sector is by far the largest driver of modern Irish economic growth &amp;mdash; the ''[[Celtic Tiger]]''. It is made up of several industries such as [[accountancy]], the [[legal]] sector, [[call center|call centres]] and customer service operations, [[finance]] and stock broking, [[catering]], and [[tourism]]. Many US firms (such as [[IBM]] and [[Apple Computer]]) located their European customer service operations in Ireland due to the availability of a young, well educated, English speaking workforce. The Irish tourism industry attracts over five million visitors annually and employees over 100,000. The [[IFSC]] in [[Dublin]] created some 14,000 jobs in the [[1990s]], all in the high-value finance and legal sectors. The hospitality and retail sectors are quite large &amp;mdash; there are hundreds of domestic and foreign retail firms in Ireland (such as [[Next (retailer)|Next]] and [[Argos]]), and many cafe and restaurant firms operate in Ireland (such as [[McDonalds]], [[Burger King]] and [[Subway (sandwich)|Subway]].)

&lt;br&gt;

==State role in the economy==
===State ownership and deregulation===
At present the [[Irish Government]] controls several large and key parts of the economy:
*Through [[Córas Iompair Éireann|CIE]] they control most of the [[bus]] and all of the [[railway]] market, a significant amount of the scheduled land transport services are accounted for through CIE companies.
*Through the [[Electricity Supply Board|ESB]] the government controls much of the electricity generation market, and all of the electricity transmission network.
*Through [[Radio Telefís Éireann|RTE]] the government control much of the radio and television broadcast sector, although commercial enterprises are gaining market share - the states control is by no means [[propaganda]] but it has a large [[financial]] and [[regulatory]] control of the sector.
*Through ownership of [[Aer Lingus]] and various airports, the government operates a large part of the [[aviation]] industry which is often accused as adopting change slowly &amp;mdash; although in recent years [[Ryanair]], [[Aer Arann]] and [[Cityjet]] have brought competition to the market.
*Through [[An Post]], the government has a monopoly of the light mail deliver industry and a large portion of the partially deregulated parcel and express deliver market.

Although the government owns the incumbents in the electricity, mail, broadcasting, land transport and air transport industries, many are wholly or partially open to competition from the private sector. Traditionally large and key sectors of the economy were dominated by government ownership. Some of these industries are currently being reformed and opened to competition however some of them are regarded as being slow to adopt change and reform to work practice &amp;mdash; work pay and conditions are often much better than that in the private sector with some having overstaffing or underproductivity which is seen as an impediment to reform.

The government is currently considering the [[privatisation]] of [[Aer Lingus]] and part of the [[Electricity Supply Board]], but it is somewhat reluctant because of an earlier situation that resulted from the privatisation of [[Eircom]] &amp;mdash; hundreds of thousands of small shareholders lost money, private investors took control and established a virtual monopoly and under-investment led to a slow roll out of [[broadband]] infrastructure.

===Taxation===
''Main article: [[Taxation in the Republic of Ireland]]''

The present government ([[1997]]&amp;ndash;) has favoured a low taxation policy to encourage [[FDI]] in Ireland.  Consequently, the government opposes moves by the [[European Commission]] to restrict [[tax competition]].  (The corporate tax rate is only 12.5%, versus between 20% and 60% in the rest of Europe).  The income tax system is designed to [[redistribution|redistribute]] wealth from the richer to the poorer segments of society. There are 2 tax bands, based on income levels. These range from a top rate of 42%, to a bottom rate of 20%.

The government receives much of its revenues from taxes on goods &amp;mdash; these include a 21% [[VAT]] rate on most consumer goods, high levels of [[excise duty]] on [[tobacco]], [[petrol]], and [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and several smaller taxes on items such as plastic bags, [[cheque]]s, [[automatic teller machine|ATM]] cards, [[credit card]]s and [[debit card]]s. The taxes in the personal financial sector, as well as the [[television licence]], are often seen as [[regressive tax|regressive]].

===The welfare state===
The Irish government runs a [[Welfare state]] system. The government provides free [[education]] at all levels, and for all Irish or EU citizens. Free healthcare is not universal, being restricted to the unemployed and very low earners at the General practitioner level. However hospital care is free to all, although waiting lists and delays characterise the public health service. People who are unemployed receive [[unemployment benefit]]s and retired people are entitled to a [[pension|state pension]] - both benefits are quite high by international comparisons however recent changes in the cost of living in Ireland have greatly eroded their relative buying power.

====Health care====
''Main article: [[Health care in the Republic of Ireland]]''

The health care system is poorly operated with many accident and emergency wards overcrowded and understaffed and tends to be seen as a [[patronage]] system rather than patient focused, something often [[colloquial|colloquially]] referred to as &quot;[[The Eleven Kingdoms]]&quot;. People with disabilities are entitled to have carers and their other living expenses paid for by the government, however services can be patchy. Health care in Ireland is comparatively expensive, with an average GP visit being €40 (or more) and dentist's visit €70 (or more). The &quot;medical card&quot;, eligibility for free health care, is only available to the unemployed, extremely low earners or those who can present a medical reason, although over one million are registered on the system - the system is also criticised for being reactionary rather than preventative. Ireland has one of the highest levels of take-up of private [[health insurance]] in the world. This, though expensive, does not result in entirely private healthcare. Those with health insurance are treated privately in public hospitals. The main benefit is avoiding the long waiting lists for major treatment that those without health insurance must endure. Thus Ireland is frequently said to have a &quot;two-tier&quot; health service. The health system, despite having millions spent on it throughout the Celtic Tiger years, has severe problems. An ongoing issue is the &quot;waiting lists&quot;, for those requiring in some cases, serious operations. These are over a year for some procedures. Another problem is accident and emergency (A&amp;E) overcrowding, with patients frequently left on trolleys in corridors for hours. A reorganisation of the health service is planned, but this is also controversial, with several cases of people dying en-route to centralised facilities (the inferior nearby facilities being shut down).

====Education====
''Main article: [[Education in the Republic of Ireland]]''

The [[Education in the Republic of Ireland|education system]] is generally quite good with standards in [[mathematics]], [[science]] and [[technology]] being among the highest in [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] member nations. The state has a virtual [[monopoly]] in [[higher education]] &amp;mdash; there are few private colleges and these are highly specialised. The primary and secondary school enrolment levels are quite high and at these levels choice is wide. Third level entry is competitive; cost is relatively cheap and courses adjusted to the needs of the economy. Irish adult literacy is 99% &amp;mdash; in line with other OECD countries.

The only recognised universities are [[Dublin City University]], [[National University of Ireland]] (with ''constituent universities'' at [[University College Cork - National University of Ireland, Cork|Cork]], [[University College Dublin - National University of Ireland, Dublin|Dublin]], [[National University of Ireland, Galway|Galway]] and [[National University of Ireland, Maynooth|Maynooth]]), [[University of Limerick]] and [[University of Dublin]]. The [[Regional Technical College|Institute of Technology]] system has recently overtaken the universities in terms of first year enrolment numbers and this trend appears to be accelerating.

==Economic ties==
===United States===
[[Image:Pfizer logo.png|thumb|150px|[[Pfizer]] was one of the first foreign multi-nationals to locate in Ireland. It did so in the [[1960s]] and today it still employs several thousand workers in [[County Cork]].]]
In [[2003]], [[trade]] between [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United States]] was worth around $33 billion, a $4 billion increase over [[2002]]. U.S. [[export]]s to Ireland were valued at $7.7 billion, an increase of almost $1 billion over 2002. Irish exports to the U.S. were worth some $25.7 billion &amp;mdash; a 500% increase since [[1997]]. Ireland had a trade surplus of over $15 billion with the U.S. in 2003. [http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c4190.html#2004] The range of U.S. products imported to Ireland includes [[electricity|electrical]] components, [[computers]] and [[peripheral]]s, [[pharmacology|drugs and pharmaceuticals]], electrical equipment, and [[livestock]] feed. Exports to the United States include [[Alcoholic beverage|alcoholic beverages]], [[chemicals]] and related products, [[electronics|electronic]] [[data processing]] equipment, electrical [[machinery]], [[textiles]] and [[clothing]], and [[glass]]ware.

U.S. [[FDI]] in Ireland has been particularly important to the growth and modernization of Irish industry since [[1980]], providing new [[technology]], export capabilities, and [[employment]] opportunities. The major U.S. investments in Ireland to date have included multi-billion dollar investments by [[Intel]], [[Dell, Inc.|Dell]], [[IBM]] and [[Abbott Laboratories]]. Currently, there are more than 600 U.S. subsidiaries operating in Ireland, employing in excess of 100,000 people and spanning activities from manufacturing of high-tech electronics, computer products, [[medical]] supplies, and pharmaceuticals to [[retailer|retailing]], [[banking]] and [[finance]], and other services. Many U.S. businesses find Ireland an attractive location to manufacture for the [[European Union|EU]] market, since it is inside the EU customs area. Government policies are generally formulated to facilitate trade and inward direct investment. The availability of an educated, well-trained, [[English language|English]]-speaking work force and relatively moderate wage costs have been important factors. Ireland offers good long-term growth prospects for U.S. companies under an innovative financial incentive programme, including capital grants and favourable [[tax]] treatment, such as a low [[corporation]] [[income tax]] rate for [[manufacturing]] firms and certain financial services firms.

[[Image:Cow.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Once a beneficiary of the EU &amp;mdash; particularly of [[Common Agricultural Policy|CAP]] grant &amp;mdash; Ireland is now a net contributor to the EU]]

===European Union===
Ireland has grown much closer to [[Europe]] in recent years &amp;mdash; particularly since it joined the [[European Union]] (EU) in [[1973]]. It is also part of the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|EMU]] and thus has the [[euro]] as its currency. Many US companies have located their European headquarters in Ireland and this has led to increased Irish-European ties. Ireland regularly comes near the top in polls of the most enthusiastic Europeans [http://www.eubusiness.com/afp/031228021601.psvrd1gm] [http://futurum2004.eun.org/ww/en/pub/futurum2004/news/enlargement_news/new_year.htm] and spent some €60m during its presidency of the EU [http://www.nicva.org/policy_and_research/europe/article.asp?ArticleID=8810]. The EU now accounts for the bulk of Irish trade, with the [[United Kingdom]] being the largest trading partner. Ireland's main exports to Europe are [[beef]], [[computers]] ([[Dell, Inc.|Dell]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[EMC Corporation|EMC]],   and [[Apple Computer]] all have manufacturing facilities in Ireland) and [[software]] ([[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] and [[Microsoft]] operate in Ireland). Ireland's major imports from Europe include [[automobile|car]]s, [[machinery]], [[truck]]s, [[steel]], oil and consumer goods.
A major economic bonus Ireland has received from EU membership has been agricultural subsidies from the [[Common Agricultural Policy|CAP]] and large amounts of EU investment in Irish road infrastructure. Even though  Ireland is the second rishest Member State of the EU, following the latest EU budget talks, Ireland will remain a net beneficiary of the EU budget until 2012. Since the acceptance of the 10 new Eastern European nations in [[2004]], Ireland's ties with Europe further increased. Many workers from countries such as [[Latvia]], [[Poland]] and [[Estonia]], no longer requiring work permits, came to live and work in Ireland.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

==Wealth distribution==
[[Image:Ireland income distribution chart.gif|thumb|left|230px|Disposable income per person as a percentage of the national average.]]
Ireland may somewhat aspire to be an [[egalitarian]] society &amp;mdash; wealth is partially redistributed among the poorer segments of society through the [[progressive tax]] system &amp;mdash; however large disparities in wealth still exist among the employed and unemployed, with one of the worst rich-poor gaps among Western nations. Wealth is more concentrated in the eastern region around [[Dublin]].

There are many spots in Dublin marked by poverty, particularly in the [[inner city]]. The poorest segments of society are foreign nationals working in manual jobs and people from some of the older social housing schemes in Dublin. The national [[minimum wage]] is €7.65 per hour for full time staff over the age of 18 &amp;mdash; this is quite high by historic levels. However, this wage is taxable, and above the threshold for free healthcare. The [[unemployment benefit]] (''the dole'') in Ireland is €134.80 per week, as of [[2004]].

Ireland is also quite unique in [[Europe]] in that [[land ownership]] is still quite high. In particular [[house]] ownership (at approx 80%) is the norm. This contrasts with most of [[Continental Europe]], where [[renting]] is the norm, and the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Social housing]] schemes do exist but the government has not progressively invested in these schemes in recent years.

According to Comreg, 390,000 mobile phone users had taken advantage of FMNP up to September 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most of the transport system in '''[[Ireland]]''' rests in public hands, both north and south of the border. The road network has evolved separately north and south, while the rail network was mostly created prior to the partition of Ireland.

In the '''[[Republic of Ireland]]''', the [[Irish Minister for Transport|Minister for Transport]], acting through the Department of Transport, is responsible for the state's road network, rail network, public transport, airports and several other areas. Although some sections of road have been built using private or public-private funds, and are operated as toll roads, they are owned by the [[Irish Government]]. The rail network is also state owned and operated, while the Government currently still owns the airports in the State (though the authorities running them are due to be privatised). Public transport is mainly in the hands of a statutory corporation, [[Coras Iompair Éireann]], and its subsidaries, Bus Átha Cliath - [[Dublin Bus]], [[Bus Éireann]] - Irish Bus, and [[Iarnrod Éireann]] - Irish Rail.

On November 1st 2005 the Dublin government published the [[Transport 21]] plan which includes €18bn for improved roads and €16bn for improved rail, including the [[Western Rail Corridor]] and the [[Dublin Metro]].

In '''[[Northern Ireland]]''', the road network and railways are in state ownership at present. The [[Department for Regional Development]] is responsible for these and other areas (such as water services), but as the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] is currently suspended, the department is operated by [[London]] (direct rule). The main airports in Northern Ireland are privately operated and owned. A statutory corporation, the [[Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company]] (which trades as [[Translink]]) operates public transport services through its three subsidaries - [[Northern Ireland Railways]] Company Limited, [[Ulsterbus]] Limited, and [[Citybus (Belfast) | Citybus Limited]] (now branded as Metro).

==Railways==
;'''Total''' (1998) - 1,947 km
:5'3&quot; (1600mm) gauge
:38 km electrified; 485 km double track

''Main article: [[Rail transport in Ireland]]''

[[Intercity]] railway services provided by [[Iarnród Éireann]] (IÉ) link [[Dublin]] ([[Dublin Connolly railway station|Connolly]], [[Dublin Heuston railway station|Heuston]] &amp; [[Dublin Pearse railway station|Pearse]] Stns.) to [[Cork railway station|Cork]] (Kent Stn.), [[Waterford]] (Plunket Stn.), [[Kilkenny]] (MacDonagh Stn.), [[Galway]] (Ceannt Stn.), [[Tralee]] (Casement Stn.), [[Sligo]] (MacDiarmada Stn.), [[Limerick]] (Colbert Stn.) and [[Belfast]] ([[Belfast Central railway station|Belfast Central]] Stn.). Rail in [[Northern Ireland]] is run by [[Northern Ireland Railways]] (NIR), connecting Belfast to [[Derry]] ([[Londonderry railway station|Londonderry]] Stn.) and providing suburban services around the city. The cross-border Dublin-Belfast '[[Enterprise (train)|Enterprise]]' service is jointly run by IÉ and NIR.

Many lines in the west were decommissioned in the [[1930s]] under [[Éamon de Valera]]. There is a campaign to bring these back into service, in particular the [[Limerick]]-[[Sligo]] line (The [[Western Rail Corridor]]), to facilitate economic regeneration in the west, which has lagged behind the rest of the country. There is also a smaller campaign to re-establish the rail link between Sligo and [[Enniskillen]]/[[Derry]].

Since [[1984]] an electrically operated train service runs between Bray and Howth, called the [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit]]. In [[2004]] a [[light rail]] system, [[Luas]], was opened in Dublin. [[As of 2004]] a [[metro]] system is also in the planning stage. The Luas system has caused much disruption in Dublin, in retrospect many believe an [[Metro|underground]] would have been a better option, one of the current options being discussed is to upgrade the Luas to the metro system when the metro is being installed.

[[Ireland]]'s roads link Dublin with all the major cities (Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Belfast). Driving is on the left.

''Main Article: [[Roads in Ireland]]''

==Bus Services==
The national bus services in the [[Republic of Ireland]] is provided by [[Bus Éireann]] (Bus Ireland). The company provides an express coach network connecting most cities in Ireland, along with local bus services in the provincial cities. In Dublin, Bus Átha Cliath - [[Dublin Bus]] provides bus services. Both are part of C.I.E. There are also a number of private operators, the biggest of which include [[Aircoach]], a subsidiary of [[First Group]] which provides services to Dublin Airport from parts of Dublin, and [[Scottish Citylink]] which competes on the Dublin-Galway route. Some private rural operators exist, such as the [[Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway|Lough Swilly Bus Company]].

In Northern Ireland [[Ulsterbus]] provides the bus network, with its sister company [[Citybus (Belfast) | Metro]] providing services in [[Belfast]]. Both are part of Translink.

==Waterways==
;'''Total''' (2004) - 753 km
:(pleasure craft only)

==Pipelines==
Natural gas 1,795 km (2003)

==Ports and harbours==
Ireland has ports in the towns of [[Arklow]], [[Belfast]], [[Cork]], [[Drogheda]], [[Dublin]], [[Dundalk]], [[Dún Laoghaire]], [[Foynes]], [[Galway]], [[Larne]], [[Limerick City|Limerick]], [[New Ross]], [[Rosslare Europort]], [[Waterford]], [[Wicklow]]

Ports in the Republic handle 3,600,000 travelers crossing the Irish sea each year, amounting to 92% of all sea travel [http://www.cso.ie/statistics/passengermovementbysea.htm (CSO figures)]. This has been steadly dropping for a number of years (20% since 1999), probably as a result of low cost airlines.

Ferry connections between Britain to Ireland via the [[Irish Sea]] include the routes from [[Swansea]] to [[Cork]], [[Fishguard]] and [[Pembroke, Wales|Pembroke]] to [[Rosslare]], [[Holyhead]] to [[Dún Laoghaire]], [[Stranraer]] to [[Belfast]] and [[Larne]], and [[Cairnryan]] to [[Larne]]. There is also a connection between [[Liverpool]] and [[Belfast]] via the [[Isle of Man]]. The world's largest car ferry, ''[[Ulysses]]'', is operated by [[Irish Ferries]] on the Dublin&amp;ndash;Holyhead route.
In addition, Rosslare and Cork run ferries to France. 

Ireland is one of the last large inhabited islands in the world without a tunnel or bridge connection. Thus the vast majority of heavy goods trade is done by sea. Northern Irish ports handle 10 megatonnes of goods trade with Britain annually, while ports in the south handle 7.6 Mt, representing 50% and 40% respectively of total trade by weight. 

Several potential Irish Sea tunnel projects have been proposed, most recently the &quot;Tusker Tunnel&quot; between the ports of [[Rosslare]] and [[Fishguard]] proposed by The Institute of Engineers of Ireland in 2004. [http://www.iei.ie/Publications/GetPublicationDetails.pasp?PublicationID=69&amp;Module=Papers&amp;txt_freetext=&amp;RecordsPerPage=1000&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;MenuID=24 IEI report (pdf)] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/4121001.stm BBC report] A different proposed route is between [[Dublin]] and [[Holyheuding [[Russians|Russian]] immigrants and some [[Jews]]) were not classified by religion.[http://www1.cbs.gov.il/shnaton56/st02_01.pdf]

Official figures do not exist as to the number of atheists or otherwise non-affiliated individuals, who may comprise up to a quarter of the population referred to as Jewish. According to one study, 6% of Israeli Jews define themselves as ''[[haredi]]m'' (or Ultra-Orthodox); an additional 9% are &quot;religious&quot; (predominantly orthodox, also known in Israel as: Zionist-religious, national-religious and Kepot Srogot); 34% consider themselves &quot;traditionalists&quot; (not strictly adhering to Jewish [[Halakha]]); and 51% are &quot;secular&quot;. Among the seculars, 53% say they believe in God. [http://www.geocities.com/demokratya/dat/shavit.htm]

==Languages==

[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (official), [[English language|English]] most commonly used foreign language

==Literacy==
(2003 est.) 

definition: age 15 and over can read and write 

total population: 95.4%

Education between ages 5 and 16 is free and compulsory. The school system is organized into kindergartens, 6-year primary schools, and either 6-year secondary schools or 3-year junior secondary schools + 3-year senior secondary schools (depending on region), after which a comprehensive examination is offered for university admissions. There are seven university-level institutions in Israel.

[[Israel]] has a diversified modern [[economic system|economy]] with substantial government ownership and a rapidly developing high-tech sector. Poor in [[Natural resource|natural resources]], Israel depends on imports of [[petroleum]], [[coal]], food, uncut [[diamond|diamonds]], other production inputs, and military equipment. It also has received substantial direct economic aid from the [[United States]], including approximately $1.2 billion per year since the mid-1970's, although that regular annual amount has been being tapered off by $120 million per year beginning in 1998. Israel's [[gross domestic product|GDP]] in [[2004]] reached $145 billion, about $20 thousand per person. The major industrial sectors include metal products, electronic and biomedical equipment, processed foods, chemicals, and transport equipment. Israel possesses a substantial service sector and is one of the world's centers for diamond cutting and polishing. It is also a world leader in software development and is a major [[tourist destination]].

Israel's strong commitment to economic development and its talented work force led to economic growth rates during the nation's first two decades that frequently exceeded 10% annually. The years after the [[1973]] [[Yom Kippur War]] were a lost decade economically, as growth stalled and [[inflation]] reached triple-digit levels. The successful economic stabilization plan implemented in [[1985]] and the subsequent introduction of market-oriented structural reforms reinvigorated the economy and paved the way for its rapid growth in the [[1990s]].

Two developments have helped to transform Israel's economy since the beginning of the decade. The first is waves of [[Aliyah|Jewish immigration]], predominantly from the countries of the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]], that has brought over one million of new citizens to Israel. These new immigrants, many of them highly educated, now constitute some 16% of Israel's 6.5 million population. Their successful absorption into Israeli society and its labor force forms a remarkable chapter in Israeli history. The skills brought by the new immigrants and their added demand as consumers have given the Israeli economy a strong upward push.

The second development benefiting the Israeli economy is the [[Peace process in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict|peace process]] begun at the [[Madrid Conference of 1991|Madrid conference]] of October [[1991]], which led to the signing of accords between Israel and the [[Palestinians]] (1993) and a peace treaty between Israel and [[Jordan]] (1994). The peace process has helped to ease Israel's economic isolation from its neighbors and has begun a process of regional economic integration that may help to stabilize the region. It has also opened up new markets to Israeli exporters farther afield, such as in the rapidly growing countries of [[East Asia]]. The peace process has stimulated an unprecedented inflow of [[Foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] in Israel, as companies that formerly shunned the Israeli market now see its potential contribution to their global strategies.

Israeli companies, particularly in the high-tech area, have recently enjoyed considerable success raising money on [[Wall Street]] and other world financial markets; Israel now ranks second among foreign countries in the number of its companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges.

The [[United States]] is Israel's largest trading partner; two-way trade totaled some $12.6 billion in 1997. The principal U.S. exports to Israel include [[Computer|computers]], integrated circuits, aircraft parts and other defense equipment, wheat, and automobiles. Israel's chief exports to the U.S. include cut diamonds, jewelry, [[Integrated circuit|integrated circuits]], printing machinery, and telecommunications equipment. The two countries signed a [[free trade]] agreement (FTA) in 1985 that progressively eliminated [[Tariff|tariffs]] on most goods traded between the two countries over the following ten years. An agricultural trade accord was signed in November 1996, which addressed the remaining goods not covered in the FTA. Some non-tariff barriers and tariffs on goods remain, however. Israel also has trade and cooperation agreements in place with the [[European Union]] and [[Canada]], and is seeking to conclude such agreements with a number of other countries, including [[Turkey]], [[Jordan]] and several countries in [[Eastern Europe]].

Until the last decade, Israel's trade with the Arab world was minimal due to the [[Arab League boycott]].  Beginning in 1945, Arab nations not only refused to have direct trade with Israel (the primary boycott), but they also refused to do business with any corporation that operated in Israel, or any corporation that did business with a corporation that did business with Israel (the secondary and tertiary boycotts).

Israel is one of the world's major exporters of military equipment, accounting for 10% of the world total in 2003.

{{Israelis}}

The '''Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel''', [[May 14]], [[1948]], was the official announcement that a new [[Jew]]ish [[state]], newly-named as the [[State of Israel]] (''Medinat Yisrael'' in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]), had been formally established in the [[British Mandate of Palestine]], the land where  the [[Kingdom of Israel]] and the [[Kingdom of Judah]] had once been. 

It has been called the start of the &quot;Third Jewish Commonwealth&quot; by some observers. (The &quot;First Jewish Commonwealth&quot; ending with the destruction of [[Solomon's Temple]], and the second ending with the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]] two thousand years ago.)

The text is [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Establishment_of_the_State_of_Israel available on WikiSource].

==Historical background==

The [[Declaration of Independence]] of the [[State of Israel]] was publicly read in [[Tel Aviv]] on [[May 14]] [[1948]], before the expiration of the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] at [[midnight]]. It was drafted in the months beforehand, and the final version is a result of a compromise between the various parts of the Israeli public of that time. On [[May 14]], [[1948]], the [[Vaad Leumi]] (Jewish National Council) gathered at the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]], and approved the proclamation, declaring the establishment of the State of Israel. The new state and its government  was [[Diplomatic recognition|recognized]] [[de facto]] minutes later by the [[United States]] and three days later [[de jure]] by the [[Soviet Union]] ([[Stalin]] thought a communist or communist-oriented Jewish state could be a useful &quot;thorn in the back&quot; to his capitalist rivals in the [[Middle East]]). 

It was however opposed by many others, particularly [[Arab]]s (both the surrounding Arab states and the Palestinian Arabs) who felt it was being established at their expense.

The declaration is written in a style reminiscent of [[United Nations|UN]] resolutions, beginning with preambulatory sentences explaining the causes for the declaration and the right of Jews to an independent country, and then operative sentences detailing the attributes of the forthcoming State of Israel.

==Context of the Declaration of the State of Israel May 14, 1948==

The document commences by drawing a direct line from [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical]] times to the present:

''&quot;...the Land of Israel, was the birthplace of the Jewish people. Here their spiritual, religious and political identity was shaped. Here they first attained to statehood, created cultural values of national and universal significance and gave to the world the eternal Book of Books.&quot;''

It acknowledges the Jewish exile over the millennia, mentioning both ancient &quot;faith&quot; and new &quot;politics&quot;: 

''&quot;After being forcibly exiled from their land, the people kept faith with it throughout their Dispersion and never ceased to pray and hope for their return to it and for the restoration in it of their political freedom.&quot;''

It speaks of the urge of Jews to merge with their ancient homeland: 

''&quot;Impelled by this historic and traditional attachment, Jews strove in every successive generation to re-establish themselves in their ancient homeland. In recent decades they returned in their masses.&quot;''

It describes Jewish immigrants to Israel in the following terms:

''&quot;Pioneers,...and defenders, they made deserts bloom, revived the Hebrew language, built villages and towns, and created a thriving community controlling its own economy and culture, loving peace but knowing how to defend itself, bringing the blessings of progress to all the country's inhabitants, and aspiring towards independent nationhood.&quot;''

In [[1897]], at the summons of the spiritual father of the Jewish State, [[Theodore Herzl]], the [[First Zionist Congress]] convened and proclaimed the right of the Jewish people to national rebirth in what it claimed to be its own country.  This right was supported by the British government in the [[Balfour Declaration]] of [[November 2]], [[1917]] and re-affirmed in the Mandate of the [[League of Nations]] which, in particular, gave international sanction to the historic connection between the Jewish people and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and to the right of the Jewish people to rebuild its National Home. 

The European [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]] of [[1939]] - [[1945]] is part of the imperative for the re-settlement of the homeland: 

''&quot;the catastrophe which recently befell the Jewish people&amp;mdash;the massacre of millions of Jews in Europe&amp;mdash;was another clear demonstration of the urgency of solving the problem of its homelessness by re-establishing in Israel the Jewish State, which would open the gates of the homeland wide to every Jew and confer upon the Jewish people the status of a fully privileged member of the community of nations. Survivors of the [[Nazi]] [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]] in [[Europe]], as well as Jews from other parts of the world, continued to migrate to Israel, undaunted by difficulties, restrictions and dangers, and never ceased to assert their right to a life of dignity, freedom and honest toil in their national homeland.&quot;''

In [[World War II]], the Jewish community of Palestine supported the [[Allied Forces]] against the [[Axis Powers]], and in particular against the [[Nazi]]s, while some members of the Arab Palestinian community supported the Nazis (see [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]]). Many maintain that the region's Jews thus earned the right to be among the peoples who founded the [[United Nations]].

On the [[November 29]], [[1947]], the [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed a [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181|resolution]] calling for the establishment of a Jewish State in Israel, requiring the inhabitants of Israel to take such steps as were necessary on their part for the implementation of that resolution. This recognition by the United Nations of the right of the Jewish people to establish their State is irrevocable.

Thus members and representatives of the Jews of Palestine and of the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement upon the end of the British Mandate, by virtue of &quot;natural and historic right&quot; and based on the [[United Nations]] resolution:

''&quot;...Hereby declare the establishment of a Jewish state in the land of Israel to be known as the State of Israel.&quot;''

And so the state will be open for Jewish immigration and for the &quot;Ingathering of the Exiles&quot;; it will foster the development of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants; it will be based on freedom, justice and peace as envisaged by the [[Prophet|prophets]] of Israel; it will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex; it will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture; it will safeguard the Holy Places of all religions; and it will be faithful to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.

The new state pledged that it will take steps to bring about the economic union of the whole of Eretz-Israel.

To the surrounding [[Arab]] states:

''&quot;...in the very midst of the onslaught launched against us now for months - to the Arab inhabitants of the State of Israel to preserve peace and participate in the upbuilding of the State on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its provisional and permanent institutions. We extend our hand to all neighbouring states and their peoples in an offer of peace and good neighbourliness, and appeal to them to establish bonds of cooperation and mutual help with the sovereign Jewish people settled in its own land. The State of Israel is prepared to do its share in a common effort for the advancement of the entire Middle East.&quot;''

A final appeal is made to the Jewish people throughout the Diaspora to rally round the Jews of Eretz-Israel in the tasks of [[Aliyah|immigration]] and upbuilding and to stand by them in the struggle for the realization of their age-old dream, the redemption of Israel.

Concluding by &quot;Placing our trust in the Rock of Israel [language which was the result of a compromise between religious and secular groups]...&quot; the signatories affixed their signatures. First to sign was [[David Ben-Gurion]], and some of the famous names associated with the founding of the state: [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]], [[Golda Meir|Golda Myerson (Meir)]], Rabbi Yehuda Leib Hacohen Fishman, [[Moshe Sharett]].&lt;!-- The ones who sign on the scroll of independence signed their names on an empty parchment, because in the time of the declaration, the writing of the scroll on the parchment was not finished. Only later the content of the scroll of independence like it is known today was added to the parchment.--&gt;&lt;!--Can we get a citation for that please?--&gt;

There are also more specialized varieties of &quot;[[sui generis]]&quot; exclusive rights, such as circuit design rights (called [[mask work]] rights in USA law, protected under the [[Integrated Circuit Topography Act]] in Canadian law, and in [[EC Law|European Community Law]] by Directive 87/54/EEC of [[16 December]] [[1986]] on the legal protection of topographies of semiconductor products), [[plant breeders' rights]], [[plant variety rights]], [[industrial design rights]], [[supplementary protection certificate]]s for pharmaceutical products and [[database rights]] (in [[EC Law|European law]]).

Exclusive rights may be analyzed in terms of their subject matter, the actions they regulate in respect of the subject matter, the duration of particular rights, and the limitations on these rights. Exclusive rights policies are conventionally categorized according to subject matter: inventions, artistic expression, secrets, semiconductor designs, and so on.

Generally, the activity regulated by exclusive rights is unauthorized reproduction or commercial exploitation.  However, as indicated above, some rights go beyond this to grant a full suite of exclusive rights on a particular idea or product.  Generally, it is true to say that exclusive rights grant the holder the ability to stop others doing something (ie. a negative right.), but not necessarily a right to do it themselves (ie. a positive right). For example, the holder of a patent on a pharmaceutical product may be able to prevent others selling it, but (in most countries) cannot sell it themselves without a separate license from a regulatory authority.

Most exclusive rights are nothing more than the right to sue an infringer, which has the effect that people will approach the rightsholder for permission to perform the acts to which the rightsholder has exclusive right.  The granting of this permission is termed licensing, and exclusive rights licenses stipulate the extent of the licensee's ability to perform the acts the rightsholder may control.  Other kinds of licenses attempt to establish additional conditions beyond the acts the rightsholder may control, and these licenses are governed by general contract principles.  In many jurisdictions the law places limits on what restrictions the licensor (the person granting the licence) can impose.  In the [[European Union]], for example, [[competition law]] has a strong influence on how licences are granted by large companies.

Copyright licenses grant permission to do something. A patent license is a declaration not to do some things, under certain conditions.  Exclusive rights policies in certain countries provide for certain activities which do not require any license, such as reproduction of small amounts of texts, sometimes termed [[fair use]].  Many countries' legal systems afford [[Compulsory license|compulsory licenses]] for particular activities, especially in the area of [[patent]] law.

Most exclusive rights are awarded by a government for a limited period of time.  Economic theory typically suggests that a free market with no exclusive rights will lead to too little production of intellectual works relative to an [[pareto efficiency|efficient]] outcome.  Thus by increasing rewards for authors, inventors and other producers of intellectual works, overall efficiency might be improved.  On the other hand, &quot;intellectual property&quot; law could in some circumstances lead to increased [[transaction costs]] that outweigh these gains (see [[Coase's Penguin]]).  Another consideration is that restricting the free reuse of information and ideas will also have costs, where the use of the best available technique for a given task or the creation of a new derived work is prevented.

==History==

===Development of specific laws===

{{expandsect}}

The [[Patent#Early_history_of_patents|early history of patents]] dates from the 15th century in England and Venice.

Copyright was not invented until after the advent of the printing press and wider public literacy. In [[England]] the King was concerned by the unfair copying of books and used the [[royal prerogative]] to pass the Licensing Act [[1662]] which established a register of licensed books and required a copy to be deposited with the Stationers Company. The [[Statute of Anne]] was the first real act of copyright, and gave the author rights for a fixed period. Internationally, the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] in the late [[1800s]] set out the scope of copyright protection and is still in force to this day.

Design rights started in England in [[1787]] with the Designing &amp; Printing of Linen Act and have expanded from there.

===History of the term===

As the words indicate, intellectual property is an asset product of the creativeness of the human mind, or intellect.  The earliest use of the term appears to be from an [[October]], [[1845]] Massachusetts Circuit Court ruling in the patent case ''Davoll et. al v. Brown.'' Justice Charles L. Woodbury wrote in that decision, &quot;only in this way can we protect intellectual property, the labors of the mind, productions and interests as much a man's own...as the wheat he cultivates, or the flocks he rears.&quot; (''Woodury &amp; Minot, CCD Mass. 7 F. Cas. 197, 1845''). The term also appears in Europe during the [[19th century]]. [[France|French]] author A. Nion mentions &quot;''propriété intellectuelle''&quot; in his ''Droits civils des auteurs, artistes et inventeurs'', published in [[1846]], and there  may well have been earlier uses of the term.

The use of the term to describe these statutorily granted rights has increased markedly in recent times, though it was rarely used without [[scare quotes]] until about the time of the passage of the [[Bayh-Dole Act]] in 1980 [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=582602 Paper by Mark A. Lemley, &quot;Property, Intellectual Property, and Free Riding&quot;; see Table 1, pp. 4-5.]. However, worldwide use of the term was uncommon until actively promulgated by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] after WIPO's establishment in 1967.

The first codification of intellectual property can be traced to the Jewish laws codified in the [[Talmud]], which declared a prohibition against &quot;Gnevat ha daat&quot;, literally the theft of ideas. The type of ideas subject to theft and further explanation may be found in the [[Shulkhan Arukh]]. Both texts precede the [[Statute of Anne]] by a few hundred years.

With the [[French Revolution]], which followed the [[American Revolution]], there was debate in Europe over the nature of protection for copyright and patents; those who supported unlimited copyrights frequently used the term ''property'' to advance that agenda, while others who supported a more limited system sometimes used the term ''[[intellectual rights]]'' (''droits intellectuels'').

The system currently used by much of the Western world is more in line with the second view, with limited copyrights that eventually expire.  However, the French Civil Code notion of &quot;moral rights&quot; has connotations similar to natural rights that are inconsistent with the U.S. tradition.

The term &quot;intellectual property&quot; does not occur in the United States Copyright Statutes, except in certain footnotes citing the titles of certain Bills.  The term used in the statutes and in the Constitution is &quot;exclusive rights&quot;.

==Critique==

{{cleanup-date|July 2005}}

===Overview===

The purposes of laws dealing with exclusive rights over intangible subject matter or the product of intellectual or creative endeavor have varied, but they all share in common the appearance of granting the &quot;owner&quot; of the exclusive rights a monopoly on copying or distribution of a protected form of &quot;property&quot;.

In [[common law]] jurisdictions, this was historically done to grant a boon to a king's favorite in the form of [[letters patent]] (with some positive advantages to the public, since often these grants were prerequisites before a merchant would undertake production). Jurisdictions with written constitutions generally vest the executive government with power to grant such monopolies or otherwise provide for the protection of intangible property. For example, the [[United States Constitution]] accords Congress the power to promote the progress of science and the useful arts by granting exclusive rights to authors and inventors for limited times.

The use of the term &quot;intellectual property&quot; is often predicated on considerations such as the &quot;[[free rider problem]]&quot; or rationalized by problematizing the fact that owners of computers have the ability to produce and distribute perfect copies of digital works.  Proponents of the term tend to address exclusive intellectual property rights policy by valorizing the incentives afforded to authors and inventors in granting them a right to exact a fee from those who wish to manufacture their inventions or publish their expressive works.  The analyses associated with the term tend to overlook or even to attempt to defeat the fact, noted by Thomas Jefferson when he took part in wording the exclusive rights clause under the USA Constitution, that published information is intrinsically free and that in fact this is the whole point of such exclusive rights -- to publish, to provide information to the public.

By an economic analysis, the incentives granted for patent rights have sometimes served the public benefit purpose (and promoted innovation) by ensuring that someone who devoted, say, ten years of penury while struggling to develop vulcanized rubber or a workable steamship, could recoup her or his investment of time and energy. Using monopoly power, the inventor could exact a fee from those who wanted to make copies of his or her invention. Set it too high, and others would simply try to make a competing invention, but set it low enough and one could make a good living from the fees.

In latter years, the public benefit idea has been downplayed in favor of the idea that the primary purpose of exclusive rights is to benefit the rights holder, even to the detriment of society at large; and this development has attracted some opponents.

In some fields, patent law has had an unintended consequence: treating abstract rules and mental products like concrete ones has stifled innovation in those fields, rather than aiding it. 

Intellectual property rights have limitations, including term limits and other considerations (such as intersections with fundamental rights and the codified or statutory provisions for [[fair use]] for copyright works).  Some analogize these considerations to public [[easement]]s, since they grant the public certain rights which are considered essential.  It is important to appreciate that different countries may have subtle or dramatic differences in the scope or protection and permitted uses of different types of intellectual property.  A fair use in one jurisdiction can easily be an infringing use elsewhere.

Authors and inventors exercise specific rights, and the &quot;property&quot; referred to in &quot;intellectual property&quot; is the rights, not the intellectual work. A patent can be bought and sold, but the invention that it covers is not owned at all. This is one of many reasons that some believe the term ''intellectual property'' to be misleading. Some use the term &quot;intellectual monopoly&quot; instead, because such so-called &quot;intellectual property&quot; is actually a government-granted monopoly on certain types of action. Others object to this usage, because this still encourages a [[natural rights]] notion rather than a recognition that the rights are purely statutory, and it only characterizes the &quot;property&quot; rather than eliminates the property presupposition.  Others object to the negative connotation of the term &quot;[[monopoly]]&quot; and cite the wide availability of [[substitute good]]s.  Still others prefer not to use a generic term, because of differences in the nature of copyright, patent and trademark law, and try to be specific about which they are talking about, or the term &quot;exclusive rights&quot;, which reflects the U.S. Constitutional language.

===Arguments against the term===

The term ''intellectual property'' has been criticized on the grounds that the rights conferred by exclusive rights laws are in some ways more limited than the legal rights associated with property interests in physical goods - [[chattel]]s or land - [[real property]].  The inclusion of the word ''property'' in the term can be seen as favoring the position of proponents of the expansion of exclusive rights in intellectual products, by helping them draw on concepts associated with those older forms of property in support of their argument for removing limitations on rights when those limitations would be generally seen as inappropriate if applied to physical goods.  For example, most nations grant copyrights for only limited terms.  Additionally, the term is sometimes misunderstood to imply ownership of the copies themselves, or even the information contained in those copies.  By contrast, physical property laws rarely restrict the sale or modification of physical copies of a work (something that many copyright laws do restrict).

A common argument against the term ''intellectual property'' is that information is fundamentally different from physical property in that a &quot;stolen&quot; idea or copy does not affect the original possession (see the [[tragedy of the commons]]).  Another, more specific objection to the term, held by [[Richard Stallman]], is that the term is confusing [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#IntellectualProperty]. Stallman argues that the term implies a non-existent similarity between [[copyright]]s, [[patent]]s, [[trademark]]s, and other forms of exclusive rights, which makes clear thinking and discussion about various forms difficult. [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.xhtml]  Furthermore, most legal systems, including that of the [[United States]], hold that exclusive rights are a government grant, rather than a fundamental right held by citizens.

Though it is convenient for direct incentive beneficiaries to regard exclusive rights as akin to &quot;[[legal property|property]]&quot;, items covered by exclusive rights are, by definition, not physical objects &quot;ownable&quot; in the traditional sense.

[[Stephan Kinsella]], in his ''Journal of Libertarian Studies'' article &quot;Against Intellectual Property&quot; ([http://www.stephankinsella.com/publications.php#IP]), details his objection to ''intellectual property'' on the grounds that the word &quot;property&quot; implies scarcity, which may not be applicable to ideas. 

Others point out that the law itself treats these rights differently than those involving physical property.  To give three examples from US law, [[copyright infringement]] is not punishable by laws against [[theft]] or [[trespass]], but rather by an entirely different set of laws with different penalties.  [[patent infringement|Patent infringement]] is not a criminal offense although it may subject the infringer to civil liability.  Willfully possessing stolen physical goods is a criminal offense while mere possessing of goods which infringe on copyright is not.  Furthermore, in the United States physical property laws are generally part of state law, while copyright law is in the main measure federal.

Some proponents of the term argue that the law is simply recognising the reality of a situation. In some jurisdictions a lease of land (e.g. a flat or apartment) is regarded as intangible property in the same way that copyright is.  In these cases too the law accepts that the property cannot be stolen - if someone moves into a flat and prevents the original residents from living there they are not regarded as 'thieves of the lease' but as '[[squatter|squatters]]' and the law provides different remedies.  [[Identity theft]] is another example of the adaptation of physical property laws to intangible items, though that term itself is seen as problematic by some.

====Alternative terms====

In [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, intellectual property has often been referred to as [[intellectual rights]], traditionally a somewhat broader concept that has included [[moral rights]] and other personal protections that cannot be bought or sold. Use of the term ''intellectual rights'' has declined since the early [[1980]]'s, as use of the term ''intellectual property'' has increased.

An alternate term '''monopolies on information''' has emerged among those who argue against the &quot;property&quot; or &quot;intellect&quot; or &quot;rights&quot; assumptions, notably [[Richard Stallman]] - ''see below''. The [[backronym]]s ''intellectual protectionism'' and ''intellectual poverty'', whose initials are also ''IP'', have found supporters as well, especially among those who have used the backronym ''[[digital restrictions management]]''.

Another issue is that if intellectual property exists there must be a parallel concept of [[intellectual capital]] - [[capital (economics)]] being the property that permits more property to be created.  This, and the related term [[instructional capital]] that applies to the proper subset of [[patent]]s and non-fiction [[copyright]], are controversial notions that economists have no clear agreement on, so one refers to the &quot;intellectual capital debate&quot; rather than thinking of it as an actual [[capital asset]].  ''See more in the &quot;Economic view&quot; section below.''

The fact that the three most common forms of intellectual property law concern different subject matter with different histories and purposes &amp;mdash; [[copyright]] concerns original creative or artistic works, [[patent]] concerns new and useful inventions, and [[trademark]]s concerns signs which uniquely identify the commercial origin of products or services &amp;mdash; is seen by some as countering what they consider to be the dogma of the [[United Nations]]' [[World Intellectual Property Organisation]] on intellectual property as the &quot;creations of the mind: inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, images, and designs used in commerce&quot; [http://www.wipo.org/about-ip/en/]. These critics see this assertion as [[propaganda]] for a &quot;property view&quot; of the intellectual property laws, and suggest alternative terms such as [[individual capital]], [[instructional capital]] and [[social capital]] over the term &quot;[[intellectual capital]],&quot; which has an ambiguous status, even among believers in [[neoclassical economics]]. Indeed, recent historical and econometric research has begun to &quot;challenge the positive description of previous models and the normative conclusion that monopoly through copyright and patent is socially beneficial&quot; [http://minneapolisfed.org/research/sr/sr303.html]).

===Expansion in nature and scope of IP laws===

In recent times there has been a general expansion in intellectual property laws. This can be seen in the extension of laws to new types of subject matter such as databases, in the regulation of new categories of activity in respect of subject matter already protected, in the increase of terms of protection, in the removal of restrictions and limitations on exclusive rights, and in an expansion of the definition of &quot;author&quot; to include corporations as the legitimate creators and owners of works. The concept of [[work for hire]] has also had the effect of treating a corporation or business owner as the legal author of works created by employees.

The increase in terms of protection is particularly seen in relation to copyright, which has recently been the subject of serial extensions [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act|in the United States]] and [[Directive on harmonising the term of copyright protection|in Europe]], such that it is unclear when subsisting copyright protection will eventually expire.

The nature and scope of what constitutes &quot;intellectual property&quot; has also expanded. In the context of trademarks, this expansion has been driven by international efforts to harmonise the definition of &quot;trademark&quot;, as exemplified by the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]]. Pursuant to TRIPs, any [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] which is &quot;capable of distinguishing&quot; the products or services of one business from the products or services of another business is capable of constituting a trademark. Under this definition, trademarks such as [[Microsoft]]'s slogan &quot;Where do you want to go today?&quot; are generally considered registrable. Furthermore, as the essential function of a trademark is to exclusively identify the commercial origin of products or services, any sign which fulfills this purpose may be registrable as a trademark. However, as this concept converges with the increasing use of [[non-conventional trademark]]s in the [[marketplace]], harmonisation may not amount to a fundamental expansion of the trademark concept.

In the context of patents, the grant of patents in some [[jurisdiction]]s over certain life forms, [[computer software|software]] algorithms, and business models has led to ongoing controversy over the appropriate scope of patentable subject matter.

Some consider that the expansion of intellectual property laws upsets the balance between encouraging and facilitating creativity and innovation, and the dissemination of new ideas and creations into the [[public domain]] for the [[common good]]. They consider that as most new ideas are simply derived from other ideas, intellectual property laws tend to reduce the overall level of creative and scientific advancement in society. They argue that innovation and competition is in effect stifled by expanding IP laws, as litiguous IP rights holders aggressively or frivolously seek to protect their portfolios.

The electronic age has seen an increase in the attempt to use software-based [[digital rights management]] tools to restrict the copying and use of digitally based works.  This can have the effect of limiting [[fair use]] provisions of copyright law and even make the [[first-sale doctrine]] (known in [[EU]] law as &quot;[[exhaustion of rights]]&quot;) moot.  This would allow, in essence, the creation of a book which would disintegrate after one reading.  As individuals have proven adept at circumventing such measures in the past, many copyright holders have also successfully lobbied for laws such as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], which uses criminal law to prevent any circumvention of software used to enforce digital &quot;rights management&quot; systems.  Equivalent provisions, to prevent circumvention of copyright protection have existed in EU for some time, and are being expanded in, for example, Article 6 and 7 the [[EU Copyright Directive|Copyright Directive]]. Other examples are Article 7 of the Software Directive of 1991 (91/250/EEC), and the Conditional Access Directive of 1998 (98/84/EEC).

At the same time, the growth of the [[Internet]], and particularly distributed search engines like [[Kazaa]] and [[Gnutella]], represents a challenge for exclusive rights policy.  The [[Recording Industry Association of America]], in particular, has been on the front lines of the fight against what it terms &quot;piracy&quot;. The industry has had victories against some services, including a highly publicized case against the file-sharing company [[Napster]], and some people have been prosecuted for sharing files in violation of copyright. However, the increasingly decentralized nature of such networks makes legal action against distributed search engines more problematic.

===Economic view===

Exclusive rights such as copyrights and patents secure their holder an exclusive right to sell, or license rights. As such, the holder is the only seller in the market for that particular item, and the holder is often described as having a [[monopoly]] for this reason.

However, it may be the case that there are other items of &quot;intellectual property&quot; that are close substitutes. For example, the holder of publishing rights for a book may be competing with various other authors to get a book published. In such cases, economists may find that another [[market form]], such as [[oligopoly]] or [[monopolistic competition]] better describes the workings of the markets for expressive works and inventions. This is one reason to prefer the term ''exclusive rights'' over ''monopoly rights''.

The case for &quot;intellectual property&quot; in economic theory notes certain substantial differences from the case for tangible property. Consumption of tangible property is rivalrous.  For example, once one person eats an apple, no one else can eat it; if one person uses a plot of land on which to build a home, that plot is unavailable for use by others. Without the right to exclude others from tangible resources, a [[tragedy of the commons]] can result.

The subjects of intellectual property do not share this feature of rivalness. For example, an indefinite number of copies can be made of a book without interfering with the use of the book by owners of other copies. When combined with a lack of exclusive intellectual property rights, this nonrivalrousness and nonexcludability combine to make them [[public good]]s and susceptible to the [[free rider problem]]. A rationale for &quot;intellectual property&quot; therefore rests on incentive effects to overcome the free rider problem. This case asserts that without a subsidy that is afforded by exclusive rights, there is no direct financial incentive to create new inventions or works of authorship. However, as [[Wikipedia]] and [[Free software]] demonstrate, works of authorship can be written without direct financial incentives. Moreover, many important works were created before copyright was invented. One might argue that much more invention occurred after patents came into existence; however, one could also argue that patents were brought into law as the power and influence of industrial interests grew.

The status of intellectual property is disputed by various commentators in [[India]], [[China]] and other [[developing nation]]s. The United States and the United Kingdom are the only two nations who consistently receive net balance of payment benefits from intellectual property, and are amongst the chief supporters of intellectual property systems.

A more recent notion, proposing to expand the scope of exclusive rights to include databases, has been introduced by the EU in 1996. This is the idea of protecting the information contained in a database against re-utilisation and extraction of substantial parts. This would be an additional right predicated on a substantial investment, that would exist alongside the copyright in the database structure. This notion was opposed by the United States Supreme Court in 1991 in the Feist Publication finding, which said that exclusive rights cannot cover the factual elements of any copyrighted work, that copyright does not derive from the effort expended in the production of the work, and that in the case of a collection of information, only the originality that may be found in the selection and arrangement of the information is governed by copyright. This case holds that the purpose of exclusive rights policy is to provide information to the public, and this consideration takes priority over concerns such as investment. A study has found that the introduction of exclusive rights to databases in the EU did not do any good to the economy.

The direct incentive beneficiaries of exclusive rights have an interest in expanding their rights and benefits. Many pool their resources to form organizations that attempt this such as the Business Software Alliance (BSA), which purports to represent the interests of the commercial software industry while the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) represents the interests of the commercial music publishing industry. As policy expands in accordance with the notion of &quot;intellectual property&quot;, in the interests of those who benefit directly from its economic incentives, it tends to reduce the rights of its primary beneficiaries, the general public.

Under the notion of &quot;intellectual property&quot; the public is increasingly prevented by law from benefiting from the use of published information without complying with the conditions set by the rightsholder. The cost for this to the public is not easy to quantify. The cost is distributed widely and unequally based on the need for the product. Ironically the direct incentive beneficiary organizations are a good source for these data. The BSA reports a study that claims &quot;while $80 billion in software was installed on computers worldwide last year, only $51 billion was legally purchased&quot; (Source:[http://www.bsa.org/globalstudy/ BSA]). The BSA says &quot;software pirates&quot; avoided a cost of $29 billion while the rest that obey the policy and do not purchase or make use of the work bear a real and substantial [[opportunity cost]] that is yet uncounted. However, it is questionable whether Microsoft would lower their price if it would earn $10 billion more on licensing from countries such as Russia, Thailand, India and China where most of the copyright infringement happens.

But Microsoft is dumping its selling price on competition from [[Linux]], for example with government clients. Because of this competition, Microsoft will also be forced to release an update to [[Internet Explorer]] to the public for its current product which it originally planned to release with its next operating system.

===Alternative systems of protection===

Before intellectual property laws existed in their current form, there were socially-enforced systems for protecting intellectual works, such as the ancient scholarly taboo against [[plagiarism]].

Other informal systems of protection include the customary [[code of non-infringement]] used by [[clown]]s to recognise each [[performance art|performer]]'s exclusive right to their unique style of makeup, costume and persona. The universality of &quot;The Code&quot; supports the belief amongst clowns that this traditional protection is more effective than that provided by trademark and copyright law. Nevertheless, clowns sometimes do seek the protection of &quot;clown material&quot; using intellectual property laws, perhaps against infringement by third parties outside the clown community.

With the advent of valuable [[domain name]]s, and the practice of domain name [[squatting]], the right to use and register certain domain names are often contested, particularly where a domain name consists of or comprises another party's well known trademark. Domain name registries, which are generally non-governmental organisations, utilise dispute resolution systems which operate in parallel with national laws. [[ICANN]] requires that registries for top level domain names (eg. .com and .net) use the [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy]] (UDRP), while other registries use systems such as [[Nominet UK]]'s &quot;Dispute Resolution Service&quot; (for the .uk registry), which often adopt or mirror the provisions of the UDRP.

==Valuation of intellectual property==

Little argument over intellectual property (IP) would occur if it did not have a value for the owner. The principle of valuing IP is to determine the future income associated with its ownership ([[Special:Booksources/0471362816|Smith&amp;Parr: ''Valuation of Intellectual Property and Intangible Assets'', 3rd Edition, Wiley 2000]]). Note that the value of IP is independent of its cost. The creation of a musical composition, invention, valuable software may have cost little, and can generate a very high income. Profit margins from IP are typically much higher than profit margins from manufacturing of tangible goods.

Determination of future income requires estimating the income due to the IP in each of all future years over its life; i.e., the amount sold and the net income per unit after routine sales costs are deducted. If the IP is used internally, then the savings due to owning it can be similarly estimated. The risk that intellectual property becomes obsolete is high, and reduces the current value. Without risk, future income is discounted by using a [[risk-free interest rate]]. Risks include unexpected competition, unauthorized copying, patent breaches or invalidation, and loss of trade secrets. With such risks, discount rates increase, based on the expected [[Beta coefficient]]. With high discount rates, sales that occur far in the future have little effect, simplifying the determination of the net current value of the included IP.

When the items being valued contain multiple IP components, then the proportion and life of each component must be determined. That case exists in the small, as for [[software]] that receives updates throughout the future, and in the large, for [[company (law)|companies]] that vend many products. [[Shareholder]]s of public companies in effect estimate the aggregate IP of a company, providing a [[market capitalization]] through the price they are willing to pay for shares, which is in effect the sum of the [[book value]] and the IP owned by the company.

[[U.S. generally accepted accounting principles]] (GAAP) do not allow the listing on corporate books of IP, making it hard for investors to be rational about share prices. IP is generated mainly through research, development, and advertising (IP generating expenses or IGE), making it hard to assess the effectiveness of IGE. Companies participating in the [[knowledge economy]] typically have a [[market capitalization]] which is a large factor greater than their [[book value]], the sum of their tangible assets and cash. Only when a company has been purchased will the purchased IP briefly appear on the books as [[goodwill]].

The '''Great Famine''' or the '''Great Hunger''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: '''''An Gorta Mór''''' or '''''An Drochshaol'''''), known more commonly outside of [[Ireland]] as the '''Irish [[Potato]] Famine''', is the name given to a [[famine]] in [[Ireland]] between [[1845]] and [[1849]]. The Famine was at least fifty years in the making, due to the disastrous interaction of [[United Kingdom|British]] economic policy, destructive farming methods, and the unfortunate appearance of &quot;the Blight&quot; &amp;mdash;the [[potato fungus]] that almost instantly destroyed the primary food source for the majority population.  The immediate after-effects of The Famine continued until [[1851]]. The number of deaths is unrecorded, and various estimates suggest totals between 500,000 and more than one million in the five years from 1846. Some two million refugees are attributed to the Great Hunger (estimates vary), and much the same number of people emigrated to [[Great Britain]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Australia]] (''see'' the [[Irish Diaspora]]).

The immediate effect on Ireland was devastating, and its long-term effects proved immense, permanently changing Irish culture and tradition. The Irish Potato Famine was the culmination of a social, biological, political and economic catastrophe, caused by both Irish and British factors, which would have sharp and lasting influences on the world.

==The potato in Ireland==
The potato contains considerable [[food energy]], and yet is very easy to cultivate. Typical farming practice of the era seeded a field once after being hoed, and future years' crops were &quot;seeded&quot; by simply leaving some of the potatoes unharvested in the ground. Weeding was minimal, and irrigation unnecessary.  The [[potato]] had become Ireland's major food crop after being introduced sometime around [[1650]], though its dominance was not achieved until around the [[1780s]]. Even small plots could provide enough food energy for a family (and also to feed pigs, providing access to meat, while they could also be sold, providing extra income.) While potatoes are relatively rich in energy they are only a fair source of protein.  Some paleo-nutritionists estimate that potato consumption prior to the famine averaged an astonishing 14 pounds per day per adult. This monotonous diet provided good nutrition which led to a taller average height in Ireland than in England during the early 19th century.  In addition to the potato crop, other lands were used for cash crops like [[flax]]. The abundance of food and cash led to a rise in population in Ireland.

The potato's benefits also led to a dangerous inflexibility in the Irish food system. The majority of food energy was being provided from a single crop. That alone is not unusual, and is still the caselumbia|Richmond]])

'''Iridium''' is a [[chemical element]] in the [[periodic table]] that has the symbol '''Ir''' and [[atomic number]] 77. A dense, very hard, brittle, silvery-white [[transition metal]] of the [[platinum family]], iridium is used in high strength [[alloy]]s that can withstand high temperatures and occurs in natural alloys with [[platinum]] or [[osmium]]. Iridium is notable for being the most corrosion resistant element known and for its association with the [[Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event#Impact_event_and_iridium|demise]] of the [[dinosaur]]s. It is used in high temperature apparatus, electrical contacts, and as a hardening agent for platinum.

== Notable characteristics == 
A [[platinum family]] [[metal]], iridium is white, resembling [[platinum]], but with a slight yellowish cast. Due to its extreme hardness and brittle properties, iridium is difficult to machine, form, or work. Iridium is the most [[corrosion]]-resistant metal known. Iridium cannot be attacked by any [[acid]]s or by [[aqua regia]], but it can be attacked by molten [[salt]]s, such as [[sodium chloride|NaCl]] and [[sodium cyanide|NaCN]].

The measured [[density]] of this element is only slightly lower than that of [[osmium]], which is therefore often listed as the heaviest element known. However, calculations of density from the [[space lattice]] may produce more reliable data for these elements than actual measurements and give a density of 22650 [[kilogram per cubic metre|kg/m&amp;sup3;]] for iridium versus 22610 kg/m&amp;sup3; for osmium. Definitive selection between the two is therefore not possible at this time.

== Applications == 
The principal use of iridium is as a hardening agent in platinum alloys. Other uses:
*For making [[crucible]]s and devices that require high temperatures.
*Electrical contacts (notable example: Pt/Ir [[sparkplug]]s).
*Osmium/iridium alloys are used for tipping [[fountain pen]] nibs and for [[compass]] bearings.
*Iridium is used as a [[catalyst]] for carbonylation of methanol to produce [[acetic acid]]
At one time iridium, as an alloy with platinum, was used in bushing the vents of heavy [[ordnance]] and, in a finely powdered condition (iridium black), for painting [[porcelain]] black.

== History == 
Iridium was discovered in [[1803]] by [[Smithson Tennant]] in London, England along with [[osmium]] in the dark-colored residue of dissolving crude [[platinum]] in [[aqua regia]] (a mixture of [[hydrochloric acid|hydrochloric]] and [[nitric acid]]). The element was named after the Latin word for [[rainbow]] (''iris''; ''iridium'' means &quot;of rainbows&quot;) because many of its salts are strongly colored.

An alloy of 90% platinum and 10% iridium was used in [[1889]] to construct the standard [[metre]] bar and [[kilogram]] mass, kept by the [[Bureau International des Poids et Mesures|International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] near [[Paris]]. The metre bar was replaced as the definition of the fundamental unit of length in [[1960]] (see [[krypton]]), but the kilogram prototype is still the international standard of mass.

The [[Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event|KT event]] of 65 million years ago, marking the temporal border between the [[Cretaceous]] and [[Tertiary]] eras of [[Geologic Timescale|geological time]], was identified by a thin [[stratum]] of iridium-rich clay. A team led by [[Luis Alvarez]] ([[1980]]) proposed an extraterrestrial origin for this iridium, attributing it to an [[asteroid]] or [[comet]] impact near what is now [[Yucatan Peninsula]]. Their theory is widely accepted to explain the demise of the [[dinosaur]]s. Dewey M. McLean and others argue that the iridium may have been of [[volcano|volcanic]] origin instead. The [[Earth]]'s core is rich in iridium, and Piton de la Fournaise on [[Réunion]], for example, is still releasing iridium today.

== Occurrence == 
Iridium is found uncombined in nature with platinum and other platinum group metals in [[alluvium|alluvial]] deposits. Naturally occurring iridium alloys include [[osmiridium]] and [[iridiosmium]], both of which are mixtures of iridium and osmium. It is recovered commercially as a by-product from [[nickel]] mining and processing.

Iridium is rare on [[Earth]], but relatively common in [[meteorite]]s.  &lt;!-- Why is iridium rare on Earth?! --&gt;

== Isotopes == 
There are two natural [[isotope]]s of iridium, and many [[radioisotope]]s, the most stable radioisotope being Ir-192 with a [[half-life]] of 73.83 days. Ir-192 [[beta decay]]s into platinum-192, while most of the other radioisotopes decay into osmium.

== Precautions == 
[[Image:Iridium_foil.jpg|thumb|Iridium foil]]
Iridium metal is mostly non-toxic due to its relative unreactivity, but iridium compounds should be considered highly toxic.

      <comment>/* Types of transcriptions */ dab &quot;Pipe&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">:&lt;span class=&quot;dablink&quot;&gt;'' &quot;IPA&quot; redirects here. For other uses, see [[IPA (disambiguation)]]. The [[NATO phonetic alphabet]] has also informally been called the &quot;International Phonetic Alphabet.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 
The '''International Phonetic Alphabet''' ('''IPA''') is a system of [[phonetic transcription|phonetic notation]] devised by linguists to accurately and uniquely represent each of the wide variety of sounds ([[phone]]s or [[phoneme]]s) used in spoken human language. It is intended as a notational standard for the [[Phoneme|phonemic]] and  [[Phonetics|phonetic]] representation of all spoken languages.

For a treatment of the [[English language]] using the IPA, see [[International Phonetic Alphabet for English]]; for a brief chart, see [[IPA chart for English]].
[[Image:IPA chart 2005.png|thumb|400px|The International Phonetic Alphabet.]]
==History==
{{main |History of the International Phonetic Alphabet}}

==Description==
The general principle of the IPA is to provide a separate symbol for each [[speech segment]], avoiding letter combinations ([[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s) such as ''[[sh (digraph)|sh]]'' and ''[[th (digraph)|th]]'' in [[English orthography]], and avoiding ambiguity such as that of [[Pronunciation of English c|''c'' in English]].

===The principle of formation===
The IPA is what MacMahon (1996) has termed a &quot;selective&quot; phonetic alphabet. It aims to provide a separate symbol for every ''contrastive'' (that is, ''[[phonemic]]'') sound occurring in human language. For instance, a [[flap consonant|flap]] and a tap are two different articulations, but since no language has (yet) been found to make a phonemic distinction between them, the IPA does not provide them with dedicated symbols. Instead, it provides a single symbol,&amp;nbsp;{{IPA|ɾ}}, that covers both. For ''non-contrastive'' (that is, ''[[phonetic]]'' or ''subphonemic'') details of these sounds, the IPA relies on [[diacritic]]s, which are optional. Thus there is a certain level of flexibility in representing a language with the IPA. 

===Principles behind the symbols===
The letters chosen for the IPA are generally drawn from the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] alphabets, or are modifications of Latin or Greek letters. There are also a few letters derived from Latin punctuation, such as the glottal stop {{IPA|ʔ}} (originally an [[apostrophe (mark)|apostrophe]], but later given the form of a &quot;gelded&quot; [[question mark]] to have the visual impact of the other consonants), and one, {{IPA|ʕ}}, although Latin in form, was inspired by [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] letter &lt;ﻉ&gt; ''`ain''. On the other hand, the original Latin-derived symbols for the [[click consonant|click]]s have been abandoned in favor of iconic [[Khoisan languages|Khoisanist]] symbols such as {{IPA|ǁ}}. 

The sound-values of the [[consonant]]s taken from the [[Latin alphabet]] correspond to usage in French and Italian, and are close to those of most other European languages as well: {{IPA|[b]}}, {{IPA|[d]}}, {{IPA|[f]}}, {{IPA|[ɡ]}}, {{IPA|[k]}}, {{IPA|[l]}}, {{IPA|[m]}}, {{IPA|[n]}}, {{IPA|[p]}}, (unvoiced) {{IPA|[s]}}, {{IPA|[t]}}, {{IPA|[v]}}, {{IPA|[z]}}. English values are used for {{IPA|[h]}} and {{IPA|[w]}}.

The [[vowel]]s from the Latin alphabet ({{IPA|[a]}}, {{IPA|[e]}}, {{IPA|[i]}}, {{IPA|[o]}}, {{IPA|[u]}}) correspond to the vowels of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and are similar to [[Italian language|Italian]]. {{IPA|[i]}} is like the vowel in ''piece'', {{IPA|[u]}} like ''rule'', etc.

The other symbols from the Latin alphabet, {{IPA|[c]}}, {{IPA|[j]}}, {{IPA|[q]}}, {{IPA|[r]}}, {{IPA|[x]}}, and {{IPA|[y]}}, correspond to sounds these letters represent in various other languages. {{IPA|[j]}} has the Slavic and Germanic value of &lt;j&gt;, that of English ''y'' in ''yoke'';
{{IPA|[y]}} has the [[Scandinavian languages|Scandinavian]] and [[Old English language|Old English]] value: [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''y'', [[German language|German]] ''y'' or ''ü'', [[French language|French]] ''u'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''u''. 

Letters that share a particular modification sometimes correspond to a similar type of sound. For example, all the [[retroflex consonant]]s have the same symbol as the equivalent [[alveolar consonant]], with the addition of a rightward facing hook at the bottom. Although there is some correspondence between modified letters, generally the IPA symbols do not have a systematic [[distinctive feature|featural]] relationship between shape and articulation. For instance, there is not a consistent relationship between lowercase letters and their small capital counterparts, nor are all [[labial consonant]]s linked through a common design.

[[Diacritic mark]]s can be combined with IPA letters to transcribe modified [[phonetic]] values or [[secondary articulation]]s. There are also special symbols for [[suprasegmental feature]]s such as [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and [[tone (linguistics)|tone]].

===Types of transcriptions===
The [[International Phonetic Association]] recommends that a [[phonetics|phonetic]] transcription should be enclosed in [[bracket|square brackets]] &quot;[&amp;nbsp;]&quot;. A transcription that specifically denotes only [[phonology|phonological]] contrasts may be enclosed in [[slash (punctuation)|slash]]es &quot;/&amp;nbsp;/&quot; instead. If one is in doubt, it is best to use brackets, for by setting off a transcription with slashes one makes a theoretical claim that every symbol within is [[phoneme|phonemic]]ally contrastive for the language being transcribed. 

Phonetic transcriptions try to objectively capture the actual pronunciation of a word, whereas phonemic transcriptions are model dependent. For example, [[Noam Chomsky]] transcribed the English word ''night'' phonemically as /nixt/. In his model, the phoneme /x/ is often silent, but shows its presence by “lengthening” the preceding vowel. The preceding vowel in this case is the phoneme /i/, which is pronounced [aj] when long. So phonemic /nixt/ is equivalent to phonetic [najt], but only if you share Chomsky's belief that historical sounds such as the ''gh'' in ''night'' may remain in a word long after they have ceased to be pronounced.  

For phonetic transcriptions, there is flexibility in how closely sounds may be transcribed. A transcription that gives only a basic idea of the sounds of a language in the broadest terms is called a &quot;broad transcription&quot;; in some cases this may be equivalent to a phonemic transcription (only without any theoretical claims). A close transcription, indicating precise details of the sounds, is called a &quot;narrow transcription&quot;. These are not binary choices, but the ends of a continuum, with many possibilities in between. All are enclosed in brackets. 

For example, in some dialects the English word ''pretzel'' in a narrow transcription would be {{IPA|[ˈpʰɹ̥ʷɛʔt.sɫ̩]}}, which notes several phonetic features that may not be evident even to a native speaker. An example of a broader transcription is {{IPA|[ˈpʰɹɛt.sɫ̩]}}, which only indicates some of the easier to hear features. A yet broader transcription would be {{IPA|[ˈpɹɛtsl]}}. Here every symbol represents an unambiguous speech sound, but without making any claims as to their status in the language. 

There are also several possibilities in how to transcribe this word phonemically, but here the differences are generally not of precision, but of analysis. For example, ''pretzel'' could be {{IPA|/ˈprɛtsl/}} or {{IPA|/ˈpretsəl/}}. The special symbol for English ''r'' is not used, for it is not meaningful to distinguish it from a rolled ''r''. The differences in the letter ''e'' reflect claims as to what the essential difference is between the vowels of ''pretzel'' and ''pray''; there are half a dozen ideas in the literature as to what this may be. The second transcription claims that there are two vowels in the word, even if they can't both be heard, while the first clay, unemployment, dependence on welfare, children outside of marriage). Recent work has demonstrated links between intelligence and health, longevity, and functional literacy. Correlations between ''[[g (factor)|g]]'' and life outcomes are pervasive, though IQ and [[happiness]] do not correlate. IQ and ''g'' correlate highly with school performance and job performance, less so with occupational prestige, moderately with income, and to a small degree with law-abidingness.

General intelligence (in the literature typically called &quot;cognitive ability&quot;) is the best predictor of job performance by the standard measure, validity.  ''Validity'' is the correlation between score (in this case cognitive ability, as measured, typically, by a paper-and-pencil test) and outcome (in this case job performance, as measured by a range of factors including supervisor ratings, promotions, training success, and tenure), and ranges between &amp;minus;1.0 (the score is perfectly wrong in predicting outcome) and 1.0 (the score perfectly predicts the outcome).  See [[validity (psychometric)]].  The validity of cognitive ability for job performance tends to increase with job complexity and varies across different studies, ranging from 0.2 for unskilled jobs to 0.8 for the most complex jobs.

A large [[meta-analysis]] (Hunter and Hunter, 1984) which pooled validity results across many studies encompassing thousands of workers (32,124 for cognitive ability), reports that the validity of cognitive ability for entry-level jobs is 0.54, larger than any other measure including job tryout (0.44), experience (0.18), interview (0.14), age (&amp;minus;0.01), education (0.10), and biographical inventory (0.37).

Because higher test validity allows more accurate prediction of job performance, companies have a strong incentive to use cognitive ability tests to select and promote employees.  IQ thus has high practical validity in economic terms. The [[utility]] of using one measure over another is proportional to the difference in their validities, all else equal.  This is one economic reason why companies use job interviews (validity 0.14) rather than randomly selecting employees (validity 0.0).  

However, legal barriers, most prominently the 1971 United States Supreme Court decision ''[[Griggs v. Duke Power Co.]]'', have prevented American employers from directly using cognitive ability tests to select employees, despite the tests' high validity.  This is largely based on that cognitive ability scores in selection adversely affects some minority groups, due to that different groups have different mean scores on tests of cognitive ability.  However, cognitive ability tests are still used in some organizations.  The U.S. military uses the [[Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery|Armed Forces Qualifying Test]] (AFQT), as higher scores correlate with significant increases in effectiveness of both individual soldiers and units,[http://www.rand.org/pubs/technical_reports/2005/RAND_TR193.pdf] [http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR818/MR818.ch2.pdf] and [[Microsoft]] is known for using non-illegal tests that correlate with IQ tests as part of the interview process, weighing the results even more than experience in many cases.[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1:18847742/Microsofts+big+advantage+-+hiring+only+the+supersmart%7eR%7e+(Company+Operations).html] [https://www.keepmedia.com/Auth.do?extId=10022&amp;uri=/archive/forbes/2005/1031/045.html]

Some researchers have echoed the popular claim that &quot;in economic terms it appears that the IQ score measures something with decreasing marginal value. It is important to have enough of it, but having lots and lots does not buy you that much.&quot; (Detterman and Daniel, 1989)[http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/24538/page/4]  

However, some studies suggest IQ continues to confer large benefits even at very high levels. Ability and performance for jobs are linearly related, such that at all IQ levels, an increase in IQ translates into a concomitant increase in performance (Coward and Sackett, 1990). In an analysis of hundreds of siblings, it was found that IQ has a substantial effect on income independently of family background (Murray, 1998).

Other studies question the real-world importance of whatever is measured with IQ tests, especially for differences in accumulated [[wealth]] and general [[economic inequality]] in a nation. IQ correlates highly with school performance but the correlations decrease the closer one gets to real-world outcomes, like with job performance, and still lower with income. It explains less than one sixth of the income variance [http://www.lrainc.com/swtaboo/taboos/apa_01.html]. Even for school grades, other factors explain most the variance. Regarding economic inequality, one study found that if we could magically give everyone identical IQs, we would still see 90 to 95 percent of the inequality we see today. [http://home.att.net/~Resurgence/L-IQpredicts.htm]. Another recent study (2002) found that wealth, race, and schooling are important to the inheritance of economic status, but IQ is not a major contributor and the genetic transmission of IQ is even less important [http://www.umass.edu/preferen/gintis/intergen.pdf]. Some argue that IQ scores are used as an excuse for not trying to reduce poverty or otherwise improve living standards for all. Claimed low intelligence has historically been used to justify the [[feudal system]] and unequal treatment of women (but note that many studies find identical average IQs among men and women; see [[sex and intelligence]]). In contrast, others claim that the refusal of high-IQ elites to take IQ seriously as a cause of inequality is itself immoral.[http://www.isteve.com/How_to_Help_the_Left_Half_of_the_Bell_Curve.htm]

== Public policy ==
{{main|Intelligence and public policy}}

Because public policy is often intended to influence the same outcomes (for example to improve education, fight poverty and crime, promote fairness in employment, and counter racial discrimination), policy decisions frequently interact with intelligence measures. In some cases, modern public policy references intelligence measures or even aims to alter cognitive development directly.

While broad consensus exists that intelligence measures neither dictate nor preclude any particular social policy, controversy surrounds many other aspects of this interaction. Central issues concern whether intelligence measures should be considered in policy decisions, the role of policy in influencing or accounting for group differences in measured intelligence, and the success of policies in light of individual and group intelligence differences. The importance and sensitivity of the policies at issue have produced an often-emotional ongoing debate spanning scholarly inquiry and the popular media from the national to the local level.

===Use of IQ in the United States legal system===

The Supreme Court of the United States has also validated the use of IQ results during the sentencing phase of some criminal proceedings.  The Supreme Court case of ''Atkins v. Virginia'', decided [[June 20]] [[2002]], [http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-8452.ZO.html] held that executions of mentally retarded criminals are &quot;cruel and unusual punishments&quot; prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.  In ''Atkins'' the court stated that

:&quot;&amp;hellip;[I]t appears that even among those States that regularly execute offenders and that have no prohibition with regard to the mentally retarded, only five have executed offenders possessing a known IQ less than 70 since we decided ''Penry''. The practice, therefore, has become truly unusual, and it is fair to say that a national consensus has developed against it.&quot;

In overturning the Virginia Supreme Court's holding, the ''Atkins'' opinion stated that petitioner's IQ result of 59 was a factor making the imposition of capital punishment a violation of his eighth amendment rights.  In the opinion's notes the court provided some of the facts relied upon when reaching their decision

:&quot;At the sentencing phase, Dr. Nelson testified: &quot;Atkins' full scale IQ is 59. Compared to the population at large, that means less than one percentile&amp;hellip;. Mental retardation is a relatively rare thing. It's about one percent of the population.&quot; App. 274. According to Dr. Nelson, Atkins' IQ score &quot;would automatically qualify for Social Security disability income.&quot; Id., at 280. Dr. Nelson also indicated that of the over 40 capital defendants that he had evaluated, Atkins was only the second individual who met the criteria for mental retardation. Id., at 310. He testified that, in his opinion, Atkins' limited intellect had been a consistent feature throughout his life, and that his IQ score of 59 is not an &quot;aberration, malingered result, or invalid test score.&quot; Id., at 308.&quot;

==Validity and ''g''-loading of specific tests==

While IQ is sometimes treated as an end unto itself, scholarly work on IQ focuses to a large extent on IQ's [[validity (psychometric)|validity]], that is, the degree to which IQ predicts outcomes such as job performance, social pathologies, or academic achievement.  Different IQ tests differ in their validity for various outcomes.

Tests also differ in their [[General intelligence factor|''g'']]-loading, which is the degree to which the test score reflects general mental ability rather than a specific skill or &quot;group factor&quot; such as verbal ability, spatial visualization, or mathematical reasoning).  ''g''-loading and validity are related in the sense that most IQ tests derive their validity mostly or entirely from the degree to which they measure ''g'' (Jensen 1998).

==Social construct==

Some maintain that IQ is a [[social construct]] invented by the privileged classes, used to maintain their privilege.  Others maintain that intelligence, measured by IQ or ''g'', reflects a real ability, is a useful tool in performing life tasks and has a biological reality.

The social-construct and real-ability interpretations for IQ differences can be distinguished because they make opposite predictions about what would happen if people were given equal opportunities. The social explanation predicts that equal treatment will eliminate differences, while the real-ability explanation predicts that equal treatment will accentuate differences. Evidence for both outcomes exists. Achievement gaps persist in socioeconomically advantaged, integrated, liberal, suburban school districts in the United States (see Noguera, 2001). Test-score gaps tend to be larger at higher socioeconomic levels (Gottfredson, 2003).  Some studies have reported a narrowing of score gaps over time.

The reduction of intelligence to a single score seems extreme and wrong to many people.  Opponents argue that it is much more useful to know a person's strengths and weaknesses than to know their IQ score.  Such opponents often cite the example of two people with the same overall IQ score but very different ability profiles.  As measured by IQ tests, most people have highly balanced ability profiles, with differences in subscores being greater among the more intelligent.

The creators of IQ testing did not intend for the tests to gauge a person's worth, and in many (or, as some people suggest, all) situations, IQ may have little relevance. 
 
===The Mismeasure of Man===

Some scientists dispute [[psychometrics]] entirely. In ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'', Professor [[Stephen Jay Gould]] argues that intelligence tests are based on faulty assumptions and shows their history of being used as the basis for [[scientific racism]]. He writes:

:&amp;hellip;the abstraction of intelligence as a single entity, its location within the brain, its quantification as one number for each individual, and the use of these numbers to rank people in a single series of worthiness, invariably to find that oppressed and disadvantaged groups&amp;mdash;races, classes, or sexes&amp;mdash;are innately inferior and deserve their status. (pp. 24&amp;ndash;25)

He spends much of the book debunking the concept of IQ, including a historical discussion of how the IQ tests were created and a technical discussion of why ''g'' is simply a mathematical artifact. Later editions of the book include criticism of ''[[The Bell Curve]]''.

[[Arthur Jensen]], Professor of Educational Psychology, University of California, Berkeley, responds to Gould's criticisms in a paper titled ''The Debunking of Scientific Fossils and Straw Persons''.[http://www.mugu.com/cgi-bin/Upstream/jensen-gould-fossils]

===The view of the American Psychological Association===
In response to the controversy surrounding ''The Bell Curve'', the [[American Psychological Association]]'s Board of Scientific Affairs established a task force to write a consensus statement on the state of intelligence research which could be used by all sides as a basis for discussion. The full text of the report is available at a third-party website. [http://www.lrainc.com/swtaboo/taboos/apa_01.html]

The findings of the task force state that IQ scores ''do'' have high predictive validity for individual (but not necessarily population) differences in school achievement. They confirm the predictive validity of IQ for adult occupational status, even when variables such as education and family background have been statistically controlled. They agree that individual (again, not necessarily population) differences in intelligence are substantially influenced by genetics. 

They state there is little evidence to show that childhood diet influences intelligence except in cases of severe malnutrition. They agree that there are no significant differences between the average IQ scores of males and females. The task force agrees that large differences do exist between the average IQ scores of blacks and whites, and that these differences cannot be attributed to biases in test construction. While they admit there is no empirical evidence supporting it, the APA task force suggests that explanations based on social status and cultural differences may be possible. Regarding genetic causes, they noted that there is not much direct evidence on this point, but what little there is fails to support the genetic hypothesis.

The APA journal that published the statement, ''[[American Psychologist]]'', subsequently published eleven critical responses in January 1997, most arguing that the report failed to examine adequately the evidence for partly-genetic explanations.

The report was published in 1995 and thus does not include a decade of recent research.

==Improving IQ==
While a large amount of one's IQ is predetermined by genetic factors, the environment can play a role as well.  IQ can be improved to a certain extent through reading and application. Improvement in diet and regular exercise can help certain cognitive functions, and getting more sleep may help as well. Depression and stress reduce IQ somewhat, so removal of these factors might also help. 

Drugs designed to improve cognitive function, and sometimes IQ scores are called [[nootropic]]s.  

Working memory training, an experimental treatment which has according to one study  by Klingberg et al, improved raw scores substantially on Ravens progressive matrices and Ravens advanced progressive matrices, both IQ tests.  It has also been claimed in some studies that [[neurofeedback]] can increase IQ.  However, some would argue that these studies should not necessarily be interpreted as proof that neurofeedback can increase IQ as (a) they don't have a double blind component and (b) it is unknown whether their effects would apply to persons without ADHD, as most of these studies were performed on persons with ADHD.  It is possible that the increase in IQ was just a result of better concentration in the subjects. 

A recent scientific article on the concept of cognitive reserve included an argument that education and application of the mind can substantially increase IQ. 

The &quot;[[Mozart effect]]&quot; is the claimed ability of certain musics to enhance intelligence, especially spatial reasoning.  However, this effect is not universally accepted.  Musical education, as opposed to appreciation, has been shown a number of times to marginally increase IQ in children; however, there is sparsity of information on whether such an effect might apply to adults. 

The levels of a variety of chemicals in the brain, such as chlorine, have been shown to relate to intelligence in a variety of ways. It is possible that by adjusting diet, these could be substantially changed.

Future possibilities for improving the skills IQ tests measure include stem cells treatment, genetic modification, better education based on neurological and cognitive discoveries, better nootropics, etc. [http://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg18625011.900.]

The introduction of [[hydroelectric power]] generation in the [[Alps]] enabled the rapid [[industrialization]] of coal-starved northern Italy, beginning in the 1890s. The increasing availability of economic petroleum products also reduced the relation of coal to the potential for industrialization.

By the 1890s, industrialisation in these areas had created the first giant industrial corporations with often nearly global international operations and interests, as companies like [[United States Steel Corporation|U.S. Steel]], [[General Electric]], and [[Bayer|Bayer AG]] joined the railroads on the world's [[stock market]]s and among huge organisations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Peace Palace.jpg|thumb|330px|Peace Palace, seat of the ICJ.]]The '''International Court of Justice''' (known colloquially as the '''World Court''' or '''ICJ''') is the principal judicial organ of the [[United Nations]]. Its seat is in the [[Peace Palace]] at [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]. Established in [[1945]] by the [[Charter of the United Nations]], the Court began work in [[1946]] as the successor to the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]]. The Statute of the International Court of Justice, similar to that of its predecessor, is the main constitutional document constituting and regulating the Court.{{ref|1}} The ICJ shouldn't be confused with the [[International Criminal Court]] or the [[War Crimes Law (Belgium)]], both of which also potentially have &quot;global&quot; jurisdiction. English and French are its two official languages.

The Court's workload is characterised by a wide range of judicial activity. Its main functions are to settle [[legal]] disputes submitted to it by [[state]]s and to give advisory opinions on legal questions submitted to it by duly authorised international organs and agencies. The number of [[case law|decisions]] made by the ICJ has been relatively small, but there has clearly been an increased willingness to use the Court since the [[1980s]], especially among [[developing countries]], although the [[USA]] withdrew from compulsory jurisdiction in 1986, meaning it only accepts the court's jurisdiction on a case-to-case basis. 

==Composition==

The ICJ is composed of fifteen permanent [[judge]]s elected by the [[UN General Assembly]] and the [[UN Security Council]] from a list of persons nominated by the national groups in the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]]. The election process is set out in Articles 4-12 of the ICJ statute. Judges serve for nine years terms and may be re-elected. Elections take place every three years, with one-third of judges retiring each time, in order to ensure continuity within the court. 

Should a judge die in office, the practice has generally been to elect a judge of the same [[nationality]] to complete the term. No two may be nationals of the same country. According to Article 9, the membership of the Court is supposed to represent the &quot;main forms of civilization and of the principal legal systems of the world&quot;. Essentially, this has meant [[common law]], [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[socialist law]] (now [[post-communist law]]). Since the [[1960s]] each of the five permanent members of the Security Council ([[France]], [[China and the United Nations|China]], [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]) have always had a judge on the Court. The exception was China (the [[Republic of China]] until [[1971]], the [[People's Republic of China]] from 1971 onwards), which did not have a judge on the Court from [[1967]]-[[1985]], because it did not put forward a candidate. The rule on a [[geopolitical]] composition of the bench exists despite the fact that there is no provision for it in the Statute of the ICJ.

Article 2 of the Statute provides that all judges should be &quot;elected regardless of their nationality among persons of high [[moral]] character&quot;, who are either qualified for the highest judicial office in their home states or known as lawyers with sufficient competence in international law. Judicial independence is dealt specifically with in Articles 16-18. Judges of the ICJ are not able to hold any other post, nor act as [[counsel]]. A judge can only be dismissed by [[unanimous]] vote of other members of the Court. Despite these provisions, the independence of ICJ judges has been questioned. For example, during the ''[[Nicaragua v. United States|Nicaragua Case]]'', the [[USA]] issued a communiqué suggesting that it could not present sensitive material to the Court because of the presence of judges from [[Eastern bloc]] states.{{ref|2}} 

Judges may deliver joint judgments or give their own separate opinions. Decisions and Advisory Opinions are by majority and, in the event of an equal division, the President's vote becomes decisive.{{ref|3}} Judges may also deliver separate dissenting opinions.

===''Ad hoc'' judges===

Article 31 of the statute sets out a procedure whereby ''[[ad hoc]]'' judges sit on contentious cases before the Court. This system allows any party to a contentious case to nominate a judge of their choice (usually of their nationality), if a judge of their nationality is not already on the bench. ''Ad hoc'' judges participate fully in the case and the deliberations, along with the permanent bench. Thus, it is possible that as many as seventeen judges may sit on one case. 

This system may seem strange when compared with domestic court processes, but its purpose is to encourage states to submit cases to the Court. For example, if a state knows it will have a judicial officer who can participate in deliberation and offer other judges local knowledge and an understanding of the state's perspective, that state may be more willing to submit to the Court's jurisdiction. Although this system does not sit well with the judicial nature of the body, it is usually of little practical consequence. ''Ad hoc'' judges usually (but not always) vote in favour of the state that appointed them and thus cancel each other out.

===Chambers===

Generally, the Court sits as a full bench, but in the last fifteen years it has on occasion sat as a chamber. Articles 26-29 of the statute allow the Court to form smaller chambers, usually three or five judges, to hear cases. Two types of chambers are contemplated by Article 26: firstly, chambers for special categories of cases, and second, the formation of ''ad hoc'' chambers to hear particular disputes. In [[1993]] a special chamber was established, under Article 26(1) of the ICJ statute, to deal specifically with [[Natural environment|environmental]] matters (although this chamber has never been used). 

''Ad hoc'' chambers are more frequently convened. For example, chambers were used to hear the ''Gulf of Maine Case'' ([[USA]] v [[Canada]]).{{ref|4}} In that case, the parties made clear they would withdraw the case unless the Court appointed judges to the chamber who were acceptable to the parties. Chambers judgments may have less authority than full Court judgments, or may diminish the proper interpretation of universal international law informed by a variety of cultural and legal perspectives. On the other hand, the use of Chambers might encourage greater recourse to the Court and thus enhance international [[dispute resolution]].{{ref|5}}

===Current composition===
[[Image:Rosalyn Higgins.jpg|thumb|Judge Higgins, President of the ICJ.]]

As of [[6 February]] [[2006]] the composition of the court is as follows:

*President: Dame [[Rosalyn Higgins]] ([[United Kingdom]])
*Vice-President: [[Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh]] ([[Jordan]])

In addition to the President and Vice-President, the ICJ judges are:
*[[Raymond Ranjeva]] ([[Madagascar]])
*[[Shi Jiuyong]] ([[People's Republic of China]])
*[[Abdul G. Koroma]] ([[Sierra Leone]])
*[[Gonzalo Parra Aranguren]] ([[Venezuela]])
*[[Thomas Buergenthal]] ([[United States|United States of America]])

*[[Leonid Skotnikov]] ([[Russia|Russian Federation]])

==Jurisdiction==
''See main article: [[Jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice]].''

As stated in Article 93 of the UN Charter, all 191 UN members are automatically [[Party (law)|parties]] to the Court's statute. Non-UN members may also become parties to the Court's statute under the Article 93(2) procedure. For example, [[Switzerland]] used this procedure in [[1948]] to become a party; [[Nauru]] also became a party in [[1988]]. Once a state is a party to the Court's statute, it is entitled to participate in cases before the Court. However, being a party to the statute does not automatically give the Court jurisdiction over disputes involving those parties. The issue of [[jurisdiction]] is considered in the two types of ICJ cases: contentious issues and advisory opinions. 

===Contentious issues===

In contentious cases, the ICJ produces a binding ruling between states that agree to submit to the ruling of the court. Only [[state]]s may be parties in contentious cases. [[Individual]]s, [[corporation]]s, parts of a [[federal state]], [[NGO]]s, UN organs and [[self-determination]] groups are excluded from direct participation in cases, although the Court may receive information from public [[international organisations]]. This does not preclude non-state interests from being the subject of proceedings if one state brings the case against another. For example, a state may, in case of &quot;diplomatic protection&quot;, bring a case on behalf of one of its nationals or corporations.{{ref|6}}

Jurisdiction is often a crucial question for the Court in contentious cases. (See [[International Court of Justice#Procedure|Procedure]] below.) The key principle is that the ICJ only has jurisdiction on the basis of consent. Article 36 outlines four bases on which the Court's jurisdiction may be founded. 

*First, 36(1) provides that parties may refer cases to the Court (jurisdiction founded on &quot;special agreement&quot; or &quot;''compromis''&quot;). This method is based on explicit consent rather than true compulsory jurisdiction. It is, perhaps, the most effective basis for the Court's jurisdiction because the parties concerned have a desire for the dispute to be resolved by the Court and are thus more likely to comply with the Court's judgment. 

*Second, 36(1) also gives the Court jurisdiction over &quot;matters specifically provided for ... in treaties and conventions in force&quot;. Most modern [[treaty|treaties]] will contain a [[compromissory clause]], providing for dispute resolution by the ICJ.{{ref|7}} Cases founded on compromissory clauses have not been as effective as cases founded on special agreement, since a state may have no interest in having the matter examined by the Court and may refuse to comply with a judgment. For example, during the [[Iran hostage crisis]], [[Iran]] refused to participate in a case brought by USA based on a compromissory clause contained in the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], nor did it comply with the judgment.{{ref|8}} Since the [[1970s]], the use of such clauses has declined. Many modern treaties set out their own dispute resolution regime, often based on forms of [[arbitration]].{{ref|9}}

*Thirdly, Article 36(2) allows states to make optional clause declarations accepting the Court's jurisdiction. The tag of &quot;compulsory&quot; which is sometimes placed on Article 36(2) jurisdiction is misleading since declarations by states are voluntary. Furthermore, many declarations contain reservations, such as exclusion from jurisdiction certain types of dispute (&quot;''ratione materia''&quot;).{{ref|10}} The principle of [[reciprocity]] may further limit jurisdiction. As of [[December 2005]], sixty-five states had a declaration in force.{{ref|11}} Out of the [[Security Council]] members, only the [[United Kingdom]] has a declaration. In the Court's early years, most declarations were made by industrialised countries. Since the ''[[Nicaragua v. United States|Nicaragua Case]]'', declarations made by developing countries have increased, reflecting a growing confidence in the Court since the [[1980s]].

*Finally, 36(5) provides for jurisdiction on the basis of declarations made under the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]]'s statute. Article 37 of the ICJ's statute similarly transfers jurisdiction under any compromissory clause in a treaty that gave jurisdiction to the PCIJ. 

In addition, the Court may have jurisdiction on the basis of tacit consent (''[[forum prorogatum]]''). In the absence of clear jurisdiction under Article 36, jurisdiction will be established if the respondent accepts its jurisdiction explicitly or simply pleads to the merits. The notion arose in the ''Corfu Channel Case'' (UK v Albania) in which it was held that letter from [[Albania]] stating that it submitted to the jurisdiction of the ICJ was sufficient to found jurisdiction.

===Advisory opinion===

An advisory opinion is a function of the court open only to specified United Nations bodies and agencies. On receiving a request, the Court decides which States and organizations might provide useful information and gives them an opportunity to present written or oral statements. Advisory Opinions were intended as a means by which UN agencies could seek the Court's help in deciding complex legal issues that might fall under their respective mandates. In principle the Court's advisory opinions are consultative in character, though they are also influential and widely respected. Whilst certain instruments or regulations can provide in advance that the advisory opinion shall be specifically binding on particular agencies or states, they are inherently non-binding under the Statute of the Court.

Advisory Opinions have often been controversial, either because the questions asked are controversial, or because the case was pursued as a &quot;backdoor&quot; way of bringing what is really a contentious case before the Court.

Examples of cases include:

*Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice on the [[Israeli West Bank Barrier]].
*[[Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice of 8 July 1996| An advisory opinion on the legality of the use (or threat to use) nuclear weapons]].
*The [[International Court of Justice Advisory Opinion on Western Sahara|opinion]] on [[Western Sahara]], issued in [[1975]].

===The ICJ and the Security Council===

Article 94 establishes the duty of all UN members to comply with decisions of the Court involving them. If parties do not comply, the issue may be taken before the [[Security Council]] for enforcement action. There are obvious problems with such a method of enforcement. If the judgment is against one of the permanent five members of the Security Council or its allies, any resolution on enforcement will be vetoed. This occurred, for example, after the [[Nicaragua v. United States|''Nicaragua'' case]], when [[Nicaragua]] brought the issue of the USA's non-compliance with the Court's decision before the Security Council.{{ref|2}} Furthermore, if the Security Council refuses to enforce a judgment against any other state, there is no method of forcing the state to comply.

The relationship between the ICJ and the [[Security Council]], and the separation of their powers, was considered by the Court in [[1992]], in the [[Pan Am case|''Pan Am'' case]]. The Court had to consider an application from [[Libya]] for the order of provisional measures to protect its rights, which, it alleged, were being infringed by the threat of economic sanctions by the [[UK]] and [[USA]]. The problem was that these sanctions had been authorised by the Security Council, which resulted with a potential conflict between the Chapter VII functions of the Security Council and the judicial function of the Court. The Court decided, by eleven votes to five, that it could not order the requested provisional measures because the rights claimed by Libya, even if legitimate under the [[Montreal Convention]], could no longer be upheld since the action was justified by the Security Council. In accordance with Article 103 of the UN Charter, obligations under the Charter took precedence over other treaty obligations.

There was a marked reluctance on the part of a majority of the Court to become involved in a dispute in such a way as to bring it potentially into conflict with the Council. The Court stated in the ''Nicaragua'' case (Jurisdiction) that there is no necessary inconsistency between action by the Security Council and adjudication by the ICJ. However, where there is room for conflict, the balance appears to be in favour of the Security Council.

Should either party fail &quot;to perform the obligations incumbent upon it under a judgment rendered by the Court&quot;, the Security Council may be called upon to &quot;make recommendations or decide upon measures&quot; if the security council deems such actions necessary. In practice, the Court's powers have been limited by the unwillingness of the losing party to abide by the Court's ruling, and by the Security Council's unwillingness to enforce consequences. However, in theory, &quot;so far as the parties to the case are concerned, a judgment of the Court is binding, final and without appeal,&quot; and &quot;by signing the Charter, a State Member of the United Nations undertakes to comply with any decision of the International Court of Justice in a case to which it is a party&quot;. 

For example, in [[Nicaragua v. United States]] the [[United States|United States of America]] had previously accepted the Court's compulsory jurisdiction upon its creation in [[1946]] but withdrew its acceptance following the Court's judgment in [[1984]] that called on the [[United States]] to &quot;cease and to refrain&quot; from the &quot;unlawful use of force&quot; against the government of [[Nicaragua]]. In a split decision, the majority of the Court ruled the [[United States]] was &quot;in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to use force against another state&quot; and ordered the US pay [[reparations]] (see note 2), although it never did.

Examples of cases include:

*A complaint by the [[United States]] in [[1980]] that [[Iran]] was detaining American diplomats in [[Tehran]] in violation of international law.
*A dispute between [[Tunisia]] and [[Libya]] over the delimitation of the continental shelf between them.
*A dispute over the course of the maritime boundary dividing the U.S. and [[Canada]] in the [[Gulf of Maine]] area.
*A complaint by the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] against the member states of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] regarding their actions in the [[Kosovo War]]. This was denied on [[15 December]], [[2004]] due to lack of jurisdiction, because the FRY was not a party to the ICJ statute at the time it made the application. 

The last example can be used as evidence of the Court's failure to take on politically conenemy of liberty. For one of the most important criteria of freedom is the right to private property in the products of ones labor. State Socialists, Communists, Syndicalists and Communist-Anarchists deny private property.&quot; -Clarence Swartz, ''What is Mutualism''  &quot;...the principle of individual property... says that each man has an absolute dominion, as against all other men, over the products and acquisitions of his own labor.&quot; -Lysander Spooner, ''The Law of Intellectual Property''

'''(PoLxAC)''' The labor theory of value is erroneous. Profit is not exploitative and contract is supreme. &quot;The capitalist, then, is a man who has labored, saved out of his labor (i.e., has restricted his consumption) and, in a series of voluntary contracts has (a) purchased ownership rights in capital goods, and (b) paid the laborers for their labor services in transforming those capital goods into goods nearer the final stage of being consumed. Note again that no one is preventing the laborers themselves from saving, purchasing capital goods from their owners and then working on their own capital goods, finally selling the product and reaping the profits. In fact, the capitalists are conferring a great benefit on these laborers, making possible the entire complex vertical network of exchanges in the modern economy.&quot; - Murray Rothbard, ''The Ethics of Liberty''.

'''(CGxCol)''' The means of production are owned by the community in collective. &quot;The revolution as we understand it will have to destroy the State and all the institutions of the State, radically and completely, from its very first day. The natural and necessary consequences of such destruction will be: ... f. the confiscation of all productive capital and of the tools of production for the benefit of workers’ associations, who will have to have them produced collectively.&quot; - Bakunin, ''The Program of the International Brotherhood''.

'''(CGxInd)''' All products of labor are the property of the individual, regardless of in the form of capital or not.&quot;Proudhon scoffed at this distinction between capital and product. He maintained that capital and product are not different kinds of wealth, but simply alternate conditions or functions of the same wealth. ...  For these and other reasons Proudhon and Warren found themselves unable to sanction any such plan as the seizure of capital by society.&quot; - Benjamin Tucker, ''State Socialism and Anarchism''.

'''(CGxAC)''' &quot;Production begins with natural resources, and then various forms of machines and capital goods, until finally, goods are sold to the consumer. At each stage of production from natural resource to consumer good, money is voluntarily exchanged for capital goods, labor services, and land resources. At each step of the way, terms of exchanges, or prices, are determined by the voluntary interactions of suppliers and demanders. This market is &quot;free&quot; because choices, at each step, are made freely and voluntarily.&quot; - Rothbard, ''[http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/FreeMarket.html Free Market]''.

'''(LrxCol)''' Will you stand up for that piece of chicanery which consists in affirming 'freedom of contract'? Or will you uphold equity, according to which a contract entered into between a man who has dined well and the man who sells his labor for bare subsistence, between the strong and the weak, is not a contract at all?&quot; -Peter Kropotkin, ''An Appeal to the Young''

'''(LrxInd)''' It is considered exploitative to pay an individual for less than the &quot;full produce&quot; of his labor. - &quot;The price is not sufficient: the labor of the workers has created a value; now this value is their property. But they have neither sold nor exchanged it; and you, capitalist, you have not earned it. That you should have a partial right to the whole, in return for the materials that you have furnished and the provisions that you have supplied, is perfectly just. You contributed to the production, you ought to share in the enjoyment. But your right does not annihilate that of the laborers, who, in spite of you, have been your colleagues in the work of production. Why do you talk of wages? The money with which you pay the wages of the laborers remunerates them for only a few years of the perpetual possession which they have abandoned to you. Wages is the cost of the daily maintenance and refreshment of the laborer. You are wrong in calling it the price of a sale. The workingman has sold nothing; he knows neither his right, nor the extent of the concession which he has made to you, nor the meaning of the contract which you pretend to have made with him. On his side, utter ignorance; on yours, error and surprise, not to say deceit and fraud.&quot; - [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] &quot;In defending the right to take usury, we do not defend the right [ethicality] of usury&quot; -Benjamin Tucker, ''Liberty I,3'' Note- Tucker used the term &quot;usury&quot; to mean profit --both from capital and labor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Italo Calvino''' ([[October 15]],[[1923]] &amp;ndash; [[September 19]], [[1985]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[writer]] and [[novelist]].

Born in [[Santiago de Las Vegas]], [[Cuba]], to botanists Mario Calvino and Evelina Mameli (a descendant of [[Goffredo Mameli]]) and brother of [[Floriano Calvino]], a famous [[geologist]], he soon moved to his family's homeland of [[Italy]], where he lived most of his life.

[[Image:calvino-italo.jpg|thumb|Italo Calvino]]

==Timeline==

He stayed in [[San Remo, Italy|San Remo]], on the [[Italian Riviera]], for some 20 years, and enrolled in the ''Avanguardisti'' (a [[fascism|fascist]] youth organisation to which membership was practically compulsory) with whom he took part in the occupation of the [[French Riviera]]. He suffered some religious troubles, his relatives being followers of the [[Waldensian]] Protestant Church. He met [[Eugenio Scalfari]] (later a politician and the founder of the major newspaper ''La Repubblica''), with whom he would remain a close friend.

In [[1941]] he moved to [[Turin]], after a long hesitation over living in this town or [[Milan]]. He often humorously described this choice, and used to define Turin as &quot;a city that is serious but sad.&quot;

In [[1943]], he joined the Partisans in the Italian Resistance, in the [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] brigade, with the battlename of ''Santiago'', and with Scalfari he created the MUL (liberal universitarian  movement).  He then entered the (still clandestine) [[Italian Communist Party]].

In [[1947]], Calvino graduated from Turin's [[university]] with a thesis on [[Joseph Conrad]] and started working with the official Communist paper ''L'Unità''; he also had a short relationship with the [[Einaudi]] publishing house, which put him in contact with [[Norberto Bobbio]], [[Natalia Ginzburg]], [[Cesare Pavese]] and [[Elio Vittorini]]. With Vittorini he wrote for the weekly ''Il Politecnico'' (a cultural magazine associated with the university). He then left Einaudi to work mainly with L'Unità and the newborn communist weekly political magazine ''Rinascita''.

In [[1950]], he worked again for the Einaudi house, where he became responsible for the literary volumes. The following year, presumably in order to verify a possibility of advancement in the communist party, he visited the [[Soviet Union]]. The reports and correspondence he produced from this visit were later collected and earned him literary prizes.

In [[1952]] Calvino wrote with [[Giorgio Bassani]] for ''[[Botteghe Oscure]]'', a magazine named after the popular name of the party's head-offices, and worked for ''Il Contemporaneo'', a [[marxism|Marxist]] weekly.

It was in [[1957]] that Calvino unexpectedly left the Communist party, and his letter of resignation (soon famous) was published in ''L'Unità''. 

He found new spaces for his periodic writings in the magazines ''Passato e Presente'' and ''Italia Domani''. Together with Vittorini he became a co-editor of ''Il Menabò di letteratura'', a position that he held for many years.

Despite the previously severe restrictions for foreigners holding communist views, he was allowed to visit the [[United States]], where he stayed six months (four of which he spent in [[New York]]), after an invitation by the [[Ford Foundation]]. Calvino was particularly impressed by the &quot;New World&quot;: &quot;Naturally I visited the South and also California, but I always felt a New Yorker. My city is New York.&quot;  In the States he also met Esther Judith Singer, whom he married a few years later in [[Havana]], during a trip in which he visited his birthplace and met [[Ernesto Che Guevara]].

Back in Italy, and once again working for Einaudi, he started publishing some of his ''cosmicomics'' in ''Il Caffè'', a literary magazine.

Vittorini's death in [[1966]] had a heavy influence on Calvino and caused him to experience what has been defined as an &quot;intellectual depression&quot;, which the writer himself described as an important passage in his life: &quot;...I ceased to be young. Perhaps it's a metabolic process, something that comes with age, I'd been young for a long time, perhaps too long, suddenly I felt that I had to begin my old age, yes, old age, perhaps with the hope of prolonging it by beginning it early&quot;.

He then started to frequent [[Paris]] (where he was nicknamed ''L'ironique amusé''). Here he soon joined some important circles like the [[Oulipo]] (''Ouvroir de littérature potentielle'') and met [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], in the fermenting atmosphere that was going to evolve into the [[1968]]'s cultural revolution (the [[French May]]); in his French experience he also became fond of [[Raymond Queneau]]'s works, which would sensibly influence his later production.

Calvino also had more intense contacts with the academic world, with notable experiences at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] (with Barthes) and at [[Urbino]]'s [[university]]. His interests included classical studies ([[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Ludovico Ariosto]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Ignacio de Loyola]], [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Cyrano de Bergerac|Cyrano de Bergérac]], [[Giacomo Leopardi]]) while at the same time, not without a certain surprise from the Italian intellectual circles, he wrote [[novel]]s for [[Playboy]]'s Italian edition ([[1973]]). He became a regular contributor to the important Italian newspaper ([[Corriere della Sera]]).

In [[1975]] he was made Honorary Member of the [[American Academy]], the following year he was awarded the Austrian State Prize for European Literature. He visited [[Japan]] and [[Mexico]] and gave lectures in several American towns.

In [[1981]] he was awarded the prestigious French [[Légion d'Honneur]].

In [[1985]] he died in [[Siena, Italy|Siena]] at the ancient [[hospital]] of ''Santa Maria della Scala'' of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]].

==[[If On a Winter's Night a Traveler]]== 

Perhaps Calvino's most famous novel, this begins with the words, &quot;You are about to begin reading Italo Calvino's new novel, ''If on a winter's night a traveller''.&quot; It's a novel therefore in which the reader plays a starring role. The reader gets a love interest, the Other Reader, and obstacles thrown in his way. In particular, the first story runs out after only a chapter. A pattern is quickly set up with single chapters of novels being cut off in their prime. Interspersed with these are chapters in which the reader's story, the pursuit of the end of these intriguing novels, and the pursuit of the Other Reader, is played out.  Each chapter is written in the style of a different genre of work.

The central concept of this novel is the quest to find a complete and coherent narrative: a quest being undertaken by the actual reader and the Reader as character, struggling to hunt down the ever-elusive Chapters. In fact Calvino does hide a short, elegant story in the book (more of a vignette, really), and with a magician's flair he hides it in plain sight in a part of the book to which most readers give cursory attention.

== Quotations ==

===Italo Calvino===
:I set my hand to the art of writing early on. Publishing was easy for me, and I at once found favor and understanding. But it was a long time before I realized and convinced myself that this was anything but mere chance. 

:Everything can change, but not the language that we carry inside us, like a world more exclusive and final than one's mother's womb.

:Your first book already defines you, while you are really far from being defined. And this definition is something you may then carry with you for the rest of your life, trying to confirm it or extend or correct or deny it; but you can never eliminate it. (preface to ''The Path to the Nest of Spiders'')

:In an age when other fantastically speedy, widespread media are triumphing and running the risk of flattening all communication onto a single, homogeneous surface, the function of literature is communication between things that are different simply because they are different, not blunting but even sharpening the differences between them, following the true bent of the written language. (''Six Memos for the Next Millennium'')

:Then we have computer science. It is true that software cannot exercise its powers of lightness except through the weight of hardware. But it is the software that gives the orders, acting on the outside world and on machines that exist only as functions of software and evolve so that they can work out ever more complex programs. The second industrial revolution, unlike the first, does not present us with such crushing images as rolling mills and molten steel, but with &quot;bits&quot; in a flow of information traveling along circuits in the form of electronic impulses. The iron machines still exist, but they obey the orders of weightless bits.
:(''Six Memos for the Next Millennium {Lightness}'')

===[[Gore Vidal]]===
:Italo Calvino has advanced far beyond his American and English contemporaries. As they continue to look for the place where the spiders make their nests, Calvino has not only found this special place but learned how himself to make fantastic webs of prose to which all things adhere.

  &lt;TR ALIGN=&quot victims has been changed to [[No_fault_insurance|No Fault]] systems, which reduce or eliminate the ability to sue for compensation but provide automatic eligibility for benefits.
*[[Boiler insurance]] (also known as Boiler and Machinery insurance or Equipment Breakdown Insurance)
*[[Casualty insurance]] insures against accidents, not necessarily tied to any specific property.
*[[Credit insurance]] pays some or all of a [[loan]] back when certain things happen to the borrower such as [[unemployment]], [[disability]], or [[death]].
*[[Financial loss insurance]] protects individuals and companies against various financial risks. For example, a [[business]] might purchase cover to protect it from loss of [[sales]] if a fire in a [[factory]] prevented it from carrying out its business for a time. Insurance might also cover failure of a [[creditor]] to pay [[money]] it owes to the insured.  [[Fidelity bond]]s and [[surety bond]]s are included in this category.
*[[Health insurance]] covers [[medicine|medical]] bills incurred because of [[disease|sickness]] or accidents.
*[[Liability insurance]] covers legal claims against the insured. For example, a homeowner's insurance policy provides the insured with protection in the event of a claim brought by someone who slips and falls on the property, and brings a lawsuit for her injuries. Similarly, a [[Physician|doctor]] may purchase liability insurance to cover any legal claims against him if his negligence (carelessness) in treating a patient caused the patient injury and/or monetary harm.  The protection offered by a liability insurance policy is two-fold: a legal defense in the event of a lawsuit commenced against the policyholder, plus indemnification (payment on behalf of the insured) with respect to a settlement or court verdict.
*[[Life insurance]] provides a cash benefit to a decedent's family or other designated beneficiary, and may specifically provide for [[burial]] and other final expenses.
**[[annuity|Annuities]] provide a stream of payments and are generally classified as insurance because they are issued by insurance companies and regulated as insurance. Annuities and [[pension]]s that pay a benefit for life are sometimes regarded as insurance against the possibility that a [[retirement|retiree]] will outlive his or her financial resources.  In that sense, they are the complement of life insurance.
*[[Total permanent disability insurance]] insurance provides benefits when a person is permanently disabled and can no longer work in their profession, often taken as an adjunct to life insurance. 
*[[Locked Funds Insurance]] is a little known hybrid insurance policy jointly issued by governments and banks. It is used to protect public funds from tamper by unauthorised parties. In special cases, a government may authorise its use in protecting semi-private funds which are liable to tamper. Terms of this type of insurance are usually very strict. As such it is only used in extreme cases where maximum security of funds is required.
*[[Marine Insurance]] covers the loss or damage of goods at sea.  Marine insurance typically compensates the owner of merchandise for losses sustained from fire, shipwreck, etc., but excludes losses that can be recovered from the carrier.
*Nuclear incident insurance - damages resulting from an incident involving radioactivive materials is generally arranged at the national level.  (For the United States, see [[Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act]].)
*[[Political risk insurance]] can be taken out by businesses with operations in [[country|countries]] in which there is a risk that [[revolution]] or other [[politics|political]] conditions will result in a loss.
*[[Professional Indemnity Insurance]] is normally a mandatory requirement for professional practitioners such as Architects, Lawyers, Doctors and Accountants to provide insurance cover against potential negligence claims.  Non licensed professionals may also purchase malpractice insurance, it is commonly called Errors and Omissions Insurance and covers a service provider for claims made against them that arise out of the performance of specified professional services.  For instance, a web site designer can obtain E&amp;O insurance to cover them for certain claims made by third parties that arise out of negligent performance of web site development services.
*[[Property insurance]] provides protection against risks to property, such as fire, [[theft]] or [[weather]] damage.  This includes specialized forms of insurance such as [[fire insurance]], [[flood insurance]], [[earthquake insurance]], [[home insurance]], inland marine insurance or [[boiler insurance]].
*[[Terrorism insurance]]
*[[Title insurance]] provides a guarantee that title to [[real property]] is vested in the purchaser and/or [[mortgage]]e, free and clear of [[lien]]s or encumbrances. It is usually issued in conjunction with a search of the public records done at the time of a [[real estate]] transaction.
*[[Travel insurance]] is an insurance cover taken by those who travel abroad, which covers certain losses such as medical expenses, lost of personal belongings, travel delay, personal liabilities.. etc.
*[[Workers' compensation]] insurance replaces all or part of a worker's [[wage]]s lost and accompanying medical expense incurred due to a job-related injury. 

A single policy may cover risks in one or more of the above categories.  For example, car insurance would typically cover both property risk (covering the risk of theft or damage to the car) and liability risk (covering legal claims from say, causing an accident).  A [[home insurance|homeowner]]'s insurance policy in the US typically includes property insurance covering damage to the home and the owner's belongings, liability insurance covering certain legal claims against the owner, and even a small amount of health insurance for medical expenses of guests who are injured on the owner's property.

Potential sources of risk that may give rise to claims are known as &quot;[[peril]]s&quot;.  Examples of perils might be fire, theft, [[earthquake]], [[hurricane]] and many other potential risks.  An insurance policy will set out in details which perils are covered by the policy and which are not.

==Types of insurance companies==
Insurance companies may be classified as

*''Life'' insurance companies, who sell life insurance, annuities and pensions products.
*''Non-life'' or ''general'' insurance companies, who sell other types of insurance.

In most countries, life and non-life insurers are subject to different regulations, [[tax]] and [[accounting]] rules.  The main reason for the distinction between the two types of company is that life business is very long term in nature &amp;mdash; coverage for life assurance or a pension can cover risks over many [[decade]]s.  By contrast, non-life insurance cover usually covers a shorter period, such as one year.

Insurance companies are generally classified as either ''[[mutual]]'' or ''stock'' companies.  This is more of a traditional distinction as true mutual companies are becoming rare.  Mutual companies are owned by the policyholders, while stockholders, (who may or may not own policies) own stock insurance companies.

''[[Reinsurance]]'' companies are insurance companies that sell policies  to other insurance companies, allowing them to reduce their risks and protect themselves from very large losses. The reinsurance market is dominated by a few very large companies, with huge reserves.

''[[Captive Insurance]]'' companies may be defined as limited purpose insurance companies established with the specific objective of financing risks emanating from their parent group or groups. This definition can sometimes be extended to include some of the risks of the parent company's customers. In short terms, it is an in-house self-insurance vehicle. Captives may take the form of a &quot;pure&quot; entity (which is a 100% a subsidiary of the self-insured parent company); of a &quot;mutual&quot; captive (which insures the collective risks of industry members) and of an &quot;association&quot; captive (which self-insures individual risks of the members of a professional, commercial or industrial association). Captives represent commercial, economic and tax advantages to their sponsors due to the reductions on costs they help create, the ease for insurance risk management and the flexibility for cash flows they generate. Additionally, they may provide coverage of risks which are neither available nor offered in the traditional insurance market at reasonable prices.

The types of risk that a captive can underwrite for the parent include property damage, public and products liability, professional indemnity, employee benefits, employers liability, motor and medical aid expenses. The captive's exposure to such risks may be limited by the use of reinsurance.

Captives are becoming an increasingly important component of the risk management and risk financing strategy of their parent. This can be understood against the following background:

*heavy and increasing premium costs in almost every line of coverage;
*difficulties in insuring certain types of fortuitous risk;
*differential coverage standards in various parts of the world;
*rating structures which reflect market trends rather than individual loss experience;
*insufficient credit for deductibles and/or loss control efforts.

There are also companies known as 'insurance consultants'. Like a mortgage broker, these companies are paid a fee by the customer to shop around for the best insurance policy amongst many companies .

Similar to an insurance consultant, an 'insurance broker' also shops around for the best insurance policy amongst many companies.   However, with insurance brokers, the fee is usually paid in the form of commission from the insurer that is selected rather than directly from the client.

Third Party Administrators are companies that perform underwriting and sometimes claims handling services for insurance companies.  These companies often have special expertise that the insurance companies do not have.

==Life insurance and saving==
Certain life insurance contracts accumulate [[cash]] values, which may be taken by the insured if the policy is surrendered or which may be borrowed against. Some policies, such as annuities and [[financial endowment|endowment]] policies, are financial instruments to accumulate or [[liquidation|liquidate]] [[wealth]] when it is needed. See [[life insurance]].  

In many countries, such as the US and the UK, [[tax law]] provides that the interest on this cash value is not taxable under certain circumstances. This leads to widespread use of life insurance as a tax-efficient method of [[saving]] as well as protection in the event of early death.

==Financial viability of insurance companies==
Financial stability and strength of the insurance company should be a major consideration when purchasing an insurance contract. An insurance premium paid currently provides coverage for losses that might arise many years in the future.  For that reason, the viability of the insurance carrier is very important. In recent years, a number of insurance companies have become insolvent, leaving their policyholders with no coverage (or coverage only from a government-backed insurance pool with less attractive payouts for losses). A number of independent rating agencies, such as Best's, provide information and rate the financial viability of insurance companies.

==Controversies==
=== Insurance insulates too much ===
By creating a &quot;security blanket&quot; for its insureds, an insurance company may inadvertently find that its insureds may not be as risk-averse as they should be (since the insured assumes the risk belongs to the insurer). This problem is known to the insurance industry as [[moral hazard]]. To reduce their own financial exposure, insurance companies have contractual clauses that mitigate their obligation to provide coverage if the insured engages in some kind of behavior that grossly magnifies their risk of loss or liability.  

For example, liability insurance providers do not provide coverage for liability arising from [[intentional tort]]s committed by the insured.  Even if a provider was irrational enough to try to provide such coverage, it is against the public policy of most countries to allow such insurance to exist, and thus it is usually illegal.

===Complexity of insurance policy contracts===
Insurance policies can be complex and some policyholders may not understand all the fees, regulation and coverages included in a policy. As a result, people could buy policies at unfavorable terms. In response to these issues, governments often make detailed regulations that set down minimum standards for policies and govern how they may be [[advertising|advertised]] and sold.

Many individuals purchase policies through an insurance broker.  The broker can counsel the policyholder on which coverage to purchase and limitations of the policy. A broker generally holds contracts with many insurers which allows the broker to &quot;shop&quot; the [[market]] for the best rates and coverage possible.

=== Redlining ===
Redlining is the practice of some insurance companies to deny the issuance of coverage in specific geographic areas, usually due to an increased likelihood of risk; the validity of the assessment may be real or perceived, though it is often attributed to discrimination. 

Evaluation of risk, when an insurer determines a premium or premium rate structure, considers  quantifiable factors, including location, [[credit score]]s, [[gender]], [[occupation]], [[marital status]], and [[education]] level.  However, the use of these essential factors, whether inappropriately or not, are often considered to be 'unfair' or [[discriminatory]] by some consumers and their advocates, sometimes leading to political disputes about insurers' determination of premiums and possible [[government]] intervention to limit the factors used.   

A refutation to this is that the job of an insurance underwriter is to properly categorize a given risk as to the likelihood that the loss will occur. Any factor that causes a greater likelihood of loss should in theory, be charged a higher rate. This is a basic principle of insurance and must be followed for insurance companies or groups to operate properly, even for [[non-profit organization]]s. Thus, discrimination of potential insureds by legitimate factors is central to insurance. Therefore the only thing that can be considered legitimately &quot;unfair&quot; are practices that [[discrimination|discriminate]] against a given group without actual factors that show that the group is a higher risk. So, eliminating real factors discriminates against other insureds by forcing them to bear part of the cost of the disallowed perceived factors.

=== Health insurance ===
Health insurance, which is coverage for individuals to protect them against medical costs, is a highly charged and political issue in the United States, which does not have socialized health coverage.  In theory, the market for health insurance provision should function in a manner similar to other insurance coverages, but the skyrocketing cost of health coverage has disrupted markets around the globe, but perhaps most glaringly in the US.  Please see [[health insurance]] for a discussion of this category.

=== Dental insurance ===
Dental insurance, like health insurance, is coverage for individuals to protect them against dental costs.  Dental insurance usually goes hand-in-hand with health insurance, with most people in the United States receiving it included in their health insurance plan from their employer.  Along with receiving dental insurance from your employer, there are ways to receive dental insurance through resellers and companies for individuals and families; although this way tends to be too expensive for most people.

=== Insurance Patents ===
New insurance products can now be protected from copying with a [[business method patent]].  This may lead to the more rapid introduction of new insurance products as insurance companies will invest more heavily in new product development if they can be reasonably assured that their patents will keep those products from being copied.

A recent example of a new insurance product that is patented is telematic [[auto insurance]].  It was independently invented and patented by a major US auto insurance company, [[Progressive Corporation|Progressive Auto Insurance]] ([http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5797134.html US patent 5,797,134]) and a Spanish independent inventor, Salvador Minguijon Perez ([http://v3.espacenet.com/origdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=EP0700009&amp;F=8&amp;RPN=EP0700009&amp;DOC=cca34af1984f0dc47b32e9a9722ad1a148 European Patent EP0700009B1]).  

The basic idea of telematic auto insurance is that a driver's behavior is monitored directly while the person drives and this information is transmitted to an insurance company.  The insurance company then assesses the risk of that driver having an accident and charges insurance premiums accordingly. A driver that drives a lot of distance at high speed, for example, will be charged a higher rate than a driver that drives small distances at low speed.  

A British auto insurance company, [[Norwich Union]], has taken a license to both the Progressive patent and Perez patent.  They have made additional investments in infrastructure and developed a commercial offering called &quot;Pay As You Drive&quot; or PAYD.  

Many independent inventors are in favor of patenting new insurance products since it gives them protection from big companies when they bring their new insurance products to market.  Independent inventors account for 70% of the new US patent applications in this area.

Many insurance executives are opposed to patenting insurance products because it creates a new risk for them.  [[The Hartford]] insurance company, for example, had to recently pay US$80 million to an independent inventor, Bancorp Services, in order to settle a patent infringement and theft of trade secret lawsuit for a new type of corporate owned life insurance product invented and patented by Bancorp.

There are currently about 150 new patent applications on insurance inventions filed per year in the United States. [http://marketsandpatents.com/IPB-12152005.mht (Source: Insurance IP Bulletin, December 15, 2005)].  Only about 20 - 30 patents per year, however, are actually issuing.

=== The insurance industry and rent seeking ===
Certain insurance products and practices have been described as [[rent seeking]] by critics. That is, insurance companies have been alleged to have certain products or practices that are only useful due to certain government laws (especially tax laws), and that the insurance industry in these cases generally adds no economic value but instead supports politicians who will continue the legal regime which gives the insurance company these benefits. For example, in the United States the current tax rules generally allow owners of variable annuities (see [[annuity (US financial products)]] and variable life insurance (see [[variable universal life insurance]]) to invest in the stock market and defer or eliminate paying any taxes until withdrawals are made. Sometimes this tax deferral is the only reason some individuals use these products instead of a mutual fund. Another example is the legal infrastructure which allows life insurance to be held in an irrevocable trust which is used to pay an [[estate tax]] while the proceeds itself are immune from the estate tax.

== Insurance in [[Blackjack]] ==
In the [[casino]] game , [[insurance]] is an optional play that requires the player to bet 1/2 of his current bet to the posibilitiy of the house drawing a blackjack (an ace and a ten), if the house does draw a blackjack, all insured players get their bet back, including the insurance, if not, the insurance is lost and the game continues as normal. A player can only buy insurance if the house open [[card]] is an ace, and only at the beginning of his turn.

According to [[Game Theory]], it is statistically unwise to buy insurance, given that the potential win is not enough to justify the risk of losing (there are 12 different cards, and either 4 or 1 are any good if insurance is possible).

==Glossary==
* 'Combined Ratio' = loss ratio + expense ratio.  Loss Ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of losses by the amount of written premium.  Expense ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of operational expenses by the amount of earned premium.  A lower number indicates a better return on the amount of capital placed at risk by an insurer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''International environmental law''' is the body of [[international law]] that concerns the protection of the global environment.

There have been many [[environmental agreements|legally-binding international agreements]] concerning the protection of the environment, but in this area of international law [[soft law]] is more common than normal.

Some basic principles of international environmental law are:
*the [[precautionary principle]]
*the [[polluter pays principle]]
*the principle of [[sustainable development]]
*environmental procedural rights

Important cases have included the various [[nuclear testing|nuclear testing]] cases such as between [[New Zealand]] and [[France]] before the [[International Court of Justice]].

Groups active in the area include the [http://www.elaw.org/ Environmental Law Alliance Worldwide(E-LAW)] and the[http://www.ciel.org/ Centre for International Environmental Law]

International environmental lawyers often receive specialized training in the form of an LL.M. degree after having a first law degree -- often in anon't feel hurt.

The documentary [[Life and Debt]] deals with the IMF's policies' influence on [[Jamaica]] and its economy, from a critical point of view.

== Past managing directors ==   
An unwritten rule establishes that the IMF's managing director must be European and that the president of the World Bank must be from the [[United States]]. Executive Directors, who confirm the managing director are voted in by Finance Ministers from countries they represent. 

The IMF is for the most part controlled by the major Western Powers, with voting rights on the Executive board based on a quota derived from a monetary stake in the institution. Rarely does the board vote and pass issues contradicting the will of the US or Europeans. There have been some exceptions in the past. Dr. [[Mohamed Finaish]] from [[Libya]], the Executive Director representing the majority of the Arab World and [[Pakistan]], was a tireless defender of the developing nations' rights at the IMF.  He stood steadfast in his beliefs and principles for fourteen years until his defeat in the 1992 elections to an Egyptian IMF Staff Member.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:Islands of the lower Firth of Clyde.PNG|thumb|Map showing location of the islands]]

The '''Islands of the lower Firth of Clyde''' is the smallest of the three major [[Scotland|Scottish]] island groups after the [[Hebrides]] and the [[Northern Isles]].

The islands are situated in [[Scotland]] in the [[Firth of Clyde]] between [[Ayrshire]] and [[Argyll]]. They include:

'''Arran''', '''Bute''', '''Great Cumbrae''', '''Holy Isle''' and '''Inchmarnock''' are all inhabited and are serviced by dedicated ferry routes.  '''Little Cumbrae''' and '''Sanda''' are also inhabited but without ferry services.  The rest of the islands are uninhabited.

The majority of the islands at one time made up the [[traditional county]] of [[Bute]]. Today the islands are split more or less equally between the modern unitary authorities of [[Argyll and Bute]] and [[North Ayrshire]] with only '''Ailsa Craig''' and '''Lady Isle''' falling outwith these two areas in [[South Ayrshire]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''International Bank Account Number''' ('''IBAN''') is an international standard for numbering bank accounts. It was originally adopted by the [[European Committee for Banking Standards]], and was later adopted as [[ISO 13616]]:[[1997]]. The IBAN consists of a two letter [[ISO 3166-1]] [[country code]], followed by two check digits, and up to thirty alphanumeric characters for the domestic bank account number, called the BBAN (Basic Bank Account Number). It is up to each country's national banking community to decide on the length of the BBAN for accounts in that country, but its length must be fixed for any given country. A unique identifying code for the bank, of a fixed length and at a fixed position, is required to be contained in the BBAN. However, it is left up to the national banking communities to determine its length and position within the BBAN, so long as it is constant for each country.

When stored electronically, the IBAN is not to be broken up by spaces; but when printed on paper, it is to be expressed in groups of four characters, with the last group of variable length.

The IBAN was developed to help improve the payments system within the European Union. Customers, especially individuals and [[Small and Medium-sized Enterprise|SME]]s, are frequently confused by differing national standards for bank account numbers. While the system is capable of being used for routing purposes, it cannot at present be used to do so since the IBAN has not been widely adopted outside of Europe, and the ECBS expects that the process of adoption may take five to ten years. Until then, it is necessary to continue to use the current [[ISO 9362]] [[Bank Identifier Code]] or BIC system in conjunction with the IBAN in order to ensure proper routing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[grammar]], the '''infinitive''' is the form of a [[verb]] that has no [[inflection]] to indicate [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]], [[grammatical mood|mood]] or [[grammatical tense|tense]].  It is called the &quot;infinitive&quot; because the verb is usually not made &quot;[[finite verb|finite]]&quot;, or limited by inflection.  In some [[language]]s, however, there are inflected forms of the infinitive denoting attributes such as tense, person and number. It happens for example in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. There are languages that do not have infinitives at all, for example [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Modern Greek]]. In some languages the infinitive can be construed as a [[verbal noun]].

The infinitive is often used as the &quot;[[citation form]]&quot;, as for many languages this is the basic [[lemma (linguistics)|lemma]] form of a verb which is usually presented in dictionaries.  In language classes, children are sometimes taught to think of it as the &quot;name&quot; of the verb.

==Infinitives in English==

[[English language|English]] has three non-finite verbal forms, but by long-standing convention, the term &quot;infinitive&quot; is applied to only one of these. (The other two are the past- and present-[[participle]] forms, where the present-participle form is also the [[gerund]] form.) In English, a verb's infinitive is its unmarked form, such as &quot;be,&quot; &quot;do,&quot; &quot;have,&quot; or &quot;sit,&quot; often introduced by the [[grammatical particle|particle]] &quot;to.&quot; When this particle is absent, the infinitive is said to be a ''bare infinitive''; when it is present, it is generally considered to be a part of the infinitive, then known as the ''full infinitive'' (or ''to-infinitive''), and some grammarians hold that it should not be separated from the main word of the infinitive. (''See'' [[split infinitive]].)

While many other languages, including French and German, use prepositions before the infinitive in much the same way English does (''de faire, zu tun''), grammarians of those languages do not construe the prepositions as part of the infinitive.  To this extent, the concept of the full infinitive, though not the construction itself, is uniquely English. &lt;!-- I'm not so sure. Hebrew has something very similar; both &quot;daber&quot; and &quot;l'daber&quot; - &quot;speak&quot; and &quot;to speak&quot; are commonly considered infinitives. --&gt;

The bare infinitive and the full infinitive are not generally interchangeable, but the distinction does not generally affect the meaning of a sentence; rather, certain contexts call almost exclusively for the bare infinitive, and all other contexts call for the to-infinitive.

===Uses of the bare infinitive===

The bare infinitive is used in a rather limited number of contexts, but some of these are quite common:

*The bare infinitive is used as the [[main verb]] after the dummy auxiliary verb ''do'', or any [[modal auxiliary verb]] (such as ''will'', ''can'', or ''should''), except that ''ought'' usually takes a to-infinitive. So, &quot;I will/do/can/etc. '''see''' it.&quot;
*Several common verbs of perception, including ''see'', ''watch'', ''hear'', ''feel'', and ''sense'' take a direct object and a bare infinitive, where the bare infinitive indicates an action taken by the main verb's direct object. So, &quot;I saw/watched/heard/etc. it '''happen'''.&quot; (A similar meaning can be effected by using the present participle instead: &quot;I saw/watched/heard/etc. it '''happening'''.&quot; The difference is that the former implies that the entirety of the event was perceived, while the latter implies that part of the progress of the event was perceived.)
*Similarly with several common verbs of permission or causation, including ''make'', ''bid'', ''let'', and ''have''. So, &quot;I made/bade/let/had him '''do''' it.&quot; (However, ''make'' takes a to-infinitive in the passive voice: &quot;I was made '''to do''' it.&quot;)
*The bare infinitive is the dictionary form of a verb, and is generally the form of a verb that receives a definition; however, the definition itself generally uses a to-infinitive. So, &quot;The word &amp;#39;'''amble'''&amp;#39; means 'to walk slowly.'&quot;
*The bare infinitive form is also the present [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] form and the [[imperative mood|imperative]] form, although most grammarians do not consider uses of the present subjunctive or imperative to be uses of the bare infinitive.

===Uses of the full infinitive===

The full infinitive (or to-infinitive) is used in a great many different contexts:

*Apart from in dictionary lemmata, the full infinitive is the most commonly used [[citation form]] of the English verb: &quot;How do we conjugate the verb ''to go''?&quot;
*It can serve as an ordinary noun, expressing its action or state in an abstract, general way. So, &quot;'''To be''' is '''to do'''.&quot; (A [[gerund]] can also be used for this: &quot;'''Being''' is '''doing'''.&quot;)
*It can serve as an adjective or adverb, expressing purpose or intent. So, &quot;He is &lt;nowiki&gt;[supposed]&lt;/nowiki&gt; '''to die''' at noon,&quot; or &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[In order]&lt;/nowiki&gt; '''to meditate''', one must free one's mind.&quot;
*In either of the above uses, it can often be given a subject using the preposition ''for'': &quot;'''For him to fail now''' would be a great disappointment&quot;; &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[In order]&lt;/nowiki&gt; '''for you to get there on time''', you'll need to leave now.&quot; (The former sentence could also be written, &quot;His failing now would be a great disappointment.&quot;)
*It can be used after many intransitive verbs; in this case, it generally has the subject of the main verb as its implicit subject. So, &quot;I agreed '''to leave''',&quot; or &quot;He failed '''to make''' his case.&quot; (This may be considered a special case of the noun use above.)
*It can be used after the direct objects of many transitive verbs; in this case, it generally has the direct object of the main verb as its implicit subject. So, &quot;I convinced him '''to leave''' with me,&quot; or &quot;He asked her '''to make''' his case on his behalf.&quot;
*As a special case of the above, it can often be used after an intransitive verb, together with a subject using the preposition ''for'': &quot;I arranged '''for him to accompany''' me,&quot; or &quot;I waited '''for summer to arrive'''.&quot;

When the verb is implied, some dialects will reduce the to-infinitive to simply ''to'': &quot;Do I have '''to'''?&quot;

===The infinitive with auxiliary verbs===

The auxiliary verb ''do'' is not used with the infinitive - even though ''do'' is also a main verb and in that sense is often used in the infinitive. One does not say *''I asked to do not have to'', but rather, either ''I asked not to have to'' or ''I asked to not have to'' (but ''see'' [[split infinitive]]). Similarly, one cannot emphasize an infinitive using ''do''; one cannot say, &quot;I hear him do say it all the time.&quot;

Nonetheless, the auxiliary verbs ''have'' (used to form the [[perfect aspect]]) and ''ncreases to $3,500,000 for 2009.  According to the Econonic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, the federal estate tax disappears for the year 2010, but the tax returns in 2011 at the 2001 level.

====Requirements for filing return and paying tax====

For estates larger than the current federally exempted amount, any estate tax due is paid by the [[executor]] or other person responsible for administering the estate.  That person is also responsible for filing a Form 706 return with the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. The return must contain detailed information as to the valuations of the estate assets and the exemptions claimed, to ensure that the correct amount of tax is paid. 

====Criticisms of the Federal estate tax====

Many of its opponents refer to the estate tax as the &quot;[[death tax]]&quot; and have called for its abolition. Since 2003, the top rate has dropped from 50% by one percent per year; it is scheduled to drop to 45% in 2009, thence to 0% in 2010, but [[as of 2006]], if no further changes in the law are enacted, the tax will be reimposed at a top rate of 50% in 2011. It is possible, however, that Congress could act in the interim and extend the abolition of the estate tax indefinitely, and legislation has been introduced to this effect.

====Exemptions and tax rates====
&lt;div style=&quot;float:left; width:55%;&quot;&gt;
As noted above, a certain amount of each estate is exempted from taxation by the federal government. Below is a table of the amount of exemption by year an estate would expect. Estates above these amounts would be subject to estate tax, but only for the amount above the exemption.

For example, assume an estate of $3.5 million in 2005. There are two beneficiaries who will each receive equal shares of the estate. The maximum allowable credit is $1.5 million for that year, so the taxable value is therefore $2 million. Since it is 2005, the tax rate on that $2 million is 47%, so the total taxes paid would be $940,000. Each beneficiary will receive $750,000 of untaxed inheritance and $530,000 from the taxable portion of their inheritance for a total of $1,280,000. This means that they would have paid (or, more precisely, the estate would have paid) a taxable rate of 26.9%.

&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

===Inheritance tax at the state level===

Many U.S. states also impose their own estate or inheritance taxes (see [[Ohio estate tax]] for an example).  Some states &quot;piggyback&quot; on the federal estate tax law in regard to estates subject to tax (i.e., if the estate is exempt from federal taxation, it is also exempt from state taxation).  Some states' estate taxes, however, operate independently of federal law, so it is possible for an estate to be subject to state tax while exempt from federal tax.

===Debate===
The propriety of the estate tax has been debated extensively. Opponents argue that the Federal estate tax rate is effectively higher as a percentage of the amount actually transferred to heirs. For example, an estate worth $3.5 million paid $940,000 federal estate tax in order to transfer $1,280,000 to each heir, suggesting an effective transfer tax rate of 36.7%. Similarly, at the limit, the top federal tax rate of 50% on the estate value would imply a transfer tax rate of 100% of the amount transferred to heirs. The high effective transfer tax rate has prompted many wealthy benefactors to make sizable gifts during their lifetime, paying a [[gift tax]] on the amount transferred, rather than allow the whole amount to be taxed at the estate level.

Some argue that the estate tax creates a potential for double taxation, that is, taxation on assets which have already been taxed.  Double taxation occurs on earned income, but not the unrealized capital appreciation of [[houses]], [[farms]], [[stock]]s, [[bond]]s, [[real estate]], and [[collecting|collectibles]] such as works of art.  [[FactCheck.org]] cites a 2000 study of 1998 estate taxation, which determined that unrealized capital gains made up 36.3% of the value of all estates in 1998, and 56.4% of estates worth more than $10 million (but without taking into account yearly increases of inflation).  
&lt;div style=&quot;float:left; width:48%;&quot;&gt;
The debate sometimes revolves around which estates are affected by current law.  The effects of the law on small business owners and family-owned farms (entities which, conservatives argue, are hardest hit by the estate tax) was studied in an analysis undertaken by the [[Tax Policy Center]].  A study of the 18,800 taxable estates taxed in 2004 found 7,090 which had any farm or business income.  Of those, there were 440 estates in which half or more of its assets were the value of farms and/or businesses. The effective tax rate on the 440 estates studied in detail never averaged more than 23%.  

Proponents of the estate tax argue that it serves to prevent the perpetuation of wealth, free of tax, in wealthy families and that it is necessary to a system of [[progressive taxation]].  Proponents point out that the estate tax only affects estates of considerable size and provides numerous credits (including the unified credit) that allow a significant portion of even large estates to escape taxation.  Regarding the tax's effect on farmers, proponents counter that this criticism is misguided as there is an exemption built into the law that is specifically designed for family-owned farms.

&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$5 - $10 million&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;80&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$1,322&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;19.3%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$10 - $20 million&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$2,832&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;22.9%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;gt; $20 million&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$23,442&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;22.2%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;All&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;440&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$2,238&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;19.9%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

Furthermore, supporters argue that many large fortunes do not represent taxed income or savings, that wealth is not being taxed but merely the transfer of that wealth, and that many large fortunes represent unrealized capital gains which with a [[step up in basis]], will never be taxed as capital gains under the federal income tax. Some even go further and suggest all transfers should be taxed, and that the large bequests to family foundations or private charities should be taxed and more heavily regulated.

===Related taxes===
The US also imposes a gift tax, assessed in a manner similar to the estate tax. One obvious purpose is to prevent a person from easily avoiding paying estate tax by giving away all of their assets during their lifetime. However, an exemption is available for transfers of up to $11,000 per person per year. A single donor can make gifts up to this amount to as many people as they wish each year, so if they have enough people they wish to give assets to and/or enough time, they may be able to reduce their estate enough to avoid estate tax.

Furthermore, transfers (whether by bequest, gift, or inheritance) in excess of $1 million may be subject to a [[generation-skipping transfer tax]] if certain other criteria are met.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&quot;Insider trading&quot;''' is a term often used to refer to a practice, which is illegal in many jurisdictions, in which an investor trades [[security (finance)|securities]] of a company (''e.g.'', [[stock]]s, [[bond]]s or [[stock option]]s) based on material non-public information which was obtained by an officer, manager, or other corporate insider, during the performance of his duties at the corporation. More formally, it is simply the trading of corporate securities by corporate insiders, which is often perfectly legal.  All insider trades, whether legal or illegal, must be reported in the US.  Many investors follow the summaries of insider trades, published by the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC), in the hope that mimicking these trades will be profitable.  Legal &quot;insider trading&quot; may not be based on material non-public information.  Illegal insider trading in the US requires the participation (perhaps indirectly) of a corporate insider or other person who is violating his fiduciary duty to corporate shareholders by trading on or secretly relaying the corporation's information.  In some other countries an &quot;outsider&quot; who illegally obtains non-public information (which may constitute a separate offence of spying on trade secrets), might also be considered an illegal &quot;inside trader.&quot;


== Trading by &quot;insiders&quot; of a corporation ==
According to the U.S. SEC, corporate insiders are a company's officers, directors and any beneficial owners of more than ten percent of a class of the company's equity securities.

Since insiders are required to report their trades, others often track these traders, and there is a school of investing which follows the lead of insiders. This is of course subject to the risk that an insider is making a buy specifically to increase investor confidence, or making a sell for reasons unrelated to the health of the company (e.g. a desire to diversify or buy a house).  

As of December 2005 companies are required to announce times to their employees as to when they can safely trade without being accused of trading on inside information.

== Trading on material, non-public information ==

There are rules against this type of &quot;''insider trading''&quot; in most jurisdictions around the world, though the details and the efforts to enforce them vary considerably. In the [[United States]], for example, there is no general federal law directly prohibiting insider trading. Authority to prosecute cases of insider trading came from the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]' interpretation of Section 10(b) of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]], and in particular of [[SEC Rule 10b-5]], prohibiting fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of securities (see ''Securities &amp; Exch. Comm'n v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co.'', 258 F. Supp. 262 (S.D.N.Y. 1966)). Insider trading has been outlawed in the U.S. since the 1960's.

The reasoning is that a corporate insider has made a contract with the shareholders to put the shareholders' interests before their own, in matters related to the corporation.  When the insider buys based upon company owned information, he is violating his contract with the shareholders.

Liability for insider trading violations cannot be avoided by passing on the information in a &quot;I scratch your back, you scratch mine&quot; arrangement, as long as the person receiving the information knew or should have known that the information was company property.

An example of illegal insider trading may be that you, as an assistant to the [[chief executive officer]], learn that your company is going to be taken over before it is officially disclosed publicly. Knowing that such a move is likely to cause the price to rise, you buy shares in the company and subsequently profit from the transaction. A less dramatic (but still potentially lucrative) example would be trading on the quarterly earnings/losses shortly before they are announced.  

In practice, [[prosecution]]s for insider trading tend to be rare and difficult to win for a variety of reasons. It can be difficult to prove what the accused actually knew at the time the trades were made -- and people may not even be told directly but merely advised to buy or sell with a nudge and wink. Proving that someone has been responsible for a trade can also be difficult, because a clever trader can hide behind a variety of nominees, companies, and [[proxy|proxies]], perhaps located offshore in jurisdictions that do not cooperate with the local authorities. Insider trading is usually performed by the already wealthy, who can afford the best lawyers available and have the resources to drag a case out and cost the prosecutors millions along the way. Finally, the details of insider trading can be highly confusing to non-experts and convincing a randomly-selected [[jury]], many with no experience of share trading, that a crime has been committed can be difficult. The complexity may be because the transactions are inherently complicated, because the transactions were made so to evade prosecution, or as Brian Doherty claims in ''Reason'' magazine, because the regulations are &quot;designed, like most law, to be understood by trained professionals, not the citizens who have to live under it&quot; [http://reason.com/hod/bd062502.shtml].

== Arguments in favour of insider trading ==

Although insider trading is often illegal, there are arguments in its favour. Insider trading amounts to a consensual act between adults, i.e. a victimless act. A willing buyer and a willing seller agree to trade property which they rightfully own, with no prior contract having been made between the parties to refrain from trading if equal knowledge is not possessed. Hence, it is maintained that since traders willingly take the risk that the party on the others side of the trade is more knowledgeable, no one's rights are violated. 

Many argue that insider trading is not &quot;fair.&quot; However, those in favor of legalizing the practice hold that making money by having superior information is what trading is &quot;all about&quot;: A trader does not sell his stock unless he believes he knows information that is more indicative of the future move of a stock than his buyer, and vice versa. In effect, the same thing is happening whether the knowledge is &quot;inside information&quot; or not: someone always has superior knowledge than someone else. Hence, the stock market by nature is not &quot;fair&quot; whether insider trading is legal or not.

Insider trading can make markets more efficient by increasing the amount of information that is known about the company, and can motivate outsiders such as analysts to increase their knowledge about the company. The costs of complying with anti-insider-trading laws are also thus avoided. Nobel prize-winning economist [[Milton Friedman]] says: &quot;You want more insider trading, not less. You want to give the people most likely to have knowledge about deficiencies of the company an incentive to make the public aware of that.&quot; Friedman does not believe that the trader should be required to make his trade known to the public (to reveal his identity or the reason for his trade), but says that the buying or selling pressure itself is information for the market.  A practical counter-argument to this, however, might be empirical research purporting to show that those markets with strongly enforced laws against insider trading tend to have lower costs of capital for security issuers.  (See, for example, &quot;The World Price of Insider Trading&quot; by Utphal Bhattacharya and Hazem Daouk in the Journal of Finance, Vol. LVII, No. 1 (Feb. 2002). [http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Teaching/BA453_2005/BD_The_world.pdf])  In other words, where certain individuals are permitted to buy and sell shares based on inside information, other investors will be more wary and demand a premium for their investment.  This, in turn, raises the cost of capital for all issuers.

Some of those who favour regulations against insider trading assert that market liquidity comes from confidence that all participants have equal access to information. A counter-argument to this is that a significant motivation of trading is the belief on the part of a trader that he has better knowledge than others do in the market and that therefore a stock is improperly priced. If a stock was always accurately priced, there would no point in speculative trading, which would result in decreased liquidity in the market. 

Advocates of legalisation sometimes also make free speech arguments. Punishment for telling someone else about a development pertinent to the next day's likely stock moves would seem, [[prima facie]], to be one of prohibited speech, i.e. an act of censorship [http://www.walterblock.com/publications/information_privilege.pdf]. A counter-argument is that information being conveyed is akin to proprietary information and that a corporate insider, if he has contracted to not expose it, has no more of a free speech right to tell another individual about confidential information that insider acquired by ways of his or her position than to tell others about the company's new product designs, formulas, or bank account passwords. However, communicating inside information is illegal even if it's not by a corporate insider.

Also, there is the question of why what amounts to insider trading is legal in other markets, such as real estate, but not in the stock market. For example, if a geologist knows there is a high likelihood of the discovery of petroleum under Farmer Smith's land, he is entitled to make Smith an offer for the land, and buy it, without first telling Farmer Smith, or competing potential buyers, of the geological data and reasoning that justify his interest. If the value of the hidden oil can be acquired in such a manner in real estate transactions, some ask: why not unlock hidden values in the stock market through the same mechanism? 

Also, although on one hand there are no laws against insider trading in the commodities markets, on the other many activities such as [[front running]] are illegal. For example, a commodity broker can be charged with fraud if he or she  receives a large purchase order from a client (one likely to affect the price of that commodity) and then purchases that commodity before executing the client's order in order to benefit from the anticipated price increase.  Likewise, an individual employed by the U.S. Agricultural Department, for example, could be charged with fraud if he or she were to receive a draft of the Department's crop report before it is released to the public and then buy or sell commodities or futures contracts based on this non-public information. (This situation was implicit in the [[Eddie Murphy]] movie [[Trading Places]].)

== Legal differences among jurisdictions ==
The US and the UK vary in the way the law is interpreted and applied with regard to insider trading.

In the UK, the relevant laws are the [[Financial Services Act 1986]] and the [[Financial Services and Markets Act 2000]], which defines an offence of Market Abuse.

It is not illegal to fail to trade based on inside information (whereas without the inside information the trade would have taken place), since from a practical point of view this is too difficult to enforce.

It is often legal to deal ahead of a takeover bid, where a party deliberately buys shares in a company in the knowledge that it will be launching a takeover bid.

Japan enacted its first law against insider trading in 1988. Roderick Seeman says: &quot;Even today many Japanese do not understand why this is illegal. Indeed, previously it was regarded as common sense to make a profit from your knowledge.&quot; [http://www.japanlaw.info/law2004/JAPANBIZLAWLITE4GAIJIN_INSIDER_TRADING.html] Insider trading was made illegal in England in 1985.

:''&quot;Fifteenth International Brigade&quot; redirects here. For the song, see [[Fifteenth International Brigade (song)]]''
The '''International Brigades''' were [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] [[military]] units in the [[Spanish Civil War]], formed of many non-state sponsored volunteers of different countries who travelled to [[Spain]], to fight for the legitimate, elected government in the [[Spanish Civil War]] between [[1936]] and [[1939]]. They fought against Spanish [[Nationalist]] forces, who were led by General [[Francisco Franco]] and assisted by [[Nazi]] [[Nazi Germany|German]] and [[fascist]] [[Fascist Italy |Italian]] forces.

The Brigades recruited 40,000 men and women. As many as 10,000 of them never returned. More than 50 nationalities were represented in the Brigades: during the [[Battle of Madrid]] alone, the XIIth Brigade counted representatives from no fewer than 17 nationalities in its ranks.

== Constitution of the Brigades ==
[[Image:International Brigades poster3.jpg|thumbnail|right|Republican propaganda poster featuring the International Brigades. The text reads : &quot;Internationals, united with the Spanish people, we fight the invader&quot;. ]]
The idea to use foreign [[Communist party |Communist Parties]] to recruit volunteers (both Communist and non-Communists -- a non-Communist volunteer would first have an interview with an agent of the [[NKVD]]) to come to the aid of the [[Spanish Republic]] was proposed in [[Moscow]] in September 1936 by [[Willi Münzenberg]], who was the chief of [[Comintern]] propaganda for Western Europe (perhaps at the suggestion by [[Maurice Thorez]]). By the end of September, the [[Italy|Italian]] and [[France|French]] Communist Parties had decided to set up a column. [[Luigi Longo]], ex-leader of the Italian [[Communist Youth]], was charged to make the necessary arrangements with the Spanish government. The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Ministry of Defense also helped, since they had experience of dealing with corps of international volunteers (there had been precedents of such corps during the Russian Civil War). At first, the idea was opposed by [[Largo Caballero]], but after the first setbacks of the war, he changed his mind, and finally agreed to the operation on [[22 October]]. However, the [[Soviet Union]] did not withdraw from the [[Non-Intervention Committee]], probably to avoid diplomatic conflict with [[France]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]].

[[Image:International Brigades poster2.jpg|thumbnail|165px|right|Republican propaganda poster. The text reads : &quot;The International Brigades, in the heart of the popular army, help to defend your wealth and land&quot;. Notice the arm-band which features the emblem of the International Brigades, a three-pointed red star.]]

The main recruitment centre was in [[Paris]], under the supervision of [[Poland|Polish]] communist colonel [[Karol Swierczewski|Karol &quot;Walter&quot; Swierczewski]]. On [[17 October]] [[1936]], an open letter by [[Stalin]] to [[José Díaz]] was published in ''Mundo Obrero'', arguing that liberation for Spain was a matter not only for Spaniards, but also for the whole of &quot;progressive Humanity&quot;; in a matter of days, support organisations for the Spanish Republic were founded in most countries, all more or less controlled by the [[Comintern]].

Paths were arranged for volunteers: for instance, Josip Broz, who would became famous as Marshal [[Tito]], was in Paris to provide assistance, money and passports for the volunteers from [[Eastern Europe]]. Volunteers were sent by train or ship from France to Spain, and sent to the base at [[Albacete]]. However, many of them also went by themselves to Spain. The volunteers were under no contract, nor defined engagement period, which would later prove a problem.

[[Image:International Brigades training.jpg|thumbnail|250px|left|American Brigadists in training]]

Many Italians, Germans, and people from other countries with repressive governments joined the movement, with the idea that combat in Spain was a first step to restore democracy or advance a revolutionary cause in their own country. There were also many unemployed workers (especially from France), and adventurers. Finally, some 500 Communists who had been exiled to Russia were sent to Spain (among them, experienced military leaders from the [[World War I|First World War]] like [[&quot;Kléber&quot; Stern]], [[Wilhelm Zaisser|&quot;Gomez&quot; Zaisser]], [[Mate Zalka|&quot;Lukacs&quot; Zalka]] and &quot;Gal&quot; Galicz, who would prove invaluable in combat).

The operation was met by Communists with enthusiasm, but by [[Anarchist]]s with scepticism, at best. At first, the Anarchists who controlled the borders with France were told to refuse Communist volunteers, and reluctantly allowed their passage after protests.

The first group of 500 men (mainly French, with a few exiled Poles and Germans) arrived in [[Albacete]] on [[14 October]] [[1936]]. They were met by international volunteers who had already been fighting in Spain: the surviving Germans from the Thälmann-Batallion, Italians from Gastone Sozzi and French from Commune de Paris. (Amongst these men was [[Britain|British]] poet [[John Cornford]]). Men were sorted  according to their experience and origin, and dispatched to units.

Albacete base was under the command of [[André Marty]], a French Communist whose obsession for plots and spies would trigger massive purges ([[Ernest Hemingway]] would draft a ferocious portrait of Marty in ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]''). Marty was essentially incompetent and owed his position to the friendship with [[Stalin]]. He was seconded by better leaders, who set up training for Cavalry, Artillery and Infantry, and hospitals. 

The [[French Communist Party]] provided uniforms for the Brigades. Discipline was extreme. For several months, the Brigades were locked in their base while their strict military training was under way.

== First Engagements: the Battle of Madrid ==

The first International Brigade, the XIth Brigade (numbered XI, next to the ten [[mixed brigades]] of the Spanish regular army), under command of [[&quot;Kléber&quot; Stern | Kléber]], was engaged during the [[Battle of Madrid]], occupying its positions on [[8 November]] [[1936]]. There were the ''Edgard André'' (German), ''Commune de Paris'' (French),  and ''Jarosław Dąbrowski'' (Polish) battalions, and a section of British machine-gunners, totalling around 1900 men. The XIIth brigade took its positions on the [[13 November]] [[1936]], with 1550 men.

[[Image:International Brigades poster1.jpg|thumbnail|200px|left|Republican propaganda poster featuring the International Brigades. The text reads: &quot;All the people of the world are in the International Brigades at the side of the Spanish People&quot;. The three figures are those of a &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; soldier, as to represent the whole humanity.]]

The Battle of Madrid was a major success for the Republic, and the role of the International Brigades in this victory was generally recognised, sometimes even beyond reality (the British Ambassador, Sir Henry Childon, declared that there were no Spaniards in the Army which had defended Madrid). Even though the International Brigades did not win the battle by themselves, nor significantly change the situation, they certainly did provide an example by their superb fight, and improved the morale of the population by demonstrating the concern of other nations in the fight.

[[Image:International Brigades casa del campo.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Brigadists at ''Casa del Campo'' on the western outskirts of Madrid.]]

One of the strategic positions in Madrid was the [[Casa del Campo]]. There the Nationalist troops were [[Arab]]s commanded by [[General Varela]]. They were excellent fighters in the open, but were ill-trained for urban warfare, a role which the Republicans mastered from the early days of the war. They were thus stopped by the IIIrd and IVth Brigades of the regular Republican Army.
On [[9 November]] [[1936]], the whole XIth Brigade was at the Casa del Campo. In the evening [[&quot;Kléber&quot; Stern | Kléber]] launched an assault on the Nationalist positions, which lasted for the whole night and part of the next morning. At the end of the fight, the Nationalist troops had been forced to retreat, abandoning all hopes of a direct assault on Madrid by Casa del Campo, while the XIth Brigade had lost a third of its men.

On the 12th, as the battle was raging on, the XIIth Brigade, under General &quot;[[Lukacs]]&quot;, took its positions on the [[Valencia]]-[[Madrid]] road, with battalions ''Thälmann'' (Germans and Scandinavians), ''André Marty''(French and Belgians) and ''Garibaldi'' (Italians). The XIIth launched an attack on Nationalist positions on the hill ''Corro de los Angeles'', which was unsuccessful (languages and communication problems, command issues, lack of rest, bad links with armoured units and insufficient artillery support seem to have contributed to the failure).

On the 16th, Anarchist units of the Republican Army were forced to retreat, and the University City was taken by Nationalist troops -- Arab troops and legionnaires covered by the Nazi [[Condor Legion]]. The XIth Brigade was sent to defend the City. The battle was extremely bloody, a mix of artillery and aerial bombardments with bayonet and grenade fights, room by room. Anarchist leader [[Durruti]] was shot there on the [[19 November]] [[1936]], and died the next day. The battle in the University went on until 3/4 of the City was under nationalist control. Both sides then started setting up trenches and fortifications. It was then clear that any assault from either side would be far too costly; the nationalist leaders had to renounce the idea of a direct assault on Madrid, and ready for a [[siege]] of the capital.

On [[13 December]] [[1936]], 18,000 nationalist troops attempted an attack to close the encirclement of Madrid at [[Guadarrama]]. The Republicans sent a Soviet armoured unit (under General [[Dmitry Pavlov]], whose experience in Spain would make him a future hero of the [[Second World War]]) and both XIth and XIIth International Brigades. Violent combat resulted in stopping the Nationalist advance.

An attack was then launched by the Republic on the [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] front. The battle ended in a form of stale-mate (a communication was issued, saying: &quot;Today, our advance continued without loss of land&quot;). Poets [[Ralph Fox (disambiguation)|Ralph Fox]] and [[John Cornford]] were killed. Eventually, the Nationalists advanced, taking the hydro-electric station at ''El Campo''. [[André Marty]] accused the commander of the ''Marseillaise'' Battalion, [[Gaston Delasalle]], of espionage and treason and had him executed (it is doubtful that Delasalle would have been a spy for Francisco Franco; he was denounced by his own second-in-command, [[André Heussler]], who might have been a traitor himself and was later executed for treason by the French Resistance during the Second World War).

Further Nationalist attempts after Christmas to encircle Madrid met with failure, not without extremely violent combat. On [[6 January]] [[1937]], the ''Thaelmann'' Battalion arrived at ''[[Las Rozas]]'' and held its positions virtually to the last man. On the 9th, only ten kilometers had been lost to the Nationalists, when the XIIth and XIVth International Brigades and the 1st British Company arrived in Madrid. Violent Republican assaults were launched in attempt to retake the land, but with little success. On the 15th, trenches and fortifications were built by both sides, resulting in a stalemate. 

The Nationalists did not retake Madrid until the very end of the war.

== The battle of [[Jarama]] ==
On the [[6 February]] [[1937]], following the fall of [[Málaga]], the nationalists launched an attack on the [[Madrid]]-[[Andalusia]] road, south of Madrid. The Nationalists quickly advanced on the little town [[Ciempozuelos]], held by the XVth International Brigade, which was composed by the ''Saklatvala'' Battalion (British), the ''Dimitrov'' battalion (miscellaneous [[Balkan]] nationalities), the ''6 Février'' Battalion ([[Belgium|Belgians]] and French) and the ''[[Abraham Lincoln]]'' battalion (550 [[United States|Americans]], many of them [[African-American]]). 
There was also a sub unit of Irish men in this battle known as the [[Connolly Column]]. This group suffered heavy blows as there was only around 80 Irish men to begin with, these Irish men were made up of southern irish and northern Irish. The northern Irish comrades came from Belfast, Derry and other Counties and were: Charlie Donnelly, Eddie O'Flaherty, Paul Burns, Jackie Hunt, Bill Henry, Bill Beattie, Paddy McLaughlin, Bill Henry, Peter O'Connor, Peter Power, Johnny Power, Liam Tumilson, Jim Straney, Willie O'Hanlon, Ben Murray and Fred McMahon.From County Derry came Eamonn Mc Grotty an ex Christian Brother and fluent Irish speaker who taught his classes through the medium of Irish, he died fighting alongside Bob Hillard from County Kerry, a Church of Ireland Pastor who was wounded in the same battle and would later die from the injuries he recieved.This particular instance shows the diverse backgrounds of those in the International Brigades, one an ex Catholic Christian Brother, the other an ordained Church of Ireland Clergyman, fighting and dying on the same side.


On the [[11 February]] [[1937]], all sentries of the ''André Marty'' battalion of the XIVth Brigade were stabbed and a Nationalist brigade crossed the Jarama. The ''Garibaldi'' Battalion stopped the advance with heavy fire. At another point, the same tactic allowed the Nationalists to deploy their troops past the river. 

The British ''Saklatvala'' Battalion took most of the attack, on the 12th. It defended its positions under heavy artillery fire for 7 hours. The place became known as &quot;Suicide Hill&quot;. At the end of the day, 225 men remained of the 600 of the British battalion. A company was made prisoner by ruse (Nationalists advanced amongst their ranks singing ''[[The Internationale]]'').

On the 17th, the Republican Army struck back. The 23rd and the 27th, the International Brigades were engaged, but with little success. The ''Abraham Lincoln'' battalion was put under great pressure, with no artillery support. There were 120 killed and 175 wounded. Amongst the dead was the [[Ireland|Irish]] poet [[Charles Donelly]] [http://www.ajoderse.com/varios/red/red.htm].

As in Madrid, the fight resulted in a stalemate, since both sides had consolidated their positions to the point were no useful assault could be undertaken.

On the [[22 February]], [[1937]] the [[League of Nations]] Non-Intervention Committee ban on foreign national &quot;volunteers&quot; went into effect.

==The [[Battle of Guadalajara]] == 

After the failed assault on the Jarama, the Nationalists  attempted another assault on Madrid, from the North-East this time. The objective was the town of [[Guadalajara, Spain|Guadalajara]], 50 kilometers from Madrid. The whole Italian expeditionary corps (35,000 men, with 80 battle tanks and 200 field artillery) was deployed, as [[Mussolini]] wanted the victory to be credited to Italy. On [[9 March]] [[1937]], the Italians made a breach in the Republican lines, but did not properly exploit the advance. However, the rest of the Nationalist army was advancing, and the situation appeared critical for the Republicans. A mixture of the best available units of the Republican army was quickly set up, among them the XIth and XIIth International Brigades. 

At dawn on [[10 March]] [[1937]] the Nationalists closed in, and by noon, the ''Garibaldi'' Battalion made its move. Some confusion arose from the fact that the sides were not aware of each other's moves, and that both sides spoke Italian; this resulted in scouts from both sides exchanging information without realising they were enemies. The Republican lines advanced and made contact with the XIth International Brigade. Fascist battle tanks were shot at and infantry patrols came into action (there took place the incident in which a fascist officer asked why Italian soldiers were shooting at his party, and was responded ''Noi siamo Italiani di Garibaldi'', at which point the Fascists surrendered). The action went on as some sort of Italian civil war in foreign land. The common language was taken advantage of when the Republicans used loudspeakers to broadcast propaganda messages and airplanes to drop messages promising to pay Fascist deserters.

On the 11th, the Fascists broke the front of the Republican army. The ''Thälmann'' Brigade suffered heavy losses but succeeded in holding the [[Trijueque]]-[[Torija]] road. ''Garibaldi'' also held its positions. On the 12th, Republican planes and tanks attacked. The ''Thaelmann'' Brigade attacked [[Trijuete]] with bayonets and re-took the town, capturing numerous prisoners.

== Composition of International Brigade units ==

The first brigades to be formed were mostly composed from [[France|French]], [[Belgium|Belgian]], [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Germany|German]] volunteers, and were numbered as the XI, XII and XIII mixed brigades (according to the re-organisation of the Spanish army, which was consituted in ten ''mixed Brigades'' immediately after the failed ''coup''; these brigades mixed experienced soldiers with volunteers who had just joined but had no experience of combat). 

There were nearly 40,000 volunteers, of whom 9,000 to 10,000 were French, for the defense of the Spanish Republic. Most of them were workers, and half of them were from Paris. They included a large number of veterans of the First World War, which made them efficient fighters. The first engagements fought by the International Brigades during the [[Battle of Madrid]] demonstrated their military value.

The International Brigades were mainly Communists, or under Communist authority. Some were involved in the fighting in [[Barcelona]] against Republican opponents of the Communists: the [[POUM]] (''Partido Obrero de Unificación Marxista'', an anti-[[Stalinist]] Marxist party) and anarchists. However overseas volunteers from anarchist, socialist, liberal and other political positions also served with the brigades.

The battalions were often constituted by speakers of a particular nationality or language, so as to ease understanding of orders. They were named, formally at least, after heroes of the left among the predominant nationalities in each unit.

Later in the war, there was a tightening of military discipline amongst the Spanish Republican military, and learning Spanish became mandatory.

==Without currency code==
A number of territories are not included in ISO 4217, because their currencies are not ''per se'' an independent currency, but a variant of another currency. In the case of the [[Channel Islands]] and the [[Isle of Man]], they have no [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] [[country codes]] and hence there is no corresponding currency code. These currencies are:
# [[Faroese króna]] (dependent on the [[Danish krone]])
# [[Guernsey pound]] (dependent on the [[Pound sterling]]; no ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code)
# [[Jersey pound]] (dependent on the [[Pound sterling]]; no ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code)
# [[Isle of Man pound]] (dependent on the [[Pound sterling]]; no ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code)
# [[Tuvaluan dollar]] (dependent on the [[Australian dollar]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Irgun1.jpg|thumb|right|Irgun poster showing their view of the Land of Israel]] '''Irgun''' (ארגון), shorthand for '''Irgun Tsvai Leumi''' (ארגון צבאי לאומי, also spelled '''Irgun Zvai Leumi'''), [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for &quot;National Military Organization&quot;, was a militant [[Zionism|Zionist]] group that operated in the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] from 1931 to 1948. In Israel, this group is commonly referred to as '''Etzel''' (אצ&quot;ל), an acronym of the Hebrew initials. In the time in which the Irgun operated, often people referred to the Irgun as 'הגנה ב or ההגנה הלאומית. The Irgun was classified by [[Britain|British]] authorities as a [[terrorism|terrorist]] organization and regularly described as such by many, but others considered it to be a [[resistance movement|liberation movement]]. Its political association with [[Revisionist Zionism]] rendered it a predecessor movement to modern Israel's [[right-wing]] [[Likud]] party/coalition.

===Founding, development and key events===
The group was an offshoot of the [[Haganah]] in protest both against its policy of restraint and [[socialist]] leanings. Based on the premises formulated by [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] that &quot;every [[Jew]] had the right to enter [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]]; only active retaliation would deter the [[Arab]]s; only Jewish armed force would ensure the Jewish state,&quot; (Howard Sachar: A ''History of the State of Israel'', pps 265-266) the group made retaliation against Arab attacks a central part of their initial efforts. The [[Jewish Agency]] denounced the existence, strategy, and tactics of the group from the very outset, leading to a full-fledged confrontation in 1948 that led to the dissolution of the group.

Irgun was founded in 1931 by [[Avraham Tehomi]], following a largely political and ideological split with the [[Haganah]] after he had assumed leadership over the district of [[Jerusalem]]. Irgun differentiated itself from the Haganah by disassociating from the socialist ideology and the prevalent strategy of ''Havlagah'', or restraint. Throughout its history Irgun advocated a more decisive use of force in the defense of Jews in Mandate Palestine and in advancing the formation of a Jewish state. 

While the strategy, tactics, and operational methods of the organization changed through the years, its primary goals were to:

* Provide a non-Socialist alternative to the leading Zionist organizations;
* Eliminate or reduce the threat of Arab attacks on Jewish targets by assured and harsh retaliation for such attacks;
* Bring to an end the British mandatory rule, which they considered in violation of international law

From its inception, the group went through several phases in its short lifespan.
* From 1931 to 1937 it was a small, renegade group that undertook scattered attacks against Arab targets.  This phase ended when the group itself split, with some of its leaders, including the original founder, Tehomi, returning to the Haganah; and the group formally identifying itself as &quot;Etzel&quot; (Irgun).
* During the [[Great Uprising]] (1936-1939), in which about 320 [[Jew]]s were killed in Arab attacks, Irgun resumed its reprisal attacks against Arabs. Following the killing of five Jews at [[Kibbutz Kiryat Anavim]] on [[November 9]], [[1937]], Irgun launched a [[List of Irgun attacks during the 1930's|series of attacks]] which lasted until the beginning of [[World War II]], in which more than 250 Arab civilians were killed.
* These attacks coincided roughly with Irgun's campaign of facilitating immigration of European Jews who faced discrimination, murder and pogroms in Europe. The first vessel arrived on [[April 13]], [[1937]], and the last on [[February 13]], [[1940]]. All told, about 18,000 Jews escaped [[genocide]] in Europe in this way.
* Upon the publication of the [[1939 White Paper|White Paper]] in May of 1939, Irgun concentrated all its efforts against the British.
* From 1940 through 1943, Irgun declared a truce against the British, and supported Allied efforts against Nazi forces and their allies in the area by enlisting its members in British forces and the [[Jewish Brigade]]. A small group lead by [[Avraham Stern]], who insisted on continuing to fight the British, broke off and formed an independent group, [[Lehi]]. In 1941, the Irgun leader, [[David Raziel]] volunteered for a dangerous British military mission in [[Iraq]] to capture or kill [[Amin al-Husayni]], but was killed by a [[Luftwaffe|German bomber]] before the operation could be finished.
* In February of 1944, under the new leadership of [[Menachem Begin]], Irgun resumed hostilities against the British authorities. The purpose of these attacks was to increase the cost of British mandatory rule and influence British public opinion so as to encourage British withdrawal. It included attacks on prominent symbols of the British administration, including the [[British army|British military]], police, and civil headquarters at the [[King David Hotel bombing|King David Hotel]] and the British prison in [[Acre]]. Although these attacks were largely successful, several Irgun operatives were captured, convicted, and hanged. Refusing to accept the jurisdiction of the British courts, those accused refused to defend themselves. The Irgun leadership ultimately responded to these executions by hanging two British sergeants, which effectively brought the executions to an end.
* Following the assassination of [[Lord Moyne]] by [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]], the [[Yishuv]] and [[Jewish Agency]] initiated &quot;[[The Hunting Season]]&quot; on Irgun and the Lehi group, facilitating the arrest of some 1000 members of those organizations who were interned in British camps. The British deported 251 of them to camps in [[Africa]].
* From about October of 1945 until July 1946, Irgun was in an alliance with the Haganah and Lehi called the [[Jewish Resistance Movement]] (תנועת המרי העברי), organized to fight British restrictions on Jewish immigration. This alliance ended when Irgun bombed British military, police, and civil headquarters at the King David Hotel as a retaliation for [[Operation Agatha]].
* From July 1946 until June 1948, Irgun fought as irregulars against the British mandate and Arab forces, informally in coordination with Haganah forces. Their participation in alleged [[war crimes]] at [[Deir Yassin]] has been widely discussed and documented.  Their largest single operation was a successful assault on [[Jaffa, Israel|Jaffa]] (an Arab enclave according to the UN partition plan) starting on May 25.
* In 1948, the group was formally dissolved and its members integrated into the newly formed [[Israeli Defense Forces]]. This integration largely coincided with the sinking of the [[Altalena Affair|Altalena]], a ship with fighters Irgun had recruited and arms Irgun had acquired for the Israeli forces.

===Legacy of Irgun===
Leaders within the mainstream [[Jewish Agency]], [[Haganah]], [[Histadrut]], as well as British authorities, routinely condemned (publicly at least; privately the Haganah kept a dialogue with the dissident groups) Irgun operations as [[Terrorism|terrorist]] and branded it an illegal organization, as a result of the groups attacks on civilian targets.  In their defense, former Irgun leaders assert that:

* The premises for their founding and strategy were vindicated by subsequent events. Arab violence against Jews in the mandate of Palestine could only be deterred through retaliation; the British authorities only ended their restrictions on Jewish immigration when pressured by force; and unrestricted Jewish immigration was a matter of saving lives, both during the [[Shoah]] and during post-World War II [[pogrom]]s in [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]].  
* Operations that are usually characterized as &quot;terrorist&quot; had another character. The [[King David Hotel bombing]] was considered a legitimate military target, being the British military headquarters; the attack on [[Deir Yassin]] was part of a campaign to control the road between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv; the attack on the Acre prison was to release prisoners the British intended to hang.
&lt;!-- * At least one of the attacks plainly made against civilians was unauthorized by the Irgun.--&gt;

===Radio station===
The Irgun had, from 1939, a [[Radio station]]: [[Kol TSion HaLokhemet]].

[[Image:Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto.jpg|thumb|260px|Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto]]
'''Isoroku Yamamoto''' ([[:ja:山本五十六|山本五十六]] ''Yamamoto Isoroku'', [[April 4]] [[1884]] &amp;ndash; [[April 18]] [[1943]]) was the commander of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] for the first four years of [[World War II]].  He is generally regarded to be Japan's greatest naval strategist of the war, and among the greatest naval strategists in history.

==Family background==
Yamamoto was born ''Isoroku Takano'' (高野 五十六 ''Takano Isoroku'') in [[Nagaoka, Niigata|Nagaoka]] in [[Niigata prefecture|Niigata]]. His father was ''Takano Sadayoshi'' (高野 貞吉 ''Takano Sadayoshi''), a lower-ranking [[samurai]] of Nagaoka-[[Han (Japan)|han]]. &quot;Isoroku&quot; is an old Japanese term meaning &quot;56&quot;; the name referred to his father's age at Isoroku's birth.

In 1916, Isoroku was adopted into the Yamamoto family and took the Yamamoto name. It was a common practice for Japanese families lacking sons to adopt suitable young men in this fashion to carry on the family name.  In 1918, Isoroku married a woman named Reiko with whom he sired four children:  two sons and two daughters.

==Early naval career==
Yamamoto enrolled at the [[Naval Academy]] at [[Etajima]], [[Hiroshima, Japan|Hiroshima]] in [[1901]], graduating in [[1904]]. In [[1905]] during the [[Russo-Japanese War]], he saw action as an ensign on the cruiser ''[[Nisshin]]'' at the [[Battle of Tsushima]] against the [[Russian Baltic Fleet]]. At that engagement, he lost two [[finger]]s on his left hand (see picture on the right). After the war, served in various shipboard assignments for several years.

In 1911 he took the &quot;B&quot; course at the Naval Staff College, and later the &quot;A&quot; course in 1916 on an obvious track for higher command. While studying in the United States at [[Harvard University]] (1919-1921) he was hired to plant a garden and several trees, on a farm in Dartmouth, Massachusetts. He served as executive officer of the light cruiser ''Kitakami'', toured Europe and America as an admiral's aide (1923-1924), and then moved into the realm of Naval Aviation in 1924 as the executive officer of a naval air station.

He served attaché duty in Washington, D.C. (1925-1928), then returned to naval aviation, commanding in succession, the [[aircraft carrier]] [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|Akagi]] (1928), the Naval Aviation Department's Technical Bureau (1930-1933) and the First Carrier Division (1933). After serving as a delegate to the London Naval Conference, he commanded the Naval Aviation Department (1935).

Yamamoto received appointment as the Navy Vice Minister in 1936, holding that post until his assignment as Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet. He also held the Naval Aviation Department command concurrently (1938-1939).

Yamamoto was promoted to Rear Admiral in 1929, Vice Admiral in 1934, and Admiral in 1940.

Although a political dove and fundamentally opposed to war with the United States by virtue of studies in the U.S., his tour of the nation as an admiral's aide, and his attach&amp;eacute; duty in Washington D.C., Yamamoto was inevitably drawn into war preparations by circumstance and his devotion to duty. His participation in the second [[London Naval Conference]] of 1930 made him a marked man for radica
