Solomon's Mines]]''. When such unrealistic subjects are treated more seriously, accusations of [[pseudoscience]] are invariably levelled at their proponents (see Pseudoarchaeology, below). However, these endeavours, real and fictional, are not representative of the modern state of archaeology.

==Goals==

There is still a tremendous emphasis in the practice of archaeology on field techniques and methodologies. These include the tasks of surveying areas in order to find new sites, digging sites in order to unearth the cultural remains therein, and classification and preservation techniques in order to analyse and keep these remains. Every phase of this process can be a source of information.

The goals of archaeology are not always the same. There are at least three broad, distinct theories of exactly what archaeological research should do. (These are beyond the scope of the present discussion, and are discussed at length below.) Nevertheless, there is much common ground.

===Academic sub-disciplines===

''Main article: [[Archaeological sub-disciplines]]''

As with most [[academia|academic]] disciplines, there are a very large number of [[archaeological sub-disciplines]] characterised by a specific method or type of material (e.g. [[lithic analysis]], [[music (archaeology)|music]], [[archaeobotany]]), geographical or chronological focus (e.g. [[Near Eastern archaeology]], [[Medieval archaeology]]), other thematic concern (e.g. [[landscape archaeology]]), or a specific [[archaeological culture]] or [[civilisation]] (e.g. [[Egyptology]]).

===Cultural resources management===
''[[Cultural resources management]]'' (CRM) (also called ''heritage management'' in Britain) is a branch of archaeology that accounts for most research done in the [[United States]] and much of that in [[western Europe]] as well. In the United States, CRM archaeology has been a growing concern since the passage of the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] of 1966 and most of the archaeology done in that country today proceeds from either direct or related requirements of that measure. In the United States, the vast majority of taxpayers, scholars, and politicians believe that CRM has helped to preserve much of that nation's history and prehistory that would have otherwise been lost in the expansion of cities, dams, and highways. Along with other statutes, this mandates that no construction project on [[public land]] or involving public funds may damage an unstudied [[archaeological site]]. 

The application of CRM in the United Kingdom is not limited to government-funded projects. Since 1990 [[PPG 16]] has required planners to consider archaeology as a [[material consideration]] in determining applications for new development. As a result, numerous archaeological organisations undertake mitigation work in advance of (or during) construction work in archaeologically sensitive areas, at the developer's expense.

Among the goals of CRM are the identification, preservation, and maintenance of [[cultural]] sites on public and private lands, and the removal of culturally valuable materials from areas where they would otherwise be destroyed by human activity, such as proposed construction. This study involves at least a cursory examination to determine whether or not any significant archaeological sites are present in the area affected by the proposed construction. If these do exist, time and money must be allotted for their excavation. If initial survey and/or test excavation indicates the presence of an extraordinarily valuable site, the construction may be prohibited entirely. CRM is a thriving entity, especially in the United States and Europe where archaeologists from private companies and all levels of government engage in the practice of their discipline.

Cultural resources management has, however, been criticized. CRM is conducted by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining the work to be done and an expected budget. It is not unheard-of for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal that asks for the least funding. CRM archaeologists face considerable time pressure, often being forced to complete their work in a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour.

==Field methods==
===Survey===
A modern archaeological project often begins with a [[archaeological survey|survey]]. ''Regional survey'' is the attempt to systematically locate previously unknown sites in a region. ''Site survey'' is the attempt to systematically locate features of interest, such as houses and [[midden|middens]], within a site. Each of these two goals may be accomplished with largely the same methods.

Survey was not widely practiced in the early days of archaeology. Cultural historians and prior researchers were usually content with discovering the locations of monumental sites from the local populace, and excavating only the plainly visible features there. [[Gordon Willey]] pioneered the technique of regional settlement pattern survey in 1949 in the [[Viru Valley]] of coastal [[Peru]], and survey of all levels became prominent with the rise of processual archaeology some years later.

Survey work has many benefits if performed as a preliminary exercise to, or even in place of, excavation. It requires relatively little time and expense, because it does not require processing large volumes of soil to search out artefacts. (Nevertheless, surveying a large region or site can be expensive, so archaeologists often employ [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] methods.) It avoids ethical issues (of particular concern to descendant peoples) associated with destroying a site through excavation. It is the only way to gather some forms of information, such as [[settlement pattern|settlement patterns]] and settlement structure. Survey data are commonly assembled into [[map|maps]], which may show surface features and/or artefact distribution.

The simplest survey technique is ''surface survey''. It involves combing an area, usually on foot but sometimes with the use of mechanised transport, to search for features or artefacts visible on the surface. Surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth, or overgrown with vegetation. Surface survey may also include mini-excavation techniques such as [[auger|augers]], [[corer|corers]], and [[shovel test]] pits.

''[[Aerial survey]]'' is conducted using [[camera|cameras]] attached to [[aircraft]], [[balloon|balloons]], or even [[kite|kites]]. A bird's-eye view is useful for quick mapping of large or complex sites. Aerial imaging can also detect many things not visible from the surface. [[Plant|Plants]] growing above a stone structure, such as a wall, will develop more slowly, while those above other types of features (such as [[midden|middens]]) may develop more rapidly. Photographs of ripening [[cereal|grain]], which changes colour rapidly at maturation, have revealed buried structures with great precision. Aerial survey also employs [[infrared]], ground-penetrating [[radar]] wavelengths, and [[thermography]].

''[[Geophysical survey]]'' is the most effective way to see beneath the ground. [[Magnetometer|Magnetometers]] detect minute deviations in the [[Earth's magnetic field]] caused by [[iron]] artefacts, [[kiln|kilns]], some types of [[stone structures]], and even ditches and middens. Devices that measure the [[electrical resistivity]] of the soil are also widely used. Most soils are [[moisture|moist]] below the surface, which gives them a relatively low resistivity. Features such as hard-packed floors or concentrations of stone have a higher resistivity. 

Although some archaeologists consider the use of [[metal detector|metal detectors]] to be tantamount to treasure hunting, others deem them an effective tool in archaeological surveying. Examples of formal archaeological use of metal detectors include musketball distribution analysis on [[English Civil War]] battlefields, metal distribution analysis prior to excavation of a nineteenth century ship wreck, and service cable location during evaluation. Metal detectorists have also contributed to the archaeological record where they have made detailed records of their results and refrained from raising artifacts from their archaeological context.  In the UK, metal detectorists have been solicited for involvement in the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]].

Regional survey in maritime archaeology uses [[side-scan sonar]].

===Excavation===
[[Excavation|Archaeological excavation]] existed even when the field was still the domain of amateurs, and it remains the source of the majority of data recovered in most field projects. It can reveal several types of information usually not accessible to survey, such as stratigraphy, three-dimensional structure, and verifiably primary context.

Modern excavation techniques require that the precise locations of objects and features, known as their [[provenance]] or provenience, be recorded. This always involves determining their horizontal locations, and sometimes vertical position as well (also see [[Primary Laws of Archaeology]]). Similarly, their [[archaeological association|association]], or relationship with nearby objects and features, needs to be recorded for later analysis. This allows the archaeologist to deduce what artefacts and features were likely used together and which may be from different phases of activity. For example, excavation of a site reveals its [[stratigraphy]]; if a site was occupied by a succession of distinct [[culture|cultures]], artefacts from more recent cultures will lie above those from more ancient cultures.

Excavation is the most expensive phase of archaeological research. Also, as a destructive process, it carries [[ethics|ethical]] concerns. As a result, very few sites are excavated in their entirety. [[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]] is even more important in excavation than in survey. It is common for large mechanical equipment, such as [[backhoe]]s ([[J. C. Bamford|JCBs]]), to be used in excavation, especially to remove the [[topsoil]] ([[overburden]]), though this method is increasingly used with great caution. Following this rather dramatic step, the exposed area is usually hand-cleaned with trowels or hoes to ensure that all features are apparent.

The next task is to form a [[Archaeological plan|site plan]] and then use it to help decide the method of excavation. Features dug into the natural [[subsoil]] are normally excavated in portions in order to produce a visible [[archaeological section]] for recording. Scaled plans and sections of individual features are all drawn on site, black and white and colour photographs of them are taken, and recording sheets are filled in describing the [[context]] of each. All this information serves as a permanent record of the now-destroyed archaeology and is used in describing and interpreting the site.

==Post-excavation analysis==
Once artefacts and structures have been excavated, or collected from surface surveys, it is necessary to properly study them, to gain as much data as possible. This process is known as post-excavation analysis, and is normally the most time-consuming part of the archaeological investigation. It is not uncommon for the final excavation reports on major sites to take years to be published.

At its most basic, the artefacts found are cleaned, catalogued and compared to published collections, in order to classify them [[typology|typologically]] and to identify other sites with similar artefact assemblages. However, a much more comprehensive range of analytical techniques are available through [[archaeological science]], meaning that artefacts can be dated and their compositions examined. The bones, plants and pollen collected from a site can all be analysed (using the techniques of [[zooarchaeology]], [[paleoethnobotany]], and [[palynology]]), while any texts can usually be [[Decipherment|deciphered]].

These techniques frequently provide information that would not otherwise be known and therefore contribute greatly to the understanding of a site.

==History of archaeology==
''Main article: [[History of archaeology]]''

The history of archaeology has been one of increasing professionalisation, and the use of an increasing range of techniques, to obtain as much data on the site being examined as possible.

Excavations of ancient monuments and the collection of antiquities have been taking place for thousands of years, but these were mostly for the extraction of valuable or aesthetically pleasing artefacts.

It was only in the 19th century that the systematic study of the past through its physical remains began to be carried out. Archaeological methods were developed by both interested amateurs and professionals, including [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]] and [[William Flinders Petrie]].

This process was continued in the 20th century by such people as [[Mortimer Wheeler]], whose highly disciplined approach to excavation greatly improved the quality of evidence that could be obtained.

During the 20th century, the development of [[urban archaeology]] and then [[rescue archaeology]] have been important factors, as has the development of [[archaeological science]], which has greatly increased the amount of data that it is possible to obtain.

==Archaeological theory==
''Main article: [[Archaeological theory]]''

There is no single theory of archaeology, and even definitions are disputed. Until the mid-20th century and the introduction of technology, there was a general consensus that archaeology was closely related to both history and anthropology. The first major phase in the history of archaeological theory is commonly referred to as '''[[Cultural-history archaeology|cultural, or culture, history]]''', which was developed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

In the 1960s, a number of young, primarily American archaeologists, such as [[Lewis Binford]], rebelled against the paradigms of cultural history. They proposed a &quot;New Archaeology&quot;, which would be more &quot;scientific&quot; and &quot;anthropological&quot;, with [[hypothesis]] testing and the [[scientific method]] very important parts of what became known as '''[[processual archaeology]]'''.

In the 1980s, a new movement arose led by the British archaeologists [[Michael Shanks (archaeologist)|Michael Shanks]], [[Christopher Tilley]], [[Daniel Miller]], and [[Ian Hodder]]. It questioned processualism's appeals to science and impartiality and emphasised the importance of relativism, becoming known as '''[[post-processual archaeology]]'''. However, this approach has been criticised by processualists as lacking scientific rigour. The validity of both processualism and post-procuessualism is still under debate.

Archaeological theory now borrows from a wide range of influences, including [[evolution|neo-Darwinian evolutionary thought]], [[phenomenology]], [[postmodernism]], [[Structure and agency|agency theory]], [[Cognitive archaeology|cognitive science]], [[Functionalism (sociology)|Functionalism]], [[Gender archaeology|gender-based]] and [[Feminist archaeology]], and [[Systems theory in archaeology|Systems theory]].

==Public archaeology==
Early archaeology was largely an attempt to uncover spectacular artifacts and features, or to explore vast and mysterious abandoned cities. Such pursuits continue to fascinate the public, portrayed in books (such as ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'') and films (such as ''[[The Mummy (1999 movie)|The Mummy]]'' and ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'').

Much thorough and productive research has indeed been conducted in dramatic locales such as [[Copán]] and the [[Valley of the Kings]], but the stuff of modern archaeology is not so reliably sensational. In addition, archaeological adventure stories tend to ignore the painstaking work involved in modern [[archaeological survey|survey]], [[excavation]], and [[archaeological data processing|data processing]] techniques. Some archaeologists refer to such portrayals as &quot;[[pseudoarchaeology]]&quot;.

Nevertheless, archaeology has profited from its portrayal in the mainstream media. Many practitioners point to the childhood excitement of [[Indiana Jones]] films and [[Tomb Raider games]] as the inspiration for them to enter the field. Archaeologists are also very much reliant on public support, the question of exactly who they are doing their work for is often discussed. Without a strong public interest in the subject, often sparked by significant finds and celebrity archaeologists, it would be a great deal harder for archaeologists to gain the political and financial support they require.

In the UK, popular archaeology programmes such as ''[[Time Team]]'' and ''[[Meet the Ancestors]]'' have resulted in a huge upsurge in public interest.  Where possible, archaeologists now make more provision for public involvement and outreach in larger projects than they once did. However, the move towards being more professional has meant that volunteer places are now relegated to unskilled labour, and even this is less freely available than before. Developer-funded excavation necessitates a well-trained staff that can work quickly and accurately, observing the necessary [[health and safety]] and indemnity insurance issues involved in working on a modern [[construction|building site]] with tight deadlines. Certain charities and [[local government]] bodies sometimes offer places on research projects either as part of academic work or as a defined community project. There is also a flourishing industry selling places on commercial [[training excavations]] and archaeological holiday tours.

Archaeologists prize local knowledge and often liaise with local historical and archaeological societies. Anyone looking to get involved in the field without having to pay to do so should contact a local group.

===Pseudoarchaeology===
''Main article: [[Pseudoarchaeology]]''.

Pseudoarchaeology is an umbrella term for all activities that claim to be archaeological but in fact violate commonly accepted archaeological practices. It includes much fictional archaeological work (discussed above), as well as some actual activity. Many non-fiction authors have ignored the scientific methods of [[processual archaeology]], or the specific critiques of it contained in  [[Post-processual archaeology|Post-processualism]].

An example of this type is the writing of [[Erich von Däniken]]. His ''[[Chariots of the Gods]]'' (1968), together with many subsequent lesser-known works, expounds a theory of ancient contacts between human civilisation on Earth and more technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilisations. This theory, known as [[palaeocontact theory]], is not exclusively Däniken's nor did the idea originate with him. Works of this nature are usually marked by the renunciation of well-established theories on the basis of limited evidence, and the interpretation of evidence with a preconceived theory in mind.

===Looting===
Looting of archaeological sites by people in search of [[hoard|hoards]] of buried treasure is an ancient problem. For instance, many of the tombs of the Egyptian [[pharaoh|pharaohs]] were looted in antiquity. The advent of archaeology has made ancient sites objects of great scientific and public interest, but it has also attracted unwelcome attention to the works of past peoples. A brisk commercial demand for artefacts encourages looting and the [[illicit antiquities]] trade, which smuggles items abroad to private collectors. Looters damage the integrity of a historic site, deny archaeologists valuable information that would be learnt from excavation, and are often deemed to be robbing local people of their heritage. 

The popular consciousness often associates looting with poor [[Third World]] countries. Many are former homes to many well-known ancient civilizations but lack the financial resources or political will to protect even the most significant sites. Certainly, the high prices that intact objects can command relative to a poor farmer's income make looting a tempting financial proposition for some local people. However, looting has taken its toll in places as rich and populous as the United States and Western Europe as well. Abandoned towns of the ancient [[Sinagua]] people of [[Arizona]], clearly visible in the desert landscape, have been destroyed in large numbers by treasure hunters. Sites in more densely populated areas farther east have also been looted. Where looting is proscribed by law it takes place under cover of night, with the [[metal detector]] a common instrument used to identify profitable places to dig.

===Public outreach===
Motivated by a desire to halt '''looting''', curb '''pseudoarchaeology''', and to secure greater public funding and appreciation for their work, archaeologists are mounting '''public-outreach campaigns'''. They seek to stop looting by informing prospective artefact collectors of the provenance of these goods, and by alerting people who live near archaeological sites of the threat of looting and the danger that it poses to science and their own heritage. Common methods of public outreach include press releases and the encouragement of school field trips to sites under excavation.

The final audience for archaeologists' work is the public and it is increasingly realised that their work is ultimately being done to benefit and inform them. The putative social benefits of local heritage awareness are also being promoted with initiatives to increase civic and individual pride through projects such as community excavation projects and better interpretation and presentation of existing sites.

===Descendant peoples===
In the United States, examples such as the case of [[Kennewick Man]] have illustrated the tensions between [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s and archaeologists which can be summarised as a conflict between a need to remain respectful towards burials sacred sites and the academic benefit from studying them. For years, American archaeologists dug on Indian burial grounds and other places considered sacred, removing artefacts and human remains to storage facilities for further study. In some cases human remains were not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied. Furthermore, Western archaeologists' views of the past often differ from those of tribal peoples. The West views time as linear; for many natives, it is cyclic. From a Western perspective, the past is long-gone; from a native perspective, disturbing the past can have dire consequences in the present. To an archaeologist, the past is long-gone and must be reconstructed through its material remains; to indigenous peoples, it is often still alive.

As a consequence of this, American Indians attempted to prevent archaeological excavation of sites inhabited by their ancestors, while American archaeologists believed that the advancement of scientific knowledge was a valid reason to continue their studies. This contradictory situation was addressed by the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA, 1990), which sought to reach a compromise by limiting the right of research institutions to possess human remains. Due in part to the spirit of postprocessualism, some archaeologists have begun to actively enlist the assistance of [[indigenous peoples]] likely to be descended from those under study.

Archaeologists have also been obliged to re-examine what constitutes an archaeological site in view of what native peoples believe to constitute sacred space. To many native peoples, natural features such as lakes, mountains or even individual trees have cultural significance. Australian archaeologists especially have explored this issue and attempted to survey these sites in order to give them some protection from being developed. Such work requires close links andormance

'''Astoria''' is the [[county seat]] of [[Clatsop County, Oregon]]{{GR|6}}, situated near the mouth of the [[Columbia River]]. It was named after the [[United States|American]] investor [[John Jacob Astor]]. As of the [[2000]] census, the city had a total population of 9,813.

== History ==
The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] spent the winter of 1805-1806 at [[Fort Clatsop]], a small log structure south and west of modern day Astoria. The expedition had hoped a ship would come by to take them back east, but instead endured a tortuous winter of rain and cold, then returned east the way they came. Today the fort has been recreated and is now a [[national monument]].

Several years later, in 1811, Astor's [[Pacific Fur Company]] founded [[Fort Astoria]] as its primary fur-trading post in the Northwest, and in fact the first permanent U.S. settlement on the Pacific coast.  It was an extremely important post for American exploration of the continent and was influential in helping establish American claims to the land.  The fort and fur trade was sold to the British in [[1813]], and while the fort was restored to the U.S. in [[1818]], control of the fur trade would remain under the British until American pioneers following the [[Oregon Trail]] began filtering into the port town in the mid-1840's. The first U.S. Post Office west of the [[Rocky Mountains]] was also established in Astoria in [[1847]].

As the [[Oregon Territory]] grew and became increasingly more settled, Astoria likewise grew as an ocean/river [[port|port city]]. In 1876 the community was legally incorporated.  It attracted a host of [[Scandinavian]] settlers, and the area still boasts a high concentration of descendants of these original settlers.

In [[1883]], and again in [[1922]], downtown Astoria was devastated by fire, but the city economy was strong enough in both cases to rebuild and thrive. Astoria has served as a port of entry for over a century and remains the trading center for the lower Columbia basin.

In addition to Fort Clatsop, another popular point of interest includes the [[Astoria Column]], a tower 38 m high built atop the hill above the town, with an inner circular staircase allowing visitors to climb to see a breathtaking view of the town, the surrounding lands, and the mighty Columbia flowing into the Pacific.  The column was built in 1926 to commemorate the region's early history by the Astor family.

Eclipsed by [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and other ports further inland along the Columbia, Astoria's economy centered around fishing, fish processing, and lumber. In 1945, about 30 canneries could be found along the Columbia; however, in 1974 [[Bumblebee Seafood]] moved its headquarters out of Astoria, and gradually reduced its presence until 1980 when the company closed its last cannery. The [[timber industry]] likewise declined, with Astoria Plywood Mill, the city's largest employer, closing in 1989, and the [[Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway]] announcing in 1996 that they were discontinuing service.

Today, tourism, Astoria's growing art scene, and light manufacturing are the main economic activities of the city. It is a port of call for [[cruise ship]]s, with many docking in 2004, 2005, and 13 scheduled in 2006.

Astoria was the setting of the [[1985]] hit movie ''[[The Goonies]]'', which was filmed on location. Other movies filmed in Astoria include ''[[Short Circuit]]'', ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]'', ''[[Free Willy]]'', ''[[Free Willy Two]]'', ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] III'', ''[[Benji]]'' and ''[[The Ring Two]]''.

Astoria is also the western terminus of the [[TransAmerica Trail]], a [[bicycle touring]] route created by the [[American Cycling Association]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty''' ('''ANZUS''' or '''ANZUS Treaty''') is the [[military alliance]] which binds [[Australia]] and the [[United States]], and separately Australia and [[New Zealand]] to cooperate on [[Defense (military)|defense]] matters in the Pacific Ocean area, though today the treaty is understood to relate to attacks in any area.
{{wikisource|Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty}}

==Treaty structure==
The treaty was previously a full three-way defence pact, but following a dispute between New Zealand and the United States in [[1984]] over visiting rights for nuclear-armed or nuclear-powered ships of the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] in New Zealand ports, the treaty no longer applies between the United States and New Zealand, but is still in force between either country and Australia, separately.

The US-Australia alliance under the ANZUS Treaty remains in full force. Heads of defence of one or both nations often have joined the annual ministerial meetings, which are supplemented by consultations between the U.S. Commander in Chief Pacific and the Australian Chief of Defence Force. There also are regular civilian and military consultations between the two governments at lower levels. Annual meetings to discuss ANZUS defence matters take place between the [[United States Secretary of State]] and the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)|Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs]] (AUSMIN). The 17th AUSMIN meeting took place in [[Adelaide]] in November 2005.

Unlike [[NATO]], ANZUS has no integrated defence structure or dedicated forces. However, in fulfillment of ANZUS obligations, Australia and the United States conduct a variety of joint activities. These include military exercises ranging from naval and landing exercises at the task-group level to battalion-level special forces training, assigning officers to each other's armed services, and standardizing equipment and operational doctrine. The two countries also operate several joint defence facilities in Australia, mainly ground stations for [[spy satellite|early warning satellites]], and signals intelligence gathering in South-East Asia and East Asia as part of the [[ECHELON]] network.

==History==

===Origins===
The treaty came about following the close cooperation of the United States, Australia and New Zealand during [[World War II]], during which time Australia had come perilously close to invasion by [[Japan]]. Following the end of World War II, the United States was eager to normalize relations with Japan, particularly as the [[Korean War]] was still raging a short distance from Japan. With the involvement of China and possibly the [[Soviet Union]] in Korea, the [[Cold War]] was threatening to become a full-scale war. However, Australia and New Zealand in particular were extremely reluctant to finalize a peace treaty with Japan which would allow for Japanese rearmament. Both countries relented only when an Australian and New Zealand proposal for a three-way security treaty was accepted by the United States.

The resulting treaty was concluded at [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] on [[1 September]] [[1951]], and entered into force on [[29 April]] [[1952]]. The treaty bound the signatories to recognize that an armed attack in the Pacific area on any of them would endanger the peace and safety of the others. It committed them to consult in the event of a threat and, in the event of attack, to meet the common danger in accordance with their respective constitutional processes. The three nations also pledged to maintain and develop individual and collective capabilities to resist attack.

It is interesting to note the treaty itself was not a source of debate for 30 years, though in this period New Zealand and Australia commited forces to the [[Malayan Emergency]] and subsequently the ANZUS nations fought together in the [[Vietnam War]].

===Malaya, Korea, and Vietnam===

New Zealand also fought alongside the United States in the Korea and Vietnam, and sent transport aircraft, maritime patrol aircraft and frigates to the Gulf, as well as a very small number of soldiers, [[Special Air Service of New Zealand|SAS]] soldiers, medical and assorted and peace-keeping forces in Afghanistan &amp;mdash; and despite Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] being openly critical of American justifications for the war, New Zealand did send engineers and troops to protect them to Iraq. An opinion poll in New Zealand in 2001 [http://www.greenleft.org.au/back/1991/15/15p18b.htm] showed 54% of those sampled preferred to let the treaty lapse rather than accept visits again by nuclear-armed/powered vessels. It seems from the United States point of view there is no need to rely upon ANZUS to obtain New Zealand military support.

===Australian reservations about the MX===
In [[1983]], the United States approached Australia with proposals for testing the new generation of American [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s, the [[LG-118A_Peacekeeper|MX missile]]. American test ranges in the Pacific were insufficient for testing the new long-range missiles and the United States military wished to use the [[Tasman Sea]] as a target area. Australian Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]] of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] had agreed to provide monitoring sites near [[Sydney]] for this purpose. However in 1985 the new Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] of the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] withdrew the offer of assistance after protests from within the Left faction of the Labor Party.

===New Zealand bans nuclear ships===
In [[1985]], the nature of the ANZUS alliance changed significantly. Tensions had long been present between Australia, New Zealand and the declared nuclear powers the United States and [[France]] which had conducted nuclear tests on South Pacific islands. Following the victory of the New Zealand Labour Party in elections in [[1984]], Prime Minister [[David Lange]] enacted laws which barred [[nuclear power|nuclear-powered]] or [[nuclear weapon|nuclear-armed]] ships from using New Zealand ports, citing the dangers of nuclear weapons, continued nuclear testing in the South Pacific, and opposition to US President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s policy of aggressively confronting the Soviet Union. Given that the United States Navy refused to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons aboard ships, these laws in effect refused access to New Zealand ports for all ships of the United States Navy. In February 1985, a port-visit request by the United States for the [[USS Buchanan (DDG-14)|USS ''Buchanan'']] was refused by New Zealand, as the ''Buchanan'' was capable of launching nuclear [[depth charge]]s.

On [[10 July]] [[1985]], the French [[DGSE]] bombed the [[Greenpeace]] protest vessel [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|Rainbow Warrior]] in [[Auckland]]. This event strengthened the nation's resolution to oppose in any form the military application of nuclear technology.

===The United States suspends ANZUS obligations to New Zealand===
After consultations with Australia and after negotiations with New Zealand broke down, the United States announced that it was suspending its treaty obligations to New Zealand until United States Navy ships were re-admitted to New Zealand ports, citing that New Zealand was &quot;a friend, but not an ally&quot;. The crisis made front-page headlines for weeks in many American newspapers, while many American cabinet members were quoted as expressing a deep sense of &quot;betrayal&quot;. It is still often incorrectly stated that David Lange withdrew New Zealand from ANZUS &amp;mdash; he did no such thing; his government's policy may well have led to the US's decision to suspend its treaty obligations to New Zealand, but that was still a decision of the US government, not the New Zealand government.

While the crisis with navy visits was prominent, the United States proved to be more forgiving of Australia's refusal to assist with the Peacekeeper missile. Fearing the total collapse of the ANZUS treaty, the US government decided to accommodate Australian domestic politics, particularly after [[NATO]] countries and other allies such as Japan showed little interest in taking a similar stance against nuclear weapons such as the [[MGM-31 Pershing |Pershing missile]].

===September&amp;nbsp;11, 2001 attacks===
Whilst Australia and New Zealand has fought alongside the United States before the treaty signing including in the [[Korean War]], the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Gulf War]] (Australia only) and elsewhere the ANZUS treaty's provisions for assistance when a member nation comes under threat were officially invoked for the first time by Australia after the [[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack|September&amp;nbsp;11, 2001 terrorist attacks]]. Australia is also a contributor to the [[National Missile Defense]] system. [http://usembassy-australia.state.gov/ausmin/2004/missile-defense.html] [http://www.foreignminister.gov.au/releases/2003/fa151_03.html]

===East Timor===
Between 1999 and 2003 the armed forces of Australia and New Zealand deployed together in a large scale operation in [[East Timor]], to prevent pro-Indonesian Militia from overturning a vote for independence and conducting ethnic cleansing on the island. The United States provided only limited logistical support. The operation was taken over by the [[United Nations]].

===Taiwan===
One topic that became prominent in the early 2000s are its implications in the case of a hypothetical attack by the [[People's Republic of China]] against [[Taiwan]] with the [[Republic_of_China|ROC]] (Taiwan) receiving American support. While Australia has strong cultural and economic ties with the United States, it also has an increasingly important trade relationship with [[mainland China]].

In August 2004, Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]] implied in Beijing that the treaty would likely not apply to that situation, but he was quickly corrected by Prime Minister [[John Howard]]. In March 2005, after an official of the [[People's Republic of China]] stated that it may be necessary for Australia to reassess the treaty and after the PRC passed an [[Anti-Secession Law]] regarding the ROC, Downer stated that in case of a PRC attack on the ROC, the treaty would come into force, but that the treaty would require only consultations with the United States and not necessarily commit Australia to war.

===The alliance today===
Annual bilateral meetings between the US Secretary of State and the Australian Foreign Minister replaced annual meetings of the ANZUS Council of Foreign Ministers. The first bilateral meeting was held in [[Canberra]] in 1985. At the second, in [[San Francisco]] in [[1986]], the United States and Australia announced that the United States was suspending its treaty security obligations to New Zealand pending the restoration of port access. Subsequent bilateral Australia-US Ministerial (AUSMIN) meetings have alternated between Australia and the United States.

The alliance engenders some political controversy in Australia. Particularly after Australian involvement in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 war on Iraq]], some quarters of Australian society have called for a re-evaluation of the relationship between the two nations. Nonetheless the alliance enjoyed broad support during the [[Cold War]] [http://assda.anu.edu.au/polls/M0004.html] and continues to enjoy broad support in Australia. [http://www.australianpolitics.com/foreign/anzus/01-06-30gnehm.shtml] [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/03/29/1080544419833.html?oneclick=true] One commentator in Australia has argued that the treaty should be re-negotiated in the context of terrorism, the modern role of the United Nations and as a purely US-Australian alliance. [http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=2140]

The value of the alliance was again questioned when a new US Ambassador arrived to take up his post in Wellington, New Zealand, in 2005. In his first speech on the topic of NZ-US relations the Ambassador referred to the ANZUS treaty repeatedly as &quot;Anzoo&quot;. Some commentators questioned how the Ambassador might know much about the alliance if he couldn't name it properly.

===Trivia===
An exhibit commemorating the past and present of the ANZUS Treaty is located at [[the Pentagon]].  Known as the &quot;ANZUS Corridor&quot;, it is located on the second floor of the A-ring, between Apex 1/2 and Apex 3/4.
The break down of the NZ-US relationship was dramatised on film by [[Greg McGee]] in the movie &quot;Fallout&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Axiology''', from the Greek ''axia'' (''&amp;alpha;&amp;xi;&amp;iota;&amp;alpha;'', value, worth), is the study of value or quality.  It is often thought to include [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]&amp;mdash;philosophical fields that depend crucially on notions of value&amp;mdash;and sometimes it is held to lay the groundwork for these fields, and thus to be similar to [[value theory]] and [[meta-ethics]].  The term was used in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but in recent decades, [[value theory]] has tended to replace it in discussions of the nature of value or goodness in general. Main article: ''[[Goodness and value theory]]''.

One area in which research continues to be pursued is so-called ''[[formal axiology]],'' or the attempt to lay out principles regarding value with [[mathematical rigor]].

The term is also used sometimes in [[economics]].

A popular work by [[Robert M. Pirsig]], ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]],'' introduced the term &quot;axiology&quot; to a general audience, although not in any technical context.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''There is a separate article about [[The Sandman: The Doll's House|The Doll's House, the graphic novel collection of the comic book The Sandman]].''

'''''A Doll's House''''' (Original [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] title: ''Et dukkehjem'') is a [[1879]] [[play]] by [[Norway|Norwegian]] playwright [[Henrik Ibsen]]. The play was highly controversial when first published, as it is sharply critical of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[marriage]] norms. It is considered a prime example of what is called the [[Well-Made Play]].

''A Doll's House'' was made into [[A Doll's House (movie)|numerous movies]], including a [[1973]] version directed by [[Joseph Losey]].

==Plot==

{{spoiler}}

''A Doll's House'' is a scathing criticism of the traditional roles of men and women in Victorian marriage.  As Ibsen wrote in his initial notes for the play, &quot;There are two kinds of moral law, two kinds of conscience, one in man and a completely different one in woman.  They do not understand each other; but in matters of practical living the woman is judged by man’s law, as if she were not a woman but a man.&quot;

Ibsen has his [[protagonist]], Nora, leave her husband in search of the wider world, after realizing that he is not the noble creature she has supposed him to be. Her role in the marriage is that of a [[doll]], her house a &quot;[[dollhouse|Doll's House]]&quot;, and indeed her husband Torvald refers to her incessantly as his little &quot;[[starling]]&quot; and as his &quot;[[squirrel]]&quot;.  She is not even permitted a key to the [[mailbox]].  Ibsen noted, &quot;A woman cannot be herself in contemporary society, it is an exclusively male society with laws drafted by men, and with counsel and judges who judge feminine conduct from the male point of view.&quot;  When she is [[blackmail]]ed because of an improper act that she commits in order to save her husband's life&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; [[forgery|forging]] her father's name on a note&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; her husband shows disgust and horror at what she had done upon finding this out. His only concern is his own reputation, despite the love for him that prompts her to do it.

When the blackmailer (Krogstad) recants, it could all be over, and in a traditional Victorian drama all would then be resolved.  For Ibsen, however, and for Nora, it is too late to go back to the way things wed amenities. Some ''zhaodaisuos'' still remain in use today.

In the late 1970s, Beijing, alongside much of China during the period of reform and economic opening under [[Deng Xiaoping]], saw greater attempts at attracting and catering to international business. A large number of hotels and other facilities to accommodate business, tourist, and other visitors began to be constructed. Today, given Beijing's size and status as one of the most frequently visited and economically, politically, and culturally important cities in Asia, a great number of hotels exist, many rivalling the highest international standards.

The most well-known hotel is the [[Beijing Hotel]], which is state-owned. Other notable hotels are the [[Great Wall Sheraton Hotel]], the [[Jianguo Hotel]], the [[China World Hotel]], the [[St. Regis]], [[Grand Hyatt at Oriental Plaza]] and the Peninsula Palace Hotel, operated by the Hong Kong-based [[Peninsula Group]].

[[Youth hostel|Youth hostels]] do exist but are few in number. There is one near the centre of Beijing, where accommodations are located four floors below ground level.

===Nightlife===
Nightlife in Beijing is varied. Most clubs are situated in the area around [[Sanlitun]] or in the region near the [[Workers Stadium]], especially to the north and to the west. New clubs opened on [[Gongrentiyuchang West Road]].

[[Wudaokou]], in northwestern Beijing, is also a bustling center of nightlife. There are more Koreans and other foreigners, mostly students, in the area.

Bar-wise, the following areas of Beijing are known as hubs for bars which open until late:

* [[Sanlitun]]
* [[Houhai]]
* [[Yuandadu]]

'''''Blue Velvet''''' is a [[1986 in film|1986]] [[film]] directed and written by [[David Lynch]]. The film begins with the protagonist discovering a severed human ear, which he takes to the police. He begins to investigate the matter himself, and discovers a seamy underworld within his quaint suburban town.

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

The film begins with Jeffrey Beaumont, played by [[Kyle MacLachlan]], coming home from college after his father has a [[stroke]]. While crossing a field he discovers a human ear and takes it to the police.  His curiosity piqued, he begins investigating the matter himself. In the process, he discovers that within his quaint suburban town exists a steamy underworld of [[kinky sex]] and brutal [[violence]].

The film operates on a number of levels, coming on as both a detective mystery and a kitchen-sink drama. The film depicts a tangled relationship which transpires between Jeffrey, his sweetheart Sandy Williams (played by [[Laura Dern]]), who is the daughter of a detective, and [[Isabella Rossellini]]'s femme fatale Dorothy Vallens. 

The relationship is twisted into even sharper relief by the character of [[Frank Booth]] (played by [[Dennis Hopper]]), a maniacal gangster who gets off by physically abusing others, breathing [[amyl nitrite]], and playing [[Roy Orbison]]'s song, &quot;[[In Dreams (song)|In Dreams]]&quot;, preferably all at the same time. ([[Amyl nitrite]] was suggested by Dennis Hopper; it was [[helium]] in Lynch's original script.)

== Symbolism  ==
The most consistent symbolism in ''Blue Velvet'' is an [[insect]] motif introduced at the end of the first scene, when the camera zooms in on a well-kept suburban lawn until it discovers, underground, a swarming nest of disgusting bugs.  This is generally recognized as a metaphor for the seedy underworld that Jeffrey will soon discover under the surface of his own suburban, [[Reagan]]esque paradise.  The bug motif is recurrent throughout the film, most notably in the horrific bug-like oxygen mask that Frank wears, but also in the excuse that Jeffrey offers when he first gains access to Dorothy's apartment: he claims he is an insect exterminator.  One of Frank's sinister accomplices is also consistently identified through the yellow jacket he wears. [[Yellowjacket]] happens to be the name of a type of wasp. Finally, a robin eating a bug on a fence becomes a topic of discussion in the last scene of the film.

The severed ear that Jeffrey discovers is also a key symbolic element; the ear is what leads Jeffrey into danger.  Indeed, just as Jeffrey's troubles begin, the audience is treated to a nightmarish sequence in which the camera zooms into the ear canal of the severed, decomposing ear.  Notably, the camera does not reemerge from the ear canal until the end of the film.  When Jeffrey finally comes through his hellish ordeal unscathed, the ear canal shot is replayed, only in reverse, zooming out and revealing that this ear belongs to Jeffrey, as he relaxes in his yard on a summer day.

A number of scenes contain red drapes or curtains, a popular recurring image for Lynch, especially prominent in [[Twin Peaks]].

==History==
'''''Blue Velvet'''''  was made [[1986 in film|1986]], shortly after [[David Lynch|Lynch's]] artistically troubling film ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]],'' which ran into various problems during shooting and eventually became a commercial and critical disappointment. Drained from such a harrowing ordeal and frustrated over the whole mess, Lynch took some time off to develop a more personal project that he had been working on while filming ''Dune''. Surprisingly, [[Dino de Laurentiis]] decided to give Lynch another chance, but only with the stipulation that he take a cut in his salary and work with a reduced budget of only $6 million. In return, the young director could have total artistic freedom and control over the final cut of the film.

''Blue Velvet'''s origins ultimately lie in Lynch's childhood a period of his life spent deep in the forests of Spokane, Washington. If Lynch's childhood memories inspired the setting of ''Blue Velvet'', the actual story of the film originated from three ideas that crystallized in the filmmaker's mind over a period of time. Ideas for ''Blue Velvet'' had begun to form in Lynch's head as early as 1973. After finishing ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'', he met producer Richard Roth over coffee. Roth had read and enjoyed Lynch's ''Ronnie Rocket'' script but didn't think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts Lynch only had ideas. &quot;I told him I had always wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea and asked me to write a treatment. I went home and thought of the ear in the field.&quot; For the filmmaker, the severed ear was the perfect way to draw Jeffrey into a secret world that lies at the heart of ''Blue Velvet''. The third idea that came to Lynch was [[Bobby Vinton]]’s classic rendition of the song &quot;Blue Velvet.&quot;

Once these three ideas came to Lynch, he set out to write a screenplay. The director wrote two scripts but both had a weak middle act so he ultimately rejected them. After his experiences with ''Dune'', Lynch returned to ''Blue Velvet'' and then De Laurentiis became involved and everything came together for the filmmaker.

It was the second film Lynch produced for Laurentiis. Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, Laurentiis had to start his own production company to distribute it. The film was also cut down from its original four-hour length to its final 120 minute length. The missing footage was put in storage and apparently lost for good.

''Blue Velvet'' was a huge critical success, earning Lynch his second [[Academy Award]] nomination and introducing several common elements of his work, including abused women, the dark underbelly of small towns and unconventional uses of vintage songs ([[Bobby Vinton]]’s &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; and [[Roy Orbison]]’s &quot;[[In Dreams]]&quot; are both featured in disturbing ways). It was also the first time Lynch worked with composer [[Angelo Badalamenti]], who would contribute to all of his future full-length films.

The title is taken from a [[Bobby Vinton]] song by the same name, which is sung by [[Isabella Rossellini]]'s character in the film.

== Possible influences ==
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:right&quot;&gt;{{lynch}}&lt;/div&gt;
Many elements of ''Blue Velvet'' are reminiscent of [[Charles Laughton]]'s [[1955 in film|1955]] one-shot-wonder, ''[[The Night of the Hunter]]''.  The story of a child or naïve young man thrust into an unexpected adult world of crime, sex, and murder is common to both films, and the development of this subject as something of a journey towards the redemption of innocence also seems similar.  Both films feature a helpless woman held under the power of a sometimes disarming but ultimately terrifying madman.  Both madmen are tied symbolically to a primal, animal or insect world.  And in both films the child character loses his father in the first scene, and later seeks the help of a surrogate father figure but is disappointed in this appeal to adult, masculine authority.

If Lynch was indeed influenced by Laughton, the ending of ''Blue Velvet'' deserves special attention.  In both ''Blue Velvet'' and ''Night of the Hunter'', the trial of the adult world is ultimately followed by a return to innocence and childhood.  However, whereas Laughton's treatment of this ending seems heartfelt and has in fact been criticized as too saccharine or simplistic, Lynch's ending seems tongue in cheek, or even sarcastic.  Just as Lynch's opening shots of perfect suburban America quickly prove too good to be true, his ending leaves doubt as to whether normalcy has really been recovered.  The appearance of a deliberately stiff and artificial-seeming robin singing merrily to Jeffrey cements the impression of cynicism.

Additionally, [[Kenneth Anger]]'s [[1949 in film|1949]] dialogue-free short ''[[Puce Moment]]'', which features a dark-haired woman slightly past her prime modelling an array of bright clothing for the camera, may be counted as an influence.

==Awards==

David Lynch and Dennis Hopper won a [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] award in 1987 for ''Blue Velvet'' in categories Best Director (Lynch) and  Best Supporting Actor (Hopper). In 1987 [[National Society of Film Critics]] gave the film  Best Film, Best Director (David Lynch), Best Cinematography (Frederick Elmes) and  Best Supporting Actor (Dennis Hopper) awards. Also David Lynch was nominated for the 1987 [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]] [[Academy Award]].

==Trivia==
*The exterior scenes of 'Lumberton' were filmed in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]].
*A number of musicians have sampled Dennis Hopper's character Frank Booth in this movie, the [[Mr Bungle]] song &quot;Squeeze Me Macaroni&quot; features the sample, &quot;One thing I can't stand is warm beer, it makes me fucking puke!!!!&quot; dialogue at the end, and [[Anthrax]]'s &quot;I'm The Man '91&quot; has him clearly saying &quot;Fuck that shit!&quot; which Frank Booth says in response to what type of beer Kyle MacLachlan's character says he likes. Pigface's unreleased remix &quot;Sickaspfuck&quot;, found on their 2001 best of album, begins with Frank's shouting of &quot;Let's fuck! I'll fuck anything that moves!&quot; The Louisiana band Acid Bath also samples Frank Booth in the song &quot;Cassie eats Cockroaches&quot;, the final track on &quot;When The Kite String Pops&quot;. The song also samples &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;.
*''Blue Velvet'' is quoted a few times in the Kevin Smith movie ''[[Clerks.]]''
*''Blue Velvet'' was referenced in an episode of ''[[Arrested Development]]''. Wayne Jarvis comments on Gob's puppet Franklin, asking (in an imitation of Kyle Maclachlan), &quot;Why do there have to be puppets like Frank?&quot;

      </clluminated by the items in its collection - which is almost anything, not just literature. 

Other items can be accessed in the Reading Rooms. In the past the Library emphasised its role as a &quot;library of last resort&quot; for people who needed access to deep and specialised collections which they could not find anywhere else. Nowadays it adopts a more welcoming approach and emphasises on its website that anyone who wishes to carry out research should be granted a reader's pass, providing they furnish the necessary identification for security purposes. The Library has come under criticism for admitting undergraduate students to the Reading Rooms, but the Library says that they have always admitted undergraduates as long as they have a legitimate personal, work-related or academic research purpose.

According to the website, more than half a million people use the Library's reading rooms every year. The huge reading rooms cover hundreds of seats which are filled with researchers every day. According to the [[May 2005]] Readers' Bulletin, usage of the Reading Rooms had gone up significantly in the last month or so - [[2005]] room usage has been the highest it has been for quite a few years. This is putting pressure on services including causing difficulty for readers using the cloakroom and locker facilities.

== Legal deposit ==
An [[Act of Parliament]] in [[1911]] established the principle of the [[Legal Deposit]], ensuring that the British Library, along with five other libraries in Britain and [[Ireland]], is entitled to receive a free copy of every item published in Britain and The Republic of Ireland. The other five libraries are: the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford]]; the [[Cambridge University Library|University Library]] at [[Cambridge]]; [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] Library in [[Dublin]]; and the National Libraries of [[National Library of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[National Library of Wales|Wales]]. The British Library is the only one that is entitled to receive a copy of everything within one month of publication; the other five have to wait for up to one year. 

In [[2003]], a [[Private Member's Bill]], the [[Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003]], was passed which extended the Legal Deposit requirements to electronic documents such as [[CD-ROM]]s and selected [[websites]]. 

See [http://www.bl.uk/about/policies/legaldeposit.html here], from the British Library's website, for more information about legal deposit.

Like the [[Library of Congress]], these libraries have retained copies of every publication in the English language over the last 100 years which is deemed significant.

== Newspapers ==
The British Library Newspapers section is based in Colindale in north London. The Library has a more or less complete collection of British and Irish newspapers since [[1840]], owing in part to legal deposit legislation of [[1869]] mandating that the library receive a copy of each edition of a [[newspaper]]. [[London]] editions of national daily and Sunday newspapers are complete back to [[1801]]. In total the collection consists of 660,000 bound volumes and 370,000 reels of [[microfilm]] containing tens of millions of newspapers with 52,000 titles on 45km of shelves.

A collection of particular interest is the [[Thomason Tracts]], containing 7,200 [[seventeenth century]] newspapers, and the [[Burney Collection]] featuring newspapers from the late [[eighteenth century|eighteenth]] and early [[nineteenth century|nineteenth]] centuries.  The Thomason Tracts and Burney collections are held at St Pancras, and are available in facsimile. 

The section also has extensive records of non-[[United Kingdom|British]] newspapers in languages that use the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] alphabets. The collection is less substantial for languages of the [[Middle East]] and the rest of [[Asia]], though some holdings of these are held at the main library in [[St. Pancras]].

== Miscellaneous information ==
[[Image:British Library - Kings Cross - London - England - 020504.jpg|thumb|300px|British Library main building, London]]
The library also holds the [[Oriental and India Office Collections]] (OIOC), Now called APAC (Asia, Pacific &amp; Africa Collections) which contain the collections of the [[India Office Library and Records]], and materials in the languages of [[Asia]] and of north and north-east [[Africa]].

The British Library participates in a project called '[[Bibliotheca Universalis]]' which aims at publishing major works on the [[World Wide Web|web]]. In the British Library's [[Digital library]] project collections can be toured online and the virtual pages of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s notebooks and other great works can be turned electronically. The British Library's [[secure electronic delivery service]], started in 2003 at a cost of 6 million pounds, brings access to more than one hundred million items (including 280,000 journal titles, 50 million patents, 5 million reports, 476,000 U.S. dissertations and 433,000 conference proceedings) for researchers and library patrons worldwide which were previously unavailable outside the Library due to [[copyright]] restrictions.

The use of the Library's web catalogue also continues to increase. In [[2003]] more than 9.7 million searches were conducted.

== Highlights of the collections ==
* The [[Marc Aurel Stein|Stein collection]] from Central Asia. 
* The [[Diamond Sutra]], claimed to be the world's oldest dated printed book
* The [[Lindisfarne Gospels]]
* Two [[Gutenberg Bible]]s
* Two [[1215]] copies of [[Magna Carta]]
* ''Papyrus Egerton 2'', the [[Egerton Gospel]]
* The only surviving copy of the poem ''[[Beowulf]]''
* 347 leaves of the [[Codex Sinaiticus]]

== Philatelic collections ==
The British Library [[philately|Philatelic]] Collections are the National Philatelic Collections of the [[United Kingdom]]. The Collections were established in [[1891]] with the donation of the [[Tapling Collection]], they steadily developed and now comprise over twenty five major collections and a number of smaller ones, encompassing a wide-range of disciplines. The collections include [[postage stamp|postage]] and [[revenue stamp]]s, [[postal stationery]], [[essay]]s, [[proof]]s, [[Cover (philately)|cover]]s and entries, '[[cinderella stamp]]' material, specimen issues, [[airmail]]s, some [[postal history]] materials, official and private [[Postal system|posts]], etc., for almost all countries and periods.

An extensive display of material from the collections is on exhibit and is probably the best permanent display of diverse classic stamps and philatelic material in the world. Approximately 80,000 items on 6,000 sheets may be viewed in 1,000 display frames; 2,400 sheets are from the Tapling Collection. All other material, which covers the whole world, is available to students and researchers by appointment.

As well as these extensive collections, the subject literature is very actively acquired, and makes the British Library one of the world's prime philatelic [[research]] centres.

'''Brown University''' is an [[Ivy League]] university located in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]].  Founded in 1764 as Rhode Island College, it is the third-oldest institution of [[higher education]] in [[New England]] and the [[Colonial colleges|seventh-oldest]] in the [[United States]]. Brown was the first college in the nation to accept students of all religious affiliations.

The Brown &quot;New Curriculum,&quot; instituted in 1969, eliminates distribution requirements and mandatory A/B/C [[grade (education)|grading]] (allowing any course to be taken on a &quot;satisfactory/no credit&quot; basis). 

Brown has the oldest undergraduate engineering program in the Ivy League (1847) and the only undergraduate [[History of Mathematics]] department in the world. Brown was also one of the first institutions to emphasize [[computer science]] as well as [[media studies]], with its department in Modern Culture and Media, where students study [[Film production|film]], [[film criticism]], and [[critical theory]].

Since 2001, Brown's current and 18th [[president]] is [[Ruth J. Simmons]], the first [[African American]] president, and second female president, of an Ivy League institution, as well as the first permanent female president of Brown.

The school colors are [[seal brown]], [[cardinal (color)|cardinal red]], and [[white]]. Brown's mascot is the [[bear]] and the sports teams are called the Bears. The costumed bear mascot named &quot;Bruno&quot; makes appearances at athletic games. The use of a bear as the University's [[mascot]] dates back to 1904. People associated with the University are known as [[List of Brown University people|Brunonians]].

In the fall of 2004, [[billionaire]] [[Sidney Frank]], who could only afford to attend Brown for one year in his youth, donated an additional $100 million exclusively for financial aid&amp;mdash;the largest gift in the university's history. Earlier that year, Frank had given $25 million for the construction of Sidney Frank Hall, the future home of Brown's fast-growing Department of Neuroscience, Department of Cognitive Science, and Department of Linguistic Sciences. In September 2005, Frank made yet another donation of $5 million to aid Brown in providing free tuition for New Orleans students whose colleges had been rendered unusable by [[Hurricane Katrina]] just weeks earlier. His donations are one part of Brown's new capital campaign, dubbed &quot;Boldly Brown&quot;, to raise $1.4 billion over the next three years, $600 million of which will go towards expanding the school's endowment. Brown parents also serve as large donors, and in 2004 gave more than any other group of non-alumni parents in the Ivy League and the second-most in the country (behind Duke).

== History ==
[[Image:Manning Chapel.jpg|frame|right|Hope College (left) was built in 1822, while Manning Hall (right) was built in 1834.]]
=== The founding of Brown ===
In 1763, [[James Manning]], a Baptist minister, was sent to [[Rhode Island]] by the Philadelphia Association of [[Baptist|Baptist Churches]] in order to found a college. At the same time, local [[Congregationalist|Congregationalists]], led by [[James Stiles]], were working toward a similar end. On [[March 3]], [[1764]], a charter was filed to create Rhode Island College in [[Warren, Rhode Island]], reflecting the work of both Stiles and Manning. 

The charter had more than 60 signatories, including [[John Brown (Rhode Island)|John]] and [[Nicholas Brown (Brown University)|Nicholas Brown]] of the Brown family, who would give the College its present day name. The college's mission, the charter stated, was to prepare students &quot;for discharging the Offices of Life&quot; by providing instruction &quot;in the Vernacular Learned Languages, and in the liberal Arts and Sciences.&quot; {{ref|WalterCBrunson}} The charter's language has long been interpreted by the university as discouraging the founding of a [[business school]] or [[law school]]. Brown continues to be one of only two [[Ivy League business schools|Ivy League universities with neither a business school]] nor a law school (the other being Princeton).

The charter required that the makeup of the board of thirty-six trustees include twenty-two Baptists, five Friends, four Congregationalists, and five Episcopalians, and by twelve Fellows, of whom eight, including the President, should be Baptists &quot;and the rest indifferently of any or all denominations.&quot; It specified that &quot;into this liberal and catholic institution shall never be admitted any religious tests, but on the contrary, all the members hereof shall forever enjoy full, free, absolute, and uninterrupted liberty of conscience.&quot; The 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica remarks that &quot;At the time it was framed the charter was considered extraordinarily liberal&quot; and that &quot;the government has always been largely non-sectarian in spirit.&quot;{{ref|eb1911}}

James Manning, the minister sent to Rhode Island by the Baptists, was sworn in as the College's first president in 1765. Rhode Island College moved to its present location on College Hill, in the East Side of Providence, in 1770 and construction of the first building, The College Edifice, began. This building was renamed University Hall in 1823. The Brown family -- Nicholas, John, Joseph and [[Moses Brown|Moses]] -- were instrumental in the move to Providence, funding and organizing much of the construction of the new buildings. The family's connection with the college was strong: [[Joseph Brown (professor)|Joseph Brown]] became a professor of Physics at the University and [[John Brown (Rhode Island)|John Brown]] served as treasurer from 1775 to 1796. In 1804, a year after John Brown's death, the University was renamed Brown University in honor of John's nephew, [[Nicholas Brown, Jr.]], who was a member of the class of 1786 and contributed $5,000 (which, adjusted for [[inflation]], is approximately $61,000 in 2005, though it was 1,000 times the roughly $5 tuition) toward an endowed professorship. In 1904, the [[John Carter Brown Library]] was opened as an independent historical and cultural research center based around the libraries of [[John Carter Brown|John Carter]] and [[John Nicholas Brown]].

The Brown family was involved in various business ventures in Rhode Island, including [[slavery]]; the family itself was divided on the issue. John Brown had relentlessly defended slavery, while [[Moses Brown]] and Nicholas Brown Jr. were fervent [[abolitionism|abolitionists]]. In recognition of this history, the University established the University Steering Committee on Slavery and Justice in 2003 ([http://www.brown.edu/Research/Slavery_Justice/index.html]).

Brown began to admit women when it established a Women's College in 1891, which was later named [[Pembroke College]]. &quot;The College&quot; (the undergraduate school) merged with Pembroke College in 1971 and became [[coeducation|coeducational]].

=== The New Curriculum ===
Brown adopted the New Curriculum in 1969, marking a major change in the University's institutional history.  The [[curriculum]] was the result of a paper written by [[Ira Magaziner]] and [[Elliot Maxwell]], &quot;Draft of a Working Paper for Education at Brown University.&quot;  The paper came out of a year-long Group Independent Studies Project (GISP) involving 80 students and 15 professors.  The group was inspired by student-initiated experimental schools, especially [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State College]], and sought ways to improve education for students at Brown.  The philosophy they formed was based on the principle that &quot;the individual who is being educated is the center of the educational process.&quot; In 1850, Brown President Francis Wayland wrote: &quot;The various courses should be so arranged that, insofar as practicable, every student might study what he chose, all that he chose, and nothing but what he chose.&quot;

The paper made a number of suggestions for improving education at Brown, including a new kind of [[interdisciplinary]] freshman course that would introduce  new modes of inquiry and bring faculty from different fields together. Their goal was to transform the survey course, which traditionally sought to cover a large amount of basic material, into specialized courses that would introduce the important modes of inquiry used in different disciplines.

The New Curriculum that came out of the working paper was significantly different from the paper itself.  Its key features were:

* Modes of Thought courses aimed at first-year students 
* Interdisciplinary University courses
* Students could elect to take any course Satisfactory/No Credit
* Distribution requirements were dropped
* The University simplified grades to ABC/No Credit, eliminating pluses, minuses and D's.  Furthermore, &quot;No Credit&quot; would not appear on external transcripts.

Except for the Modes of Thought courses, a key component of the reforms which have been discontinued, these elements of the New Curriculum are still in place.

Additionally, due to the school's proximity and close partnership with the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] ([[RISD]]), Brown students have the ability to take up to four courses at RISD and have the credit count towards a Brown degree.  Likewise, RISD students can also take courses at Brown.  Since the two campuses are effectively adjacent to each other, the two institutions often partner to provide both student bodies with services (such as the local Brown/RISD after-hours and downtown transportation shuttles).

Recently, there has been some debate on reintroducing plus/minus grading to the curriculum.  Advocates argue that adding pluses and minuses would reduce grade inflation and allow professors to give more specific grades, while critics say that this plan would have no effect on grade inflation while increasing unnecessary competition among students and violating the principle of the New Curriculum.

The University is currently in the process of broadening and expanding its curricular offerings as part of the &quot;Plan for Academic Enrichment.&quot; The number of faculty has been greatly expanded. Seminars aimed at freshmen have begun to be offered widely by many departments.

==Academics, ranking, and reputation==
Admission to Brown is extremely competitive, with an admissions rate of 14.6%. Students come from all 50 [[U.S. state|state]]s, as well as 65 countries. Brown's [[financial aid]] program awards approximately $70 million each year in the form of scholarships, jobs, and loans. Over 50 percent of students receive some form of financial aid.

=== The College ===
==== Concentrations ====
Brown offers over 100 [[List of academic disciplines|concentrations]] (majors) and around 2,000 courses each year. The most popular concentration is [[Biology]], followed by [[History]] and [[International Relations]]. Brown's undergraduate concentration in [[Bioethics|Biomedical Ethics]] is the oldest program in the subject in the country.  Undergraduates can also design an independent concentration if the existing standard programs do not befit their interests.

=== Brown Medical School ===
The University's [[Brown Medical School|medical program]] started in 1811, but the school was suspended by President Wayland in 1827. In 1975, the first [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] degrees of the modern era were awarded to a graduating class of 58 students. In 1984, Brown endorsed an eight-year medical program called the [[Program in Liberal Medical Education]] (PLME). The majority of openings for the first-year medical school class are reserved for PLME students. Each year, approximately 60 students matriculate into the PLME out of an applicant pool of about 1,600.

In addition, Brown offers a joint program with [[Dartmouth Medical School]] called the Brown-Dartmouth Medical Program. Approximately 15 students at Dartmouth Medical School enroll in this program annually. They spend the first two basic medical science years at [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] and the next two years in clinical education at Brown, where they receive their M.D. degree.  In June 2005, however, the deans of both schools announced that the Brown-Dartmouth program would accept its final class in the fall of 2006, stating that the institutions desired to move in their own directions.

Several other admission pathways exist.  The Early Identification Program (EIP) encourages Rhode Island residents to pursue careers in medicine by recruiting sophomores from [[Providence College]], [[Rhode Island College]], the [[University of Rhode Island]], and [[Tougaloo College]] to BMS.  In 2004, the school once again began to accept applications via the &quot;standard route&quot;, from pre-medical students at any [[college]] or [[university]].  For the Class of 2009, nine students were accepted via this route.

BMS also offers combined degree programs leading to the M.D./[[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] or M.D./[[Master of Public Health|M.P.H.]] degrees.

== Student life ==
=== Setting ===
Brown's campus is located atop College Hill, in the city's East Side neighborhood, across the Providence River from downtown Providence. The East Side is home to the largest remaining collection of historic [[Thirteen Colonies|colonial]] homes in the country.  The [[Thayer Street]] commercial strip is so well integrated into geographic area of Brown, that students often just consider it as part of the campus.  Also on the hill, but further to the south and away from the main campus area, is Wickenden Street, which offers another array of restaurants and bistros that students like to frequent.

=== Atmosphere ===
[[Princeton Review]] ranks Brown third among all American colleges for &quot;happiest students.&quot;[http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/rankings/rankingDetails.asp?categoryID=6&amp;topicID=43]  Brown was recently named &quot;the most fashionable school in the Ivy League&quot; by the [[fashion]] trade journal ''Women's Wear Daily'' on the basis that students on campus seem to have the strongest sense of personal style. Students at Brown, as at most Ivies, lean [[left-wing politics|Left]] ([[American liberalism|liberal]]) on the [[Left-Right politics|Left-Right]] [[political spectrum]].

==== Nightlife ====	 
Brown is home to an active on-campus nightlife. A wide array of parties take place on the weekends, most of them in dorms and off-campus houses. Greek life is restricted to a fraction of the Brown student body, though they do take the spotlight during the annual Spring Weekend. Some parties, such as the Queer Alliance’s debauched [[SexPowerGod]] and [[Starf*ck (party)|Starf*ck]], are annual occurrences.

[[Image:Brown bears logo.jpg|right|Brown Bears]]
=== Athletics ===
Brown is a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[Division I]] Ivy League athletic conference. It sponsors 37 [[varsity team|varsity]] intercollegiate teams. Its athletics program has been featured in the College Sports Honor Roll as one of the top 20 athletic programs in the country according to [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]. [http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/sports/rankings/honor.htm] Brown also features several competitive intercollegiate club sports, including its nationally ranked [[sailing]], [[Taekwondo]]  and [[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate]] teams.  In 2005, the men's ultimate frisbee team won the national championship, and the football team won its first-ever outright Ivy League title.

=== Student groups ===
There are approximately 240 [http://www.brown.edu/web/gab3/ registered student organizations] on campus with diverse interests. The Student Activities Fair, during the orientation program, is an opportunity for first-years to become acquainted with the wide range of clubs.  

==== Residential / Greek ====
9% of Brown students are in [[fraternity|fraternities]] and just over 1% are in [[sorority|sororities]]. There are eleven residential Greek houses: six all-male fraternities (Alpha Epsilon Pi, Delta Tau, Delta Phi, Theta Delta Chi, Sigma Chi, and Phi Kappa Psi), two sororities (Alpha Chi Omega and Kappa Alpha Theta), two co-ed fraternities (Delta Psi and [[Zeta Delta Xi]]), and a co-ed literary society (Alpha Delta Phi). All recognized Greek letter organizations live on-campus in University-owned dorm housing. Ten of the houses are overseen by the Greek Council and are located on Wriston Quadrangle. [[St. Anthony Hall]], a co-ed fraternity (Delta Psi) that does not participate in Greek Council, is located in King House. Greek letter organizations that &quot;discriminate on the basis of race&quot; are not sanctioned, forcing groups like the [[Alpha Phi Alpha|Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity]], an [[African American]] fraternity, to operate off-campus.

An alternative to fraternity life at Brown are the program houses, which are organized around various themes. As with Greek houses, the existing residents of each house take applications from students returning for the fall semester. Examples of program houses include: Buxton International House, [[French language|French]]/[[Spanish language|Spanish]] House, Art House, Technology House, Environmental House and [[Interfaith]] House.

==== Secret societies ====
Like at most other Ivies, secret societies have existed at Brown since the mid-18th century.  They originated as literary clubs and organized disputes among their members, a forensic tradition that continues today in the [[Brown Debating Union]].  The first known literary society was Athenian at Queen's, founded in 1776, but this group disbanded by the mid-1780's.  The Philermenian Society (founded as the Misokosmian Society) arose in 1794. In reaction to the [[United States Federalist Party|Federalist]] Philermenians, a [[United States Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] society called the United Brothers Society was formed in 1806. In 1824 a third society, the Franklin Society, was formally recognized by the university president, and counted as honorary members [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[John Quincy Adams]], and [[Henry Clay]]. All of these societies had libraries and meeting rooms on the top floor of Hope College, and few written documents were preserved in order to protect against inter-society espionage. By the mid-19th century, these societies diminished on account of the growth in the number of [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternities]]. In recent years, the Society of the Pacifica House has claimed to be the continuation of the Franklin Society and the sole remaining secret society at Brown, although this has not been verified.

== Traditions ==
[[Image:Van Wickle in snow.jpg|frame|right|The Van Wickle Gates, built in 1901, in the middle of a Providence winter.]]

Though the early history of Brown's traditions as a men's school includes a number of unusual [[hazing]] traditions, the University's present-day traditions tend to be non-violent while maintaining the spirit of zaniness ([http://www.browndailyherald.com/post/stories.asp?ID=84 Poulson 2004]).

=== Van Wickle Gates ===
The Van Wickle Gates, dedicated on [[June 18]], [[1901]], have a pair of center gates and a smaller gate on each side. The side gates remain open throughout the year, while the center gates remain closed except for two occasions each year. At the beginning of the academic year, the center gates open inward to admit students during Convocation. At the end of the second semester, the gates open outward for the Commencement Day procession. A traditional superstition is that students who pass through the gates for a second time before graduation do not graduate. Undergraduate members of the Brown Band who must pass through the gates during the Commencement ceremonies walk through it backwards. Formerly, the graduation superstition only applied to male students, as female students had their own fear of never marrying. Similar superstitions apply to the Pembroke seal on the stone steps leading to the Pembroke quad from Meeting Street, a holdover from when Pembroke College was a separate college for women. Another traditional superstition is that students rub the nose of the statue of [[John Hay]] in the John Hay Library for good luck on exams, a superstition that has been in effect since around 1910, resulting in a very shiny nose.

=== Josiah S. Carberry ===
One of Brown's most notable traditions is keeping alive the spirit and accomplishments of [[Josiah Carberry|Josiah S. Carberry]], the fictional Professor of Psychoceramics (the equally fictional study of cracked pots), who was born on a University Hall billboard in 1929. He is the namesake of &quot;Josiah's&quot;, a University-run snackbar. &quot;Josiah&quot; is also the name of the University's electronic library [http://josiah.brown.edu catalog]. Every [[Friday the 13th]] is &quot;Josiah Carberry Day&quot; and students throw pennies into cracked pots.

=== Spring Weekend ===
Starting in 1960, Brown replaced a traditional Junior Dance with a Spring Weekend concert on the college's main green, which has, in the past, brought in acts such as [[Ray Charles]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Ike Turner|Ike]] and [[Tina Turner]], [[Blue Öyster Cult]], [[U2]], [[R.E.M. (band)|R.E.M.]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], [[The Fugees]], [[Busta Rhymes]], and [[G. Love &amp; Special Sauce]]. Recent acts include [[They Might Be Giants]], [[Ben Harper]], [[The Get Up Kids]], [[The Roots]], [[The Wallflowers]], [[Béla Fleck and the Flecktones]], [[Jurassic 5]], [[Ben Folds]], [[Howie Day]], [[The Shins]], and [[Talib Kweli]]. This year's acts (academic year 2005-2006) will feature [[Wilco]] and [[Common]].

=== Other Campus Traditions ===
==== Naked donut run ====
At the end of each semester, usually on the night before the first day of exams (the last day of &quot;reading period&quot;), naked students walk (despite the word &quot;run&quot; in the name) through the Rockefeller and Sciences Libraries and hand out donuts to their peers.  Neither the organization nor the precise timing of the &quot;run&quot; are publicly known, with the recruitment of participants usually occurring within 24 hours of the actual run.  The role of head organizer is secretly passed from an upperclassman to an underclassman every year or two, and has usually been associated with one of the campus's co-ed fraternities or residential co-ops.  If a naked donut run fails to occur during a semester, a new organizer will often take up the tradition the following term.

==== Naked party ====
Every fall, the [[Brown Association for Cooperative Housing]] (BACH) throws an invitation-only &quot;naked party&quot; where all guests remove their clothes upon entry. The hosts aim to create a comfortable setting where people of all body types can celebrate the naked human body.  In contrast to the sexually suggestive dancing that can be found at many college parties, dancing at a &quot;naked party&quot; is paradoxically much more tame and devoid of physical contact.

==== Miscellaneous traditions ====
* Seniors sleep in the Sciences Library some time before graduation.
* Students have sex on the 13th floor of the Sciences Library. The restroom is usually used by all but the most adventuresome of students.
* Students attempt to complete the &quot;SciLi Challenge,&quot; a shot of liquor on each of the library's 14 floors.
* It is said that a student who enters all seven of the Brown libraries during his or her first year will never marry anyone of the opposite sex.

=== Brown songs ===
==== Alma Mater ====
The &quot;Alma Mater&quot; was written by James Andrews DeWolf (Class of 1861) in 1860, who named it &quot;Old Brown&quot; and set it to the tune of &quot;[[1822 in music|Araby's Daughter]]&quot; (which was later known as &quot;[[Samuel Woodworth|The Old Oaken Bucket]]&quot;). The song was renamed &quot;Alma Mater&quot;, after the [[incipit]], in 1869.{{ref|almamater}} It is sung and played after varsity athletic victories and at formal events such as Convocation and Commencement.

::Alma Mater! we hail thee with loyal devotion,
::And bring to thine altar our off'ring of praise;
::Our hearts swell within us, with joyful emotion,
::As the name of old Brown in loud chorus we raise.
::The happiest moments of youth's fleeting hours,
::We've passed, 'neath the shade of these time-honored walls,
::And sorrows as transient as April's brief showers
::Have clouded our life in Brunonia's halls.

::And when we depart from thy friendly protection,
::And boldly launch out upon life's stormy main,
::We'll oft look behind us, with grateful affection,
::And live our bright college days over again.
::When from youth we have journeyed to manhood's high station,
::And hopeful young scions around us have grown,
::We'll send them, with love and deep veneration,
::As pilgrims devout, to the shrine of Old Brown.

::And when life's golden autumn with winter is blending,
::And brows, now so radiant, are furrowed by care;
::When the blightings of age on our heads are descending.
::With no early friends all our sorrows to share; -
::Oh! then, as in memory backward we wander,
::And roam the long vista of past years adown,
::On the scenes of our student life often we'll ponder,
::And smile, as we murmur the name of Old Brown.

==== Ever True To Brown ====
Brown's official fight song &quot;Ever True To Brown&quot; was written by Donald Jackson (Class of 1909). The song is played by the Brown Band at varsity athletic events. The unofficial version is alternately played by the Band as well.

{|

And the people always say,&lt;br /&gt;
That you can't outshine Brown Men,&lt;br /&gt;
With their Rah! Rah! Rah!&lt;br /&gt;
And their Ki! Yi! Yi!&lt;br /&gt;

We are ever true to Brown,&lt;br /&gt;
For we love our college dear,&lt;br /&gt;
And wherever we may go, (Where are we going?)&lt;br /&gt;
We are ready with a beer,&lt;br /&gt;
And the people always say, (What do they say?)&lt;br /&gt;
That you can't outdrink Brown Men, (and Women!)&lt;br /&gt;
With a scotch and rye,&lt;br /&gt;
And a whiskey dry,&lt;br /&gt;
And a B-O-U-R-B-O-N!&lt;br /&gt;
|}

== Computing projects ==
Several projects of note involving hypertext and other forms of electronic text have been developed at Brown, including:
* [[BrainGate]]
* [[FRESS]]
* [[Hypertext Editing System]]
* [[Women Writers Project]]

In addition, the Computer Science department at Brown is home to [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment|The CAVE]], part of the [[Thomas J. Watson, Sr. Center for Information Technology]].  This project is a complete virtual reality room, one of few in the world, and is used for everything from three-dimensional drawing classes to tours of the [[circulatory system]] for medical students.

== Trivia ==
* The John Hay library contains three books bound in human skin: a 1568 edition of [[Andreas Vesalius|Vesalius]]' ''De Humani Corporis Fabrica'' and two 19th century editions of &quot;The Dance of Death,&quot; a medieval morality tale. According to Associated Press reporter M.L. Johnson, other large university libraries also have such volumes, and quotes a rare book cataloger as saying that while the idea of making leather from human skin seems bizarre and cruel today, it was not uncommon in centuries past.{{ref|skin}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bill Atkinson''' worked at [[Apple Computer]] from [[1978]] to early [[1980s]]. He received his undergraduate degree from the [[University of California, San Diego]], where [[Apple Macintosh]] [[visionary]] [[Jef Raskin]] was one of his professors. Atkinson continued his studies as a graduate student at the [[University of Washington]].

He designed and implemented [[HyperCard]], the first popular [[hypertext]] system. Atkinson was also part of the [[Apple Macintosh]] development team and was the creator of the ground-breaking [[MacPaint]] application, among others. Atkinson also designed and implemented [[QuickDraw]], the fundamental toolbox that the Macintosh used for graphics. QuickDraw's performance was essential for the success of the Macintosh's [[graphical user interface]].

Around [[1990]], [[General Magic]] was founded and Bill Atkinson was one of the three co-founders.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The obstacles to General Magic's success may appear daunting, but General Magic is not your typical start-up company. Its partners include some of the biggest players in the worlds of computing, communications, and consumer electronics, and it's loaded with top-notch engineers who have been given a clean slate to reinvent traditional approaches to ubiquitous worldwide communications. ([http://www.byte.com/art/9402/sec3/art1.htm Source]) &lt;/blockquote&gt; 

[[As of 2002]], he was involved full-time in fine-art [[digital photography|digital]] [[nature photography]]. Some of his [[photograph]]s are available as [[e-cards]] in the &quot;iCards&quot; section of the [[.Mac]].

Some of Atkinson's noteworthy contributions to the field of computing include:

* [[Marching ants]]
* The [[Selection lasso]]
* [[Fat bits]]
* [[HyperCard]]

      <comment>/* Second Battle of Lostwithiel, 1644 */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There were two '''Battles of Lostwithiel''', both in the 1640s.

===First Battle of Lostwithiel, 1642===


===Second Battle of Lostwithiel, 1644===

After the overwhelming defeat at the [[Battle of Marston Moor]], which cost him the entire north of [[England]], [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] continued to defy the Parliamentarian forces. 

From his headquarters in [[Oxford, England|Oxford]], he marched west in pursuit of [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex]], who was invading the Royalist stronghold of [[Cornwall]]. [[Charles I of England|Charles]]'s army vastly outnumbered that of Devereux, and had the advantage of surprise.  On [[September 2]] [[1644]], [[Charles I of England|Charles]]'s army attacked the rear of Essex's force and quickly surrounded it at [[Lostwithiel]] in Cornwall, 30 miles west of [[Plymouth]], attacking from both the north and the east at the same time. Lostwithiel was strategically important during the [[English Civil War]] since it held the key to [[Fowey]], at the time a major seaport. 

Devereux and most of his cavalry managed to escape, but virtually all of the infantrymen, about 8,000, and the artillery fell into the King's hands. Only Major-General [[Philip Skippon]] and a few of his men succeeded in fighting their way out. Charles wheeled about and marched toward [[London]].

This setback for Parliament in [[Cornwall]], and the last major victory for the Royalists, was reversed by [[Sir Thomas Fairfax]] leading the [[New Model Army]] at or near [[Tresillian Bridge]], close to [[Truro]] on [[March 12]] [[1645]].

'''Bertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell''', [[Order of Merit|OM]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] ([[18 May]] [[1872]] &amp;ndash; [[2 February]] [[1970]]), was an influential British [[mathematical logic|logician]], [[philosopher]], and [[mathematician]], working mostly in the [[20th century]]. A prolific [[writer]], Bertrand Russell was also a populariser of [[philosophy]] and a commentator on a large variety of topics, ranging from very serious issues to the mundane. Continuing a family tradition in [[politics|political]] affairs, he was a prominent [[liberalism|liberal]] as well as a [[socialist]] and [[anti-war]] [[activism|activist]] for most of his long life. Millions looked up to Russell as a prophet of the [[creativity|creative]] and [[rationality|rational]] life; at the same time, his stances on many topics were extremely controversial.

Born at the height of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[economics|economic]] and political ascendancy, he died of [[influenza]] nearly a century later when the [[British Empire]] had all but vanished; its power dissipated in two victorious, but debilitating [[world war]]s. As one of the world's best-known [[intellectual]]s, Russell's voice carried enormous [[morality|moral]] [[authority]], even into his early 90s. Among his other political activities, Russell was a vigorous proponent of [[nuclear disarmament]] and an outspoken [[critic]] of the [[Vietnam War|American war in Vietnam]].

In [[1950]], Russell was made a [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Laureate]] in [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Literature]] &quot;in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions [[humanitarian]] ideals and [[freethought|freedom of thought]]&quot;.

==Biography==
Bertrand Russell was born on [[18 May]] [[1872]] at [[Trellech]], [[Monmouthshire]], [[Wales]], into an [[aristocratic]] [[English people|English]] family. His paternal grandfather, [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell]], had been the British [[Prime Minister]] in the [[1840s]] and [[1860s]], and was the second son of [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford]]. The Russells had been prominent for several centuries in Britain, and were one of Britain's leading [[Whig]] (Liberal) families. Russell's mother Kate (née Stanley) was also from an aristocratic family, and was the sister of [[Rosalind Howard]], Countess of Carlisle. Russell's parents were quite radical for their times&amp;mdash;Russell's father, [[Viscount Amberley]], was an atheist and consented to his wife's affair with their children's tutor, the [[biologist]] [[Douglas Spalding]].  Both were early advocates of [[birth control]] at a time when this was considered scandalous. [[John Stuart Mill]], the [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian]] philosopher, was Russell's [[Godparent|godfather]].

Russell had two siblings: [[Frank Russell, 2nd Earl Russell|Frank]] (nearly seven years older than Bertrand), and Rachel (four years older). In June [[1875]] Russell's mother died of [[diphtheria]], followed shortly by Rachel, and in January [[1876]] his father died of [[bronchitis]] following a long period of [[clinical depression|depression]]. Frank and Bertrand were placed in the care of their staunchly [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] grandparents, who lived at [[Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park|Pembroke Lodge]] in [[Richmond Park]]. The first Earl Russell died in [[1878]], and his widow the Countess Russell (née Lady Frances Elliot) was the dominant family figure for the rest of Russell's childhood and youth. The countess was from a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Presbyterian]] family, and successfully petitioned a British [[court]] to set aside a provision in Amberley's [[will (law)|will]] requiring the children to be raised as agnostics. Despite her religious conservatism, she held progressive views in other areas (accepting [[Darwinism]] and supporting [[Irish Home Rule]]), and her influence on Bertrand Russell's outlook on [[social justice]] and standing up for principle remained with him throughout his life. However, the atmosphere at Pembroke Lodge was one of frequent prayer, emotional repression and formality - Frank reacted to this with open rebellion, but the young Bertrand learned to hide his feelings.

Russell's [[adolescence]] was very lonely, and he often contemplated [[suicide]]. He remarked in his autobiography that his keenest interests were in sex, religion and mathematics, and that only the wish to know more mathematics kept him from suicide. He was educated at home by a series of tutors, and he spent countless hours in his grandfather's library. His brother Frank introduced him to [[Euclid]], which transformed Russell's life.

Russell won a scholarship to read [[mathematics]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], and commenced his studies there in [[1890]].  He became acquainted with the younger [[George Edward Moore|G.E. Moore]] and came under the influence of [[Alfred North Whitehead]], who recommended him to the [[Cambridge Apostles]].  He quickly distinguished himself in mathematics and philosophy, graduating with a B.A. in the former subject in 1893 and adding a fellowship in the latter in 1895.

Russell first met the American [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]], [[Alys Pearsall Smith]], when he was seventeen years old.  He fell in love with the puritanical, high-minded Alys, who was connected to several educationists and religious activists, and, contrary to his grandmother's wishes, he married her in December [[1894]]. Their [[marriage]] began to fall apart in [[1902]] when Russell realised he no longer loved her; they divorced nineteen years later. During this period, Russell had passionate (and often simultaneous) affairs with, among others, Lady [[Ottoline Morrell]] and the [[actor]] Lady [[Constance Malleson]]. Alys pined for him for these years and continued to love Russell for the rest of her life.

Russell began his published work in 1896 with ''[[Germany|German]] [[Social Democracy]]'', a study in politics that was an early indication of a lifelong interest in political and social theory. In 1896 he taught German social democracy at the [[London School of Economics]], where he also lectured on the science of power in the autumn of 1937.

Russell became a fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in [[1908]]. The first of three volumes of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (written with Whitehead) was published in [[1910]], which (along with the earlier [http://fair-use.org/bertrand-russell/the-principles-of-mathematics ''The Principles of Mathematics'']) soon made Russell world famous in his field.  In [[1911]] he became acquainted with the Austrian engineering student [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], whose genius he soon recognised (and whom he viewed as a successor who would continue his work on mathematical logic).  He spent hours dealing with Wittgenstein's various phobias and his frequent bouts of despair. The latter was often a drain on Russell's energy, but he continued to be fascinated by him and encouraged his [[academic]] development, including the publication of Wittgenstein's ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' in [[1922]].

During the [[First World War]], Russell engaged in pacifist activities, and in [[1916]] he was dismissed from [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] following his conviction under the [[Defence of the Realm Act]]. A later conviction resulted in six months' imprisonment in [[Brixton prison]] (see ''[[Bertrand Russell#Russell.27s activism|Activism]]'').

In [[1920]], Russell travelled to [[Russia]] as part of an official delegation sent by the British government to investigate the effects of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]]. Russell's lover [[Dora Black]] also visited Russia independently at the same time - she was enthusiastic about the revolution, but Russell's experiences destroyed his previous tentative support for it.

Russell subsequently lectured in [[Peking]] on philosophy for one year, accompanied by Dora. While in China, Russell became gravely ill with [[pneumonia]], and [[List of premature obituaries|incorrect reports]] of his death were published in the Japanese press. When the couple visited Japan on their return journey, Dora notified journalists that &quot;Mr Bertrand Russell, having died according to the Japanese press, is unable to give interviews to Japanese journalists&quot;.

On the couple's return to England in [[1921]], Dora was five months pregnant, and Russell arranged a hasty divorce from Alys, marrying Dora six days after the divorce was finalised. Their children were [[John Conrad Russell, 4th Earl Russell]] and [[Katharine Russell|Katharine Jane Russell]] (now Lady Katharine Tait). Russell supported himself during this time by writing popular books explaining matters of physics, ethics and [[education]] to the layman. Together with Dora, he also founded the experimental [[Beacon Hill School (England)|Beacon Hill School]] in [[1927]]. After he left the school in 1932, Dora continued it until 1943.

Upon the death of his elder brother Frank, in [[1931]], Russell became the 3rd Earl Russell. He once said that his [[title]] was primarily useful for securing [[hotel]] rooms.

Russell's marriage to Dora grew increasingly tenuous, and it reached a breaking point over her having two children with an American [[journalist]], [[Griffin Barry]]. In [[1936]], he took as his third wife an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] undergraduate named Patricia (&quot;Peter&quot;) Spence, who had been his children's [[governess]] since the summer of [[1930]]. Russell and Peter had one son, [[Conrad Russell, 5th Earl Russell|Conrad Sebastian Robert Russell]], later to become a prominent historian, and one of the leading figures in the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] party.

In the spring of [[1939]], Russell moved to [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] to lecture at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. He was appointed professor at the [[City College of New York]] in 1940, but after public outcries, the appointment was annulled by the [[court]]s: his [[radical]] opinions made him &quot;morally unfit&quot; to teach at the college. The protest was started by the mother of a student who would not have been eligible for his graduate-level course in abstract, mathematical logic. Many intellectuals, led by [[John Dewey]], protested his treatment. Dewey and [[Horace M. Kallen]] edited a collection of articles on the CCNY affair in ''[[The Bertrand Russell Case]]''. He soon joined the [[Barnes Foundation of Philadelphia|Barnes Foundation]], lecturing to a varied aud²) campus is adjacent to Columbia's [[Morningside Heights]] campus, and has been used by Barnard since [[1898]]. The neighborhood is sometimes called the [[Academic Acropolis]] because it is mostly on a hill, and is the location of [[Bank Street College of Education]], [[Columbia University]], [[Jewish Theological Seminary]], [[Manhattan School of Music]], [[Teachers College (Columbia University)]], and [[Union Theological Seminary]].
   
==General Information==
Barnard's original 1889 home was a rented [[brownstone]] at 343 Madison Avenue, where a faculty of six offered instruction to 14 students in the School of Arts, as well as to 22 “specials,” who lacked the entrance requirements in Greek and so enrolled in science.  In [[1900]], Barnard affiliated with [[Columbia University]], but it continued to be independently governed, while making available to its students the instruction, the library, and the degree of the University. Under the terms of the affiliation, Columbia University actually awards degrees to graduates of Barnard College.  Barnard College, in fact, was created for the female students of the University, which traditionally admitted only men.

The College gets its name from [[Frederick A.P. Barnard]] ([[1809]]-89), an American educator and mathematician, who served as then-Columbia College's president from [[1864]] to 1889.  Frederick Barnard advocated equal educational privileges for men and women (but preferably in a coeducational setting).  The school's founding, however, is largely due to the determined efforts of  [http://www.columbia.edu/~rr91/3567/sample_biographies/annie_nathan_meyer_McCaughey.htm Annie Nathan Meyer], a talented student and writer who was not satsified with what she saw as Columbia's half-hearted, token effort to educate women.

Meyer later wrote: &quot;I confess to a pride in having defended the affiliated college at a time when it was neither popular or understood. To me nothing in the education of women mattered so much as the creation of right standards, and this was effected by the establishment of the affiliated college. My faith was surely justified, for in 1891 I was happy to proclaim (to the Council of Women in Washington) as an established fact: 'Barnard College is Columbia.'&quot;

Barnard College was one of the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] founded to provide an education for women comparable to that of the [[Ivy League]] schools, which (with the exception of [[Cornell University]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]]) only admitted men for undergraduate study into the [[1960s]]. Barnard was the sister school of Columbia College, one of the [[undergraduate]] schools of Columbia University.  Columbia College began admitting women in 1983 after a decade of failed negotiations with Barnard for a [[merger]] along the lines of [[Harvard College]] and [[Radcliffe College]]. Today, Barnard is one of five Seven Sisters that remain single-sex in admissions.  The school's classes and activities, however, are open to all members of Columbia University, male or female, in a [http://www.barnard.columbia.edu/about/columbia.html reciprocal arrangement] to benefit the academic and social life of the entire University community. Nevertheless, some Columbia students and alumnae are unhappy with Barnard's association with Columbia University. As a result, Barnard students are a regular jest for Columbia students. Popular points of insult include the relative intelligence of a Barnard girl vs. a Columbia girl, the &quot;easiness&quot; of Barnard girls, and the typical Barnard girl's eagerness to associate herself with the Columbia name.

[[Image:Benedikt-von-nursia 1-500x600.jpg|thumb|right|St Benedict of Nursia (c. 480-543), detail from a [[fresco]] by [[Fra Angelico]], [[Saint Mark's Basilica|San Marco]], [[Florence]] (c. [[1400]]-[[1455]]).]]
The '''Order of Saint Benedict''' &amp;mdash; full [[Latin]] name: ''Ordo Sancti Benedicti'' , initials: '''OSB''' &amp;mdash; is a [[monastic]] [[order (religious)|order]] within the [[Roman Catholic Church]], sometimes referred to as the '''Benedictine Order''', where the [[Rule of St Benedict]] is observed, supplemented by later constitutions and modern customaries.  The monastery at [[Monte Cassino]] in Italy established by Saint [[Benedict of Nursia]] ca 529 was the first of the Benedictine monasteries. 

The order is fundamentally different from other Western religious orders:  there is no legal entity within the Church called the &quot;Order of St Benedict&quot;, run on similar lines with other Roman Catholic religious orders with their [[Generalate]]s and [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus|Superiors General]].  Rather, the various [[autonomous]] Houses (that is, communities) have formed themselves loosely into Congregations (for example, Cassinese, English, Solesmes, Subiaco, Camaldolese, Sylvestrines) that in turn are represented in the [[Benedictine Confederation]]. 

The Order of Saint Benedict does not include [[Benedictine]]s who are not Roman Catholic.

Benedictine monks, nowadays also referred to as brothers (monastic [[men]]) and nuns (monastic [[women]]) profess the three Benedictine Vows of ''Stability'' (to remain in the monastery), of ''Conversion of Manners'', and of ''Obedience'' (to the superior) in accordance with ch. 58.17 of the Rule of [[Saint]] [[Benedict of Nursia]]. Benedictines who are not members of the Consecrated Life (''i.e.'', [[Oblate (religion)|Oblate]]s) nevertheless endeavour to embrace the spirit of the Benedictine Vows in their own life in the world.

Within the Order of Saint Benedict, other orders that use the Rule of Saint Benedict and are generally considered to be of the Benedictine tradition are the [[Cistercian]]s, [[Bernardines]], and [[Benedictine Sisters of Grace and Compassion]], although these are not part of the [[Benedictine Confederation]].

The Benedictine motto is: ''pax'' (Latin: &quot;peace&quot;), traditionally also ''ora et labora'' (Latin: &quot;pray and work&quot;).

==Benedictines in popular culture and fiction==

* The film &quot;In This House of Brede&quot; (1975, TV), with Dame [[Diana Rigg]] in the lead role, presents a portrayal of the progress of a fictitious postulant.  The film was inspired by the 1969 novel of the same name written by Rumer Godden.
* Perhaps the most famous Benedictine monk in all fictiondom is [[Brother Cadfael]]. ([[Friar Tuck]] does not qualify for this distinction, as he was a [[Franciscan]].)  [[Edith Pargeter]], writing under the pen name Ellis Peters, created the character of Brother Cadfael as the [[detective]] [[hero]] of her series of [[medieval]] [[crime fiction|murder mysteries]] known as ''The Cadfael Chronicles''.
* Although the protagonist is a Franciscan, the [[Umberto Eco]] [[novel]] ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' is set in a fictional Benedictine monastery in [[Italy]].
* Samples of [[Chant|chanting]] Benedictine monks were used in the song ''I'm Dying'' by [[V.A.S.T.]], from their album ''[[Visual Audio Sensory Theater]]''.
* Joseph Knecht, the protagonist of [[Hermann Hesse]]'s novel ''[[The Glass Bead Game]]'', is sent as an ambassador of sorts to a Benedictine abbey for his first assignment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Beyazid I.jpg|frame|Bayezid I]]

''' Bayezid I ''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Bayezıt'', nicknamed ''Yıldırım'', &quot;the Thunderbolt&quot;; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: بايزيد الأول; ca [[1354]]&amp;ndash;[[1403]]) was the [[sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from [[1389]] to [[1402]]. He ascended to the throne following the assassination of his father [[Murad I]] and immediately had his younger brother [[Yakub]] strangled to prevent him from staging a coup. 

In revenge for the assassination of [[Murad I]] in the first [[Battle of Kosovo]], Bayezid massacred the [[Serbian]] prisoners responsible. He then took as a wife the daughter of the [[King]] of [[Serbia]], allying himself with Serbs and enabling his offspring to claim [[Serbia]] as a dynastic privilege. He appointed  [[Stephen Bulcovic]] as [[Serbian]] leader, and granted [[Serbia]] considerable autonomy. After this victory he started drinking alcohol but stopped after social unrest about his conduct.

In [[1391]] Bayezid laid siege to [[Constantinople]], the capital of the [[Byzantine empire]]. On the demand of the [[Byzantine]] emperor [[John V Palaeologus]] a new [[crusade]] was organized to defeat him. This proved unsuccessful: in [[1396]] the [[Christianity|Christian]] allies, under the leadership of the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] King and [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], were defeated in the [[Battle of Nicopolis]]. The siege of [[Constantinople]] thus continued, lasting until [[1401]]. At one point, the Emperor even fled from the city. Salvation for the [[Byzantine empire]], assaulted by Bayezid's Ottomans, came unexpectedly from the [[Mongol]] declaration of war on [[Bayezid]]. 

In [[1400]], the Central Asian warlord [[Timur Lenk]] had succeeded in rousing the local kingdoms that had been conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] to join him in his attack on [[Bayezid]]. In the fateful [[Battle of Ankara]], on [[July 20]], [[1402]], [[Bayezid]] was captured by [[Timur]].  His sons however escaped, and fled to [[Serbia]] until [[Timur]] died. Some contemporary reports claimed that [[Timur]] kept [[Bayezid]] chained in a cage as a trophy. Likewise, there are many stories about [[Bayezid]]'s captivity, including one that describes how [[Timur]] used him as a footstool. Another one describes how Timur made [[Bayezid]]'s [[Serbian]] wife dance naked at his court. However, these accounts are thought to be false, as writers from [[Timur]]'s court reported that [[Bayezid]] was treated well, and that [[Timur]] even mourned his death.  Likewise, [[Timur]]'s own history with other rulers demonstrated that he was true to his word when he later claimed to have aimed at re-establishing [[Bayezid]] on the [[Ottoman]] throne.  One year later, [[Bayezid]] died &amp;mdash; some accounts claim that he committed [[suicide]].

'''Bayezid II''' ([[1447]]/[[1448|48]] &amp;ndash; [[May 26]], [[1512]]) ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: بايزيد الثاني) was the [[sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from [[1481]] to [[1512]].

Bayezid was born in [[Demotika]] in [[Thrace]]. The son of [[Mehmed II]] the Conqueror, Bayezid ascended the Ottoman throne in 1481.  Like his father, Bayezid was a patron of western and eastern culture and unlike many other Sultans, worked hard to ensure a smooth running of domestic politics, which earned him the epithet of &quot;the Just&quot;.  Throughout his reign, Bayezid engaged in numerous campaigns to conquer the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]]-held despotate of [[Morea]], accurately defining this region as the key to future Ottoman naval power in the Eastern [[Mediterranean]].  The last of these wars ended in [[1501]] with Bayezid in control of the main citadels of [[Mistra]] and [[Monemvasia]].  

Bayezid's overriding concern was the quarrel with his brother [[Cem]], who claimed the throne and sought military backing from the [[Knights of St John]] in [[Rhodes]].  Eventually the Knights handed Cem over to [[Pope Clement VII]].  The Pope thought of using Cem as a tool to drive the Turks out of Europe, but as the Papal Crusade failed to come to fruition, Cem was left to fester and die in a Neapolitan prison.

Rebellions in the east, such as that of the [[Kizil Bash]], plagued much of Bayezid's reign and were often backed by the [[Shah]] of [[Iran|Persia]], [[Ismail of Persia|Ismail]], who was eager to promote [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'ism]] to undermine the authority of the Ottoman state. Ottoman authority in [[Anatolia]] was indeed seriously threatened during this period, and at one point Bayezid's grand [[vizier]], Ali Pasha, was killed in battle against rebels.

Bayezid also sent out the Ottoman navy to Spain in 1492 to safely bring Jews, who were fleeing the Spanish Inquisition, to Ottoman lands.

On [[September 14]], [[1509]], Constantinople was devastated by an earthquake. Bayezid's final years saw a succession battle between his sons [[Selim I|Selim]] and Ahmed.  Ahmed, the older of the two claimants had won a battle against the Karaman Turks and their Safavid allies in Asia Minor and now marched on [[Constantinople]] to exploit his triumph.  Fearing for his safety, Selim staged a revolt in Thrace but was defeated by Bayezid and forced to flee to the [[Crimea]] ([[1511]]).  At this point, Bayezid developed fears that Ahmed might in turn kill him to gain the throne and refused to allow his son to enter Constantinople.

Selim returned from the Crimea and, with support from the [[Janissary|Janissaries]], defeated and killed Ahmed. Bayezid then [[abdication|abdicated]] the throne on [[April 25]], [[1512]]. He departed for retirement in his native Demotika, but he died along the way, and is buried next to [[Bayezid Mosque]] in [[Istanbul]].

'''Boxing''', nicknamed the &quot;sweet science&quot; and also called '''pugilism''' or '''prizefighting''', is a sport where two participants of similar weight attack each other with their fists in a series of one to three-minute intervals called &quot;rounds&quot;. In both Amateur and Professional divisions, the combatants (called boxers or fighters) avoid their opponent's punches whilst trying to land punches of their own. Points are awarded for clean, solid blows to the legal area on the front of the opponent's body above the waistline, with hits to the head and torso especially valuable. The fighter with the most points after the scheduled number of rounds is declared the winner. Victory may also be achieved if the opponent is knocked down and unable get up before the referee counts to ten (a Knockout, or KO) or if the opponent is deemed too injured to continue (a Technical Knockout, or TKO).

==Origins==
[[Image:NAMA Akrotiri 2.jpg|thumb|200px|Youths boxing in a [[Minoan]] fresco on the Greek island of Santorini]]
Earliest evidence suggests that boxing was prevalent in North Africa during 4000 BC and the Mediterranean in 1500 BC.

A [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] ruler named Thesus, who ruled around 900 B.C., was entertained by men who would be seated in front of each other and beat another with their fists until one of them was killed. In time, the fighters fought on their feet and wore gloves (not padded) and wrappings on their arms below the elbows, but were otherwise naked when competing. First accepted as an Olympic sport (the ancient Greeks called it Pygme/ Pygmachia) in 688 BC, participants in the ancient games texpanded so that almost half of it is now within the city's political boundaries. [[Boston University]], now the city's second largest employer and one of the largest private universities in the country, was originally established in Vermont before moving to [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] and later to its present campus in the Back Bay in the 1950s. [[Harvard University]], the nation's oldest institution of higher learning, is based across the Charles River in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]; however, most of its current land holdings lie in Boston. These holdings include the [[Arnold Arboretum]], and its [[Harvard Business School|business]] and [[Harvard Medical School|medical]] schools. Harvard recently announced plans to expand its main campus across the Charles River into Boston's [[Allston, Boston, Massachusetts|Allston]] neighborhood, which already hosts some of the university's dormitories and sports facilities. The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) operates several major laboratories within the city. [[Emerson College]], a highly regarded arts &amp; communications school, maintains a campus near the Theatre District at the southwest corner of [[Boston Common]]. [[Northeastern University]], a large private university with a distinctive work/study program, maintains a campus in the Fenway district. [[Suffolk University]], a small private university known for its law school, maintains a campus on Beacon Hill. The city is also home to a number of conservatories and art schools, including the [[Massachusetts College of Art]], [[New England Conservatory]], [[Boston Conservatory]], and [[Berklee College of Music]].

===Primary and secondary schools===
Boston Public Schools, the oldest public school system in the U.S., enrolls 58,600 students from [[kindergarten]] to grade 12. The system operates 145 schools, which includes [[Boston Latin School]] (the oldest public school, established in 1635), [[English High]] (the oldest public [[high school]], established 1821), and Mather (the oldest public elementary school, established in 1639).{{ref|school}} The city also has private, parochial, and [[charter school]]s. 3000 students of racial minorities attend participating suburban schools through the Metropolitan Educational Opportunity Council, or METCO.

==Culture==
[[Image:Charles River Esplanade, Boston, Massachusetts.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A summer day on the [[Charles River esplanade]].]]
{{main|Culture in Boston, Massachusetts}}
Boston shares many cultural roots with greater [[New England]], including a dialect of the [[American English#Eastern New England|Eastern New England]] accent popularly known as [[Boston English]], and a [[New England cuisine|regional cuisine]] with a large emphasis on seafood and dairy products. [[Irish Americans|Irish Americans]] are a major influence on Boston's politics and religious institutions and consequently on the rest of Massachusetts. Italian, Chinese, and Hispanic groups also have major contributions to Boston's cultural composition. Boston has its own collection of [[neologism|neologisms]] known as [[Boston slang]].

Many consider Boston a highly cultured city, perhaps as a result of its intellectual reputation. Much of Boston's culture originates at its universities. The city also has a number of ornate theatres, including the [[Cutler Majestic Theatre]] and [[The Wang Center for the Performing Arts]]. Renowned performing arts groups include the [[Boston Ballet]], [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]], [[Boston Pops]], [[Boston Lyric Opera|Boston Lyric Opera Company]], and the [[Handel and Haydn Society]] (the oldest choral company in the United States). There are a number of major annual events such as [[First Night]], which occurs during [[New Year's Eve]], and several events during the [[Independence Day (US)|Fourth of July]]. These events include the weeklong Harborfest festivities and a Boston Pops concert accompanied by fireworks on the banks of the [[Charles River]].

[[Image:Faneuil Hall Boston MA USA.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Faneuil Hall]], looking at the east side]]
In contrast to what might be considered the more &quot;refined&quot; aspects of Boston's culture, the city is also one of the birthplaces of the [[hardcore punk]] genre of music. Boston musicians have contributed greatly to the [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] scene over the years (''see also [[Boston hardcore]]'').  Boston also had one of the leading local [[ska]] scenes in the ska revival of the mid-1990s with bands like [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]], [[The Allstonians]], and Skavoovie and the Epitones.

===Media===
{{main|Media in Boston, Massachusetts}}

''[[The Boston Globe]]'', owned by the [[New York Times Company]], and ''[[The Boston Herald]]'' are Boston's two major daily [[newspaper]]s. The city is also served by a number of smaller publications such as ''[[The Boston Phoenix]]'' and ''The Improper Bostonian''.

Boston has the largest broadcasting market in New England, with the Boston radio market being the eleventh largest in the United States.{{ref|radio}} Several major [[amplitude modulation|AM]] stations include [[talk radio]] [[WRKO|WRKO 680 AM]], [[sports radio|sports]]/talk station [[WEEI|WEEI 850 AM]], and news radio [[WBZ (AM)|WBZ 1030 AM]]. A variety of [[Frequency modulation|FM]] [[radio format|radio formats]] serve the area as well as [[National Public Radio|NPR]] stations [[WBUR]] and [[WGBH]]. University radio stations include [[WZBC]] (Boston College), [[WERS]] (Emerson), and [[WUMB]] (UMass Boston).

The Boston television [[Designated market area|DMA]], which also includes [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], is the fifth largest in the United States.{{ref|TV}} The city is served by stations representing every major [[List of United States broadcast television networks|American network]] including [[WBZ-TV|WBZ 4]] ([[CBS]]), [[WCVB-TV|WCVB 5]] ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]), [[WHDH-TV|WHDH 7]] ([[NBC]]), [[WFXT|WFXT 25]] ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]]), [[WSBK-TV|WSBK 38]] ([[UPN]]), and [[WLVI|WLVI 56]] ([[The WB Television Network|WB]]). Boston is also home to [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] station [[WGBH|WGBH 2]], which also operates [[WGBX|WGBX 44]]. WGBH is a major producer of PBS programs. Most Boston television stations have their transmitters in nearby [[Needham, Massachusetts|Needham]] and [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]].

===Sites of interest===
[[Image:FrogPondBostonCommon.JPG|thumb|250px|The Frog Pond in the Boston Common.]]
{{main|Sites of interest in Boston, Massachusetts}}

Because of the city's prominent role in the [[American Revolution]], several historic sites relating to that period are preserved as part of the [[Boston National Historical Park]]. Many are found along the [[Freedom Trail]], which is marked by a red line or bricks embedded in the ground. Also along the Freedom Trail is [[Boston Common]], with the [[Boston Public Garden]] being adjacent. Boston Common is part of the [[Emerald Necklace]], a string of parks designed by [[Frederick Law Olmstead]]. In the winter, the Frog Pond at Boston Common doubles as a popular ice-skating rink. Another major park is the [[Esplanade]] located along the banks of the [[Charles River]]. A major recreation site for many Bostonians, it is also the site of the [[Hatch Shell]]. Other parks are scattered throughout the city, with the major parks located near [[Castle Island]], Charlestown, the Dorchester shoreline, and East Boston.

[[Image:Boston Back Bay.jpg|thumb|250px|Back Bay]]
The [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] district includes many prominent landmarks such as the [[Church of Christ, Scientist|Christian Science Center]], [[Boston Public Library]], [[Copley Square]], and [[Newbury Street]]. Back Bay is also the home of two of New England's tallest buildings: the [[John Hancock Tower]] and the [[Prudential Center]].{{ref|Skyscraper}} Near the John Hancock Tower is the [[John Hancock Tower#The Berkeley Building (the &quot;old John Hancock Building&quot;)|old John Hancock Building]] with its prominent weather forecast beacon. Other notable districts/neighborhoods include [[Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Beacon Hill]], [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]], [[Chinatowns in North America#Massachusetts|Chinatown]], [[Downtown Crossing]], [[North End]], and [[South Boston]].

Boston is home to several world-renowned museums, including the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]], the [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]], and the [[Museum of Science, Boston|Museum of Science]]. The [[University of Massachusetts]] campus at Columbia Point houses the [[John F. Kennedy Library]]. The [[New England Aquarium]], [[Franklin Park Zoo]], [[Boston Athenaeum]] (one of the oldest independent libraries in the United States), and the [[Boston Children's Museum]] are located within the city.

There are also two self-guided walking tours: Harbor Walk, which is designed to allow people the walk the entire shore of [[Boston Harbor]], and the [[Black Heritage Trail]]. A popular guided tour is the Boston Duck Tour, which uses World War II-era [[DUKW|duck boat]]s. The outer suburbs of Boston, which tend to be forested, have vibrantly colored foliage every [[autumn#Autumn and tourism|autumn]] that attracts many tourists.

The [[TD Banknorth Garden]] (formerly called the Fleet Center) is near [[North Station (Boston)|North Station]] is the home of two major league teams: the [[Boston Bruins]] [[ice hockey]] team ([[National Hockey League]]) and the [[Boston Celtics]] [[basketball]] team ([[National Basketball Association]]). The Celtics have the distinction of having more World Championships than any other NBA team with 16 championships from 1957 to 1986.

The [[baseball]] team [[Boston Red Sox]] is a member of the [[American League]] of [[Major League Baseball]]. Their home at [[Fenway Park]], located near [[Kenmore Square]], is the oldest ballpark in active use in the United States. Boston was once the home of the [[National League]] baseball team [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]] as well as the site of the first [[World Series]] in 1903. The game was played between the Boston Americans (currently the Boston Red Sox) and the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]].{{ref|MLB}}

Once the [[Boston Patriots]], a charter team of the [[American Football League]], the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[New England Patriots]] [[American football|football]] team plays in nearby [[Foxborough, Massachusetts|Foxboro]]. Boston fans travel there to see the Patriots and the [[New England Revolution]] [[soccer]] team of [[Major League Soccer]]. Both teams play at [[Gillette Stadium]]. Another major league team is the [[lacrosse]] team [[Boston Cannons]] of [[Major League Lacrosse]]. The team plays at [[Boston University]]'s [[Nickerson Field]].

Boston's many colleges and universities field sports teams. The most prominent include [[Boston College]] (member of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]]), [[Boston University]] ([[America East Conference]]), [[Northeastern University, Boston|Northeastern University]] ([[Colonial Athletic Association]]), and [[Harvard University]]. The hockey teams of these four universities meet every year in an immensely popular four-team tournament known as the &quot;[[Beanpot]]&quot;. The city is also the site of two other major annual sporting events: the [[Boston Marathon]], the world-famous 26-mile run from [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts|Hopkinton]] to Copley Square in Boston, and the [[Head of the Charles Regatta]] rowing competition on the Charles River.

==Infrastructure==
===Health and medicine===
As the home to some of the world's most respected research [[hospital]]s, Boston enjoys an international reputation in the medical field. The [[Longwood Medical Area]] is a region of Boston with a concentration of medical and research facilities, including [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], [[Children's Hospital Boston|Children's Hospital]], [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]], and [[Harvard Medical School]]. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Brigham and Women's Hospital were both formed by mergers: the former between Beth Israel Hospital and New England Deaconess Hospital, and the latter by Peter Bent Brigham Hospital and the Boston Hospital for Women. [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] (MGH) is located near the Beacon Hill neighborhood, with the [[Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary]] and [[Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital]] nearby. Boston also has [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]] medical centers in the Jamaica Plain and West Roxbury neighborhoods.

Many of Boston's major medical facilities are associated with universities. The facilities in the Longwood Medical Area and MGH are world-renowned research medical centers affiliated with Harvard Medical School. New England Medical Center, located in the southern portions of the Chinatown neighborhood, is affiliated with [[Tufts University]]. Boston Medical Center, located in the South End neighborhood, is the primary teaching facility for the [[Boston University]] School of Medicine as well as the largest [[trauma center]] in the Boston area; it was formed by the merger of Boston University Hospital and Boston City Hospital.

===Transportation===

[[Logan International Airport]], located in the [[East Boston, Massachusetts|East Boston]] neighborhood, is the major airport serving Boston. Another airport serving the city and surrounding areas is [[Hanscom Field]] in [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]] and [[Bedford, Massachusetts|Bedford]]. [[T. F. Green Airport]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], and [[Manchester Airport (US)|Manchester Airport]] in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], are airports outside Massachusetts which serve as secondary facilities.

Boston's streets appear as though they were not planned, evolving from centuries-old foot and cow paths. Except for the reclaimed [[Back Bay, Boston, Massachusetts|Back Bay]] and part of [[South Boston, Massachusetts|South Boston]], the city has no [[Grid plan|street grid]]. Boston has been described as a &quot;City of Squares&quot;, referring to the tradition of naming the intersections of major thoroughfares after prominent city residents. Roads change names and lose and add lanes seemingly at random. The city also has a number of [[rotary intersection|rotaries]], which have confused many drivers. In its March 2006 issue, ''Bicycling'' magazine named Boston as one of the three worst cities in U.S. for cycling, though the city does have a huge cult following of the activity, especially fixed gear.

Boston is the eastern terminus of [[Interstate 90|I-90]], also known as the [[Massachusetts Turnpike|Mass Pike]]. [[Interstate 95|I-95]], which surrounds the city, is locally referred to by its historical state route numbering &amp;mdash; [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]]. [[U.S. Highway 1|US 1]] and [[Interstate 93|I-93]] runs north to south through the city. The most infamous portion, the [[Central Artery]], runs through downtown Boston and was constantly prone to heavy traffic. Through the [[Big Dig]] the elevated highway was replaced with an underground tunnel.

The [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA) operated the nation's first underground subway system, which has since been expanded to an extensive [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority#subway|rapid transit system]] reaching as far north as [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]], as far south as [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]], and as far west as [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]]. Collectively known as the &quot;T&quot;, the MBTA also operates an extensive network of [[MBTA Bus|bus lines]] and water shuttles, and a [[MBTA Commuter Rail|commuter rail]] network extending north to the [[Merrimack River]] valley, west to [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], and south to [[Providence, Rhode Island]].

Amtrak's [[Northeast Corridor]] and [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] lines originate at [[South Station (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority)|South Station]] and stop at [[Back Bay (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority)|Back Bay]]. Fast Northeast Corridor trains, which service [[New York City]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and points in between, also stop at [[Route 128 Station]] in the southwestern suburbs of Boston. Meanwhile, Amtrak's [[Downeaster]] service to [[Maine]] originates at [[North Station (Boston)|North Station]].

===Utilities===
Water supply and sewage-disposal services are provided by the [[Boston Water and Sewer Commission]]. The Commission in turn purchases wholesale water and sewage disposal from the [[Massachusetts Water Resources Authority]] (MWRA).  Established as a public authority in 1984, the MWRA pipes water from reservoirs in Western and Central Massachusetts, notably the [[Quabbin Reservoir|Quabbin]] and [[Wachusett Reservoir|Wachusett Reservoirs]], for several communities within Greater Boston. The agency operates several facilities for sewage treatment, notably an effluent tunnel in Boston Harbor and the Deer Island Wastewater Treatment Plant near the mouth of Boston Harbor.

[[NSTAR]] is the exclusive ''distributor'' of [[electric power]] to the city, though due to deregulation, customers now have a choice of electric ''generation'' companies. [[Natural gas]] is distributed by [[KeySpan Corporation]] (the successor company to Boston Gas); only commercial and industrial customers may choose an alternate natural gas supplier. [[Verizon]], successor to [[New England Telephone]], [[NYNEX]], and [[Bell Atlantic]], is the primary wired telephone service provider for the area. Phone service is also available from various [[List of United States mobile phone companies|national wireless companies]]. [[Cable television]] is available from [[Comcast]] and [[RCN]]. [[Broadband Internet access]] is provided by Comcast and RCN in certain areas. [[Satellite television]] is available from [[Dish Network]] and [[DirecTV]].  A variety of [[digital subscriber line|DSL]] providers and resellers are able to provide broadband Internet over Verizon-owned phone lines.

{{Template:Ancient Mesopotamia}}
'''Babylon''' is the Greek variant of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] '''Babilu''', an ancient city in [[Mesopotamia]] (Location: {{coor dms|32|32|11|N|44|25|15|E|}}, modern [[Al Hillah]],  [[Iraq]]). It was the &quot;holy city&quot; of [[Babylonia]] from around [[2300 BC]], and the seat of the [[Babylonia|Neo-Babylonian]] empire from [[612 BC]]. In tians&quot; was never used by the local Czech population. In Czech, the region was since early Middle Ages called only &quot;Čechy&quot; - Bohemia or &quot;Království české&quot; - Kingdom of Bohemia, and its mainly Czech-speaking inhabitants &quot;Češi&quot;. 

In other European vernaculars and in Latin (Bohemi) the word &quot;Bohemian&quot; or its derivates was used to designate all inhabitants of Bohemia. If the Czech ethnic origin was to be stressed, combinations like &quot;Bohemian of Bohemian language&quot;, &quot;a real Bohemian&quot; etc. were used.

It was not until the 19th century when other European languages started to use the word &quot;Czechs&quot; (in English), &quot;Tschechen&quot; (in German) or tchéques (in French) in a deliberate (and successful) attempt to distinguish between ethnic Czechs and other inhabitants of Bohemia. Nowadays &quot;Bohemians&quot; is still used when there is need to distinguish between inhabitants of the western part of the Czech Republic (Bohemia) and the eastern part ([[Moravia]]).

It is not clear how the word acquired its secondary meaning (see [[Bohemianism]] or [[Bohemian (disambiguation)]]), but it is believed that it comes from the French idea that [[Roma people|Gypsies]] originated from Bohemia (while they were travelling from there).

'''Bob Jones University''' ('''BJU''') is a [[private university|private]], [[school accreditation|unaccredited]], non-denominational, [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Protestant]] [[Fundamentalist Christianity|Fundamentalist]], [[liberal arts]] [[university]] located in [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]], [[South Carolina]].  Founded in 1927 by [[Bob Jones, Sr.]], an [[evangelist]] and revival-preacher, it is the largest private liberal arts university in South Carolina. The university is a candidate for accreditation with the [[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]]. The University has a reputation as one of the most strongly conservative and religious schools in the [[United States|USA]]. 

The current president of the University is [[Stephen Jones (BJU)|Stephen Jones]], son of previous school president [[Bob Jones III]] and the first president of the University not named &quot;Bob Jones.&quot; The university enrolls approximately 5000 students representing every state and 43 foreign countries, and employs a staff of 1,800.  It offers degrees in 126 majors, plus additional schools from [[kindergarten]] through 12th grade.  

Its mission statement reads as follows:  ''Within the cultural and academic soil of liberal arts education, Bob Jones University exists to grow Christlike character that is Scripturally disciplined; others-serving; God-loving; Christ-proclaiming; and focused Above.''

The school is also known for its strong connection to the [[anti-Catholic]]ism movement in [[Northern Ireland]], and anti-Catholic movements in general.

[[Interracial dating]] was prohibited at the university starting in the 1950's, but the ban was lifted in 2000 after Dr. [[Bob Jones III]], following a national uproar prompted by the visit of presidential candidate [[George W. Bush]], announced its nullification on [[Larry King Live]]. 

==Creed==
Students at BJU recite the ''University Creed'' at chapel services four days a week and at the worship service on Sunday.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe in the inspiration of the [[Bible]] (both the [[Old Testament|Old]] and the [[New Testament|New Testaments]]); the [[Creationism|creation]] of man by the direct act of [[God]]; the incarnation and virgin birth of our Lord and Savior, [[Jesus]] Christ; His identification as the Son of God; His vicarious atonement for the [[sin|sins]] of mankind by the shedding of His blood on the cross; the [[resurrection]] of His body from the tomb; His power to save men from sin; the new birth through the regeneration by the [[Holy Spirit]]; and the gift of eternal life by the grace of God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
BJU was founded in 1927 by evangelist [[Bob Jones, Sr.]], in [[College Point, Florida]]. Jones was the son of an [[Alabama]] [[sharecropper]]. His stated purpose was to create a [[school]] where Christian students could receive a high-quality education in a strongly traditional Christian environment. The following is a direct quotation from the BJU homepage:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Established in 1927 by evangelist Bob Jones Sr., Bob Jones University is known as the citadel of biblical Christianity for its adherence to the Bible as mankind's only source of faith and Christian practice. Throughout his travels, Dr. Bob Jones Sr. saw students whose faith was shaken during college, and he recognized the need for a thoroughly Christian school to train America's youth. His vision was to establish a training center for Christians from around the world that would be distinguished by its academic excellence, refined standards of behavior, and opportunities to appreciate the performing and visual arts. At the same time, Dr. Jones's intent was to make a place where Christ would be the center of all thought and conduct.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The school moved to [[Cleveland, Tennessee]] in 1933, and to its present campus in Greenville, South Carolina in 1947. The former [[Cleveland, Tennessee]] campus currently serves as the home for [[Lee University]] operated by the [[Church of God (Cleveland)|Church of God]], which has its headquarters in the same town.

From its 1927 founding to 1971, [[African American]] people were prohibited from enrolling. From 1971 to 1975, only married black people were permitted to apply to the school. After the 1975 court decision of ''[[McCrary v. Runyon]]'', which prohibited racial exclusion from private schools, the policy was changed. A person of any race could apply to the school, but the school adopted a disciplinary rule prohibiting interracial dating or marriage:

:There is to be no interracial dating.
:#Students who are partners in an interracial marriage will be expelled. [461 U.S. 574, 581]
:#Students who are members of or affiliated with any group or organization which holds as one of its goals or advocates interracial marriage will be expelled.
:#Students who date outside of their own race will be expelled.
:#Students who espouse, promote, or encourage others to violate the University's dating rules and regulations will be expelled.&quot;

The former policies of Bob Jones University on interracial dating are indebted to the founder's view that the Bible forbids interracial dating and marriage; though today Bob Jones University sometimes claims that the policy is a product of a (1950s) legal threat on the part of the parents of a male Asian student who threatened legal action after learning that their son &quot;nearly married&quot; a white girl. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/110/53.0.html] 

The school lost its [[US Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]] tax exemption in 1980 because of its anti-interracial dating policy.  The school appealed all the way to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], arguing that the school met the criteria for tax-exempt status on several counts, including that the school's racial discrimination was based on sincerely held religious beliefs. U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] supported the school's tax exempt status, but the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of the IRS in 1983 (see ''[[Bob Jones University v. United States]]'', 461 U.S. 574) and the school does not intend to seek tax-exempt status again.  

In 2000, following a national uproar prompted by the visit of presidential candidate George W. Bush, the policy was dropped entirely after some experimentation with a policy of parental consent for interracial dating.  

The school's attitude toward gay and lesbian people has often caused outrage.  In 1998, Wayne Mouritzen, a gay, 60-year-old alumnus, wrote seeking permission to come back to visit the school.  The dean of students wrote back: ''With grief we must tell you that as long as you are living as a homosexual, you, of course, would not be welcome on the campus and would be arrested for trespassing if you did. We take no delight in that action. Our greatest delight would be in your return to the Lord.'' [http://ctlibrary.com/1504]

==Academics==
The University is composed of six colleges and schools that offer over 125 undergraduate majors. Among these majors are fourteen &quot;trade school&quot; programs that range from [[aircraft]] management to [[cosmetology]]. Classes are also offered by correspondence and  through the University's live, interactive [[satellite]] system.

The University is currently a candidate for [[School accreditation|accreditation]] through the [[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]][http://www.tracs.org], which means that it has the potential to become accredited during the prescribed five year period but there is no guarantee that it will become accredited. Nonetheless, &quot;School officials say they still won't accept federal student financial aid.&quot;[http://www.wciv.com/news/stories/0405/223962.html]

BJU also operates the ''[[Bob Jones University Press]]'', one of the two major publishers of curriculum for K-12 Christian schools in America (the other being [[A Beka Book]]s, which is affiliated with [[Pensacola Christian College]]).

==Extracurriculars==
The University has intramural sports programs in many different fields including [[soccer]], [[basketball]], [[softball]], [[athletics|track]], [[volleyball]], [[tennis]], [[badminton]], and [[table tennis]]. The highlight of the sports season is the Turkey Bowl, where the top two societies (the University's version of [[fraternities]] and [[sororities]]) compete in a soccer match before the Thanksgiving Break.

The University also competes in intercollegiate [[debate]] in the [[National Educational Debate Association]] and from time to time places very highly in their competitions.

==Achievements==
*In May 2004, its high school, Bob Jones Academy, won the [[National High School Mock Trial Championship]] [http://www.nationalmocktrial.org/results2004.cfm].
*On [[December 3]], [[2004]], the school broke the [[Guinness Book of Records|Guinness World Record]] for [[Christmas carol]]ing with 7,514 carolers.
*On [[April 2]], [[2005]], the school won the [[National Educational Debate Association|NEDA]] Debate [[List of NEDA Tournament Results|Nationals Tournament]], defeating [[Ball State University]] 2-1 in Varsity and 3-0 in Novice, and also taking 1st place Varsity Speaker.

==Art gallery==
[[Bob Jones, Jr.]], son of the founder, had an interest in art depicting scenes from the [[Bible]], especially those which had a highly illustrative nature rather than those relying on symbols.  He began collecting after [[World War II]], and concentrated on Italian [[Baroque]] painters.  This style was out of favor in the mid-20th century and the works were relatively inexpensive, and Jones built up an important collection.  He donated his paintings to a museum at the University. The [http://www.bjumg.org BJU Museum &amp; Gallery] now is now one of the largest collections of religious art in the Western Hemisphere.

==Controversial national recognition==
Largely due to the national attention received after the scuffle with the [[IRS]] and its ban on interracial dating, the school has been seen as a racist institution. The school has a number of international students and participates in the [[National Educational Debate Association]] intercollegiate debate format, a small association with a closed membership policy, not recognized by the mainstream [[American Forensic Association]].

===Biology===
The BJU [[biology]] department proclaims its support for [[creationism]].  Its Department of Biology's website states:
:Although Bob Jones University is primarily a teaching institution, the members of the science faculty have a long tradition of speaking, writing, and doing research related to defending the Bible's account of creation.

==Rules for students==
Bob Jones has a notably strict series of rules governing life while at the university. [http://www.bju.edu/prospective/expect/general.html][http://www.bju.edu/prospective/expect/dress.html][http://www.bju.edu/prospective/expect/rhall.html] As previously described, some of the rules have been retracted for various reasons throughout the schools history. The school asserts that its rules are in line with several other Fundamentalist Christian universities.

Such commentators as ''[[Christianity Today]]'' have argued that BJU focuses on rules rather than principles, saying that, &quot;a recent BJU handbook prohibits students from promoting Calvinism or Arminianism, speaking in tongues, wearing beards, and listening to music recorded after 1960.&quot; (Incidentally, BJU does not forbid its students to listen to music recorded after the 1960s. In fact, the University choral and instrumental groups perform contemporary music, and SoundForth, BJU’s recording label, regularly releases CDs containing music composed in the twenty-first century.) According to the Boston Globe, BJU has a reputation for stringent rules even among other  Christian colleges:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If you ask a student at non-fundamentalist evangelical schools like Wheaton in Illinois or Gordon in Wenham, Mass, what they think of Bob Jones, you will get looks of horror far worse than you'll get from secular kids — along with questions about whether Bob Jones really has separate pink and blue sidewalks for men and women. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2002/141/12.0.html]&lt;/blockquote&gt; One college administrator has stated that the institution's unchanging ways are like &quot;stroking the cat in the wrong direction.&quot; [http://www.kentucky.com/mld/kentucky/living/religion/12251675.htm]

While all these rules are based on the opinions of BJU, one rule directly mentions a specific company in relation to BJU dress code.  According to BJU, students are prohibited from wearing any clothing displaying logos from [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]] due to what BJU perceives as &quot;antagonism to the name of Christ&quot; and &quot;wickedness&quot; in their advertising.  

====General rules====
*[[Curfew]] is at 10:25 pm and all lights must be out by 12 am. BJU say this curfew aids safety for students and also helps to ensure that they get some needed sleep while they are at college. 
*Residence Hall Students are required to sign out when they leave campus, largely as a measure of safety.  This rule does not apply to male students with Junior and Senior privileges, who are free to leave without signing out between the hours of 7 am and 7 pm.  
*Unfiltered [[Wireless network|wireless internet access]] via computer, [[mobile phone]], or [[satellite phone]] is prohibited.  However, the university provides [[Censorware|content-filtered]] [[Wireless campus|Wi-fi service for student use]]. The filter blocks pornography and other &quot;objectionable content.&quot;
*Students are provided with an individual [[E-mail|email]] account which is filtered through the campus email system to prevent [[internet pornography|questionable content]]. BJU say this filtered email system is consistent with the practice of many major banks and other businesses.
*DVD/VCRs are not allowed in residence halls; [[DVD player]]s as part of computer systems cannot be used for watching films. [[Television]]s may be used only as monitors for [[video game console]]s.
*Students in [[residence halls]] are not allowed to watch any [[film]]s with a rating higher than a [[Motion Picture Association of America|G rating]] when visiting local homes and are forbidden from visiting [[Movie theater|cinemas]].  Additionally, students are not permitted to play, use, or own [[Computer and video games|video games]] that are rated [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|T, M, or Ao]], or that have any kind of [[profanity]], sensual or suggestive dress, rock music, blood and gore, or demonic themes.
*The University has strict rules regarding music: [[Country music|Country]], [[Jazz]], [[New Age music|New Age]], [[Rock (music)|Rock]], [[Rap]], and [[Contemporary Christian music]] are all off-limits to BJU students.
*Movie, music, and fashion posters are prohibited.
*Sexual relations between unmarried students, if discovered, is an expulsion offense.
*Possessing or distributing pornography is an expulsion offense. Some think that magazines of any kind showing any pictures of females are prohibited on the campus, but this rule does not exist.
*[[Weapon]]s of any kind must be stored by the University. [[Pistol]]s must have [[trigger lock]]s.  No [[firework]]s are allowed at any time.

====Work====
*  Students are permitted to work until 10:25 pm on weekdays and 12 am on weekends. 
* Freshmen and sophomores are not permitted to use vehicles in order to [[Commuting|commute]] to and from work because parking on campus is limited. 
* [[Solicitation]] by students in the Greenville area is forbidden. All students are required to have a retail license or permission from the [[Dean of Students]] to solicit services door to door.

====Male dress code====
*Men's hair is required to be traditionally styled with a conservative cut.  Hair must not be colored or highlighted and is not permitted to be shaved, shelved, tangled or spiked.
*Sideburns may not reach past the lower opening of the ear.  It is recommended that men be clean-shaven at all times. 
*Men may not wear earrings, necklaces, or bracelets of any kind. 
*No hats are allowed indoors except in the gymnasium. 
*Tattoos and body piercings are forbidden.
*The University will not allow articles of any kind to display the logos of [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]] and its subsidiary [[Hollister Co.|Hollister]]. These items may not be carried or displayed, even if the logos are hidden.
*Morning dress consists of the following: dress shirt (no denim or chambray) with tie, dress or ironed casual pants (no jeans, cargo, carpenter, or sloppy pants), dress or leather casual shoes. Sweaters should show shirt collar and tie knot.  No sweatshirts are allowed.
*Afternoon dress will include a collared shirt (no crew necks), neat casual pants, dress or casual shoes (no slippers or sandals).  Socks should be above the ankle, and sweatshirts or sweaters are permitted.
*Sunday dress requires a coat, tie, dress shirt, dress shoes, dress or dressier casual pants.
*Recreation and work dress may include jeans and t-shirts.  Sleeveless athletic shirts may be worn during indoor activities only.  Shorts may be worn at athletic facilities but not as spectators at sporting events.  Socks are required at all times.
**BJU say the goal of these guidelines for dress is a neat and professional look for students while they are at school.

====Female dress code====
General and classroom dress for women consists of a [[dress]] or top and [[skirt]].  Pants are allowed for some recreational activities.  Women may never wear [[shorts]] outside the residence halls and fitness center.

*Underwear
**Colored underwear should not be visible through outer clothing. For instance, a student should not pair a nt]].  This rule further helped in the preservation of works since writing platforms of vellum and papyrus and methods of reproduction was not cheap.  The title of ''canon'' placed on a work meant that it would be more easily preserved for future generations.  In modern times, a [[Western canon]] was collated that defined the best of [[Western culture]]. 

At the Alexandrian Library, the ancient scholars coined another term for canonized authors, ''hoi enkrithentes''; &quot;the admitted&quot; or &quot;the included&quot;. 

Classical studies incorporate a certain type of methodology. The Rule of the classical world and of Christian culture and society was Philo's rule: 
:&quot;Philo's rule dominated Greek culture, from Homer to Neo-Platonism and the Christian Fathers of late antiquity. The rule is: &quot;&amp;mu;&amp;epsilon;&amp;tau;&amp;alpha;&amp;chi;&amp;alpha;&amp;rho;&amp;alpha;&amp;tau;&amp;tau;&amp;epsilon; &amp;tau;&amp;omicron; &amp;theta;&amp;epsilon;&amp;iota;&amp;omicron;&amp;nu; &amp;nu;&amp;omicron;&amp;mu;&amp;iota;&amp;sigma;&amp;mu;&amp;alpha;&quot; (&quot;metacharatte to theion nomisma&quot;). It is the law of strict continuity. We preserve and do not throw away words or ideas. Words and ideas may grow in meaning but must stay within the limits of the original meaning and concept that the word has.&quot; 

Classical education was considered the best training for implanting the life of moral excellence [[arete (excellence)|arete]], hence a good citizen.  It furnished students with intellectual and aesthetic appreciation for &quot;the best which has been thought and said in the world&quot;.  Copleston, an Oxford classicist said that classical education &quot;communicates to the mind...a high sense of honour, a disdain of death in a good cause, (and) a passionate devotion to the welfare of one's country&quot;.  [[Cicero]] commented, &quot;All literature, all philosophical treatises, all the voices of antiquity are full of examples for imitation, which would all lie unseen in darkness without the light of literature&quot;.

At [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] Classics is known as ''[[Literae Humaniores]]'', comprising the study of Ancient Greek and Latin language and literature, Greek and Roman art and archaeology, history and philosophy. It is sometimes known as '''Greats''' after the nickname for the final examinations.

==Quotations==
*&quot;Nor can I do better, in conclusion, than impress upon you the study of Greek literature, which not only elevates above the vulgar herd but leads not infrequently to positions of considerable emolument.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;Thomas Gaisford, Christmas sermon, Christ Church, Oxford.

'''Chemistry''' (derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''kimia'', [[alchemy]], where ''al'' is Arabic for ''the'') is the [[science]] that deals with the [[Chemical property|properties]] of organic and inorganic [[chemical substance|substance]]s and their interactions with other [[organic compound|organic]] and [[inorganic]] substances. In the study of [[matter]], chemistry also investigates the movement of [[electron]]s (see [[energy]], [[physics]], [[biology]]). Because of the diversity of matter, which is mostly composed of different combinations of [[atom|atoms]], chemists often study how atoms of different [[chemical element]]s interact to form [[molecules]] and how molecules interact with each other.
[[Image:Chemistry.jpg|right|thumb|Multicolored chemicals are frequent hallmarks of chemistry ]]

==Introduction==
Chemistry is often called the central science because it connects other sciences together, such as [[physics]], [[biology]] or [[geology]]. Chemistry encompasses many specific specialized sub-disciplines that often overlap with significant portions of other sciences. Sub-disciplines, however, are very specific -- to chemistry, for example, they allow the manufacturing and testing of stronger materials, the synthesis of [[pharmaceuticals]] to treat disease, and determination of the mechanisms behind life processes.

A fundamental component of chemistry is that matter is involved. Chemistry may involve the interaction of matter with matter, or, involve matter with non-material phenomena such as energy. Most central and traditional to chemistry is the interaction of one [[chemical substance|substance]] with another such as in a  [[chemical reaction]] where one substance or substances is transformed into another. This may involve [[electromagnetic radiation]] (as in [[photochemistry]]) where a chemical reaction is driven by the stimulation of light. However the chemical reaction is only part of a larger field that also studies matter in other ways. Chemical spectroscopists for example study the interaction of light with matter often without any reaction occuring.

[[Scientists]] who profess chemistry are known as [[chemists]]. According to contemporary chemists all ordinary matter consists of [[atom|atoms]] or the sub atomic components that make up atoms. Atoms may be combined to produce more complex forms of matter such as [[ion|ions]], [[molecule]]s or [[crystal]]s. The structure of the world we commonly experience and the properties of the matter we commonly interact with is determined by properties of chemical substances and their interactions. [[Steel]] is hard because its atoms are bound together in a crystalline lattice. Wood burns because it can react spontaneously with [[oxygen]] in a chemical reaction above a certain [[temperature]]. [[Water]] is a [[liquid]] at room temperature because its molecules move about more than in a solid but less than in a gas.  One can see because of the interaction of light with molecules called [[proteins]] in the back of one's eye.

With such a large area of study, it is impossible to know everything about chemistry and very difficult to summarize the field concisely. Even the most knowledgeable, experienced chemist only knows a very narrow area of chemistry better than others, though most chemists have a general knowledge of many areas of chemistry. Chemistry is divided into many areas of study called sub-disciplines in which chemists specialize. The chemistry taught at the high school or early college level is often called &quot;general chemistry&quot; and is intended to be an introduction to a wide variety of fundamental concepts and to give the student the tools to continue on to more advanced subjects. Many concepts presented at this level are often incomplete and technically inaccurate, yet they are of extraordinary utility. Chemists regularly use these simple, elegant tools and explanations in their work because the best solution possible is often so overwhelmingly difficult and the true solution is usually unobtainable.

The science of chemistry is historically a recent development but has its roots in [[alchemy]] which has been practiced for millennia throughout the world. The word chemistry is directly derived from the word alchemy; however, the etymology of alchemy is unclear (see [[alchemy]]).

==History of chemistry==
''Main article'': [[History of chemistry]]

The roots of chemistry can be traced to the phenomenon of [[combustion|burning]]. [[Fire]] was a mystical force that transformed one substance into another and thus was of primary interest to mankind. It was fire that led to the discovery of [[iron]] and [[glass]]. After [[gold]] was discovered and became a precious metal, many people were interested to find a method that could convert other substances into gold. This led to the [[protoscience]] called [[Alchemy]]. Alchemists discovered many chemical [[processes]] that led to the development of modern chemistry. Chemistry as we know it today, was invented by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] with his law of [[Conservation of mass]] in 1783. The [[discoveries of the chemical elements]] has a long history culminating in the creation of the [[periodic table]] by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]]. The [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] created in 1901 gives an excellent overview of chemical discovery in the past 100 years.

==Chemical phenomena==
A chemical phenomenon is a phenomenon that is describable by chemistry and involves [[chemical substance|substances]] and [[energy]]. Chemical phenomena are associated with a change in the properties of the substance as a result of a chemical reaction.
[[Fire]] is undoubtedly the most spectacular chemical phenomenon. Chemists strive to explain all known chemical phenomena, to discover others and group chemical phenomena into classes with common causes or effects. For example, substances that react with oxygen to produce other substances are said to undergo oxidation; similarly a group of substances called [[acid]]s or [[alkali]]s can react with one another to neutralize each other's  effect, a phenomenon known as [[neutralization]]. [[chemical substance|Substances]] can also be [[chemical decomposition|dissociated]] or synthesized from other substances by various different chemical [[processes]]. A chemical reaction is often accompanied by evolution or absorption of energy, this phenomenon is studied under a subdiscipline of chemistry called [[chemical thermodynamics]]/ [[thermochemistry]]. Similarly certain substances emit light without being heated, a phenomenon known as [[phosphorescence]].

==Subdisciplines of chemistry==
Chemistry typically is divided into several major sub-disciplines. There are also several main cross-disciplinary and more specialized fields of chemistry.

*[[Analytical chemistry]] is the [[analysis]] of material samples to gain an understanding of their [[chemical composition]] and [[structure]]. Analytical chemistry incorporates standardized experimental methods in chemistry. These methods may be used in all subdiciplines of chemistry, excluding purely theoretical chemistry.

*[[Biochemistry]] is the study of the [[chemical compound|chemicals]], [[chemical reaction]]s and chemical [[interaction]]s that take place in living [[organism]]s. Biochemistry and organic chemistry are closely related f.e. in [[medicinal chemistry]]. 

*[[Inorganic chemistry]] is the study of the properties and reactions of inorganic compounds. The distinction between organic and inorganic disciplines is not absolute and there is much overlap, most importantly in the sub-discipline of [[organometallic chemistry]].

*[[Organic chemistry]] is the study of the structure, properties, composition, mechanisms, and [[chemical reaction|reactions]] of [[organic compound]]s. 

*[[Physical chemistry]] is the study of the physical basis of chemical systems and processes.  In particular, the energetics and dynamics of such systems and processes are of interest to physical chemists.  Important areas of study include [[chemical thermodynamics]], [[chemical kinetics]], [[electrochemistry]], [[statistical mechanics]], and [[spectroscopy]].  Physical chemistry has large overlap with [[molecular physics]]. Physical chemistry involves the use of [[calculus]] in deriving equations.

*[[Theoretical chemistry]] is the study of chemistry via theoretical reasoning (usually within [[mathematics]] or [[physics]]).  In particular the application of [[quantum mechanics]] to chemistry is called [[quantum chemistry]].  Since the end of the second world war, the development of computers has allowed a systematic development of [[computational chemistry]], which is the art of developing and applying [[computer program]]s for solving chemical problems.  Theoretical chemistry has large overlap with [[molecular physics]].
  
Other fields are [[Astrochemistry]], [[Atmospheric chemistry]], [[Chemical Engineering]], [[Chemo-informatics]], [[Electrochemistry]], [[Environmental chemistry]], [[Geochemistry]], [[Green chemistry]], [[History of chemistry]], [[Materials science]], [[Medicinal chemistry]], [[Molecular Biology]], [[Molecular genetics]], [[Nanotechnology]],[[Nuclear chemistry]], [[Organometallic chemistry]], [[Petrochemistry]], [[Pharmacology]], [[Photochemistry]], [[Phytochemistry]], [[Polymer chemistry]], [[Supramolecular chemistry]], [[Surface chemistry]], and [[Thermochemistry]].

==Fundamental concepts==
'''Nomenclature'''

''Main article: [[IUPAC nomenclature]]''

Nomenclature refers to the system for naming [[chemical compound]]s. There are well-defined systems in place for naming chemical species. [[Organic compound]]s are named according to the [[organic nomenclature]] system. [[Inorganic compound]]s are named according to the [[inorganic nomenclature]] system. 

'''Atoms'''

''Main article: [[Atom]]''

An ''atom'' is a collection of matter consisting of a positively charged core (the [[atomic nucleus]]) which contains [[protons]] and [[neutrons]], and which maintains a number of [[electron]]s to balance the positive charge in the nucleus.

'''Elements'''

''Main article: [[Chemical element]]''

An ''element'' is a class of atoms which have the same number of [[proton]]s in the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. This number is known as the [[atomic number]] of the element. For example, all atoms with 6 protons in their nuclei are atoms of the chemical element [[carbon]], and all atoms with 92 protons in their nuclei are atoms of the element [[uranium]].

The most convenient presentation of the elements is in the [[periodic table]], which groups elements with similar chemical properties together. Lists of the elements [[List of elements by name|by name]], [[List of elements by symbol|by symbol]], and by [[List of elements by number|atomic number]] are also available. In addition elements have many [[isotope]]s.

'''Compounds'''

''Main article: [[Chemical compound]]''

A ''compound'' is a substance with a ''fixed ratio'' of [[chemical element]]s which determines the composition, and a particular organization which determines chemical properties. For example, [[water (molecule)|water]] is a compound containing [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] in the ratio of two to one, with the Oxygen between the hydrogens, and an angle of 104.5° between them. Compounds are formed and interconverted by [[chemical reaction]]s.

'''Molecules'''

''Main article: [[Molecule]]''

A ''molecule'' is the smallest indivisible portion of a pure [[Chemical compound|compound]] or [[chemical element|element]] that retains a set of unique chemical properties.  A molecule consists of two or more [[atom]]s covalently [[Chemical bond|bonded]] together.

'''Ions'''

''Main article: [[Ion (physics)|Ion]]''

An ''ion'' is a charged species, or an atom or a molecule that has lost or gained an electron. Positively charged [[cations]] (e.g. [[sodium]] cation Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and negatively charged [[anions]] (e.g. [[chloride]] Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) can form neutral [[Salt|salts]] (e.g. [[sodium chloride]] NaCl). Examples of [[polyatomic ion]]s that do not split up during [[Acid-base reaction theories|acid-base reactions]] are [[hydroxide]] (OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;), or [[phosphate]] (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt;).

'''Substance'''

''Main article: [[Chemical substance]]''

A chemical substance can be an element, compound or a mixture of compounds, elements or compounds and elements. Most of the matter we encounter in our daily life are one or another kind of mixtures, e.g. [[Earth's atmosphere|air]], [[alloy]]s, [[biomass]] etc.

'''Bonding'''

''Main article: [[Chemical bond]]''

A ''chemical bond'' is an [[interaction]] which holds together [[atom]]s in [[molecule]]s or [[crystal]]s. In many simple compounds, [[valence bond theory]] and the concept of [[oxidation number]] can be used to predict molecular structure and composition. Similarly, theories from [[classical physics]] can be used to predict many ionic structures. With more complicated compounds, such as [[complex (chemistry) | metal complexes]], valence bond theory fails and alternative approaches which are based on [[quantum chemistry]], such as [[molecular orbital]] theory, are necessary.

'''States of matter'''

''Main article: [[Phase (matter)]]''

A ''phase'' is a [[set]] of states of a chemical system that have similar bulk structural properties, over a range of conditions, such as [[pressure]] or [[temperature]].  Physical properties, such as [[density]] and [[refractive index]] tend to fall within values characteristic of the phase.  The phase of matter is defined by the ''[[phase transition]]'', which is when energy put into or taken out of the system goes into rearranging the structure of the system, instead of changing the bulk conditions.

Sometimes the distinction between phases can be continuous instead of having a discrete boundary, in this case the matter is considered to be in a [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]] state.  When three states meet based on the conditions, it is known as a [[triple point]] and since this is invariant, it is a convenient way to define a set of conditions.

The most familiar examples of phases are [[solid]]s, [[liquid]]s, and [[gas]]es. Less familiar phases include [[Plasma physics|plasma]]s, [[Bose-Einstein condensate]]s and [[fermionic condensate]]s and the [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] and [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] phases of [[magnet]]ic materials.  Even the familiar [[ice]] has many different phases, depending on the pressure and temperature of the system.  While most familiar phases deal with three-dimensional systems, it is also possible to define analogs in two-dimensional systems, which is getting a lot of attention because of its relevance to [[biology]].

'''Chemical reactions'''

''Main article: [[Chemical reaction]]''

''Chemical reactions'' are transformations in the fine [[structure]] of [[molecule]]s.  Such reactions can result in molecules attaching to each other to form larger molecules, molecules breaking apart to form two or more smaller molecules, or rearrangement of [[atom]]s within or across molecules. Chemical reactions usually involve the making or breaking of [[chemical bond]]s.

'''Quantum chemistry'''

''Main article: [[Quantum chemistry]]''

''Quantum chemistry'' describes the behavior of [[matter]] at the [[molecule | molecular]] scale. It is, in principle, possible to describe all chemical systems using this theory. In practice, only the simplest chemical systems may realistically be investigated in purely [[quantum mechanics | quantum mechanical]] terms, and approximations must be made for most practical purposes (e.g., [[Hartree-Fock]], [[post Hartree-Fock]] or [[Density functional theory]], see [[computational chemistry]] for more details). Hence a detailed understanding of [[quantum mechanics]] is not necessary for most chemistry, as the important implications of the theory (principally the [[atomic orbital|orbital approximation]]) can be understood and applied in simpler terms.

'''Chemical Laws'''

''Main article:'' [[Chemical law]]

The most fundamental concept in chemistry is the [[law of conservation of mass]], which states that there is no detectable change in the quantity of matter during an ordinary [[chemical reaction]]. Modern physics shows that it is actually [[energy]] that is conserved, and  subjects.

Since the colleges are all fully independent legal entities owning their own buildings, employing their own staff, and managing their own endowments, colleges vary widely in wealth. It is entirely possible for some colleges to be in better financial health than the universities of which they are a part.

Typically a student or fellow of an Oxbridge college is said to be &quot;living in college&quot; if their accommodation is inside the college buildings. Most colleges also accommodate students in houses or other buildings away from the college site.

====University of Durham====

The [[University of Durham]] is also collegiate in nature, and its colleges enjoy the same legal status as 'listed bodies' as the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge.  Generally, however, its colleges are not financially independent and do not have any teaching duties as part of the university, though they do provide meals, libraries, computers, and recreational facilities for their members. In many ways, colleges at the [[University of Durham]] have a similar function to what a traditional Hall of Residence has at many other universities.

====University of Edinburgh====

The [[University of Edinburgh]] recently restructured and created colleges along [[academic]] lines merging the old Faculties into larger bodies, and devolving control for most matters to academic schools.

====University of St Andrews====

The [[University of St Andrews]] is legally a collegiate university, having two colleges: the [[United College, St Andrews|United College of St Salvator and St Leonard]] and [[St Mary's College, St Andrews|St Mary's College]]. However, each college exists in name only and the power they once held is now vested in the [[Academic Senate]] and the Faculties of Arts, Divinity, Medicine and Science.

====University of Wales====

In the [[University of Wales]], colleges are the lower tier of institutional membership, below constituent institutions, following the reorganisation of the university in [[1996]].  Prior to this, the member institutions were all called colleges.  There are not currently any colleges in the University of Wales, but this is likely to change in the future.

====New Universities====

Three of the [[New Universities]], [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]], [[University of York|York]] and [[University of Kent|Kent]], have a similar system, although their colleges lack the legal status of those at Durham and Oxbridge. Officially, the [[University of London]] consists of a number of colleges. However, the federation has always been even looser there than at Oxford or Cambridge, to the extent that each of these &quot;colleges&quot; is essentially an independent university-level institution.

== United States of America==
By contrast to British usage, in [[American English]] the term &quot;college&quot; is generally reserved for institutions of higher education, which are often totally independent and fully empowered to grant degrees. The usual practice in America today is to call an institution made up of several faculties and granting a range of higher degrees a &quot;university&quot; while a smaller institution only granting [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] or [[Associate's degree|associate's degrees]] is called a &quot;college&quot;. (See [[liberal arts colleges]], [[community college]]). Nevertheless, a few of America's most prestigious universities, such as [[Boston College]], [[Dartmouth College]] and the [[College of William and Mary]], have retained the term &quot;college&quot; in their names for historical reasons though they offer a wide range of higher degrees.  This problem led, in part, to the threatened lawsuit between [[Yale College Wrexham]] (equivalent to an American &quot;[[high school]]&quot;) and [[Yale University]], the latter claiming copyright infringement. 

[[Image:Belushi in Animal House.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Belushi]] played &quot;Bluto&quot;, a stereotypical American college student in the 1978 film ''[[Animal House]]'']]

Usage of the terms varies among the [[U.S. state|states]], each of which operates its own institutions and licenses private ones. In [[1996]] for example, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] changed all of its four-year colleges to universities, and all of its [[vocational]] [[technology]] [[school]]s to [[technical college]]s. (Previously, only the four [[research]] institutions were called universities.) Other states have changed the [[name]]s of individual colleges, many having started as a [[teacher]]s' college or [[vocational school]] (such as an A&amp;M &amp;mdash; an [[agricultural]] and [[mechanical]] school) that ended up as a full-fledged [[state university]].

It should be noted, too, that &quot;university&quot; and &quot;college&quot; do not exhaust all possible titles for an American institution of higher education. Other options include &quot;institute&quot;, &quot;academy&quot;, &quot;union,&quot; and &quot;school&quot; as in the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]], [[Cooper Union]], or the [[Juilliard School]].

The term ''college'' is also, as in Britain, used for a constituent semi-autonomous part of a larger university but generally organized on academic rather than residential lines. For example, at many institutions,  the undergraduate portion of the university can be briefly referred to as '''the college''' (such as The College at [[Brown University|Brown]] or [[Harvard College]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]]) while at others each of the faculties may be called a &quot;college&quot; (the &quot;college of engineering&quot;, the &quot;college of nursing&quot;, and so forth). Some American universities, such as [[Rice University|Rice]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Yale University|Yale]], do have [[residential college|residential colleges]] along the lines of Oxford or Cambridge, but the name was clearly adopted in homage to the British system. Unlike the Oxbridge colleges, these residential colleges are not autonomous legal entities nor are they typically much involved in education itself, being primarily concerned with room, board, and social life. At the [[University of California, San Diego]], however, each of the six residential colleges does teach its own core writing courses and has its own distinctive set of graduation requirements.

===The origin of America's usage===
The founders of the first institutions of higher education in the United States were graduates of Oxford and Cambridge. The small institutions they founded would not have seemed to them like universities &amp;mdash; they were tiny and did not offer the higher degrees in medicine and theology. Furthermore, they were not composed of several small colleges. Instead, the new institutions felt like the Oxbridge colleges they were used to &amp;mdash; small communities, housing and feeding their students who were instructed by residential tutors (see United Kingdom/Universities and Colleges above). However, when the first students came to be graduated, these &quot;colleges&quot; proceeded to assume (without any recognized authority) the right to confer degrees upon them. In Europe only universities could grant degrees. Presumably the leaders of [[Harvard College]] (which granted America's first degrees in 1642) thought of their college as the first of many residential colleges which would grow up into a New Cambridge university. However, over time, no new colleges were founded; and Harvard grew and added higher faculties. Eventually, it changed its title to university, but the term &quot;college&quot; had stuck and &quot;colleges&quot; had sprung up all over America.

==British and American usage contrasted==
The most confusing aspect of the conflict between the British and American terminology arises from the colloquial use of the word &quot;college&quot; by Americans. Where a British person (or indeed, most people around the world) would say &quot;attend university&quot;, the American instead says, &quot;go to college&quot; &amp;mdash; ''even if he is referring to an institution formally called a university''.  In Britain, aside from usage in reference to [[collegiate universities]] as detailed above, to attend &quot;college&quot; would usually be accepted as meaning one attends a [[technical college]] or a specific [[sixth form]] institution (NB. Most [[state schools]] and [[public schools]] in Britain have sixth forms, but there are a number of sixth form specific institutions). However, in the States, the student at the enormous [[University of Michigan]] still calls it his &quot;college&quot;. Similarly, the institution that administers many standardized admissions tests in the US is known as the [[College Board]]. Thus to the American, the word &quot;college&quot; refers not only to an institution but to a ''phase in one's life''. Anywhere else in the world that phase is called &quot;university&quot;.

However, this phase itself varies somewhat around the world, which can lead to confusion even when the terminology is understood. Two outstanding features of the American version are '''universality''' and '''breadth''': 
#nearly half of all Americans attend at least one year of &quot;college&quot;, so the word is more natural, less remarkable, than &quot;university&quot; might sound abroad. At the less-academic end of the scale, American universities award a great many degrees for professional training which might be accomplished on-the-job elsewhere. 
#at the more-academic end of the scale, on the other hand, many American college students (especially at the most elite institutions) see &quot;college&quot; as a time of intellectual exploration which can be accomplished free from any need to prepare for the future, believing [[graduate school]] to be the time for that. The American system, by permitting students to spend some of their time in classes entirely removed from their [[college major | major]] field of study, forces much less specialization and focus than is common in the rest of the world. Hence &quot;college&quot; is less dryly academic than &quot;university&quot; might sound abroad. Furthermore, a great many students in American universities and colleges live either in institution-run dormitories or in neighborhoods made up largely of student apartments. Hence one's college years involve a quite distinct kind of living arrangement between the family home and the first adult apartment.

For all these reasons, &quot;college&quot; as a phase-in-life between childhood and adulthood has become very important culturally in America, perhaps more so than in the rest of the world.

==The rest of the English-speaking world==
Influenced by their origins in the [[British Empire]], and by modern American [[pop culture]], the rest of the English-speaking world seems to have adopted a mix of their practices.

=== Australia ===
In [[Australia]], the term &quot;college&quot; can refer to an institution of [[tertiary education]] that is smaller than a university, run independently or as part of a university. Following a reform in the [[1980s]] many of the formerly independent colleges now belong to a larger university. Many private [[high school]]s that provide [[secondary education]] are called &quot;colleges&quot; in Australia. The term can also be used to refer to residence halls, as in the United Kingdom, but compared to the UK their tutorial programs are relatively small-scale and they do no actual teaching towards academic degrees (with the exception of one or two that host [[theology|theological]] colleges).

Additionally, in [[Tasmania]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]], &quot;college&quot; refers to the final two years of high school (years eleven and twelve), and the institutions which provide this.  In this context, &quot;college&quot; is a system independent of the other years of high school. (Here, the expression is a shorter version of ''matriculation'' college.) All college courses in the ACT are sanctioned by the [[Board of Senior Secondary Studies]], or BSSS.

=== Canada ===
In [[Canada]], the term &quot;college&quot; usually refers to a [[community college]] or a technical, applied arts, or applied science school. These are [[post-secondary education|post-secondary]] diploma-granting institutions, but they are not universities, and typically do not grant degrees, except in [[British Columbia]] where some have university status. In [[Quebec]], it can refer in particular to [[CEGEP]] (''Collège d'enseignement général et professionnel'', &quot;college of general and professional education&quot;), a form of post-secondary education specific to the [[Quebec education system]] that is required in order to continue onto university, or to learn a trade.

The [[Royal Military College of Canada]] is a full-fledged degree-granting university, but does not follow the naming convention used by the rest of the country.

The term &quot;college&quot; also applies to separate entities within a university (usually referred to as &quot;[[federated school|federated colleges]]&quot; or &quot;affiliated colleges&quot;), akin to the residential colleges in the United Kingdom. These colleges act independently, but in affiliation or federation with the university that actually grants the degrees. For example, [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]] was once an independent institution, but later became federated with the [[University of Toronto]], and is now one of its residential colleges.

It should be noted that, unlike in the United States, there is a strong distinction between &quot;college&quot; and &quot;university&quot; in Canada. In conversation one specifically would say either &quot;I'm going to university&quot; (i.e., studying for a three- or four-year degree at a university) or &quot;I'm going to college&quot; (suggesting a technical or career college).  Similarly, the term &quot;college [[professor]]&quot; does not hold nearly the same prestige in Canada as it does in the United States (whereas &quot;university professor&quot; does). Also because of this distinction, the cultural phenomenon known as [[college radio]] in the United States is more properly designated as &quot;campus radio&quot; in Canada. 

In [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], many government-run secondary schools are called “collegiate institutes” (C.I.), a complicated form of the word “college” which avoids the usual “post-secondary” connotation. Some private secondary schools in Toronto choose to use the word “college” in their names nevertheless. Some high schools elsewhere in the country, particularly ones within the [[separate school]] system, may also use the word &quot;college&quot; or &quot;collegiate&quot; in their names.

===Ireland ===
{{seealso|List of universities in the Republic of Ireland}}

In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the term &quot;college&quot; is usually limited to an institution of [[tertiary education]], but the term is quite [[generic]] within this field. University students often say they attend &quot;college&quot; rather than &quot;university&quot;, with the term college being more popular in wider society. This is possibly due to the fact that, until 1989, no university provided teaching or research directly. Instead, these were offered by an constituent college of the university, in the case of the [[National University of Ireland]] and [[University of Dublin]] &amp;mdash; or at least in strict legal terms. A limited number of [[secondary education]] institutions use the word college to describe or name themselves, but this tends to be the exception.

The state's only [[ancient university]], the [[University of Dublin]], is really English in its origins and, until recently, its outlook. Created during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], it is modeled on the universities of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. However, only one ''constituent college'' was ever founded, hence the curious position of [[Trinity College, Dublin]] today. For a time, degrees in [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] were also conferred by the university. However, that institution now has its own degree awarding powers and is considering applying for full university status.

Among more modern foundations, the [[National University of Ireland]], founded in 1908, consisted of constituent colleges and recognised colleges until 1997. The former are now referred to as ''constituent universities'' &amp;mdash; institutions that are essentially universities in their own right. The National University can trace its existence back to 1850 and the creation of the ''[[Queen's University of Ireland]]'' and the creation of the ''[[Catholic University of Ireland]]'' in 1854. From 1880, the degree awarding roles of these two universities was taken over by the ''[[Royal University of Ireland]]'', which remained until the creation of the National University in 1908 and the [[Queen's University of Belfast]].

The state's two new universities [[Dublin City University]] and [[University of Limerick]] were initially [[National Institute for Higher Education]] institutions. These institutions offered university level [[academic degree]]s and [[research]] from the start of their existence and were awarded university status in [[1989]] in recognition of this. These two universities now follow the general trend of universities having associated colleges offering their degrees.

Third level technical education in the state has been carried out in the [[Regional Technical College]] network since [[1970]]. These institutions are now referred to as ''Institutes of Technology'', and some have ''delegated authority'' that entitles them to give degrees and diplomas in their own name. Initially these institutions offered only [[National Certificate]] and [[National Diploma]] courses. Now they also offer [[academic degree]]s at [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate]] level.

Other types of college include ''Colleges of Education''. These are specialist institutions, often linked to a university, which provide both [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate]] [[academic degrees]] for people who want to train as teachers.

=== Hong Kong ===
{{seealso|Education in Hong Kong}}

In [[Hong Kong]], the term &quot;college&quot; mostly refers to [[secondary school]]s. It is also used for some tertiary institutions (e.g., Shue Yan College, or United College of the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]]), or a residence hall of a university (as in [[United Kingdom|British]] usage, e.g., St. John's College of the [[University of Hong Kong]]).

=== India ===
{{seealso|Universities and colleges in India|Indian Institute of Management|Indian Statistical Institute}}

The term university is more common than college in [[India]]. Generally, colleges are located in different parts of a state and all of them are affiliated to a regional university. The colleges offer programmes under that university. Examinations are conducted by the university at the same time for all colleges under its affiliation. There are several hundred universities and each university has affiliated colleges.

The first liberal arts and sciences college in India was the [[Presidency College, Kolkata]] (estd. [[1817]]) (initially known as Hindu College). The first Missionary institution to impart Western style education in India was the [[Scottish Church College, Calcutta]] (estd. [[1830]]). The first modern university in India was the [[University of Calcutta]] (estd. January [[1857]]). The first research institution for the study of the social sciences and ushering the spirit of [[Oriental]] research was the [[Asiatic Society]], (estd. [[1784]]). The first college for the study of Christian theology and ecumenical enquiry has been the [[Serampore College]] (estd. [[1818]]). 

The [[Indian Institutes of Technology]] (IITs) are specialized institutions that award their own degrees. They are premier institutes in India. There are only seven of them at present.

Of late the government has been establishing [[Indian Institutes of Information Technology]] (IIITs) as specialized centres of excellence in the rapidly emerging field of Information Technology. They have been setup to educate professionals for the booming technology oriented market. 

=== Singapore ===
The term &quot;college&quot; in [[Singapore]] is generally only used for pre-university educational institutions called &quot;Junior Colleges&quot;, which provide the final two years of [[secondary education]] (equivalent to sixth form in English terms or grades 11-12 in the American system). Since [[1 January]] [[2005]], the term also refers to the three campuses of the [[Institute of Technical Education]] with the introduction of the &quot;collegiate system&quot;, in which the three institutions are called [[ITE College East]], [[ITE College Central]], and [[ITE College West]] respectively.

The term &quot;[[university]]&quot; is used to describe higher-education institutions offering locally-conferred degrees. Institutions offering diplomas are called &quot;[[polytechnic]]s&quot;, while other institutions are often referred to as &quot;institutes&quot; and so forth.

=== New Zealand ===
In [[New Zealand]] the word &quot;college&quot; normally refers to a newer [[Secondary education|secondary]] school for ages 13 to 17. In contrast, most older schools of the same type are &quot;high schools&quot;, and &quot;high schools&quot;. Also, single-sex schools are more likely to be &quot;Someplace Boys/Girls High School&quot;, but there are also very many coeducational &quot;high schools&quot;. There is no distinction between &quot;high schools&quot; and &quot;colleges&quot;.

Some older schools are more collegiate in nature, however: [[Christ's College, Canterbury]] is still in theory organised as a body of [[fellow]]s, and was a college of the Universities of [[University of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[University of Canterbury|Canterbury]]. [[Wellington College (New Zealand)|Wellington College]] also enjoys its right to be named a College by virtue of its affiliation with the former University of New Zealand. 

The constituent colleges of the former [[University of New Zealand]] (such as Canterbury University College) have become independent universities. Some halls of residence associated with New Zealand universities retain the name of &quot;college&quot;, particularly at the [[University of Otago]] (which although brought under the umbrella of the University of New Zealand, already possessed university status and degree awarding powers). The institutions formerly known as &quot;Teacher-training colleges&quot; now style themselves &quot;College of education&quot;.

Essentially the pattern of usage found in the United Kingdom is followed in New Zealand (refer: Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, R.A.C. of Physicians etc.).

== The non-English-speaking world ==
Some languages beyond English use words similar to &quot;college&quot;. (French, for example, has the [[Collège de France]].) However, in other languages, confusion is most likely to arise when an American is reading something translated by someone using British conventions, or ''vice versa''.

*In [[Germany]] a ''Hochschule'' is an institute of [[tertiary education]]. &quot;College&quot; is a more proper term to use than a direct translation: ''Hochschule'' literally means &quot;high school&quot;. German [[secondary education]] often takes place in an institution called in [[German language|German]] an ''Oberschule'', with its specific forms ''Hauptschule'', ''Realschule'', ''[[gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'', and in some [[States of Germany|states]] also ''Gesamtschule'', together with vocational secondary education in ''Berufsschule'' (in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] called ''Berufskolleg''). The term ''Kolleg'' (literally: college) is used in some [[States of Germany|states]] for institutions of [[Adult education|adult education]] where graduates of a ''Berufsschule'' can graduate with an [[Abitur]]. A ''Graduiertenkolleg'' is a German [[Graduate school]].
*In [[Sweden]] the term &quot;[[university college]]&quot; is used as an official English translation for ''högskola'', a term used for independent [[List of universities in Sweden|educational institutions]] providing [[tertiary education|tertiary]], but not [[quaternary education]]. Similarly to the situation in Germany, the [[Swedish (language)|Swedish]] term ''högskola'' literally means &quot;high school&quot;. The same term is also used for a number of institutions which function as specialized [[university|universities]] rather than as university colleges, providing quaternary education and conducting [[research]] (such as ''Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan'', the [[Royal Institute of Technology]]).
*In [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and other East Asian nations, colleges and universities are collectively named &amp;#22823;&amp;#23416; or in simplified writing &amp;#22823;&amp;#23398;, which is a word originally introduced by [[Confucius]] with his influential book of the same name. The original word and subsequently the book's title is most frequently translated to &quot;[[Great Learning|The Great Learning]]&quot;. Today's pronunciation of this word is country- and sometimes region- specific and includes ''daxue'' and ''daigaku''. In Japan, ''daigaku'' is usually considered distinct from ''senmon gakkou'' (&amp;#23554;&amp;#38272;&amp;#23398;&amp;#26657;), which is more of a [[Post-secondary education|post-secondary]] ''[[Vocational education|vocational school]]''. In [[China]], the college students are selected through the annual [[National College Entrance Examination]].
*In [[Belgium]], the term '''college''' is used for institutes of [[secondary education]], more in particular for [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] schools ([[official]] secondary schools are called ''[[atheneum]]''). For [[tertiary education]], the difference is made between ''hogeschool'' (which literally means ''high school'') and [[university]]. With the current reform of higher education under the [[Bologna process]], the ''hogeschool'' institutions now offer [[professional]] [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's degrees]] (three years study in one cycle) as well as professional [[master's degree|master's degrees]] (one year study in addition to the professional bachelor's degree). Universities offer [[academic]] [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's degrees]] (three years study in one cycle) and academic [[master degree|master's degrees]] (one or two years study in addition to the academic bachelor's degree). Recent government measures have brought the ''hogeschool'' institutions to associate with an university in order to ''academize'' their curriculum and to get involved in applied research projects.
*In [[France]], '''collège''' generally refers to a ''[[middle school]]'' or ''junior high school''. However, it can also be used in a manner more similar to that of English, such as in the term ''[[electoral college]]'' or the [[Collège de France]]. The latter use, though, is not as common.
*In [[Greece]] the term college is mainly used to refer to private secondary education institutions (high schools and junior high schools), while &amp;#928;&amp;#945;&amp;#957;&amp;#949;&amp;#960;&amp;#953;&amp;#963;&amp;#964;&amp;#942;&amp;#956;&amp;#953;&amp;#959; (University) is the term utilized for Higher Education.
*In [[Hungary]] the term &quot;kollégium&quot; refers to a [[dormitory]] that may or may not be independent from an educational institution; it can also refer to a university's autonomous student organisation, dedicated to the advanced study of a certain science, topic etc, for example the [[College for Social Theory]].
*In [[the Netherlands]] the term '''college''' is used for institutes of [[secondary education]]. The term '''college''' is also used for classes or lectures at university.
*In some [[Cantons_of_Switzerland|cantons]] of the French speaking part of [[Switzerland]] and also on the border to the [[Swiss German]] speaking part (i.e. in [[Fribourg]]) the French term “Collège” (German: Kollegium) is used for the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] (10th to 13th grade) which lends to the [[matura]]. It is also used as a name for the physical building in which obligatory education takes place (e.g., ''Le collège des coteaux'').

'''Chalmers University of Technology''' or '''Chalmers tekniska högskola''' ('''CTH'''), often '''Chalmers''', is a [[university]] in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]]. 

==History==
Founded in [[1829]] following a donation by [[William Chalmers]], a director of the [[Swedish East India Company]], and being run as a private institution until [[1937]], when the institute became a state owned university. In [[1994]] the school once again became a private institution, owned by a foundation.

==Schools==
&lt;!-- The Schools at Chalmers are the equivalents to Faculties at non-technical universities. They are components of the organizational structure of the university and not study programs. --&gt;

The organization is divided into schools, corresponding to faculties.

[[Image:Codex Argenteus.jpg|thumb|first page of the Codex Argenteus]]A '''codex''' ([[Latin]] for ''[[book]]''; plural ''codices'') is a handwritten book from late [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] or the [[Early Middle Ages]].  Although the Romans used the codex and similar precursors made of wood for taking notes and other informal writings, the first recorded use of the codex for literary works dates  from the late [[first century]], when [[Martial]] experimented with the format.  At that time, the roll (also called a [[scroll (parchment)|scroll]]) was the dominant medium for literary works and would remain dominant for secular works until the [[4th century]]. As far back as the early [[2nd century]], there is evidence that the codex was the preferred format among [[Christianity|Christians]], while other religions preferred the roll. The Christian codex was made of [[papyrus]], more compact and better suited for people on the move than [[parchment]]. 

From the 4th century, when the codex gained wide acceptance to the [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian Revival]] in the [[8th century]] many works were not converted from scroll to codex and were lost to posterity. The designation ''Codex'' is less used in conventional names given Medieval manuscripts, when the codex form is universal and understood. 

The correct Latin plural is ''codices'', although ''codexes'' is also often used as a plural form in [[English language|English]].  The codex was an improvement over the [[scroll (parchment)|scroll]], because it can be opened flat at any page,  allowing easier reading, and pages can be written on both sides. 

The modern codex book owes a lot to the innovations of [[Aldus Manutius]] who introduced the compact format book that could be carried in a saddlebag and italic type as a means of increasing print density. 

The introduction of page numbers some time in the 1600s allowed for [[cross reference]]s to be made more easily. 
 
The codex also made it easier to organize documents in a [[library]] because it had a stable spine on which the title of the book could be written, and later read when books were arranged upright on shelves.  The spine could be used for the [[incipit]], before the concept of a proper title was developed, during medieval times. 

Medieval book makers used [[parchment]] or [[vellum]] for their pages, which made them very durable, but extremely expensive. Early codices were also made from papyrus, however papyrus is too fragile to be repeatedly folded.  The scholarly study of [[manuscript]]s from the point of view of book-making is called [[codicology]].  The study of ancient documents in general is called [[paleography]].

The books of [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]] had basically the same form, with long folded strips of paper (usually made from either wood bark or plant fibers, often with a layer of [[whitewash]] applied before writing), hence the ancient books of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Aztec]], and [[Mixtec]] peoples, among others, are also known as codices. See also: [[Maya codices]].

A legal text or code of conduct is sometimes called a '''codex''' (for example, the ''Justinian Codex''), since laws were recorded in large codices.

==Some codices==
Codices are usually named for their most famous resting-place, whether a city or a private library. An example of a somewhat later codex than these would be the [[Book of Kells]].

'''Calves''' are young [[animal]]s.  The term is mainly used for [[cattle]], although [[deer]], [[whale]]s and [[elephant]]s also have calves.

A cattle calf is a child of a [[cattle|cow]] and a [[bull]] and a calf that has lost its mother is referred to as a ''dogie''. The plural is calves.  With respect to cattle calves, calf meat is called [[veal]]; fine calf skin used for [[page (paper)|page]]s in early [[codex]]es is called [[pergamon]].  The fourth stomach of slaughtered milk fed calves is the source of [[rennet]]. Calves feed from their mother's udders for a few weeks before eating solid food.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Shannon.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Claude Shannon]]
'''Claude Elwood Shannon''' ([[April 30]], [[1916]] &amp;ndash; [[February 24]], [[2001]]), an [[United States|American]] [[electrical engineer]] and [[mathematician]], has been called &quot;the father of [[information theory]]&quot;, and was the founder of practical [[digital circuit]] design theory.

==Biography==
Shannon was born in [[Gaylord, Michigan]] and was a distant relative of [[Thomas Edison]]. While growing up, he worked as a messenger for [[Western Union]].

In [[1932]], Shannon entered the [[University of Michigan]], where he eventually took a course that introduced him to the works of [[George Boole]].  He graduated in [[1936]] with two [[bachelor's degree]]s, one in [[electrical engineering]] and one in [[mathematics]], then began graduate study at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], where he worked on [[Vannevar Bush]]'s [[differential analyzer]], an [[analog computer]].
 
While studying the complicated ad hoc circuits of the differential analyzer, Shannon saw that Boole's concepts could be used to great utility. A paper drawn from his [[1937]] master's [[thesis]], ''[[A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits]]'', was published in the [[1938]] issue of the ''Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers''. It also earned Shannon the &lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT CONFUSE WITH THE NOBEL PRIZE--&gt;[[Alfred Noble Prize|Alfred Noble American Institute of American Engineers Award]] in [[1940]]. [[Howard Gardner]], of [[Harvard University]], called Shannon's thesis &quot;possibly the most important, and also the most famous, master's thesis of the century&quot;.  

In this work, Shannon proved that [[Boolean algebra]] and [[binary arithmetic]] could be used to simplify the arrangement of the electromechanical [[relays]] then used in telephone routing switches, then turned the concept upside down and also proved that it should be possible to use arrangements of relays to solve Boolean algebra problems. Exploiting this property of electrical switches to do logic is the basic concept that underlies all electronic digital computers. Shannon's work became the foundation of practical [[digital circuit]] design when it became widely known among the electrical engineering community during and after [[World War II]]. The theoretical rigor Shannon's work supplied completely replaced the &quot;ad hoc&quot; methods that had prevailed heretofore.

Flush with this success, Vannevar Bush suggested that Shannon work on his dissertation at [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]], funded by the Carnegie Institution headed by Bush, to develop similar mathematical relationships for [[Gregor Mendel|Mendelian]] [[genetics]], which resulted in Shannon's [[1940]] [[PhD]] thesis at MIT, ''[[An Algebra for Theoretical Genetics]].''  Shannon then joined [[Bell Labs]] to work on fire-control systems and cryptography during World War II.  He returned to MIT to hold an endowed chair in 1956.

In [[1948]] Shannon published ''[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]'' in two parts in the July and October numbers of the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]''.  This work focuses on the problem of how to best encode the [[information]] a sender wants to transmit.  In this fundamental work he used tools in probability theory, developed by [[Norbert Wiener]], which were in their nascent stages of being applied to communication theory at that time.  Shannon developed [[information entropy]] as a measure for the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing what became known as the dominant form of &quot;information theory.&quot; 
The book co-authored with [[Warren Weaver]], ''The Mathematical Theory of Communication'', reprints Shannon's 1948 article and Weaver's popularization of it, which is accessible to the non-specialist. Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in [[John Robinson Pierce]]'s ''Symbols, Signals, and Noise''.

Another notable paper published in [[1949]] is ''[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]'', a major contribution to the development of a mathematical theory of [[cryptography]].  He is also credited with the introduction of [[Nyquist-Sha four-year school's core requirement for a Business Administration degree.)  Some have gone one step further, having arrangements with a four-year college for the student to obtain the bachelor's degree from the four-year college while taking all the courses via [[distance learning]] or other non-traditional modes,  on the community college campus, thus limiting the number of trips to the four-year school.

The second level of study is towards certification in an area of [[vocational or occupational education|training]] (such as nursing, computer repair, or welding), which require preparation for a state or national examination, or where certification would allow for hiring preference and/or a higher salary upon entering the workforce.

The third level of study offers services of local interest to members of the community, such as job placement, adult continuing-education classes (either for personal achievement or to maintain certification in specialized fields), and developmental classes for children.  Some community colleges offer opportunities for students to return and earn a high school diploma or obtain a GED.  Community colleges often work with local employeers to develop specialized classes tailored toward their organization's needs.

==Advantages of community colleges==

*Community colleges are geared toward local students and local needs.  Students who could not afford campus or off-site housing at a four-year college, or for other reasons cannot relocate, can attend courses while staying in their local community.  Also, community colleges can work with local businesses to develop customized training geared toward local needs, whereas a four-year institution generally focuses on state-wide and/or national needs. Some community colleges have programs allowing local high school students to &quot;jump start&quot; their college career by taking classes at the community college that also count toward their high school diploma. Policies and classes offered vary with different agreements existing between the community college and high schools.
*The &quot;open enrollment&quot; policy allows anyone to begin the goal towards future college education.  The policy is highly beneficial to students with mediocre academic records in high school (or who dropped out and later obtained a GED), students &quot;maturing&quot; later in life who now see the benefits of college education, or students who could not attend college after high school but now have the chance to do so.
*In North America, tuition and fees are substantially lower than those of a traditional four-year public or private institution. (This is not true in China where community college tuition exceeds that of the university.)  Students from low-income families, or those having to work to pay for their education, benefit from the reduced costs.  Many colleges offer and accept scholarships or educational grants.
*Community colleges have little or no time limits on when classes must be taken or a degree must be earned (many four-year schools, tired of &quot;[[professional student|professional students]]&quot; taking up limited space, have imposed limits on when a degree can be earned).  Students who must hold down full-time employment, and who cannot take a full-term load, are thus not under pressure to complete courses in a limited timeframe.
*Four-year colleges often give priority to students transferring from community colleges, citing their demonstrated preparedness for junior and senior college-level work.  Students who may not have been able to attend a particular college after high school (either for academic, financial, and/or personal reasons), may now be able to attend the college of their choice.
*Community college professors are solely dedicated to teaching, and classes are generally small, whereas a four-year college course may be taught to 300 students by a student intern, while the professor is concentrating on research.  Most professors have [[Master's degree]]s and some even hold [[doctorate]] degrees.
*Several community colleges have tremendously successful athletic programs, where students have gone on to play for major colleges and/or the professional ranks. Others offer no athletic programs.
*Research shows there is no learning or income penalty for individuals who start at a community college and transfer to a four-year institution. Additionally, research indicates students who begin their higher education career at a community college are more likely to transfer to a higher quality four-year institution than if they had started at a four-year college.

==Disadvantages of community colleges==
*Transferring credits can sometimes be a problem, as each four-year college has its own requirements as to what is and isn't required for enrollment.  However, many four-year colleges (usually nearby to the community college) have made arrangements allowing associate degrees to qualify for transfer, and in some cases allowing the student to complete the bachelor's degree via [[distance learning]] from the community college campus. [[Minnesota]] has created a statewide &quot;transfer curriculum&quot; allowing credits to be transfered to any other public university and almost all of the private colleges. Illinois' &quot;I-transfer&quot; program is a model articulation program (www.itransfer.org.)
*It is frequent for many courses to be taught by part-time [[lecturer]]s holding only a Master's degree in the field, although there is little evidence, other than anecdotal, to indicate that taking a class from a full-time college instructor leads to higher order learning outcomes.
*Few community colleges have on-campus housing. This makes it more difficult for students to participate in extra-curricular activities.
*Many community colleges do not offer any athletic programs other than basic physical education classes.
*Research shows individuals with Associate's degrees earn less than those with Bachelor's degrees. Because a correlation exists between years of education and earnings, this says more about years of schooling than the value of Associate's degrees or certificates, which have a strong value in the workplace.

==Community college libraries==
Community college libraries, also called learning resources centers, have evolved over their existence.  These libraries often include traditional library services such as book checkout, online research tools, and research help, but they also have included multimedia technology expertise, video centers, tutor centers and support services.  Community college libraries play a significant role in the college curriculum by supporting information literacy across campus.  The librarians spend a significant amount of their work week in the classroom teaching students about information, to select research tools, to evaluate search results, and to use their results in papers, speeches, or in other projects.  For this reason, community college librarians are considered full faculty members at most institutions.  Community college libraries are often at the cutting edge of research services, because they are able to change faster than their larger cousins at major research institutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Civil Rights Memorial''' in [[Montgomery, Alabama]] is a [[memorial]] to 40 people who died in the struggle for equal and integrated treatment of people of [[Europe|European]] and [[Africa|African]] descent. The memorial is sponsored by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]].

The names included belong to those who died between 1954 and 1968. Those dates were chosen because in 1954 the [[US Supreme Court]] ruled that [[racial segregation]] in schools was unlawful. 1968 is the year of [[Martin Luther King]]'s [[assassination]]. The monument was created by [[Maya Lin]] who also created the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The memorial was dedicated in 1989.
  
The concept of Maya Lin's design is based on the soothing and healing effect of [[water]]. It was inspired by [[Martin Luther King]]'s quotation ''&quot;... we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream. ...&quot;'', from the ''[[I Have a Dream]]'' speech, delivered at the [[National Mall]], [[Washington D.C.]] August 28, 1963. The memorial is a round stone inverted [[Cone (solid)|cone]], which is a [[fountain]]. A film of water flows over the base of the cone, which contains the 40 names. It is possible to touch the smooth film of water and temporarily alter the surface film, which quickly returns to smoothness.

As such, the memorial represents the aspiration of the [[American civil rights movement]] against [[racism]].

In [[1991]], working from Babbage's original plans, a [[difference engine]] was completed, and functioned perfectly. It was built to tolerances achievable in the 19th century, indicating that Babbage's machine would have worked. Nine years later, the Science Museum completed the [[printer]] Babbage had designed for the difference engine; it featured astonishing complexity for a 19th-century device.

==Life==
Charles  Babbage was born in [[England]], most likely at 44 Crosby Row, [[Walworth Road]], [[London]]. A [[blue plaque]] on the junction of Larcom Street and Walworth Road commemorates the event. There was a discrepancy regarding the date of Babbage's birth, which was published in ''The Times'' obituary as [[26 December]] [[1792]]. However, days later a nephew of Babbage wrote to say that Babbage was born precisely one year earlier, in [[1791]]. The parish register of [[St. Mary's Newington]], London, shows that Babbage was baptised on [[6 January]] [[1792]] [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Babbage.html].

Babbage's father, [[Benjamin Babbage]], was a banking partner of the Praeds who owned the Bitton Estate in [[Teignmouth]]. His mother was Betsy Plumleigh Babbage. In [[1808]], the Babbage family moved into the old Rowdens house in East [[Teignmouth]], and Benjamin Babbage became a warden of the nearby St. Michael’s Church.

===Education===
His father's money allowed Charles to receive instruction from several schools and tutors during the course of his elementary education. Around age eight he was sent to a country school to recover from a life-threatening fever. His parents ordered that his &quot;brain was not to be taxed too much&quot; and Babbage felt that &quot;this great idleness may have led to some of my childish reasonings.&quot; He was sent to King Edward VI Grammar School in [[Totnes]], [[Devon|South Devon]], a thriving comprehensive school still extant today, but his health forced him back to private tutors for a time. He then joined a 30-student academy under Reverend Stephen Freeman. The academy had a well-stocked library that prompted Babbage's love of mathematics. He studied with two more private tutors after leaving the academy. Of the first, a clergyman near Cambridge, Babbage said, &quot;I fear I did not derive from it all the advantages that I might have done.&quot; The second was an Oxford tutor from whom Babbage learned enough of the Classics to be accepted to Cambridge.

Babbage arrived at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[Cambridge]] in October [[1810]]. He had read extensively in [[Leibniz]], [[Lagrange]], [[Thomas Simpson|Simpson]], and [[Lacroix]] and was seriously disappointed in the mathematical instruction available at Cambridge. In response, he, [[John Herschel]], [[George Peacock]], and several other friends formed the [[Analytical Society]].

In [[1812]] Babbage transferred to [[Peterhouse]], [[Cambridge]]. He was the top mathematician at Peterhouse, but failed to graduate with honours. He instead received an honorary degree without examination in 1814.

===Marriage===
On [[25 July]] [[1814]], Babbage married Georgiana Whitmore at St. Michael's Church in [[Teignmouth]], [[Devon]]. His father did not approve of the marriage. The couple lived happily at 5 Devonshire Street, Portland Place, London. They had eight children, but only three lived to adulthood. Charles' father, his wife Georgiana Babbage, and one son all died in [[1827]].

===Children===

*Charles Whitmore Babbage (born [[22 January]] [[1817]])
*Georgiana Whitmore Babbage (born [[17 July]] [[1818]])

==Design of computers==

In recognition of the high error rate in the calculation of mathematical tables, Babbage wanted to find a method by which they could be calculated mechanically, removing human sources of error. Three different factors seem to have influenced him: a dislike of untidiness; his experience working on [[logarithm|logarithmic tables]]; and existing work on calculating machines carried out by [[Wilhelm Schickard]], [[Blaise Pascal]], and [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. He first discussed the principles of a calculating engine in a letter to Sir [[Humphrey Davy]] in [[1822]].

[[Image:BabbageDifferenceEngine.jpg|thumb|right|Part of Babbage's difference engine, assembled after his death by Babbage's son, using parts found in his laboratory.]]

Babbage's engines were among the first mechanical computers. His engines were not actually completed, largely because of funding problems and personality issues. Babbage realized that a machine could do the work better and more reliably than a human being. Babbage controlled building of some steam-powered machines that more or less did their job; calculations could be mechanized to an extent. Although Babbage's machines were mechanical monsters their basic architecture was astonishingly similar to a modern computer. The data and program memory were separated, operation was instruction based, control unit could make conditional jumps and the machine had a separate I/O unit. Inventions not talked about here but worth mentioning are: The [[cowcatcher]], [[dynamometer]], [[standard railroad gauge]], uniform [[postal rates]], [[occulting lights]] for lighthouses, [[Greenwich Time signals]], and [[heliograph ophthalmoscope]].

===[[Difference engine]]===
In Babbage’s time numerical tables were calculated by humans called ‘computers’. At Cambridge he saw the high error rate of the people computing the tables and thus started his life’s work in trying to calculate the tables mechanically, removing all human error. He began in 1822 with what he called the difference engine, made to compute values of polynomial functions. 

Unlike similar efforts of the time, Babbage's difference engine was created to calculate a series of values automatically. By using the method of finite differences, it was possible to avoid the need for multiplication and division.

The first difference engine needed around 25,000 parts of a combined weight of fifteen tons standing eight feet high.  Although he received much funding for the project, he did not complete it. He later designed an improved version, &quot;Difference Engine No. 2&quot;. This was not constructed at the time, but was built using his plans in 1989-1991, to 19th century tolerances, and performed its first calculation at the London Science Museum bringing back results to 31 digits, far more than the average modern pocket calculator.

===Printer===
Babbage designed a printer for the second difference engine which had some remarkable features; it supported line-wrapping, variable column and row width, and programmable output formatting.

===Analytical engine===
Soon after the attempt at making the difference engine crumbled, Babbage started designing a different, more complex machine called the [[Analytical Engine]].  The engine is not a single physical machine but a succession of designs that he tinkered with until his death in 1871. The main difference between the two engines is that the Analytical Engine could be programmed using [[punch cards]], an idea unheard of in his time. He realized that programs could be put on similar cards so the person had to only create the program initially, and then put the cards in the machine and let it run. The analytical engine was also proposed to use loops of [[Jacquard loom|Jacquard]]'s punched cards to control a mechanical calculator, which could formulate results based on the results of preceding computations.  This machine was also intended to employ several features subsequently used in modern computers, including sequential control, branching, and looping, and would have been the first mechanical device to be [[Turing-complete]].

[[Ada Lovelace]], an impressive mathematician and one of the few people who totally understood Babbage's vision, created a program for the Analytical Engine. Had the Analytical Engine ever actually been built, her program would have been able to calculate a numerical sequence known as the [[Bernoulli numbers]]. Based on this work, Ada is now credited as being the first [[programmer|computer programmer]] and, in 1979, a contemporary programming language was named [[Ada programming language|Ada]] in her honour.  Shortly afterward, in 1981, a satirical article in Datamation magazine described the [http://www.tlc-systems.com/babbage.htm Babbage programming language], the &quot;language of the future&quot;.

==Other accomplishments==

In [[1824]], Babbage won the [[Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society]] &quot;for his invention of an engine for calculating mathematical and astronomical tables&quot;.

From [[1828]] to [[1839]] Babbage was [[Lucasian professor]] of mathematics at Cambridge. He contributed largely to several scientific periodicals, and was instrumental in founding the Astronomical Society in [[1820]] and the Statistical Society in [[1834]]. However, he dreamt of designing mechanical calculating machines. 

:“... I was sitting in the rooms of the Analytical Society, at Cambridge, my head leaning forward on the table in a kind of dreamy mood, with a table of logarithms lying open before me. Another member, coming into the room, and seeing me half asleep, called out, Well, Babbage, what are you dreaming about?&quot; to which I replied &quot;I am thinking that all these tables&quot; (pointing to the logarithms) &quot;might be calculated by machinery. &quot; 

In [[1837]], responding to the official eight ''[[Francis Henry Egerton, 8th Earl of Bridgewater|Bridgewater Treatises]] &quot;On the Power, Wisdom and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation&quot;'', he published his ''Ninth Bridgewater Treatise'' putting forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator, making laws (or programs) which then produced species at the appropriate times, rather than continually interfering with ''ad hoc'' miracles each time a new species was required. The book is a work of [[natural theology]]. The book incorporated extracts from correspondence he had been having with [[John Herschel]] on the subject.

Charles Babbage also achieved notable results in [[cryptography]]. He broke Vigenère's [[autokey cipher]] as well as the much weaker cipher that is called [[Vigenère cipher]] today. The autokey cipher was generally called &quot;the undecipherable cipher&quot;, though owing to popular confusion, many thought that the weaker polyalphabetic cipher was the &quot;undecipherable&quot; one. Babbage's discovery was used to aid English military campaigns, and was not published until several years later; as a result credit for the development was instead given to [[Friedrich Kasiski]], who made the same discovery some years after Babbage.

Babbage also invented the [[Pilot (locomotive)|pilot]] (also called a cow-catcher), the metal frame attached to the front of locomotives that clears the tracks of obstacles in 1838. He also performed several studies on [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s [[Great Western Railway]].

He only once endeavoured to enter public life, when, in [[1832]], he stood unsuccessfully for the borough of [[Finsbury]]. He came in last in the polls.

==Eccentricities==
Babbage once counted all the broken panes of glass of a factory, publishing in 1857 a &quot;Table of the Relative Frequency of the Causes of Breakage of Plate Glass Windows&quot;: 14 of 464 were caused by &quot;drunken men, women or boys&quot;.  His distaste for commoners (&quot;the Mob&quot;) included writing &quot;Observations of Street Nuisances&quot; in 1864, as well as tallying up 165 &quot;nuisances&quot; over a period of 80 days; he especially hated [[street musiivisions, each of which offer several degree programs, as well as a number of interdisciplinary programs.

===Undergraduate program===

Caltech is on the [[academic term|quarter system]], meaning that students have one quarter before winter break and two quarters after.  Thus, the college starts relatively late, in late September, and ends in early June rather than May like most colleges.  Also, Caltech is unusual in that students normally take five classes every term rather than four as at most colleges.  Instead of majors Caltech has &quot;options&quot; while offering only one minor in Control and Dynamical Systems (CDS).  Approximately 10% of students double-major in two options. This is achievable since the humanities and social sciences majors have been designed to be done in conjunction with a science major. Although double-majoring in two options in the same division is technically discouraged, it is still possible although those who seek to do so usually need to be exceptionally bright. The double major of math and physics is generally thought to be so hard that it is comically referred to as the plan of naive freshmen who do not yet understand the difficulty of Caltech academics.

Caltech is known for a rigorous math and science [[core curriculum]].  Students are expected to take five quarters of core math, including [[differential equations]] and [[probability]] and [[statistics]], five quarters of core physics including [[quantum mechanics]], [[special relativity]], and [[statistical mechanics]], two quarters of chemistry, and a quarter of biology, as well as two quarters of laboratory classes.

Despite the high pressure of academics, few students fail classes or fail out of the school as a whole, although the option of transferring out is a running joke.  This is due to several cushions that help students survive.  First of all, the first two quarters during freshman year are on a pass/fail grading scheme, easing the transition to college.  During the second quarter, &quot;shadow grades&quot; are given, but during the first, there are no grades at all.  Second, there is little competition and collaboration on [[homework]] is encouraged (and often necessary for success) in almost every class.  This allows even students who are not doing as well as others to learn the material and not get behind in their studies.  In addition, students often request extensions on homework due dates and use many other strategies to help learn the material and handle the stress of Caltech life.

Caltech usually has the lowest four-year graduation rate among the leading US universities.  This is despite the fact that entering students have consistently higher average test scores ([[SAT]] 1 and 2) than any other school in the major [[college and university rankings|college rankings]]. Reasons for this include the fact that Caltech does not believe in grade inflation and has a smaller percentage of students who graduate with honors than in the Ivy League. So, Caltech does not rush students through and try to inflate student egos in hopes of greater alumni donations down the road. And of course, its Core is required for all majors.  Consequently, Caltech's graduation rates are comparatively low. Of greater note, in 2005, Princeton Review rated Caltech #1 for Worst Teaching. This statistic comes from polls of students in universities across the nation. While this rating was distressing to the administration, it was not particularly surprising to undergraduates who often feel abandoned in the classroom in favor of the professor's research. Caltech students do encounter good classes with wonderful professors. The required courses are often taught by distinguished researchers who are not necessarily good teachers.  However, the situation has improved greatly over the last few decades and many more students now graduate (&gt;85% yield) than in previous years (when a third of the entering freshmen either transferred or flunked out).

Undergraduates at Caltech are also encouraged to participate in [[research]].  Most students do research through the annual [http://surf.caltech.edu/ Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF)] program at least once during their stay, and many continue it during the school year.  Students write and submit SURF proposals for research projects in collaboration with professors, and about 70% of applicants are awarded SURFs.  The program is open to both Caltech and non-Caltech undergraduate students.  It serves as good preparation for graduate school and helps to explain why Caltech has the highest percentage of alumni who go on to receive a Phd of all the major universities.

==Student life==

===House system===
''See main article: [[House System at Caltech]]''

During the early [[20th century]], a Caltech committee visited several universities and decided to transform the [[undergraduate]] housing system from regular [[fraternities and sororities|fraternities]] to a [[House System]], similar to the [[residential college|residential college system]] of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. Four south houses (or ''hovses'', so named for the inscription on the gates thereof) were built: Blacker House, Dabney House, Fleming House, and Ricketts House. In the [[1960s]], three north houses were built: Lloyd House, Page House, and Ruddock House. During the [[1990s]], an additional house, [[Avery House]], was built to accommodate those who feel the original seven houses were not suitable for them. Some students jocularly refer to the Undergraduate Computer Science Laboratory as another house, as a few spend most of their time there.  The four south houses will be closed for renovation from [[2005]] to [[2007]].

=== Traditions===
[[Image:Beckman auditorium, Caltech.jpg|thumb|Beckman Auditorium]]
There are many annual [[tradition]]s at Caltech, demonstrating the weird and wonderful creativity of its inhabitants. Every [[Halloween]] Dabney House stages a [[pumpkin]] drop from the top of the Millikan Library, the highest point on campus. According to tradition, a claim was once made that the shattering of a pumpkin frozen in [[liquid nitrogen]] and dropped from a sufficient height would produce a spark. This yearly leads onlookers to try to spot the elusive spark. 

There is also the annual Ditch Day, for which seniors ditch school, leaving behind elaborately designed tasks and traps at the doors of their rooms to prevent underclassmen from entering. This has evolved to the point where many seniors spend months designing mechanical, electrical, and software obstacles in order to confound the underclassmen.  Each group of seniors designs a &quot;stack&quot; to be solved by handful of underclassmen. A series of clues, which leads to the solution of the puzzle, is left around campus to lead the students to their final reward, which lies within the sealed room. The faculty has been drawn into the event as well, and cancel all classes on Ditch Day so that the underclassmen can participate in what has become a highlight of the year.

Another tradition is the playing of the ''[[Ride of the Valkyries]]'' at 7 AM each morning during finals week with the largest, loudest speakers available. The playing of that piece is not allowed at any other time, and any offender is dragged into the showers to be drenched in cold water fully dressed. The playing of the ''Ride'' is such a strong tradition that when the music was used during [[Apollo 17]] to awaken Astronaut [[Harrison Schmitt]], the only astronaut-scientist to explore the moon, he became extremely stressed in the same manner as a student during finals week.

====Pranks====
[[Image:Caltech hollywood sign.jpg|thumb|right|Caltech Hollywood sign prank]]
Caltech students have been known for the many [[practical joke|prank]]s (also known as '''[[RF (practical joke)|RF]]'s''') they have pulled off in the area. The two most famous are the changing of the [[Hollywood]] sign to read Caltech, by judiciously covering up certain parts of the letters, and the changing of the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] scoreboard to an imaginary game where Caltech soundly trounced [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].  During the 1961 [[Rose Bowl Game#Trivia|Rose Bowl Game]], Caltech students altered the flip-cards that were raised by the stadium attendees to display &quot;Caltech&quot;.

Recently, a group of Caltech students, during the admitted students program at MIT in 2005, pulled a [http://www.caltechvsmit.com/ string of pranks], including covering up the word Massachusetts in the &quot;Massachusetts Institute of Technology&quot; engraving on the main building façade with a banner so that it read &quot;That Other Institute of Technology&quot;.  A group of MIT hackers retaliated by altering the banner so that the inscription read &quot;The Only Institute of Technology&quot;.

====Honor Code====
Life in the Caltech community is governed by the [[honor code|Honor Code]], which states simply: &quot;No member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community.&quot; This is enforced by a Board of Control, which consists of undergraduate students[http://donut.caltech.edu/about/boc/ug_handbook.php], and by a similar body at the graduate level, called the Graduate Review Board [http://www.its.caltech.edu/~grb/].  The Honor Code, and the atmosphere of respect and trust that it promotes, allows Caltech students to enjoy privileges that make for a more relaxed atmosphere.  For example, the Honor Code allows the professors to trust students sufficiently to give them take-home tests.  Almost all Caltech tests are take-home, allowing students to take them on their own schedule and in their preferred environment.

The only exception to the Honor Code, implemented in 1990s in response to changes in federal regulations, concerns Sexual Harrassment Policy.

==Presidents of Caltech==
Since Throop College of Technology became Caltech in 1920, it has been led by the following individuals:

* [[Robert A. Millikan]], [[1921]]&amp;ndash;[[1945]], experimental physicist, Nobel laureate in physics for 1923 (his official title was &quot;Chairman of the Executive Council&quot;)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:KT boundary 054.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Badlands near [[Drumheller, Alberta]] where erosion has exposed the KT boundary.]]
The '''Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event''' was a period of massive [[extinction event|extinction of species]], about 65.5 [[geologic timescale|million years ago]]. It corresponds to the end of the [[Cretaceous]] [[Geologic period|Period]] and the beginning of the [[Tertiary]] Period.

The duration of this extinction event (like others) is unknown. Many forms of life perished (embracing approximately 50% of all [[genus|genera]]), the most often mentioned among them being the non-[[avian]] [[dinosaur]]s. Many explanations for this event have been proposed, the most widely-accepted being the results of an [[impact event|impact on the Earth]] of an object from space.

It is also known as the '''K-T''' (or '''KT''') '''extinction event''' or as the '''KT boundary''':  K is the traditional abbreviation for the Cretaceous period. Cretaceous comes from the Latin for chalk, ''creta''. The K comes from the German word for chalk ''kreide'', or possibly Greek ''kreta''. The K is used so as to avoid confusion with the [[Carboniferous]] period which uses the letter C.

==Casualties of the extinction==
[[Image:Extinction Intensity.png|thumb|right|300px|The KT extinction event, labeled here as &quot;End K&quot;, is shown in comparison to the impact of other events on the extinction intensity for marine fossilerferous [[genus|genera]].]]

A wide range of [[organism]]s became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period. The most conspicuous, of course, were the dinosaurs. While there is evidence that dinosaur [[Biodiversity|diversity]] declined in the Late Cretaceous of [[North America]], many species are known from the [[Hell Creek]] and [[Lance Formation]]s of the Late Cretaceous. These include six or seven [[Family (biology)|families]] of [[theropoda|theropods]] and a similar number of [[ornithischia|ornithischians]]. Among the Dinosauria, the only survivors were the [[bird]]s, but birds suffered heavy losses. A number of diverse groups became extinct, including the [[Enantiornithes]] and [[Hesperornithiformes]]; the last of the pterosaurs also went extinct. A number of mammal groups also became extinct. In the sea, many species of [[phytoplankton]] were wiped out. The great sea [[reptile]]s of the Cretaceous, the [[mosasaur|mosasaurs]] and [[plesiosaur|plesiosaurs]], also fell victim to extinction. Among [[mollusk]]s, the [[ammonite]]s, a diverse group of coiled [[cephalopod]]s, were exterminated, as were
the specialized [[rudist]] and [[inoceramid]] [[clam]]s. Freshwater [[mussel]]s and [[snail]]s also suffered heavy losses in North America. Much less is known about how the K-T event affected the rest of the world. It should be emphasized that the survival of a group does not mean that the group was unaffected: a species may be 99% annihilated by an [[asteroid]] strike, yet still manage to survive.

Darkness from an impact-generated dust cloud (Alvarez et al. 1980) may have been supplemented by associated gases.

Darkness resulted in loss of [[photosynthesis]] both on land and in the oceans.  On land preferential survival may be closely tied to animals that were not in [[food chain]]s directly dependent on plants. Dinosaurs (both [[herbivores]] and [[carnivores]]) were in plant-eating food chains.

Mammals of the Late Cretaceous were not herbivores.  Many mammals fed on [[insect]]s, [[larva]]e, [[worm]]s, snails etc., which in turn fed on dead plant matter. During the crisis when green plants disappeared, mammals may have survived, because they lived in “[[Detritus (biology)|detritus]]-based” food chains.  Soon after the K/T extinction the mammals radiated into plant-eating lifestyles, and were soon followed by other mammals that became carnivores.

In [[stream]] [[Biocoenosis|communities]] few groups of animals became extinct.  Stream communities tend to be less reliant on food from living plants and are more dependent on detritus that washes in from land.  The stream communities may also have been buffered from extinction by their reliance on detritus-based food chains.  (See Sheehan and Fastovsky, Geology, v. 20, p. 556-560.)  Similar, but more complex patterns have been found in the oceans.  For example, animals living in the [[water column]] are almost entirely dependent on [[primary production]] from living phytoplankton.  Many animals living on or in the [[ocean floor]] feed on detritus, or at least can switch to detritus feeding.  Extinction was more severe among those animals living in the water column than among animals living on or in the sea floor.

==Theories==
===Alvarez hypothesis===
In 1980, a team of researchers led by Nobel-prize-winning physicist [[Luis Alvarez]], his son, geologist [[Walter Alvarez]], and a group of colleagues discovered that fossilized sedimentary layers found all over the world at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, 65.5 million years ago contain a [[concentration]] of [[iridium]] hundreds of times greater than normal. The end of the Cretaceous coincided with the end of the dinosaurs. It was in general a period of extraordinary mass extinction, leading to the Tertiary Period of the [[Cenozoic Era]], in which mammals came to dominate on Earth. The paper suggested that the dinosaurs had been killed off by the impact of a ten-kilometer-wide [[asteroid]] on Earth (see [[impact event]]). Two facts supporting this conclusion are that
* iridium is relatively abundant in many asteroids, and
* the [[isotope|isotopic]] composition of iridium in K-T layers resembles that of asteroids more closely than that of terrestrial iridium.

Iridium is very rare on Earth's surface, but much more common in the Earth's interior as well as in extraterrestrial objects, such as asteroids and [[comet]]s. Furthermore, [[chromium]] isotopic anomalies are found in Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary sediments which strongly supports the impact theory and suggests that the impactor must have been an asteroid or a comet composed of material similar to [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s.

The resulting blast would have been hundreds of millions of times more devastating than the most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated, may have created a hurricane of unimaginable fury, and certainly would have thrown massive amounts of dust and vapor into the upper atmosphere and even into space.

A global firestorm may have resulted as the incendiary fragments from the blast fell back to Earth. Analyses of [[fluid inclusions]] in ancient [[amber]] suggest that the [[oxygen]] content of the atmosphere was very high (30 - 35%) during the late Cretaceous [http://minerals.cr.usgs.gov/gips/na/0amber.htm#amber]. This high O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmospheric content would have supported massive combustion. The level of atmospheric O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; plummeted in the early Tertiary.

In addition, the worldwide cloud would have choked off sunlight for months, resulting in a darkness that prevented photosynthesis and depleting food resources. During this interval of reduced sunlight a &quot;long winter&quot; may have also been involved in the extinction. Gradually skies cleared but greenhouse gases from the impact caused an increase in temperature for many years.

The impact target rocks also produced [[acid rain]]s that would have inflicted further hardship on the environment, but recent work suggests this was relatively minor.  Chemical buffers would have reduced the effect, and survival of animals prone to acid rain damage (such as [[frog]]s) indicate this was not a major contributor to extinction (see Kring, D.A. GSA Today v. 10, no.8). 

Although further studies of the K-T layer consistently showed the excess of iridium, the idea that the dinosaurs were exterminated by an asteroid remained a matter of controversy among [[geologist]]s and [[paleontologist]]s for over a decade.

===Chicxulub crater===
''Main article:'' [[Chicxulub Crater]]

[[Image:Chicxulub radar topography.jpg|thumb|200px|Radar topography reveals the 180 kilometer (112 mile) wide ring of the crater (image courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech)]]
One problem with the &quot;Alvarez hypothesis&quot; (as it came to be known) was that no documented crater matched the event. This was not a lethal blow to the theory; although the crater resulting from the impact would have been 150 to 200 kilometers in diameter, Earth's geological processes tend to hide or destroy craters over time. The discovery by Alan R. Hildebrand and Glen Penfield of a crater buried under [[Chicxulub, Yucatán|Chicxulub]] in the [[Yucatan]] as well as various types of debris in North America and [[Haiti]] have lent credibility to this theory (see [[Chicxulub Crater]]). Most paleontologists now agree that an asteroid did hit the Earth 65 million years ago, but many dispute whether the impact was the sole cause of the extinctions. The age of the Chicxulub crater has been revised to approximately 300ky before the K-T boundary. This dating is based on evidence coll Offices for Cornell-administered study abroad programs such as the Cornell-Nepal Study Program and Cornell-in-Rome

==Academics==
For the undergraduate class of 2009, 27.1% of [[college application|applicants]] were admitted. Over 88% of them graduated in the top 10% of their high school class (among schools reporting class rank){{ref|academics.admission}}. Cornell's enrollment includes students from over 120 countries and all fifty [[U.S. state]]s.

===International programs===
Cornell offers a wide array of programs and undergraduate majors with an international focus, including [[Africa|Africana Studies]], [[Asia|Asian Studies]], [[France|French Studies]], [[Germany|German Studies]], [[Jewish Studies]], [[Latino|Latino Studies]], [[Near East|Near Eastern Studies]], [[Romance languages|Romance Studies]], [[Russian Literature]], the [[South Asia|South Asia Program]], the [[Southeast Asia|Southeast Asia Program]], and the newly-launched China and Asia-Pacific Studies (CAPS). In addition to these academic programs, to the [[Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar]] and to its study abroad programs on six continents{{ref|international_programs.study_abroad}}, Cornell has undertaken a number of major initiatives overseas:
*In [[Asia]], Cornell has an agreement with [[Peking University]] in which students in the CAPS major will spend a semester in [[Beijing]].
*The [[Cornell University College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] has an agreement to exchange faculty and graduate students with [[Tsinghua University]] in [[Beijing]]{{ref|international_programs.china}}.
*The [[Cornell University School of Hotel Administration|School of Hotel Administration]] has a joint master's program with [[Nanyang Technological University]] in [[Singapore]]{{ref|international_programs.japan}}.
*The [[New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences|College of Agriculture and Life Sciences]] has signed an agreement with [[Japan]]'s [[National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences]] to engage in joint research, and to exchange graduate students and faculty members.
*The [[New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences|College of Agriculture and Life Sciences]] has agreed to cooperate in agricultural research with the [[Indian Council of Agricultural Research]]{{ref|international_programs.india}}.
*In the [[Middle East]], Cornell is developing the Bridging the Rift Center{{ref|international_programs.bridging_the_rift}}, a &quot;Library of Life&quot; (or databank about all living systems) on the border of [[Israel]] and [[Jordan]], in collaboration with those two countries and [[Stanford University]].

===Reputation===
Cornell ranked 13th in the [[2006]] [[U.S. News and World Report]] &quot;National Universities&quot; ranking{{ref|reputation.usnews}}, and 12th globally in an academic ranking of world universities by Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2005{{ref|reputation.worldrank}}.

In its 2005 ranking of engineering programs at universities in the United States, U.S. News and World Report has placed Cornell first in engineering science and engineering physics. That same magazine rated the medical school's departments of psychiatry and orthopedic surgery as second best in the country, while rheumatology was rated third.

==Student life==
===Activities===
[[Image:Sun-first.jpg|right|160px|thumb|[[The Cornell Daily Sun]] is one of numerous campus publications]]
Cornell has more than 800 registered student organizations, running the gamut from [[kayak]]ing to full-armor [[jousting]], from varsity and club [[sport]]s and [[a cappella]] groups to [[improvisational theatre]], from political clubs and publications to [[chess]] and [[Computer and video games|video game]] clubs. Many groups are subsidized financially by the Student Assembly Finance Commission, a student-run organization that gives nearly $1,000,000 a year to clubs and organizations. Organized in [[1868]], the oldest student organization is the [[Cornell University Glee Club]]. 

[[The Cornell Daily Sun]] is the oldest continuously independent college daily in the United States, having published since September [[1880]], and the first collegiate member of the [[Associated Press]]. Other campus publications include [[The Cornell Review]], [[Turn Left]] and [[The Cornell American]].

WVBR is an independent radio station owned and operated by Cornell students. During the 1970s, it was noted for its progressive rock radio format. It is also known for its coverage of both Cornell and national sports.

Cornell also hosts one of the largest [[fraternities and sororities|fraternity and sorority]] systems in North America, with over 60 chapters involving 30 percent of [[undergraduate]] students. [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], the first intercollegiate [[Greek alphabet|Greek-letter]] fraternity established for [[African American]]s was founded at Cornell in [[1906]].

===Housing===
[[Image:Balch Halls Exterior.jpg|left|375px|thumb|[[Balch Hall]] is a women-only dormitory on North Campus]]
University housing is broadly divided into three sections: West Campus, Collegetown and North Campus. As a result of President [[Hunter R. Rawlings III]]'s 1997 Residential Initiative,{{ref|housing.north_campus}} West Campus houses mostly transfer and returning students, whereas North Campus is almost entirely populated by freshmen. 
The only options for living on North Campus for upperclassmen are the program houses: [[Risley Hall|Risley Residential College]], Just About Music (JAM), the Ecology House, Holland International Living Center (HILC), the Multicultural Living Learning Unit (MLLU), the Latino Living Center (LLC), Akwe:kon, and Ujaama.

In an attempt to create a sense of community and an atmosphere of education outside the classroom, the university has undertaken the $250 million [[residential college]] project on West Campus. In line with Andrew Dickson White's vision of the university, the West Campus Class Halls will be demolished and rebuilt as five residential colleges. The first House, the [[Alice Cook House]], was opened to students in 2004, followed by the [[Carl Becker House]] in 2005. The next house will be the [[Hans Bethe House]]. The names of the Houses come from notable Cornell professors. The idea of building a House system can be attributed in part to the success of [[Risley Hall|Risley Residential College]], the oldest continually-operating residential college at Cornell. Like Risley, the new houses will have their own dining halls, student governments, in-house lectures, House trips, and [[heraldry|crests]]. The completion of the five-House &quot;residential college&quot; campus will occur in [[2010]].{{ref|housing.west_campus}}

A variety of off-campus housing options exist. Many homes in the East Hill neighborhoods adjacent to the university have been converted to apartments, and several high-rise apartment complexes have been constructed in the Collegetown neighborhood. A significant number of undergraduate students live in fraternity and sorority houses. Many &quot;co-op&quot; or other independent living units such as Watermargin, [[Telluride Association|Telluride House]], the Center for Jewish Living (formerly the Young Israel House), and the Wait Cooperative also exist.

The campus dining services have been rated as one of the top college dining services many times in recent years{{ref|housing.food}}. Cornell has a program called Cross Country Gourmet Guest Restaurant Series which periodically brings chefs, menus, and atmosphere from America’s most influential restaurants to Cornell’s dining rooms.

===Athletics===
{{main|Cornell Big Red}}
Cornell has one of the most diverse varsity athletic programs in the country. It sponsors 36 varsity teams. [[Image:Schoellkopfcrecent.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Schoellkopf Field]].]] An [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I]] institution, Cornell is a member of the [[Ivy League]] and also competes in [[Eastern College Athletic Conference]], the largest athletic conference in North America. Cornell's traditional [[American football|football]] rival is the [[University of Pennsylvania]]; in [[1993]], the two institutions celebrated the 100th anniversary of their first game. More keenly followed in the present day are the men's [[ice hockey]] contests with [[Harvard University]], although the rivalry has been somewhat one-sided in recent years, with Cornell leading 22-5-2 since the 95-96 season, including ECAC Championship Game wins in 1996, 2003, and 2005.

In addition to the school's varsity athletics, a wide variety of club sports teams have been organized as student organizations under the auspices of the Dean of Students.

Cornell's intramural program includes 30 sports. In addition to such familiar sports such as [[flag football]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], or [[horseshoes]], such unusual offerings as &quot;inner tube [[water polo]]&quot; and formerly &quot;broomstick [[polo]]&quot; have been offered, as well as a sports trivia competition.

==Faculty==
{{seealso|List of Cornell University people#Faculty}}
Cornell University has over 1,550 full-time and part-time academic faculty members, and an additional 1,600 affiliated with its medical divisions. The 2004-05 Cornell faculty included three [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureates]], a [[Crawford Prize]] winner, two [[Turing Award]] winners, a [[Fields Medal]] winner, two [[Légion d'honneur|Legion of Honor]] recipients, a [[World Food Prize]] winner, four [[National Medal of Science]] winners, two [[Wolf Prize]] winners, four [[MacArthur Award]] winners, four [[Pulitzer Prize]] winners, 14 Alexander von Humboldt Award winners, two Eminent Ecologist Award recipients, a Carter G. Woodson Scholars Medallion recipient, 20 National Science Foundation CAREER grant holders, a recipient of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] Award for Initiatives in Research, a winner of the American Mathematical Society's Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement, a recipient of the Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics, two Packard Foundation grant holders, a Keck Distinguished Young Scholar, two Beckman Foundation Young Investigator grant holders, and two NYSTAR (New York State Office of Science, Technology, and Academic Research) early career award winners. In total, Cornell is affiliated to 32 [[Nobel prizes by university affiliation|Nobel laureates]].{{ref|faculty.distinction}}

Among [[Cornellians#Faculty|Cornell's notable former professors]] are [[Carl Sagan]], [[Norman Malcolm]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Hans Bethe]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[Kip S. Thorne]], and [[Allan Bloom]].

==Alumni==
{{seealso|List of Cornell University people}}

[[As of 2005]], Cornell University counted over 230,000 living alumni{{ref|alumni.living_graduates}}. The Office of Alumni Affairs and Development sponsors a wide variety of affinity programs, activities, and organizations, including annual Reunion Weekend and [[Homecoming (tradition)|Homecoming]] Weekend festivities in Ithaca, and the International Spirit of Zinck's Night sponsored by Cornell offices and organizations around the world. The various classes, regional clubs, and special interest associations are coordinated by the Cornell Alumni Federation. 

Cornell ranked second in gifts and bequests from alumni and third in total support from all sources (alumni, friends, corporations, and foundations) among U.S. colleges and universities reporting voluntary gift support received in fiscal year 2003-4{{ref|alumni.gifts}}.

Among Cornell's most notable alumni are [[Thomas Pynchon]], [[Pearl S. Buck]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsberg]], [[David Starr Jordan]], [[Lee Teng-hui]], [[Christopher Reeve]], [[Janet Reno]], [[Hu Shih]], [[Sanford I. Weill]], [[E. B. White]] and [[Paul Wolfowitz]].

==Cornelliana==
[[Image:Dragon Day 1901.JPG|right|thumb|250px|[[Dragon Day]], one of the school's oldest traditions, has been celebrated since [[1901]].]]
:''See main article: [[Cornelliana]]''
Cornelliana is a term for Cornell's unique traditions, legends and lore. Cornellian traditions include [[Slope Day]], a celebration held on the last day of classes, and [[Dragon Day]], which includes the burning of a dragon built by architecture students. 

The school colors are [[carnelian]] (a shade of [[red]]) and [[white]], a play on &quot;Cornellian&quot; and Andrew Dickson White. Cornell's athletic teams are referred to as the &quot;[[Cornell Big Red|Big Red]]&quot;; a bear is commonly used as the unofficial mascot, which dates back to the introduction of the mascot &quot;Touchdown&quot; in 1915, a live bear who was brought onto the field during football games. The sports teams participate in the [[Ivy League]] and the [[Eastern College Athletic Conference]] (ECAC). At sporting events, Cornellians sing the university's [[alma mater]] &quot;[[Far Above Cayuga's Waters]]&quot; and [[fight song]] &quot;[[Give My Regards to Davy]]&quot;. People associated with the university are called &quot;[[Cornellians]]&quot;; &quot;Cornellian&quot; may also be used as an adjective and is the name of the university's [[yearbook]].

The university is legally known as ''Columbia University in the City of New York'', and is incorporated as ''The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York''. Its undergraduate schools are [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]], the [[Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science]] (SEAS), and the [[Columbia University School of General Studies|School of General Studies]].

The university is affiliated with [[Barnard College]] (an undergraduate liberal arts college for women and one of the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]]), [[Teachers College]], [[Jewish Theological Seminary]] and [[Union Theological Seminary]]. Through affiliation agreements, it is the university which awards degrees to graduates of [[Barnard College]] and [[Teachers College]].

== Campus ==
[[Image:Nyc_columbia.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Butler Library (June 2003)]]

Most of Columbia's graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in [[Morningside Heights]] on [[Seth Low]]'s late-19th century vision of a university campus where all disciplines could be taught in one location. This campus was designed by acclaimed architects [[McKim, Mead, and White]] and is considered one of their best works.

Columbia's main [[campus]] occupies more than six [[city block]]s, 32 acres (132,000 m&amp;sup2;), in the [[Morningside Heights]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]]. The university owns 7300 apartments in Morningside Heights, which house faculty, graduate students, and staff. Health-related schools are located at the [[Columbia University Medical Center]], twenty acres located about fifty blocks uptown.

[[Image:Columbia_College_Walk.jpg|thumb|200px|left|&quot;College Walk&quot; provides a public path between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue, and serves as the main campus quad.]]

Columbia also owns the 26 acre Baker Field, which has the facilities for field sports, outdoor track, tennis, and rowing at the northern tip of Manhattan island (in the neighborhood of [[Inwood]]).  There is a third campus on the west bank of the [[Hudson River]], the 157 acre Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in [[Palisades, New York]].

New buildings and structures on the campus have often only been constructed after a contentious process often involving open debate and protest over the new structures. Often the complaints raised by these protests during these periods have expansion have included issues beyond the debate over the construction of any of the architectural features which diverged from the original McKim, Mead, and White plan, and often involved complaints against the administration of the university. This was the case with Uris Hall which sits behind Low Library, which evolving from an original plan for a single building encompassing the area of Low and Uris and with Alfred Lerner Hall. Elements of these same issues have been reflected in the current debate over the future expansion of the campus into [[Manhattanville]], several blocks uptown from the current campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~tt2124/CUHist/ Evolution of Morningside]&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbia's library system includes 8.7 million bound volumes [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/opir/facts.html?libraries].  &lt;!--more content here --&gt;

== History ==
Columbia is the oldest institution of [[higher education]] in the state of [[New York]] and the sixth-oldest in the [[United States]].  Columbia has grown over time to comprise twenty schools and affiliated institutions.

In the early [[1750]]'s, clergymen of the [[Episcopal]]ian Trinity Church in [[New York City]] became alarmed by the [[Presbyterian]] founding of [[Princeton University ]](then known as the ''College of New Jersey'') [http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/kingsv1/biosketches.htm]. They established their own &quot;rival&quot; institution, ''[[King's College]]'' and elected as its first president [[Samuel Johnson (1696-1772)|Samuel Johnson]].  Classes began on [[July 17]], [[1754]], with Johnson being the sole faculty member.  A few months later, [[Great Britain]]'s [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] officially granted a [[royal charter]] for the college on [[October 31]], 1754.  

Controversy surrounded the founding of the new college in New York, as it was a thoroughly Anglican institution dominated by the influence of Crown officials in its governing body such as the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and the [[Crown Secretary for Plantations and Colonies]].  The fears of an [[Anglican]] episcopacy and Crown influence in America through [[King's College]] were confirmed by its vast wealth, far surpassing all other colonial colleges of the period.  Until the American Revolution, [[King's College]] would remain a bastion of Loyalists.  On the other hand, the College would produce the leading men of the Revolutionary generation.

After the [[American Revolutionary War]], King's College was renamed in [[1784]] to Columbia College, and Samuel Johnson's son, [[William Samuel Johnson]], became its president.  In [[1896]], it was renamed to Columbia University.

=== Park Place and Rockefeller Center ===
In July 1754, [[Samuel Johnson (1696-1772)|Samuel Johnson]] held the first classes in a new school house adjoining [[Trinity Church, New York|Trinity Church, Wall Street]], located on what is now lower [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]] in [[Manhattan]]. There were eight students in the class. In [[1767]] King's College established the first American medical school to grant the MD degree.

The [[American Revolutionary War]] brought the growth of the College to a halt, forcing a suspension of instruction in [[1776]] that lasted for eight years. Among the earliest students and trustees of King's College were [[John Jay]], the first [[Chief Justice of the United States]]; [[Alexander Hamilton]], the first [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]]; [[Gouverneur Morris]], the author of the final draft of the [[United States Constitution]]; and [[Robert R. Livingston]], a member of the five-man committee that drafted the [[Declaration of Independence]]. In 1784, the college reopened as Columbia College, reflecting the patriotic fervor which had inspired the nation's quest for independence.[[Image:Kings_college_1770.gif|thumb|King's College Hall, 1770]]

In 1849, the College moved from Park Place, near the present site of City Hall, to 49th Street and [[Madison Avenue]], where it remained for the next fifty years. During the last half of the nineteenth century, Columbia rapidly assumed the shape of a modern university. [[Columbia Law School]] was founded in 1858, and the country's first mining school, a precursor of today's [[Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science]], was established in 1864. [[Barnard College]] for women became affiliated with Columbia in 1889; the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]] came under the aegis of the University in 1891, followed by [[Teachers College]] in 1893.

The development of the Graduate Faculties in Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science established Columbia as one of the nation's earliest centers for graduate education.  By the close of the nineteenth century, Columbia was the world's leading producer of academic doctorates and was universally recognized as America's top research university.

=== Morningside Heights ===
In 1896, the trustees officially authorized the use of yet another new name, Columbia University, and today the institution is officially known as &quot;Columbia University in the City of New York.&quot; At the same time University president [[Seth Low]] moved the campus again from Rockefeller Center at 49th Street to its present location, a more spacious campus in the Morningside Heights area of [[Manhattan]].

[[Image:Columbia_low_plaza_3old.jpg|thumb|left|View of Columbia University's Low Library Plaza, c [[1900]] ]]

The building often depicted as emblematic of Columbia is the centerpiece of the Morningside Heights campus, the Low Library. Constructed in [[1895]], the building is still referred to as the &quot;Low Library&quot; although it has not functioned as a library since [[1934]]. It currently houses the office of the President and some archival collections. Patterned on the [[Parthenon]] and [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], it is surmounted by the largest all-granite dome in the United States.[http://www.gs.columbia.edu/kevinmap/lowmemorial.htm]

[[Image:Columbia University library.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Library in [[2005]].]]

Under the leadership of Low's successor, [[Nicholas Murray Butler]], Columbia rapidly became the nation's major institution for research, setting the &quot;multiversity&quot; model that later universities would adopt.  On the Morningside Heights campus, Columbia centralized on a single campus the College, the School of Law, the Graduate Faculties, the School of Mines (predecessor of the Engineering School), and the College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons.  Butler went on to serve as president of Columbia for over four decades and became a giant in American public life (as one-time [[vice-presidential|vice presidential]] candidate and a [[Nobel Laureate]]).  His introduction of &quot;downtown&quot; business practices in university administration led to innovations in internal reforms such as the centralization of academic affairs, the direct appointment of registrars, deans, provosts, and secretaries, as well as the formation of a professionalzed university bureaucracy, unprecedented among American universities at the time.

In 1893 the [[Columbia University Press]] was founded in order to &quot;promote the study of economic, historical, literary, scientific and other subjects; and to promote and encourage the publication of literary works embodying original research in such subjects.&quot; Among its publications are ''[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]],'' first published in 1935, and ''The Columbia Lippincott Gazetteer of the World,'' first published in 1952.

In 1902, New York newspaper magnate [[Joseph Pulitzer]] donated a substantial sum to the University for the founding of a school to teach journalism. The result was the 1912 opening of the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism|Graduate School of Journalism]]-- the only journalism school in the Ivy League. The school is the administrator of the [[Pulitzer Prize]] and the [[duPont-Columbia Award]] in broadcast journalism.

[[Columbia Business School]] was added in the early [[20th century]]. During the first half of the 20th Century Columbia and [[Harvard]] had the largest endowments in the country.

By the late [[1930s]], a Columbia student could study with the likes of [[Jacques Barzun]], [[Paul Lazarsfeld]], [[Mark Van Doren]], [[Lionel Trilling]], and [[I. I. Rabi]]. The University's graduates during this time were equally accomplished - for example, two alumni of Columbia's Law School, [[Charles Evans Hughes]] and [[Harlan Fiske Stone]] (who also held the position of Law School dean), served successively as Chief Justices of the United States. In the '50s, [[Dwight Eisenhower]] served as Columbia's president before becoming the President of the United States.

Research into the atom by faculty members [[John R. Dunning]], I. I. Rabi, [[Enrico Fermi]] and [[Polykarp Kusch]] placed Columbia's Physics Department in the international spotlight in the [[1940s]] after the first nuclear pile was built to start what would become the [[Manhattan Project]].

Following the end of [[World War II]] the School of International Affairs was founded in [[1946]].  Focusing on developing [[diplomat]]s and [[foreign affairs]] specialists the school began by offering the [[Masters in International Affairs]].  To satisfy an increasing desire for skilled [[civil service|public service]] professionals at home and abroad, the School added the [[Master of Public Administration]] degree in 1977. In 1981 the School was renamed the [[School of International and Public Affairs]] (SIPA).   The School introduced an MPA in [[Environmental Science]] and [[environmental policy|Policy]] in 2001 and, in 2004, SIPA inaugurated its first doctoral program - the interdisciplinary Ph.D. in [[Sustainable Development]].

=== Student demonstrations ===
{{main|Columbia University protests of 1968}}
Students protested in 1968 over the issue of whether Columbia would build its gymnasium in neighboring [[Morningside Park]]; this was seen by the protestors to be an act of aggression aimed at the Black residents of neighboring Harlem.  A second issue sparking the 1968 student protest was the Columbia Administration's failure to resign its institutional membership in the [[Pentagon]]'s weapons research think-tank, the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] [IDA].

=== Traditions ===

[[Image:Meadmoresculpture.jpg|thumb|right|Curl, by [[Clement Meadmore]].]]
[[Image:ColumbiaCampusSunset.JPG|thumb|right|Columbia's campus at sunset (February 2006)]]

==== Orgo Night ====
On the day before the Organic Chemistry Exam, at precisely the stroke of midnight, the [[Columbia University Marching Band]] occupies Butler library (the main library) to distract diligent students from studying and to lower the curve. After a half-hour of the campus-interest jokes, the procession then moves out to the lawn in front of Hartley, Wallach and John Jay residence halls to entertain the residents there.{{fact}}

==== Alma Mater ====
This refers to the statue that has been sitting on the steps in front of Low Library since 1904, and of which the university possesses three back-up versions in case of unforeseen rioting or some terrorist attack. Supersition has it that the first member of the class to discover the owl hidden in Alma Mater's robe will become valedictorian.{{fact}}

==== The [[Varsity Show]] ====
An annual musical written by and for students, this is one of Columbia's oldest and finest traditions.  Past writers and directors have included Columbians [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein]].

==== Butler Library====
The main library, packed during midterms and finals weeks, has three main parts: the stacks, the study rooms, and the cafe.  Butler houses two million of the university's 8.6 
million volumes, mostly in the humanities.  Unlike the libraries of most other schools, Butler remains partially open 24 hours a day and acts as a center of late night studying.

==== Tree-Lighting Ceremony====
College walk is the part of 116th street that passes through campus, and it was closed to the public while [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was university president in 1953. On the left and the right, just in front of Kent and Hamilton Hall on the east end, and Dodge and Journalism on the west side are planted some medium-sized trees. These are lit annually just before finals week in early december, and the lights remain on until mid-march. Students meet at the sun-dial for free hot chocolate, performances by various a capella groups, a guest speaker, and a speech by the university president.{{fact}}

==== Naked Run ====
Each year in October, some students run from the steps in front of Low around one of the lawns, pass Butler, and return to the steps, naked, surrounded by a crowd. {{fact}}

==== First Year Run ====
During orientation week before their first classes, freshmen get the rare opportunity to exit Lerner Hall through its back doors, turn right and enter campus again through the main gates to officially become Columbia students.{{fact}}

==== Annual Bad Poetry Contest ====
The Columbia Philolexian Society hosts this once a year. Contestants get up and read their poetry, hoping for cheers. Past worst poets include Everett Patterson and Matthew Harrison.{{fact}}

=== Sundial ===
This elevated stone pedestal at the center of the main campus quadrangle now serves as a podest for various speeches. Originally there was a large granite sphere located upon the pedestal, which would mark the time via its shadow. It sat upon the pedestal from approximately 1914 to 1946. It was removed in that year due to cracks that formed within it. The ball was assumed destroyed for 55 years until it was discovered intact in a Michigan field in 2001. As of 2006, is unlikely that the sundial will ever be restored back to a working state. [http://www.columbiaspectator.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2001/12/05/3c0de9f044e89?in_archive=1]

=== Dormitories ===
First years usually live in one of the first year dorms: Hartley, Wallach, John Jay, Furnald, or Carman. Upperclassmen participate in a housing lottery. Based on their luck, students can choose between the aforementioned dorms (but not Carman or John Jay), and Schapiro, River, McBain, East Campus, Broadway, Watt, 116th, Hogan, and Wien.  Most students consider a town house in East Campus the best housing option, which includes two-story suites for six students including a kitchen, common lounge, large single rooms, and a quiet location.

=== The tunnels ===
A tunnel system connects all campus buildings underground, but it has been shut down since the student riots of 1968. Part of the system is still accessible, however, and being used as a safe way to move without getting wet or snowed on. (See [[Columbia University Tunnels]].)

=== CULPA ===
Invented in 2002, this website allows students to post their own analyses of their professors. It is a useful tool for students looking to enroll in a class. The site has occasionally been accused of harboring biased reviews and misrepresenting professors. Still, it is the main source of professor review currently available to the Columbia student body. The acronym CULPA stands for &quot;Columbia Underground Listing of Professor Ability&quot;, where &quot;Underground&quot; refers to the fact that CULPA is not officially affiliated with the university. It can be found at [[http://www.culpa.info.]]

=== Publications===
Major publications include The ''[[Columbia Review]]'',[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/review] the nation's oldest college literary magazine ; The ''[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]'',[http://www.columbiaspectator.com] the nation's second-oldest student newspaper; CTV,[2] the nation's second oldest student television station; The Fed,[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/thefed/] an alternative humor paper; ''[[Jester of Columbia]]'',[http://www.jesterofcolumbia.com], the revived campus humor magazine established in 1899 and edited at one point by Allen Ginsberg; ; The ''[[Blue &amp; White]]'',[http://www.theblueandwhite.org/] a literary magazine established in 1890; the Collection, an undergraduate literary magazine; and the Journal of Politics &amp; Society,[6] the nation's leading journal of advanced undergraduate research in the social sciences, published by the Helvidius Group. Columbia also has an online arts and literary web magazine The Mobius Strip[http://www.mobiusmag.com/]. This year, a group of undergraduates also started AdHoc, an undergraduate magazine that grapples with progressive issues on campus.

===Athletics===
While Columbia is no longer an athletics powerhouse, sports at Columbia have a long tradition. [[Sport rowing|Crew]] was Columbia's first sport, and the first non-English school to win the [[Henley Regatta]]. The Columbia football team is one of the nation's oldest and won the [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] in 1934. Its [[amateur wrestling|wrestling]] team is the nation's oldest.  Due to space constraints, most of Columbia's outdoor athletic teams practice and compete uptown at Baker Field in [[Inwood, Manhattan]].  The rowing teams use the [[Orchard Beach, New York|Orchard Beach Lagoon]] as their home course.  Home meets for [[cross country running]] are held at [[Van Cortlandt Park]] in the [[Bronx]].

Columbia has been home to some famous athletes - [[Eddie Collins]] and [[Lou Gehrig]] played baseball and [[Sid Luckman]] played football there. Columbia's [[fencing]] team in the late 20th century was one of the nation's most successful, with [[NCAA]] [[NCAA Fencing team championship|team championships]] in 1987, 1988, 1989, 1992 and 1993.  In recent years, the women's [[cross country running|cross country]] team has held the Heptagonal Championship title.  In 2004, both the men's and women's teams won the race.

The university's recent notoriety in sports, however, lies with its [[American football|football]] team, which set an NCAA record of most consecutive football games without a win. After a losing 44 games, it broke the streak by beating [[Princeton University|Princeton]] at Columbia's [[homecoming game]] in 1988. Their dubious record was superseded by [[Prairie View A&amp;M]] in the 1990s. 

Although Columbia routinely finishes at or near the bottom of the [[Ivy League]] standings in most sports, the university remains among the top 20 universities in terms of its number of [[NCAA]] [[Division I]] varsity sports offerings. 

For a listing of organizations, see the article [[Clubs and Organizations of Columbia University]].

==Awards and honors==
As of 2005, 73 Columbia University affiliates have been honored with Nobel Prizes for their work in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, peace, and economics. For a complete list, see [http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/nobel_laureates/by_year.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''cell wall''' is a more or less solid layer surrounding a [[cell (biology)|cell]]. They are found in [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[archaea]], [[fungus|fungi]], [[plant]]s, and [[alga]]e. [[Animal]]s and most other [[protist]]s have [[cell membrane]]s without surrounding cell walls. When a cell wall is removed using cell wall degrading [[enzyme]]s, what is left of the cell and its surrounding plasma membrane is called a [[protoplast]]. The cell wall's main purpose is to actually protect the interior from any physical movement that may damage the cell.

== Plant cell walls ==

Plant cell walls have a number of functions: they provide rigidity to the cell for structural and mechanical support, maintaining cell shape, the direction of cell growth and ultimately the architecture of the plant. The cell wall also prevents expansion when water enters the cell. The term [[turgor]] is used to describe this pressure that is induced by excess water inside the plant cell. Cell walls protect against [[pathogen]]s and the environment and are a store of [[carbohydrate]]s for the plant.  The cell wall is constructed primarily from a carbohydrate [[polymer]] called [[cellulose]].

The ''primary cell wall'', built by the plant first, is composed of cellulose [[microfibril]]s aligned at all angles. Microfibrils are held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s to provide a high tensile strength. Cell walls of neighbouring cells are held together by a shared gelatinous membrane called the ''middle lamella'', which contains [[magnesium]] and [[calcium]] [[pectate]]s (salts of [[pectic acid]]).Cells interact though [[plasmodesma]](ta), which are inter-connecting channels of cytoplasm that connect to the protoplasts of adjacent cells across the cell wall.

In some plants and cell types, after a maximum size or point in development has been reached, a ''secondary wall'' is constructed below the primary wall. Unlike the primary wall, the microfibrils are aligned mostly in the same direction, and with each additional layer the orientation changes slightly. Cells with secondary cell walls are rigid. Cell to cell communication is possible through ''pits'' in the secondary cell wall that allow plasmodesma to connect cells through the secondary cell walls.

===Composition of plant cell walls===

The major carbohydrates making up the primary cell wall are [[cellulose]], [[pectin]] and [[hemicellulose]]. Insoluble cellulose fibers are meshed in to a matrix called pectin and ''hemicelluloses''; they give the plant strength and support. 

Plant cells walls also incorporate a number of [[protein]]s; the most abundant include hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGP), also called the extensins, the arabinogalactan proteins (AGP), the glycine-rich proteins (GRPs), and the proline-rich proteins (PRPs). With the exception of glycine-rich proteins, all the previously mentioned proteins are [[glycosylation|glycosylated]] and contain [[hydroxyproline]] (Hyp). Each class of glycoprotein is defined by a characteristic, highly repetitive protein sequence. Chimeric proteins contain two or more different domains, each with a sequence from a different class of glycoprotein. Most cell wall proteins are cross-linked to the cell wall and may have structural functions. 

Secondary cell walls may contain [[lignin]] and [[suberin]], making the walls rigid. 

The relative composition of carbohydrates, secondary compounds and protein varies between plants and between the cell type and age.

==Algal cell walls==
Like plants, algae have cell walls (Sendbusch, 2003). Algal cell walls contain cellulose and a variety of glycoproteins. The inclusion of additional polysaccharides in algal cells walls is used as a feature for algal taxonomy.

*[[Manosyl]] form microfibrils in the cell walls of a number of marine [[green algae]] including those from the genera, ''Codium'', ''Dasycladus'', and ''Acetabularia'' as well as in the walls of some [[red algae]], like ''Porphyra'' and ''Bangia''.
*Xylanes
*[[Alginic acid]] is a common polysaccharide in the cell walls of [[brown algae]]
*Sulfonated polysaccharides occur in the cell walls of most algae; those common in red algae include [[agarose]], [[carrageenan]], [[porphyran]], [[furcelleran]] and [[funoran]].

Other compounds that may accumulate in algal cell walls include [[sporopollenin]] and [[calcium]].

The group of [[algae]] known as the [[diatom|diatoms]] synthesise their cell walls (also known as frustules or valves) from [[silicic acid]] (specifically orthosilicic acid, H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The acid is [[polymer|polymerised]] intra-cellularly, then the wall is extruded to protect the cell. Significantly, relative to the organic cell walls produced by other groups, silica frustules require less energy to synthesize (approximately 8%), potentially a major saving on the overall cell energy budget (Raven, 1983).

== Prokaryotic cell walls ==

Cell walls of bacteria are primarily used for protection against hostile environments or, in the case of [[pathogen]]ic bacteria, against the [[immune system]] of the [[Host (biology)|host]]. They contain [[peptidoglycan]], which can be made visible in [[Gram-positive]] bacteria by [[Gram staining]]. The cell walls of bacteria are also vital for containing the high [[turgor|osmotic pressure]] inside bacterial cells caused by the high concentration of [[solute]]s in the [[cytoplasm]]. This pressure can often be as high as 15 atmospheres. Many [[antibiotic]]s, including [[penicillin]] and its derivatives, target the cell wall of bacteria.

The cell walls of [[archaea]] are not made of peptidoglycan, but some archaea may contain [[pseudopeptidoglycan]], which is composed of [[N-acetyltalosaminuronic acid]], instead of [[N-acetyl muramic acid]] in peptidoglycan.

== Fungal cell walls ==

Not all species of fungi have cell walls but in those that do, the cell walls are composed of cellulose, glucosamine, and [[chitin]], the same carbohydrate that gives strength to the [[exoskeleton]]s of [[insect]]s. They serve a similar purpose to those of plant cells, giving fungal cells rigidity and strength to hold their shape and preventing [[osmotic lysis]]. It also limits the entry of molecules that may be toxic to the fungus, like plant-produced and synthetic [[fungicide]]s. 

The composition, properties, and form of the fungal cell wall change during the cell cycle and depend on growth conditions.

{{classic element}}
Many [[ancient]] [[philosophies]] use a set of [[archetypal]] '''classical elements''' to explain [[pattern]]s in [[nature]].  The [[Greece|Greek]] version of these ideas, which dates from pre-Socratic times, persisted throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[Renaissance]], deeply influencing [[European]] [[thought]] and [[culture]]; but the concept is far older in the Far East, and was widely disseminated in [[India]] and [[China]], where it forms the basis of both [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]], particularly in an [[esoteric]] context.

The modern scientific [[periodic table]] of the [[chemical element|elements]] and the understanding of [[combustion]] (fire) can be considered successors to such early models.

==Classical elements in Greece==
The [[Hellenic civilization|Greek]] classical elements are [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Air (classical element)|Air]], and [[Water (classical element)|Water]] (Latin derivatives are ''pyro, terra, aero,'' and ''aqua'').  They represent in [[Greek philosophy]], [[science]], and [[medicine]] the realms of the [[cosmos]] wherein all things exist and whereof all things consist.

[[Plato]] mentions them as of [[The Presocratics|Pre-Socratic]] origin, a list created by the ancient [[philosopher]] [[Empedocles]].

* [[Fire (classical element)|'''Fire''']] is both hot and dry.
* [[Earth (classical element)|'''Earth''']] is both cold and dry.
* [[Air (classical element)|'''Air''']] is both hot and wet.
* [[Water (classical element)|'''Water''']] is both cold and wet.

[[image:Four elements representation.png|right|Four Classical Elements]]
One classic diagram (right) has two squares on top of each other, with the corners of one being the classical elements, and the corners of the other being the properties.

According to [[Galen]], these elements were used by [[Hippocrates]] in describing the [[human body]] with an association with the [[four humours]]:  yellow [[bile]] (Fire), [[Melancholia|black bile]] (Earth), [[blood]] (Air), and [[phlegm]] (Water).

Some [[Cosmology|cosmologies]] include a fifth element, the &quot;[[quintessence]].&quot;  These five elements are sometimes associated with the five [[platonic solid]]s.  

The [[Pythagoras|Pythagoreans]] added [[idea]] as the fifth element, and also used the initial letters of these five elements to name the outer angles of their [[pentagram]].

[[Aristotle]] added [[aether]] as the quintessence, rationalizing that whereas Fire, Earth, Air, and Water were earthly and corruptible, the [[star|stars]] were eternal (&quot;aether&quot; is based on [[Greek language|Greek]] for [[eternity]]) and were thus not made out of any of the four elements but rather a heavenly substance. The word ''aether'' was revived by late [[19th century]] [[physicists]] as a term for the proposed invisible medium which permeated the [[universe]], the ''[[luminiferous aether]]''.

Some [[occult|occultists]] have noted that in modern [[science]] the general rule is that most visible matter can be classified as either a [[solid]] (Earth), [[liquid]] (Water), [[gas]] (Air), or [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] (Fire).  By extension, more exotic [[Phase (matter)|phases of matter]] (such as [[Bose-einstein condensate]]) are sometimes seen as representative forms of a fifth element (Aether).

In [[1987]] [[composer]] [[Robert Steadman]] wrote a chamber [[symphony]] each [[movement]] of which musically depicts the characteristics of the [[Ancient Greek]] [[classical element|elements]]: Fire, Water, Wind and Earth.

==Classical elements in China==
{{main|Five elements (Chinese philosophy)}}

In [[Taoism]] there is a similar system of elements, which includes [[Metal (classical element)|Metal]] and [[Wood (classical element)|Wood]], but excludes Air. The five major [[planet]]s are associated with and named after the elements: [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] is Metal, [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] is Wood, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] is Water, [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] is Fire, and [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]] is Earth. Additionally, the [[Moon]] represents [[Yin Yang|Yin]], and the [[Sun]] represents [[Yin Yang|Yang]]. Yin, Yang, and the five elements are recurring themes in the [[I Ching]], the oldest of Chinese classical texts which describes an ancient system of [[cosmology]] and [[philosophy]].

==Classical elements in Hinduism==
{{main|Tattva}}

The ''Panchamahabhuta,'' or &quot;[[five]] great elements,&quot; of  [[Hinduism]] are ''[[Prithvi]]'' or ''[[Bhumi]]'' ([[earth (classical element)|Earth]]), ''[[Aap|Ap]]'' or ''Jala'' ([[water (classical element)|Water]]), ''[[Agni]]'' or ''[[Tejas]]'' ([[fire (classical element)|Fire]]), ''[[Vayu]]'' or ''Pavan'' ([[air (classical element)|Air]] or [[Wind]]), and ''[[Akasha]]'' ([[Aether]], in both it's [[aether (classical element)|elemental]] and [[aether (mythology)|mythological]] senses)

==Classical elements in Japan==
{{main|Five elements (Japanese philosophy)}}

[[Japan]]ese traditions use a set of elements called the 五大 (''go dai'', literally &quot;five great&quot;).  These five are [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[water (classical element)|water]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[wind (classical element)|wind]], and [[void (classical element)|void]].  These came from Buddhist beliefs; the classical Chinese elements (五行, ''go gyô'') are also prominent in Japanese culture.

==Classical elements during the [[Middle Ages]]==
During [[medieval]] times, the idea of the classical elements was known. Just as the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[dogma]] was related to the Greek world view, the idea of classical elements in the Middle Ages composed a large part of the medieval [[world view]]. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] supported the Aristotelian concept of [[aether]] because it supported the [[Christianity|Christian]] view of earthly life as impermanent and [[heaven]] as eternal. References to the classical elements in [[medieval]] [[literature]] are numerous and can be seen in the work of many writers, including  [[William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare]]:

:Thou hast as chiding a nativity
:As '''fire, air, water, earth, and heaven''' can make,
:To herald thee from the womb
::-PERICLES, from [[Pericles Prince of Tyre]]

:The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
:Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
:Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
:Whether in '''sea or fire, in earth or air''',
:The extravagant and erring spirit hies
:To his confine
::-HORATIO, from [[Hamlet|Hamlet, Prince of Denmark]]

==Astrology and the classical elements==
{{main|astrology and the classical elements}}

[[Astrology]] has used the concept of classical elements from antiquity up until the present. Most modern [[astrologers]] use the four classical elements extensively, and indeed it is still viewed as a critical part of interpreting the [[natal chart|astrological chart]].

==[[Tarot]] and the classical elements==
The [[tarot]] suits of cups, wands, swords and pentacles may be taken as corresponding to water, air, fire, and earth respectively. These correspond in the modern deck of [[playing cards]] to hearts, clubs, spades and diamonds.

==Classical elements in popular culture==
{{main|Classical elements in pop culture}}

The classical elements are often used together thematically in modern [[fantasy]], [[literature]], [[Film|movie]]s, [[television show]]s, and [[comic book]]s.  Typically, a magic wielder has the ability to influence one of the elements, or can use the elements to affect the world around him.

{{classic element}}

'''Fire''' has been important to all peoples of the earth, and it is rich in spiritual tradition.

== Western concepts of Fire ==

Fire is one of the four [[classical element]]s in ancient [[Greek philosophy]] and science.  [[Prometheus]] stole fire from the gods to protect the otherwise helpless humans, and was tortured for his kindness.  Fire is considered to be both hot and dry, and according to [[Plato]] is associated with the [[tetrahedron]].

In [[Wicca]]n tradition, it is associated with the South, Summer, and the color red on the physical plane.  It is sometimes represented by a red triangle, the athame, blood, candles, the guitar, rubies, and incense.  Fire represents energy, inspiration, passion, and masculinity.  In rituals, Fire is represented in the forms of burning objects, love spells, baking, and lighting candles and fires.

The manifestations of the Element of Fire are the sun, lightning, fires, volcanoes and lava, all forms of light, and ovens.  Cats of all types, especially the lion and tiger, are also thought to personify the element of Fire, as are all predatory creatures, such as the fox.  Astral creatures of Fire (elementals) are the Salamander, Phoenix, Drake/Dragon and the Falcon (Although most associate this with Air).  Fire’s place on the pentagram is the lower right point. Fire is represented by the Greeks, an apple-bough and in Christian iconography by a lion.

== Non-Western concepts of Fire ==

In China and Japan Fire is represented by a red bird; in the Aztec religion, by a flint; to the Hindus, a lightning bolt; to the Scythians, an axe.

'''Air''' is one of the four [[classical element]]s in ancient [[Greek philosophy]] and science.  Air is considered to be both hot and wet, and according to Plato is associated with the [[octahedron]].  It is associated with many other concepts, including the [[wand]] suit in the [[tarot]].

In some Wiccan traditions, it is associated with the East, Spring, and the color green on the physical plane.  Air is represented by a green circle, the flute, feathers, the wand, breath, the fan, glass, bells and windchimes, diamonds, whistles, and incense.  Air represents intelligence, communication, psychic powers, and masculinity.  In rituals, Air is represented in the forms of tossing objects into the wind, aromatherapy, songs, and suspending things in high places.

In other Wiccan traditions, Air is associated with the North, Winter, and the color yellow.  The other correspondences are generally the same.

The manifestations of the Element of Air are breezes, the sky, windstorms, clouds, and birdsong.  Birds, especially the eagle and the hawk, are also thought to personify the element of Air, as are most things that fly, such as butterflies.  Astral creatures of Air (elementals) are the Sylph/Zephyr, Faerie, Djinn, and Griffin.  Air’s place on the pentagram is the upper left point.  In China and Japan Air was represented by a blue dragon; in the Aztec religion, by a rabbit; to the Scythians, a yoke; to the Hindus and Greeks, a sword; and in Christian iconography by an eagle.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Saint Columbanus''' ([[543]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; [[21 November]] [[615]]; also '''Columban'''), was an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[missionary]] notable for founding a number of [[monastery|monasteries]] on the European continent and therefore as an exemplar of Irish missionary activity in early medieval Europe. He is also one of the earliest identifiable [[Hiberno-Latin]] writers.

Born in [[Leinster]], Ireland, he went to the European continent sometime around [[590]].

Columbanus founded several monasteries in the [[Franks|Frankish]] kingdoms, most notably [[Luxeuil-les-Bains|Luxeuil]] in [[590]], spreading among the Franks a [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic]] monastic rule and Celtic penitential practices for those repenting of sins.  These practices emphasized private confession to a priest, followed by penances levied by the priest in reparation for the sin.

Because of political difficulties with bishops and [[Merovingian]] kings, including disagreement over the date for the celebration of [[Easter]], Columbanus moved south into [[Italy]] in about [[612]], where, with the help of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] King [[Agilulf]] and Queen [[Theodelinda]], he established his final and most important monastery at [[Bobbio]] (between [[Milan]] and [[Genoa]]). He died there in 615. (This monastery is in part the model for the great monastery in [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]''.)

The main source for Columbanus's life or '''vita''' is recorded by [[Jonas of Bobbio]], a monk who entered the monastery in Bobbio in [[618]], three years after the saint's death. In his vita, Columbanus is reported to have performed a miracle in [[Bregenz]]: The townpeople had placed a large vessel in the town center, filled with beer. They told Columbanus it was intended as a sacrifice to their god [[Wodan]] (''Illi aiunt se Deo suo Vodano nomine''), whom they identified with Roman [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]. Angrily, Columbanus breathed on the vessel, which broke asunder with a loud noise, spilling the beer.

A number of writings of Columbanus survive, including a monastic rule (the ''Regula monachorum''), a number of letters, and some poetry. These provide some of the earliest evidence for Irish knowledge of Latin.

Columbanus is not to be confused with his near contemporary, Saint [[Columba]], otherwise known as [[Columba|Columcille]].

The '''Clean Air Act''' (CAA) of [[1970]] is a [[United States environmental law]] that requires the [[United States]] [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to develop and enforce regulations to protect the general public from exposure to [[air pollution|airborne contaminants]] that are known to be hazardous to human health. 

In accordance with Sections 111 and 112 of the CAA, EPA established [[New Source Performance Standard]]s (NSPS) and [[National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants]] (NESHAP) to protect the public.

The Clean Air Act was made federal law in 1970 and is listed under the 42 U.S.C.A. §§7401.  The Clean Air Act is significant in that it was the first major [[environmental law]] in the United States to include a provision for [[citizen suit]]s.

==Enforcement by states==
In the creation of the act the federal government charges the US Environmental Protection Agency with enforcing the CAA in 49 states (California is exempt). However, the EPA has allowed the individual states to elect responsibility for compliance with and regulation of the CAA within their own borders in exchange for funding.  The election is not mandatory and in some cases states have chosen to not accept responsibility for enforcement of the act and force the EPA to assume those duties.  In order to take over compliance with the CAA the states must write and submit a [[State Implementation Plan]] (SIP) to the EPA for approval. The SIP must meet the minimum criteria established by the EPA. The SIP becomes the state&amp;rsquo;s legal guide for local enforcement of the CAA. 
===Example - Rhode Island===
The Rhode Island General Law Title 23 Chapter 23 Section 2 (RIGL 23-23-2) states that it is a state policy requirement to comply with the Federal CAA (42 USC s/s 7401) through the SIP.  The state SIP delegates permitting and enforcement responsibility to the state Dept. of Environmental Management (RI-DEM).  

In accordance with the requirements of the CAA, RI-DEM issues air release permits to large stationary sources of pollution such as power plants and factories. The permitting process requires a monitoring plan to be created and sets limits on the amounts and types of releases allowed. The information contained in this permit is made available to both the polluter, other agencies, and the public.  

These permits are known as &amp;lsquo;part 70&amp;rsquo; permits because they are related to the federal minimums in 40 CFR part 70. These permits are also known as &amp;lsquo;title V&amp;rsquo; permits because they are required by title V of the CAA amendments of 1990. The title V permit is meant to contain all the requirements for emissions from the permitted source.  The permit requires &amp;lsquo;regular&amp;rsquo; reporting, monitoring, and annual certification of compliance &amp;ndash; (all of which is information which is made public). 

The permit information is available online through the EPA ECHO (Enforcement and Compliance History Online) database and the state permits themselves are available online through the RI-DEM website.

'''Concord''' is the capital of [[New Hampshire]], a [[U.S. state|state]] of the [[United States|United States of America]].  As of the [[2000]] census, it has a population of 40,687. (2003 Est. 41,378)  It is the [[county seat]] of [[Merrimack County, New Hampshire|Merrimack County]].

Concord is the home of [[Franklin Pierce Law Center]], the only [[law school]] in New Hampshire, and the prep school [[St. Paul's School (Concord, NH)|St. Paul's School]].

== History ==
[[Image:Concordcapitolsign.jpg|left|thumb|Sign Outside of The State Capitol]]
The land which Concord now occupies along the banks of the [[Merrimack River]] was settled thousands of years ago by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. The broad sweeps of the river valley, good soil for farming, and easy transportation on the Merrimack made the site of Concord equally inviting to [[English language|English]]-speaking settlers in the [[18th century]].  During the 18th century the community grew in prominence. Some of Concord's earliest houses remain today at the north end of Main Street. 

The city was settled by immigrants from [[Massachusetts]] in 1727 as '''Penacook'''. In 1733, it was incorporated as '''[[Rumford]]''', and in 1765,  the name was changed to Concord.  In the years following the [[American Revolution]], Concord's central location made it a logical choice for the state capital, and in 1808 it was named the official seat of state government. Today the 1819 [[New Hampshire State House|State House]] is the oldest state capitol in which the legislative branches meet in their original chambers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Classical education''' as understood and taught in the [[middle ages]] of [[Western culture]] is roughly based on the [[ancient Greek]] concept of [[Paideia]].  [[China]] had a completely different tradition of classical education, based in large part on [[Confucian]] and [[Taoist]] traditions.  This article concerns the Western tradition.

== The overall organization ==

Classical education developed many of the terms now used to describe modern [[education]].  Western classical education has three phases, each with a different purpose.  The phases are roughly coordinated with human development, and would ideally be exactly coordinated with each individual student's development.

&quot;Primary education&quot; teaches students how to learn. 

&quot;Secondary education&quot; then teaches a conceptual framework that can hold all human knowledge (history), and then fills in basic facts and practices of the major fields of knowledge, and develops the skills (perhaps in a simplified form) of every major human activity. 

&quot;Tertiary education&quot; then prepares a person to pursue an educated profession, such as law, theology, war, medicine or science.

=== Primary Education ===

Primary education was often called the ''[[trivium]]'', which covered grammar, logic, and rhetoric.

Logic and rhetoric was often taught in part by the [[Socratic method]], in which the teacher raises questions and the class discusses them. By controlling the pace, the teacher can keep the class very lively, yet disciplined.

==== Grammar ====

Grammar consists of [[language]] skills such as reading and the mechanics of writing. An important goal of grammar is to acquire as many words and concepts as possible. Very young students can learn these by rote.  Classical education traditionally included study of [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], so that students could read the [[Classics]] of [[Western Civilization]] in the words of the authors.

==== Logic ====

[[Logic]] ([[dialectic]]) is the art of correct [[reasoning]]. The traditional text for teaching logic was [[Aristotle]]'s [[Aristotelian logic|Logic]].

==== Rhetoric ====

[[Rhetoric]] debate and composition (which is just written rhetoric) are taught to somewhat older students, who then have the concepts and logic to criticize their own work and persuade others. According to [[Aristotle]] &quot;Rhetoric is the counterpart of dialectic.&quot;  It is concerned with finding &quot;all the available means of persuasion.&quot;     Hopefully a student has already learned to reason correctly by studying logic.  Students would read and emulate classical poets such as [[Ovid]].

=== Secondary Education ===

Secondary education, classically the ''[[quadrivium]]'' or &quot;four ways,&quot; classically taught [[astronomy]], [[arithmetic]], [[music]] and [[geometry]], usually from Aristotle and [[Euclid]].  Sometimes [[architecture]] was taught, often from the works of [[Vitruvius]].

History was always taught to provide a context, and show political and military development.  The classic texts were from ancient authors such as [[Cicero]] and [[Tacitus]].  

Biographies were often assigned as well; the classic example being [[Plutarch]]'s &quot;Lives.&quot;  Biographies help show how persons behave in their context, and the wide ranges of professions and options that exist.  As more modern texts became available, these were often added to the curriculum.

In the [[middle ages]], these were the best available texts.  In modern terms, these fields might be called [[history]], natural [[science]], [[accounting]] and [[business]], [[fine art]]s (at least two, one to amuse companions, and another to decorate one's domicile), [[military strategy]] and [[tactics]], [[engineering]], [[agronomy]], and [[architecture]].

These are taught in a matrix of history, reviewing the natural development of each field for each phase of the trivium. That is, in a perfect classical education, the historical study is reviewed three times: first to learn the grammar (the concepts, terms and skills in the order developed), next time the logic (how these elements could be assembled), and finally the rhetoric, how to produce good, humanly useful and beautiful objects that satisfy the grammar and logic of the field. 

History is the unifying conceptual framework, because history is the study of everything that has occurred before the present. A skillful teacher also uses the historical context to show how each stage of development naturally poses questions and then how advances answer them, helping to understand human motives and activity in each field. The question-answer approach is called the &quot;dialectic method,&quot; and permits history to be taught Socratically as well. 

Classical educators consider the [[Socrates|Socratic]] method to be the best technique for teaching critical thinking.  In-class discussion and critiques are essential in order for students to recognize and internalize critical thinking techniques. This method is widely used to teach both [[philosophy]] and [[law]].  It is currently rare in other contexts.  Basically, the teacher referees the students' discussions, asks leading questions, and may refer to facts, but never gives a conclusion until at least one student reaches that conclusion.  The learning is most effective when the students compete strongly, even viciously in the argument, but always according to well-accepted rules of correct reasoning.  That is, [[fallacy|fallacies]] should not be allowed by the teacher.

By completing a project in each major field of human effort, the student can develop a personal preference for further education and professional training.

=== Tertiary Education ===

Tertiary education was usually an [[apprentice|apprenticeship]] to a person with the desired profession.  Most often, the understudy was called a &quot;secretary&quot; and had the duty of carrying on all the normal business of the &quot;master.&quot; [[Philosophy]] and [[Theology]] were both widely taught as tertiary subjects in Universities however.

The early biographies of nobles show probably the ultimate form of classical education: A tutor.  One early, much-emulated classic example was that [[Alexander the Great]] was tutored by [[Aristotle]].

== Modern Interpretations of Classical Education ==
 
&quot;The Well-Trained Mind: A Guide to Classical Education at Home,&quot; by Jessie Wise and Susan Wise Bauer (W.W. Norton, 1999), is a modern reference on classical education. It provides a history of classical education, an overview of the methodology and philosophy of classical education, and annotated lists of books, divided by grade and topic, that list the best books for classical education in each category.

[[Marva Collins]] has successfully taught a rapid-fire classical education to inner-city deprived children, many of them labeled as &quot;retarded.&quot;

Also of note is &quot;[http://www.sigmaxi.org/meetings/archive/forum.2001.online.tri.shtml|A New Trivium and Quadrivium],&quot; an article by Dr. George Bugliarello (Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society, Vol. 23, No. 2, 106-113 (2003)). In it, he argues that the scope of the classical liberal education is inadequate for today's society, and that people should also be conversant with the basic facts of science and technology, since they now form a much more important part of our lives than did the tertiary studies of antiquity. He argues for a new synthesis of science, engineering, and the humanities in which there is a balance between what ''can'' be done and what ''ought'' to be done, between human desires and earthly consequences, and between our ever-increasing power to affect our surroundings and the ever-present danger of destroying the ecological and environmental systems which allow us to exist. 

No discussion of classical education could be complete without mentioning [[Mortimer Adler]] and [[Robert Hutchins]], both of the [[University of Chicago]], who set forth in the 1930s to restore the &quot;Great Books&quot; of Western civilization to center stage in the curriculum. Although the standard classical works&amp;mdash;such as the [[Harvard Classics]]&amp;mdash;most widely available at the time, were decried by many as out of touch with modern times, Adler and Hutchins sought to expand on the standard &quot;classics&quot; by including more modern works, and by trying to tie them together in the context of what they described as the &quot;Great Ideas,&quot; condensed into a &quot;Syntopicon&quot; index and bundled together with a new &quot;five foot shelf&quot; of books as &quot;The [[Great Books of the Western World]].&quot; They were wildly popular during the Fifties, and discussion groups of aficionados were found all over the USA, but their popularity waned during the Sixties and such groups are relatively hard to find today.  Extensions to the original set are still being published, encompassing selections from both current and older works which extend the &quot;great ideas&quot; into the present age and other fields, including civil rights, the global environment, and discussions of multiculturalism and assimilation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:CatherineAragon.jpg|thumb|The recently-widowed young Catherine of Aragon, by [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]'s court painter, Michael Sittow, c. 1502]]
'''Catherine of Aragon''' ([[December 16]], [[1485]] &amp;ndash; [[January 7]], [[1536]]; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: '''Catalina de Aragón''') was [[queen consort]] of [[England]] as [[Henry VIII of England]]'s first [[Wives of Henry VIII|wife]]. Henry [[Annulment|annulled]] his twenty-four year marriage to her after only one of their six children, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], survived infancy.

==Princess of Aragon and Castille==
Born in [[Alcalá de Henares]], Catherine was the youngest surviving child of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella of Castille|Isabella I of Castile]] and, as a third-great-granddaughter of [[Edward III of England]], a fourth cousin of both [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and his wife [[Elizabeth of York]].

==Princess of Wales==
Catherine first married [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Prince Arthur]], the oldest son of [[Henry VII of England]], in [[1501]]. As [[Prince of Wales]], Arthur was sent to [[Ludlow Castle]] on the borders of [[Wales]], to preside over the Council of Wales, and Catherine accompanied him.  A few months later, both of them fell prey to an infection which was sweeping the area.  Catherine herself nearly died; she recovered to find herself a [[widow]]. Catherine testified that, because of the couple's youth, the marriage had not been [[consummate]]d;  [[Pope Julius II]] then issued a dispensation, so that Catherine could become betrothed to Arthur's younger brother, the future [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].

==Queen consort of England==
{{Henryviiiwives}}
The marriage did not take place until after Henry VIII ascended the throne in [[1509]], the marriage on [[June 11]], followed by the coronation on [[June 24]], [[1509]]. Both as Princess of Wales and as Queen, Catherine was extremely popular with the people. She governed the nation as [[Regent]] while Henry invaded France in [[1513]].

Henry VIII supposedly married Catherine of Aragon at his father's dying wish and was happily-enough married to her, although not faithful, for 18 years, until he became seriously worried about getting a male heir to his throne as she approached [[menopause]]. Her first child was [[stillborn]] in [[1510]]. Prince [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall]] was born in [[1511]] but died after 52 days. Catherine then had a [[miscarriage]], followed by another short-lived son. On [[February 18]], [[1516]] at the [[Palace of Placentia]] in [[Greenwich, London]], she gave birth to a daughter named Mary (later Queen [[Mary I of England]]). There was another miscarriage in [[1518]]. A male [[heir]] was essential to Henry. The [[Tudor dynasty]] was new, and its legitimacy might still be tested. No queen had ever ruled England successfully in her own right. The disasters of [[civil war]]  were still fresh in living memory from the [[Wars of the Roses]] ([[1455]] &amp;ndash; [[1487]]).

[[Image:oldcath.JPG|left|frame|Catherine at the time Henry began his affair with Anne Boleyn]]

In [[1520]], Catherine's nephew [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] paid a state visit to England, and the Queen urged the policy of gaining his alliance rather than that of [[France]]. Immediately after his departure, [[May 31]], [[1520]], she accompanied the king to France on the celebrated visit to [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], remembered (from the splendors of the occasion) as the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]]. Within two years, however, war was declared against France and the Emperor once again made welcome in England, where plans were afoot to betroth him to Henry and Catherine's daughter Princess Mary.

Henry was keeping a succession of [[mistress]]es.  Catherine was not in physical condition to undergo further [[human pregnancy|pregnancies]]. The marriage was further soured by trouble made by Catherine's father, Ferdinand, over payments of her [[dowry]] and by a shift of allegiance on the part of Ferdinand, who signed a treaty with the French, to Henry's fury. Because of the lack of heirs, Henry began to believe that his marriage was cursed and sought confirmation from two verses of the biblical Book of [[Leviticus]], which said that, if a man marries his brother's wife, the couple will be childless.  He chose to believe that Catherine had lied when she said her marriage to Arthur had not been consummated, therefore making their marriage wrong in the eyes of God. He therefore asked [[Pope Clement VII]] to annul his marriage in [[1527]].

The Pope stalled on the issue for seven years without making a final judgement, partially because allowing an annulment would be admitting that the Church had been in error for allowing a special dispensation for marriage in the first place, and partially because he was a virtual prisoner of Catherine's nephew Charles V, who had conquered [[Rome]].  Henry separated from Catherine in [[July]] [[1531]], and secretly married one of Catherine's former [[lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]] (and sister of his former mistress [[Lady Mary Boleyn]]), [[Anne Boleyn]] in January [[1533]], a [[bigamy|bigamous]] marriage.  Henry finally had [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[archbishop of Canterbury]], annul the marriage himself on [[May 23]], 1533.  To forestall an appeal to [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]], which Catherine would have almost certainly won, he had Parliament pass the [[Act of Supremacy]], repudiating Papal jurisdiction in England, making the king the head of the English church, and beginning the [[English Reformation]].

==Later years==
Catherine refused to acknowledge the divorce and took the issue to the law, but she lost and was forced to leave [[noble court|Court]]. She was separated from her daughter (who was declared [[illegitimate]]) and was sent to live in remote castles and in humble conditions, in the hope that she would surrender to the inevitable; but she never accepted the divorce and signed her last letter, &quot;Catherine the Queen&quot;.  By this time, she was aware that Henry's marriage to Anne was turning sour, and she had not ceased to hope that he might one day return to her.

Catherine died of a form of [[cancer]], at [[Kimbolton Castle]], on January 7, [[1536]] and was buried in [[Peterborough Cathedral]] with the ceremony due to a [[Princess of Wales|Princess Dowager of Wales]], not a Queen.  Henry and Anne Boleyn celebrated her death - Henry did not attend the funeral, nor did he allow Princess Mary to do so.

Visitors to Peterborough Cathedral can still visit Catherine's tomb, which is frequently decorated with flowers and bears the title 'Katherine the Queen'.

==Film, TV and fiction==
Catherine was first portrayed on the silver screen in 1911 by [[Violet Vanburgh]] in a production of William Shakespeare's play ''Henry VIII.'' Nine years later, the German actress [[Hedwig Pauly-Winterstein]] played Catherine in the film ''Anna Boleyn.'' Later, actress [[Rosalie Crutchley]] played Catherine in ''The Sword and the Rose'' an acount of [[Mary Tudor (queen consort of France)|Mary Tudor]]'s romance with the duke of Suffolk in 1515. Crutchley later played Henry's sixth queen [[Catherine Parr]] in ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII]].''

It was not until 1969, in [[Hal B. Wallis]]'s acclaimed movie ''[[Anne of the Thousand Days]]'' that Catherine appeared again. This time she was played by the Greek actress [[Irene Papas]]. A year later, in a 90-minute television drama produced by the [[BBC]], British actress [[Annette Crosbie]] played the most historically-accurate version of Catherine in a piece simply entitled ''Catherine of Aragon'' as part one in the channel's series ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]''. The drama began on the night Catherine arrived in England and followed through until her early marriage to Henry VIII. It re-commenced almost a decade later, with Henry's manoeuvres to get a divorce in order to marry Anne Boleyn. The play, which co-starred the Australian actor [[Keith Michell]] as Henry VIII, Dame [[Dorothy Tutin]] as Anne Boleyn and [[Patrick Troughton]] as the duke of Norfolk, then chronicled Catherine's life until her death in January 1536. Two years later [[Claire Bloom]] played Catherine in another adaptation of Shakespeare's play.

In 1973, in the movie ''Henry VIII and his Six Wives,'' [[Frances Cuka]] played Catherine and Keith Michell reprised his role as Henry VIII. A scene was incorporated between Ms. Cuka and [[Charlotte Rampling]] (playing Anne Boleyn) to show their quiet, glacial enmity.

It was not until 2001 that Catherine again appeared on the screen. This time it was in Dr. [[David Starkey]]'s documentary series on Henry's queens. She was portrayed by [[Annabelle Dowler]], with [[Julia Marsen]] as Anne Boleyn.

In 2003 Catherine appeared twice on British television. In January, Spanish actress [[Yolanda Vasquez]] made a brief appearance in the wildly-inaccurate ''The Other Boleyn Girl,'' opposite [[Jared Harris]] as Henry VIII and [[Natascha McElhone]] as [[Mary Boleyn]]. In October, the [[ITV]] 2-part television drama, ''Henry VIII'' starred [[Ray Winstone]] in the title role and [[Assumpta Serna]] as Queen Catherine. Part 1 chronicled the king's life from the birth of his [[illegitimacy|bastard]] son, [[Henry Fitzroy]] until the execution of Anne Boleyn (played by [[Helena Bonham Carter]]) in 1536. [[David Suchet]] co-starred as [[Cardinal Wolsey]].

Catherine's story appears in fiction: ''Katharine of Aragon'' by Jean Plaidy, a trilogy recently published under one volume. Also, for younger readers, Catherine's story is told in ''Patience, Princess Catherine'' by Carolyn Meyer. Released in 2005, also by Philippa Gregory (author of ''The Other Boleyn Girl'') ''The Constant Princess'', her take on Catherine's story.

==Historiography==
For centuries, Catherine had been revered by many as a saint-like figure. She became a symbolic representation of the wronged woman and was presented in an extremely favourable light. 

This view was first challenged in 1860 by historian [[G. A. Bergenroth]]. He had seen the Spanish royal archives, and believed that the universal praise of Catherine of Aragon needed &quot;to be more or less lowered.&quot; Bergenroth's research formed the bapendence; however, the [[secondary school]] system was limited, and [[post-secondary education|higher education]] was almost nonexistent in most regions of the country. The principal objective of this system was to train low-level administrators and [[clerk]]s. Since independence, efforts have been made to increase access to education, and secondary and higher education have been made available to many more Congolese. Despite the deterioration of the state-run educational system in recent years, about 80% of the males and 65% of females, ages 6-11, were enrolled in a mixture of state- and church-run primary schools in 1996. At higher levels of education, males greatly outnumber females. The elite continues to send their children abroad to be educated, primarily in [[Western Europe]].

Sparsely populated in relation to its area, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] is home to a vast potential of natural resources and [[mineral]] wealth, yet the [[Economics|economy]] of the DROC has declined drastically since the mid-[[1980s]]. [[Agriculture]] is the mainstay of the economy, accounting for 57.9% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] in [[1997]]. Main cash crops include [[coffee]], [[palm oil]], [[rubber]], [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[tea]], and [[cocoa]]. Food crops include [[cassava]], [[plantains]], [[maize]], [[groundnuts]], and [[rice]]. In [[1996]], agriculture employed 66% of the work force.

Industry, especially [[mining]], remains a great potential source of wealth for DROC. In 1997, industry accounted for 16.9% of GDP. The Congo was the world's fourth-largest producer of industrial [[diamond]]s during the 1980s, and diamonds continue to dominate exports, accounting for $717 million or 52% of exports in 1997. The Congo's main [[copper]] and [[cobalt]] interests are dominated by [[Gecamines]], the state-owned mining giant. Gecamines production has faltered in recent years, due in part to a competitive world copper market.

Despite the country's vast potential, under the [[Mobutu]] regime widespread corruption, economic controls, and the diversion of public resources for personal gain thwarted economic growth. The unrecorded and illicit transactions of Zaire's unofficial economy were estimated in the early [[1990s]] to be three times the size of official GDP.

The Congo's record with multilateral and bilateral donors has been uneven. Despite a succession of economic plans financed by the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) since independence, budgetary imbalance, [[inflation]], and debt consistently plagued the Mobutu government. In early [[1990]], both the World Bank and the IMF suspended most disbursements, and most bilateral aid was cut off. Unable to make debt payments, Zaire's borrowing rights with the IMF were cut off in February [[1992]]; its World Bank credits were frozen in July [[1993]]. Despite the introduction of a new currency, the [[New Zaire]] (NZ), currency issuance remained disorderly, and largescale inflation rose to over 9,000% by early 1994.

In [[May 1997]] the [[AFDL]], led by [[Laurent Kabila]], overthrew the regime of Mobutu Sese Seko. Under President Kabila the government and state enterprises began a program of reconstruction. The government began to reform the corrupt [[tax]] system, civilian [[police]] force, and repair the damaged road system.

In [[August 1998]], a war broke out in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At that time, some progress had been made in the economic reconstruction of the country, but major problems continued to exist in transportation infrastructure, customs administration, and the tax system. Government finances had not been put in order and relations with the IMF and World Bank were in disarray. Much of the government's revenue was kept &quot;off book,&quot; and not included in published statistics on revenue and expenditure. Relations with the World Bank were on hold as a result of the government's failure to finalize an agreement for administration of the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (IBRD) Trust Fund for the Congo.

The outbreak of war in the early days of August 1998 caused a major decline in economic activity that continues to the present. The country has been divided into rebel- and government-held territories, and commerce between them has stopped. The economic and commercial links among the various sections of the country are not strong, but they are important.

After a surge in inflation during August 1998, the government began enforcing [[price control]] laws. It also began regulating foreign exchange markets. Taken together, these measures have severely damaged the ability of businesses depending on imports to continue operations. Furthermore, the small gains against inflation and [[currency depreciation]] were quickly reversed when the foreign-backed rebellion in the eastern part of the country began in August 1998. The war has dramatically reduced government revenue, and increased external debt. Foreign businesses have curtailed operations due to uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict and because of increased government harassment and restrictions.  The wide spread between the official rate for buying the new currency, [[Congo francs]] (FCs), and the black market rate for buying [[dollar]]s has forced merchants to price their imported goods according to the official rate for buying local currency.

Poor [[infrastructure]], an uncertain legal framework, corruption, and lack of openness in government economic policy and financial operations remain a brake on investment and growth. A number of [[IMF]] and [[World Bank]] missions have met with the new government to help it develop a coherent economic plan but associated reforms are on hold.  Faced with continued currency depreciation, the government resorted to more drastic measures and in [[January 1999]] banned the widespread use of U.S. dollars for all domestic commercial transactions, a position it later adjusted. The government has been unable to provide foreign exchange for economic transactions, while it has resorted to printing money to finance its expenditure.  Growth was negative in [[2000]] because of the difficulty of meeting the conditions of international donors, continued low prices of key exports, and post-coup instability. 

Conditions improved in late [[2002]] with the withdrawal of a large portion of the invading foreign troops. A number of [[IMF]] and [[World Bank]] missions have met with the government to help it develop a coherent economic plan, and President Kabila has begun implementing reforms. Much economic activity lies outside the GDP data.

With relative peace in the country during [[2003]], the DRC aims to increase its exports of [[electricity]] to [[Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa]] to 500 [[megawatt]]s from 210 megawatts (mostly from the [[Inga dam]]). Electricity distribution in the DRC is licensed to a [[Zambia|Zambian]] company, [[CEC]].

Despite President [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]]'s claims that his was a [[transitional government]] leading to a new [[constitution]] and full elections by April [[1999]], these elections have not [[as of 2004]] been held, and a [[1998]] draft constitution has not been finalized. All executive, legislative, and military powers are vested in the president. The judiciary is independent, with the president having the power to dismiss or appoint. The president is head of a 26-member cabinet dominated by the [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo]] (ADFL).

After some successes at improving internal security and lowering the [[inflation rate]] over his first year, Kabila was unable to control insurgent activities by various armed groups. Activities by [[Hutu]] ex-FAR/[[Interahamwe]], [[Mai-Mai]] soldiers, and a February [[1998]] mutiny by [[Tutsi]] [[Banyamulenge]] destabilized the regime. In addition, Kabila's pledges to democratize the government over time contrasted with the reality of banned political parties and increasingly centralized power. Criticism of Kabila's government grew both domestically and within the international community.

In an attempt to stabilize the country and consolidate his control after his [[1997]] victory in the [[First Congo War]], President Kabila in August [[1998]] expelled the [[Rwanda]]n troops remaining in DRC . This prompted army mutinies in Kinshasa and the Kivu provinces in the east. Although the Kinshasa mutiny was put down, the mutiny in the Kivus continued and mushroomed into a drive to topple the government, now called the [[Second Congo War]]. Opposing the Kabila government were factions of the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]] (RCD), [[Rwanda]], and [[Uganda]]. The Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC), another rebel group, emerged later. Defending the Kabila government were the former Rwandan army (ex-FAR)/Interahamwe militia, [[Angola]], [[Namibia]], [[Chad]], [[Zimbabwe]], and the Congolese army (FAC).

A cease-fire was signed on [[10 July]] [[1999]] by the DROC, [[Zimbabwe]], [[Angola]], [[Uganda]], [[Namibia]], [[Rwanda]], and Congolese armed rebel groups, but sporadic fighting continued. Kabila was assassinated on [[16 January]] [[2001]] and his son [[Joseph Kabila]] was named head of state ten days later. In October [[2002]], the new president was successful in getting occupying Rwandan forces to withdraw from eastern Congo; two months later, an agreement was signed by all remaining warring parties to end the fighting and set up a government of national unity, though final peace remains elusive.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;tst return to Earth. This distance increases with frequency. As a result, any station employing DX will be surrounded by an annular ''dead zone'' where they can't hear other stations or be heard by them.

This is the phenonenon that allows [[short wave]] radio reception to occur beyond the limits of line of sight.  It is utilized by [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts (hams), shortwave broadcast stations (such as [[BBC]] and [[Voice of America]]) and others.  This is what allows you to hear AM (MW) stations from locations far from your location.  It is the only backup to failure of long distance communication by satellites, when their operation is affected by [[electromagnetic]] storms from the sun.

'''Drexel University''' is an institution of higher learning located in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].  The school was founded in [[1891]] by [[Anthony J. Drexel]], a noted [[financier]] and [[philanthropist]]. The current president is [[Constantine Papadakis]].

==History==
[[Image:Drexel Main Building.jpg|thumb|left|The Main Building, dedicated in 1891.]]Drexel University was founded in 1891 as the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry by Philadelphia financier and philanthropist Anthony J. Drexel to provide educational opportunities in the “practical arts and sciences” for women and men of all backgrounds. The Drexel Institute of Technology gained university status in 1970, becoming Drexel University. On July 1, 2002, Drexel was officially united with the former MCP Hahnemann University.  Drexel has also recently begun work on a new Law School, which will open in the autumn of 2006.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

==Academics==
[[Image:Drexel-logo.gif|right|Drexel University Logo]]
Drexel University is known for its engineering school, which includes The Drexel Engineering Curriculum, or &quot;tDEC&quot; for short.  tDEC is a rigorous series of online and offline courses designed to prepare students for future engineering work.

==Branch campuses==
Drexel University's campus is divided into three parts: the University City Campus, the Center City Hanneman Campus, and the Queen Lane College of Medicine Campus.  The latter two are recent acquisitions by the university.

==Co-op program==
Branded as the Ultimate Internship™, Drexel's cooperative education program is one of the largest in the nation.  Drexel has a fully internet-based job database, where users can submit resumes and request interviews with any of the hundreds of companies that are offering positions.  A student graduating from Drexel with a 5-year degree typically has a total of 18 months of internship with up to three different companies.  Major co-op employers include:

*[[Sunoco|Sunoco Inc.]]
*[[GlaxoSmithKline]]
*[[Unisys Corporation]]
*[[Lockheed Martin]]
*[[Comcast Corporation]]
*[[Merck]]
*[[Dupont]]
*[[University of Pennsylvania]]

==Drexel Art==
Drexel maintains three art galleries on its main campus. 

The Drexel Collection is housed in the Westphal Picture Gallery, on the third floor of the Main Building.  The collection was established by the university's founder, [[Anthony J. Drexel]], who collected many types of art.  The collection continued to receive donations after his death from family, friends, and alumni.  The collection has a large variety of artifacts, including porcelains and furniture.

The Leonard Pearlstein Gallery is an aluminum and slate structure connected to Nesbitt Hall (the building for the College of Media Arts and Design) in which art exhibitions are frequently held.  The slate side of the building is frequently covered with chalk messages about upcoming events.

==Residence Halls==
Drexel requires all non-commuting freshmen to live in one of the six (soon to be seven) freshmen residence halls.  Kelly Hall, Myers Hall, Towers Hall, and Calhoun are traditional dormitories, while East Hall and Van Rensselaer are arranged into suites of 4-6 residents.  East Hall and Van R. are currently designated for students of the Penonni Honors College.  All dormitories except East Hall are located on the north side of campus, north of Arch Street, in the area of [[Powelton Village]].  Drexel's continued efforts to expand the university and the dormitories have brought them into conflict with the Powelton Village Community Association, which has attempted to block dormitory construction on several occasions.

For upperclassmen North Hall is the only on-campus housing available.  Most students find apartments within Powelton Village.  Academic Properties Inc., a subsidary of Drexel, offers apartments, and there are also apartments in the nearby University Crossings building, which was previously owned by [[Amtrak]] and used as office buildings.

==Drexel Achievement==
Drexel has been ranked among the &quot;Best National Universities-Top Schools&quot; by a U.S. News &amp; World yearly report on &quot;America's Best Colleges&quot;.  The 2006 rankings (released in 2005) placed Drexel as 109th.  Drexel and [[University of Pennsylvania|Penn]] are the only Philadelphia colleges in this category.

Drexel frequently ranks among the top 25 schools in the nation for technology use according to [[The Princeton Review]] and [[Intel|The Intel Corporation]], and was ranked first for wireless access by [[Yahoo!]].

The Math Forum@Drexel has been selected as one of the most useful websites by [[PC Magazine]] and [[Scientific American]].

The universities [[financial endowment|endowment]] is currently over $500 million, placing it 108th among all U.S. colleges and Universities. (data from The Chronicle of Higher Education 2002-03)

Drexel is the 18th largest private university in the U.S., with an enrollment of 17,500 students.  (data from the National Center for Educational Statistics 2001-02).

==Student Newspaper==

==Student lore and traditions==
When students think they are being mistreated by the University, they often refer to it as getting the [[Drexel Shaft]].  The Drexel Shaft is also a smokestack structure on the rail yard next to the campus, and according to university legend the structure grows one more inch every time a student is shafted.

To receive good grades on exams, a myth is to rub the toe of the bronze &quot;Waterboy&quot; statue located in the Main Building on campus.  Although the rest of the bronze statue has turned dark brown, the toe has become highly polished and shines.

==Trivia==
*Drexel University's campus is located right next to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[University City, Pennsylvania|University City]], [[Philadelphia]].

*In the 2005 Princeton Review, under the category of &quot;Campus Is Tiny, Unsightly, Or Both&quot;, Drexel was ranked 2nd. It is presently in the middle of several renovations to rectify this situation.

*A feature of the main quad is a water fountain bearing the ironic name &quot;The Flame of Knowledge&quot;.

[[Image:Landon-IcarusandDaedalus.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''Daedalus and Icarus'', by [[Charles Paul Landon]], 1799 (Musée des
Beaux-Arts et de la Dentelle, Alençon)]]

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Daedalus''' (Latin, also Hellenized Latin  '''Daedalos''', Greek '''Daidalos''' and Etruscan '''Taitle''') was a most skillful artificer  and was even said to have first invented images. He built for [[Ariadne]] a wide dancing-ground (''Iliad'' xviii.591), and Homer also still calls her by her Cretan name, the &quot;Lady of the [[Labyrinth]]&quot; (''Iliad'' xviii.96) which Daedalus also made, in which the [[Minotaur]] was kept and from which [[Theseus]] escaped by means of the thread clue of Ariadne.  Ignoring Homer, later writers envisaged the labyrinth as an edifice, and rather than a single path to the center and out again, gave it numberless winding passages and turnings opening into one another, seeming to have neither beginning nor end (see [[labyrinth]]).  Daedalus built it for King [[Minos]], who needed the labyrinth to imprison his wife's son: [[Asterius]], the [[Minotaur]].  Daedalus had built for Minos' wife, [[Pasiphae]], a wooden cow so she could mate with the bull, for the Greeks imagined the Minoan [[Bull (mythology)|bull of the sun]] to be an actual, earthly bull.

Daedalus afterwards was shut up in a tower to prevent his knowledge of the labyrinth from spreading to the public. He could not leave Crete by sea, as the king kept strict watch on all the vessels, and permitted none to sail without being carefully searched.  Since Minos controlled the land and sea routes, Daedalus set to work to fabricate wings for himself and his young son [[Icarus (mythology)|Icarus]].  He tied feathers together beginning with the smallest and adding larger, so as to form an increasing surface.  The larger ones he secured with thread and the smaller with wax, and gave the whole a gentle curvature like the wings of a bird.  When at last the work was done, the artist, waving his wings, found himself buoyed upward and hung suspended, poising himself on the beaten air.  He next equipped his son in the same manner, and taught him how to fly.  When both were prepared for flight, Daedalus warned Icarus not to fly too high, because the heat of the sun would melt the wax, nor too low because the sea foam would make the wings wet and they would no longer fly.  Then the father and son flew away.
[[Image:PBrueghelElderIcarus.jpg|thumb|360px|''The Fall of Icarus'' (detail) by [[Peter Brueghel the Elder]], ca. 1558]]
They had passed [[Samos Island|Samos]], [[Delos]] and [[Lebynthos]] when the boy began to soar upward as if to reach heaven. The blazing sun softened the wax which held the feathers together, and they came off.  Icarus fell into the sea.  His father cried and bitterly lamenting his own arts, called the land near the place where Icarus fell into the ocean [[Icaria]] in memory of his child.  Daedalus arrived safe in [[Sicily]] in the care of King [[Cocalus]], where he built a temple to [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]], and hung up his wings, an offering to the god.

Minos, meanwhile, searched for Daedalus by travelling from city to city asking a riddle.  He presented a spiral seashell and asked for it to be strung all the way through.  When he reached [[Camicus]], King Cocalus, knowing Daedalus would be able to solve the riddle, fetched the old man.  He tied the string to an ant, which walked through the seashell, stringing it all the way through.  Minos then knew Daedalus was in the court of King Cocalus and demanded he be handed over.  Cocalus managed to convince Minos to take a bath first.  Cocalus' daughters then killed Minos.

Daedalus was so proud of his achievements that he could not bear the idea of a rival.  His sister had placed her son [[Perdix]] under his charge to be taught the mechanical arts.  He was an apt scholar and gave striking evidences of ingenuity.  Walking on the seashore he picked up the spine of a fish (some versions say it is a serpent's jaw that is used as the basis for the saw).  Imitating it, he took a piece of iron and notched it on the edge, and thus invented the saw.  He put two pieces of iron together, connecting them at one end with a rivet, and sharpening the other ends, and made a pair of compasses.  Daedalus was so envious of his nephew's performances that he took an opportunity, when they were together one day on the top of a high tower, to push him off. But [[Athena]], who favors ingenuity, saw him falling, and arrested his fate by changing him into a bird called after his name, the [[partridge]].  This bird does not build his nest in the trees, nor take lofty flights, but nestles in the hedges, and mindful of his fall, avoids high places.  For this crime, Daedalus was tried and banished.

Daedalus had two sons: [[Icarus (mythology)|Icarus]] and [[Iapyx]].

Daedalus gave his name [[eponym]]ously to any Greek artificer and to many Greek contraptions that represented dextrous skill. At [[Plataea]] there was a festival, the [[Daedala]], in which a temporary wooden altar was fashioned, an effigy was made from an oak-tree and dressed in bridal attire, and carried in a cart with a woman who acted as bridesmaid. The image was called ''Daedale'' and the archaic ritual given an explanation through a myth to the purpose.

In the period of [[Romanticism]], Daedalus had come to denote the classic artist,a skilled mature craftsman, while Icarus symbolizes the romantic artist, an undisputed heir of the classic artist, whose impetuous, passionate and rebellious nature as well as his defiance of formal aesthetic and social conventions ultimately prove to be self destructive.

'''Deception Pass''' is a narrow pass separating [[Whidbey Island]] from [[Fidalgo Island]], in the northwest corner of [[Washington|Washington State]].

In 1792, Captain [[George Vancouver]] and his navigator and First Mate [[Joseph Whidbey]] mistook Whidbey Island for a peninsula, and named the passage into  [[Puget Sound]] for the way the island deceived them. 

The pass is bridged by connecting Whidbey Island to the tiny Pass Island with [[Deception Pass Bridge]], and Pass Island to Fidalgo Island with Canoe Pass Bridge. The pass is surrounded by a state park.

Deception Pass is a major tourist destination and is noted for its scenic views and fast flowing tide water changes.

More than half of the city schools were built before 1930.[http://www.detroitk12.org/importantNews/Deficit_Elimination_Plan1.pdf]

DPS has not escaped many of the problems that other city sectors have encountered. In the early [[1970s]], the [[NAACP]] brought DPS to court seeking remedies for past ''de jure'' racial segregation. In a series of decisions beginning in September 1971, federal judge [[Stephen Roth]] ordered [[busing]] to desegregate the system, speeding up the [[white flight]] that had been on-going within the city. As of 2004, Detroit schools were 91% African-American.[http://www.detroitk12.org/schools/index.php?type=All+Schools] In the latest count, Detroit lost over 10,000 students, and the district continues to project similar losses for the next several years.[http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051123/SCHOOLS/511230328]

The school district continued a steady decline and, in the mid to late 1990s, was rocked by allegations of mismanagement by the school board. In 1999, the [[Michigan Legislature]] removed the locally elected board of education and replaced it with a reform board appointed by the mayor and governor, with the reform board selecting a CEO to run the schools. In 2004, reports revealed that the appointed reform board was no improvement.  The elected board of education responsible for selecting the General Superintendent to run the schools was reinstated following a city referendum. The election of the eleven member board of education, with four chosen at-large and seven by district, occurred on [[November 8]], [[2005]].

Detroit has a well developed [[charter school]] system. While charter schools accept students from any location within Michigan, making it difficult to determine the number of Detroit children attending, news reports indicate that charter enrollment was up 22.5% or almost 10,000 students in Detroit in 2005, leading to a figure of about 54,000 Detroit students attending charter schools. When charter school and Detroit Public Schools enrollments are combined, the total number of children in public schools in Detroit has increased.[http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051219/SCHOOLS/512190339&amp;SearchID=73230252551594]

If the current growth trends continue, more of Detroit's public school students will be attending charter schools than the Detroit Public Schools during the 2009-2010 school year (based on 22.5% growth rate in charter public schools and a constant loss of 10,000 students per year in the DPS enrollment). To meet the change in demand, the Detroit Public Schools has a goal of closing 95 schools by 2009.[http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051123/SCHOOLS/511230328]

=== Higher education ===
It was once the home of the [[University of Michigan]], which was founded in Detroit in 1817 but then later moved to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] in 1837. Detroit has several universities and colleges within its borders, including: [[College for Creative Studies]], [[Lewis College of Business]], [[Marygrove College]], [[Wayne State University]], [[University of Detroit Mercy]], and [[Wayne County Community College]].  The [[Detroit College of Law]], now affiliated with [[Michigan State University]], was founded in the city in 1891 and remained there until 1997, when it relocated to [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]].

== Culture ==
=== Music and performing arts ===
[[Image:Fisher Building, Detroit.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Fisher Building, located in the City's New Center area, home to the Fisher Theatre.]]
{{main|Music of Detroit}}
Music has been the dominant feature of Detroit's nightlife since the late [[1940s]]. The metropolitan area boasts two of the top live music venues in the U.S. [[DTE Energy Music Theatre]] (formerly Pine Knob) was the most attended summer venue in the U.S. in 2005 for the fifteenth consecutive year, while [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]] ranked twelfth, according to music industry source [[Pollstar]]. Detroit is considered by most industry analysts as the best concert market in the U.S. in per capita terms. 

The city has the second-largest theater district in America, after New York City, with eighteen professional theaters. Outside New York City, Detroit has more theater seats than any other city east of the Mississippi River. Detroit is home to the [[Detroit Symphony Orchestra]] and the Detroit Opera House. Major theaters include the [[Fox Theatre (Detroit)|Fox Theatre]], [[Masonic Temple Theatre]], [[Fisher Theatre]], [[State Theatre]], [[Music Hall (Detroit)|Music Hall]], and the [[Detroit Repertory Theatre]]. Historically, Detroit's former [[Black Bottom]] neighborhood was a major [[jazz]] and [[blues]] mecca through the [[1950s]]; its influence would still be felt decades later. Major jazz stars of the era often came to Black Bottom to perform in its many venues.

[[Image:Motown.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The Logo for the [[Motown Records]] label, founded in Detroit.]]
One of the highlights of Detroit's musical history was the success of [[Motown Records]] during the [[1960s]] and early [[1970s]]. The label was founded in Detroit by [[Berry Gordy, Jr.]] and housed at the &quot;[[Hitsville U.S.A.]]&quot; complex along West Grand Boulevard until 1972. Motown was home to some of the most popular recording acts in the world, including [[Marvin Gaye]], [[The Temptations]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Diana Ross]] &amp; [[the Supremes]],  [[Smokey Robinson]] &amp; [[The Miracles]], [[The Four Tops]], and [[Martha Reeves]] &amp; [[the Vandellas]]. One major Detroit R&amp;B artist from this era that was not in Motown's stable was [[Aretha Franklin]].

Through the 1950's Detroit was one of America's most important jazz centers. Notable musicians from Detroit who achieved international recognition include: Elvin Jones, Hank Jones, Thad Jones, Tommy Flanagan, Lucky Thompson, Louis Hayes, Barry Harris, Paul Chambers, Marcus Belgrave, Milt Jackson, Kenny Burrell, Pepper Adams. 

Metro Detroit also spawned in the late 1960s a unique, high-energy rock scene in antithesis to Motown and the more mellow scenes popular on the coasts. Area artists [[MC5]] and [[Iggy and the Stooges]] laid the groundwork for the punk rock movement in the mid-1960s. Rock acts from southeast Michigan that first enjoyed success in the area include 1970s icons [[Bob Seger]], [[Ted Nugent]] &amp; The [[Amboy Dukes]], [[The Romantics]] and [[Grand Funk Railroad]] as well as recent acts [[The White Stripes]], and [[The Von Bondies]]. Detroit is also home to [[The Black Dahlia Murder]], a popular [[death metal]] band. The Detroit area is also generally accepted as the birthplace of the [[Techno music|Techno]] movement, which has grown from local radio and clubs to dance venues worldwide over the past 25 years. [[As of 2006]], fourteen groups or solo artists, four nonperformers, and two sidemen connected with the Detroit area have been enshrined in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

Detroit is more recently home to many hip-hop artists such as: [[Aaliyah]], [[Eminem]], [[Royce Da 5'9&quot;]], [[Slum Village]], [[Alley Life]], [[Rock Bottom Entertainment|Rock Bottom]], [[Juan (Street Lord'z)|Juan]], [[Trick Trick]] &amp; The Goon Sqwad, [[D12 (hip-hop group)|D12]], [[Teairra Mari]], [[Tone-Tone]], [[MC Breed]], [[Blade Icewood]], [[Big Herk]], the [[Street Lord'z]], [[Insane Clown Posse]] and [[Twiztid]] are among the musical acts who have kept the diverse musical pipeline flowing.

=== Events ===
[[Image:DetroitDownBrushSt.JPG|thumb|right|300px|A view looking south down Brush Street at the [[Renaissance Center]] (rear left) and the Wayne County Building (right). The giant decal on the Renaissance Center was installed for the [[2005]] [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star Game]]. It is 4,612 ft (1,375 m) from the home plate in [[Comerica Park]] to the main tower of the Renaissance Center.]]
Detroit has two major events that are associated with the automobile industry: the [[North American International Auto Show]] (January) and the [[Woodward Dream Cruise]] (August). A number of annual music events occur in the city, which are the Downtown Hoedown [[country music]] festival (May), [[Detroit Electronic Music Festival|DEMF/Movement/Fuse-In]] electronic music festival (May), [[Ford Detroit International Jazz Festival]] (September), and the [[Concert of Colors]], a diverse summer music festival.

Other Detroit events include: the [[Windsor-Detroit International Freedom Festival]] (June&amp;ndash;July), [[Comerica Tastefest]] (July), [[Detroit Thunder Fest]] hydroplane race (July), [[Detroit Fashion Week]] (August), [[Art on the Move]], and the [[America's Thanksgiving Parade]].

Due to the large Polish population, the day before [[Ash Wednesday]], or the festival of [[Mardi Gras]]/[[Fat Tuesday]] is more frequently known locally as Pączki Day (though traditionally celebrated by Poles five days earlier on [[Fat Thursday]]). Many Metro Detroiters join in the festivity by indulging in jelly-filled donuts called [[pączki|pączkis]].

===Fashions===
Detroit is a city known for style. One of the most known fashions of Detroit is suits with alligator shoes, and the city is often referred to as &quot;Alligator City.&quot; Many inner-city young adults seem to take a liking in wearing fashionable streetwear or workwear such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoes, [[baseball cap]]s, [[Carhartt]] jackets, [[Guess?|Guess]] jeans, [[Dickies]], [[Iceberg History]], and more recently [[Marithé François Girbaud]] and [[Akademiks]] jeans. There are more expensive tastes in [[Cartier]] eyewear, [[Rolex]] wristwear, [[Stacy Adams]] dress shoes, [[Pelle Pelle]], and [[Al Wissam]] leather jackets.

===Food===  
Founded in 1907 by two Russian immigrant brothers in Detroit, [[Faygo]] soda (universally referred to as &quot;pop&quot; in the Detroit area) remains a Detroit tradition.  It was made famous by [[ICP]] and is sold internationally. Detroit was also the birthplace of [[Vernors]] [[ginger ale]], the oldest surviving soft drink in the United States. Detroit is also the home of the [[Better Made]] Chips Factory which makes [[potato chips]], Detroit is also considered the birthplace of the [[Coney Island hot dog]], a [[chili dog]] with onions and mustard.

=== Media ===
The major daily [[newspaper]]s serving Detroit are '' [[The Detroit Free Press]]'' and ''[[The Detroit News]]''. Other  Detroit publications are ''[[The Metro Times]]'' and ''Crain's Detroit Business''[http://www.crainsdetroit.com ], both weeklies. Detroit is also home to the weekly ''[[Michigan Chronicle]]'', the state's largest African American owned newspaper, and the ''[[Michigan Citizen]]'', another publication that targets African American readers.

The Detroit television market is the eleventh largest in the United States.[http://www.nielsenmedia.com/DMAs.html] Most [[television station]]s broadcasting from Detroit have their studios in [[Southfield, Michigan|Southfield]], which is also the site of transmission facilities of almost all Detroit-based stations. Stations broadcasting from Detroit include [[WJBK]] ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]), [[WDIV-TV]] ([[NBC]]), [[WXYZ]] ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]), and [[WWJ-TV]] ([[CBS]]). Other Metro Detroit television stations include [[WDWB]] ([[WB Television Network|The WB]]), [[WKBD-TV]] ([[UPN]]), [[WPXD-TV]] ([[I (TV network)|Pax TV]]) and [[WADL-TV]] (primarily broadcasting [[infomercials]]). [[WTVS]] is the city's [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] member station. Detroiters also receive the broadcast signal from [[CBET]] channel 9, the [[CBC Television]] affiliate based in Windsor. Depending on the location, some viewers can also receive the [[TVOntario]], [[CTV television network|CTV]], [[Global Television Network|Global]], [[A-Channel]], [[Citytv]], and [[Télévision de Radio-Canada|SRC]] networks. People who live in the downtown area can also receive channels from [[Toledo, Ohio]], and from other Michigan cities such as [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], [[Bay City, Michigan|Bay City]], and [[Midland, Michigan|Midland]]. [[Comcast]] has the one cable [[franchise]] so far granted by the city.

Detroit is also served by a variety of [[radio station]]s. The primary [[amplitude modulation|AM]] stations are [[WJR (AM)|WJR]] 760 (news-talk), [[WWJ (AM)|WWJ]] 950 (news), [[CKLW]] (Canadian general talk) and [[WDFN (AM)|WDFN]] 1130 (sports). Several [[frequency modulation|FM]] stations include [[100.3 WNIC|WNIC]] 100.3 (mix-genre), 101.1 [[WRIF]] (Rock), [[WJLB]] 97.9 (urban contemporary), [[WMXD]] (urban adult contemporary), and [[WOMC]] 104.3 (oldies). [[WDET]] 101.9 is the city's [[National Public Radio|NPR]] station. [[WUOM]] 91.7 and [[WEMU]] 89.1 are also regional NPR affiliates. [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] radio stations [[CIMX-FM|CIMX]] 88.7 and [[CBE-FM|CBC 89.9]] can also be heard in the Detroit area.

In the [[1960s]], before widespread rock music exposure in national media, Detroit-area radio stations, especially [[CKLW]] with its powerful signal, were instrumental in propelling many musical acts, both local and out-of-town, to national stardom.

=== Sites of interest ===
[[Image:DIAfront Detroit USA.jpg|275px|thumb|Front of the Detroit Institute of Art located in Midtown]]
The [[Detroit Institute of Arts]] houses what is considered to be one of the most prominent American collections outside New York City, and features showcase pieces by [[Diego Rivera]], [[Picasso]] and [[Van Gogh]] along with such hometown artists as [[Charles McGee]]. The Detroit Institute of Arts is located in an area near [[Wayne State University]] known as the Cultural Center, which is also the site of the Detroit Historical Museum, Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, Detroit Science Center, and the main branch of the Detroit Public Library. Other cultural highlights include the [[Hitsville U.S.A.|Motown Historical Museum]], [[Tuskegee Airmen]] Museum, Historic [[Fort Wayne (Detroit)]], Dossin Great Lakes Museum, and the Belle Isle Conservatory.

Major parks include [[Belle Isle (Michigan)|Belle Isle]] (the largest island park within a city in the U.S.), Palmer Park, River Rouge Park, Chene Park and [[Campus Martius Park]]. [[Hart Plaza]], located between the Renaissance Center and [[Cobo Hall]] on the riverfront, is the site of many events, notably various music festivals. Other city recreational facilities include municipal golf courses (William Rogell, Rouge, Belle Isle, Palmer Park), Northwest Activities Center, [[Detroit Zoo]], the [[Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory]], and the [[Belle Isle Aquarium]]. As of April 2005 the Aquarium and Zoo at Belle Isle are closed, though there is a movement to reopen them.

The most important civic sculpture in Detroit is the &quot;[[Spirit of Detroit]]&quot;, which when it was installed in [[1958]] was the largest cast sculpture made since the Renaissance. The 16 foot (4&amp;nbsp;m) tall bronze kneeling man holds a gold orb in one hand and a golden family in the other. The image is often used as a symbol of Detroit and the statue itself is occasionally dressed in sports uniforms to celebrate when a Detroit team is doing well. A memorial to [[Joe Louis]] at the intersection of Jefferson and Woodward Avenues was dedicated on [[October 16]], [[1986]]. The sculpture, commissioned by [[Sports Illustrated magazine|''Sports Illustrated'']] and executed by [[Robert Graham (sculptor)|Robert Graham]], is a 24&amp;nbsp;foot (7.3 m) long arm with a fisted hand suspended by a 24 foot high pyramidal framework.

=== Sports ===
Detroit is home to professional teams representing the four major sports in North America. All but two play within the city of Detroit ([[basketball|basketball's]] [[Detroit Pistons]] and [[Detroit Shock]] play in suburban [[Auburn Hills]]). There are three active major sports venues in the city: [[Comerica Park]] for [[baseball]], [[Ford Field]] for [[American football|football]], and [[Joe Louis Arena]] for [[ice hockey]].

Like many industrial cities, Detroit is known for its avid fans, particularly in such blue-collar sports as football ([[Detroit Lions]]) and hockey ([[Detroit Red Wings]]). Detroit is perhaps the most fervent hockey hotbed in the United States. A Red Wings marketing campaign in the late [[1990s]] launched the nickname ''[[Hockeytown]]'', a city moniker subsequently embraced by local fans and national media.

In college sports, the [[University of Detroit Mercy]] has a [[NCAA]] [[Division I]] program, and [[Wayne State University]] has both [[NCAA]] Division I and [[Division II|II]] programs. The NCAA football [[Motor City Bowl]] is held here each December.

Detroit is home to the [[Detroit International Marathon]], which crosses the border into Canada via the [[Ambassador Bridge]] and returns to the United States through the [[Detroit-Windsor Tunnel]]. It is the world's only cross-national marathon. The city is also home to the APBA Gold Cup unlimited hydroplane boat race, which is held in Detroit each year since 1990. The race occurs on the Detroit River near Belle Isle.

Detroit was also the former home of a round of the [[Formula One]] World Championship, holding a race on the [[Detroit street circuit|streets of downtown Detroit]] from 1985 until 1988, after which the sanction moved from Formula One to [[Indycars]]. [[CART]] continued downtown until 1992, when the race was moved to another temporary course on [[Belle Isle (Michigan)|Belle Isle]] where the race remained through 2001.

Detroit was a finalist in bidding for the [[1944 Summer Olympics|1944]], [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952]], [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]], [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960]], [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]], [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], and [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] [[Summer Olympic Games]]. No other city has made it to the final [[IOC]] Olympic host city elections as often without eventually being selected. [http://www.gamesbids.com/english/archives/past.shtml] 

Comerica Park hosted the 2005 [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All Star Game]] on [[July 12]], [[2005]], and [[Ford Field]] hosted [[Super Bowl XL]] on [[February 5]], [[2006]]. A world record was set on [[December 13]], [[2003]], when the largest crowd in basketball history &amp;mdash; 78,129 &amp;mdash; packed Ford Field to watch the [[University of Kentucky]] defeat [[Michigan State University]], 79&amp;ndash;74.

==Infrastructure==
===Medicine===
Detroit is home to three major medical systems: the [[Detroit Medical Center]], Henry Ford Health System, and the St. John's Health System. Detroit Receiving Hospital and [[Henry Ford Hospital]] are both [[Level I trauma center]]s. Detroit is considered to have some of the busiest emergency rooms in the United States.

The Detroit Medical Center consists of Detroit Receiving Hospital and University Health Center, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Harper University Hospital, Hutzel Women's Hospital, Rehabilitation Institute of Michigan, and the Karmanos Cancer Institute. It is staffed by physicians from the [[Wayne State University]] School of Medicine, which is the largest single-campus medical school in the United States. Henry Ford Hospital, Children's Hospital of Michigan, and Harper University Hospital are consistently ranked by ''[[US News and World Report]]'' as some of the best [[hospital]]s in the United States.

===Transportation===
[[Image:800px-Eight_Mile_Road-fixed.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Exit onto 8 Mile Road from I-94]]
Because of its gateway between the United States and Canada and its major industrial status &amp;mdash; along with its major highways, rail connections and international airport &amp;mdash; Detroit has been an important transportation hub.

Detroit is the crossroads for three mainline [[Interstate Highway]]s:  [[I-94]] ([[Edsel Ford]] Freeway), [[I-96]] ([[Edward Jeffries|Jeffries]] Freeway) and [[I-75]] (Fisher and [[Walter P. Chrysler|Chrysler]] Freeways). [[I-696]] ([[Walter Reuther]] Freeway) serves the northern suburbs, while [[Interstate 275 (Michigan)|I-275]] serves the western suburbs and [[Interstate 375 (Michigan)|I-375]] is a short extension of the Chrysler Freeway. Other major routes are the [[John C. Lodge]] Freeway ([[Michigan State Highway 10|M-10]]), the [[Michigan State Highway 39|Southfield Freeway]] (M-39) and the [[Davison Freeway]] (M-8). All freeways except I-696 and I-275 were traditionally referred to by name (e.g. &quot;The Ford&quot;) rather than route number by Detroiters; this remains true for the non-Interstates. The city also has two international border crossings at the [[Ambassador Bridge]] and the [[Detroit-Windsor Tunnel]], linking Detroit to [[Windsor, Ontario]] to Canadian [[Highway 401]]. The Ambassador Bridge is the nation's busiest border crossing in terms of trade volume; it carries 25% of all traded US-Canada merchandise.

[[Coleman A. Young International Airport]], known as Detroit City Airport, is on Detroit's northeast side. Although [[Southwest Airlines]] once had service to the airport, there is currently no commercial passenger service. [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport]] (DTW), the area's principal airport, is located in nearby [[Romulus, Michigan|Romulus]] and is a hub for [[Northwest Airlines]] and [[Spirit Airlines]]. [[Willow Run Airport]], in western Wayne and eastern Washtenaw counties near [[Ypsilanti, Michigan|Ypsilanti]] is a general aviation and cargo airport. Willow Run served as the primary manufacturing center for the [[B-24 Liberator]] during [[World War II]].  This and other area industries led to Detroit's WWII nickname as the ''Arsenal of Democracy''.[http://info.detnews.com/history/story/index.cfm?id=73&amp;category=locations]

[[Mass transit]] within the city functions within two separate spheres of influence. Transit services within the city are provided by the [[Detroit Department of Transportation]] (DDOT), which provides bus service that terminates at the suburbs' edges. Service in the suburbs is provided by [[Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation]] (SMART). Although SMART buses pick up passengers within Detroit, it cannot drop them off due to the exclusive jurisdiction the DDOT has over these routes. Combining the systems has been problematic and tainted by the racial politics that has affected all aspects of city-suburban relationships.  The [[automated guideway transit]] system known as the [[Detroit People Mover|People Mover]] provides a 2.9 mile (4.6 km) loop in the downtown area and usually operates daily.

The city is also served by [[Amtrak]] with routes connecting to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], and other Michigan destinations. The current rail facill Science Foundation]] and the [[National Institutes of Health]].  Many [[Ivy League]] and other well-endowed universities provide funding for the entire duration of the course, or for most of it.

In Australia, Ph.D. students are quite often offered a scholarship to study their Ph.D. The most common of these is the Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) scholarship, which provides a living stipend to students of approximately AUD$19,000 a year (tax free). Most universities also offer a similar scholarship that matches the APA amount, but is funded by the university. In recent years, with the tightening of research funding in Australia, these scholarships have become increasingly harder to obtain.

In addition to the more common APA and University scholarships, Australian students also have other sources of funding in their Ph.D. These could include, but are not limited to, scholarships offered by schools, research centres and commercial enterprise. For the latter, the amount is determined between the university and the organisation, but is quite often set at the APA (Industry) rate, roughly AUD$10,000 more than the usual APA rate.  Australian students are often also able to tutor undergraduate classes (much like a teaching assistant in the USA) to generate income.

In the U.K., funding for Ph.D. students is often provided by government-funded [[Research Council|Research Councils]] such as the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council|EPSRC]] for Engineering and the Physical Sciences, the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|MRC]] for Medicine and the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council|AHRC]] for students of the arts and humanities. The funding takes the form of a [[Income tax|tax-free]] [[bursary]] of around [[£]]12,000 per year for three years, whether or not the degree continues for longer.

Research Council funding is typically allocated to an academic department which then allocate it to students. In order to ensure that students receiving such funding use it to complete their degree rather than for a paid three-year holiday, funding is provided to departments on the basis that future funding will be reduced by one half of a student for each student who does not complete a funded degree. This means that departments have a strong incentive to ensure that funding is allocated only to students who are likely to finish the degree.

Students at British universities may also take part in tutoring, work as a research assistant or even occasionally lecturing, either to supplement existing funding or as a sole means of funding.

==Oral defense==
In some countries, a Ph.D. candidate is required to present an oral defense of his or her thesis, known in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] as a '''viva''' (short for ''viva voce'', Latin for &quot;by live voice&quot;) before a committee. In [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[France]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], and [[Switzerland]], before a degree can be granted, the dissertation has to be defended in what is, using a medieval term, called a '''[[disputation]]''': an expert in the field, often from another university, is appointed who will present the dissertation, subject it to a critical examination and discuss it with the author. In the context of the disputation, the critical examiner is termed the ''opponent'', and the author of the dissertation the ''respondent''. The dissertation has to be generally available in its final or at least in a preliminary published form a few weeks before the disputation (7 weeks in Sweden), which is open to the public; after the opponent is finished, anyone present is allowed to ask critical questions (anyone who does is called an &quot;opponent ex auditorio&quot;&amp;mdash;an opponent from the auditorium). The final grade is decided after the disputation in a meeting between the opponent and a grading committee of three or (sometimes) four people. In theory, also the points raised by ''oppenenti ex auditorio'' affect the grade. It has happened, that such opponent has caused the committee not to pass the ''respondent'', although this would be extremely extraordinary nowadays. 

In the United States a final oral defense before one's dissertation committee is required although it is rare that at this stage the thesis is not accepted.  Nonetheless, there are typically several candidates per decade in each college of each major U.S. university who somehow do fail to defend successfully.  Most who fail do not complete the process at a subsequent defense. It is a largely unwritten rule in the U.S. that unqualified candidates are eliminated during the coursework or dissertation research phases, and are never permitted to defend, hence the rarity of failing to pass the final defense in most cases.  Minor edits are often (most times) required during the defense by committee members, and must be made prior to the final signing of the committee's recommendation paperwork by all committee members.  At the end of the defense, the candidate is excused from the room, and the committee votes in secret whether to grant the degree.  Upon successfully voting in the affirmative unanimously, the committee then calls the candidate back in to the room by addressing him or her using the honorific Dr. (with their last name) if successful, or Mr. or Ms. (with their last name) if unsuccessful.  In some universities, the candidate is considered to become a Doctor of Philosophy at the instant that all committee members vote in the affirmative.  In others, the degree must be conferred by the university corporation.

The rare case of not successfully defending is also true in the [[Netherlands]], where the oral defense (&quot;promotie&quot;) typically happens after the thesis has already been approved by examiners. The oral defense is ended after a preset amount of time by the University-appointed 'pedel' or ''custos'' who is in charge of the protocol and will end the defense with the words &quot;Hora est!&quot; (latin for ''it is time'' or ''the hour has come'').  

In contrast, examinations ''viva voce'' in British universities are by no means a rubber stamp.  Whilst many (perhaps most) theses are passed with some minor corrections or revisions required by the examiners, very few are passed with no corrections whatsoever, and indeed a pass-without-correction is considered a particular honour.  Moreover, it is not uncommon for British theses to be failed, as well &amp;mdash; in which case, either major re-writes are required, followed by a new viva, or else the thesis may be awarded the lesser degree of M.Phil ([[Master of Philosophy]]) instead.

== Comparative value ==

A Ph.D. does not confer commensurate advantage in every sphere. For example, many commercial organizations regard a [[Professional Master's degree|professional Master's degree]], such as an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]], or professional designation, such as [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]], as the highest level of education that is desirable. Traditional views of the value of academic study in commerce are changing {{inote|MacGillivray, Alex; Potts, Gareth; Raymond, Polly. ''Secrets of Their Success'' (London: New Economics Foundation, 2002) pp. 16-19|NEF2002}} but scepticism about the commercial value of a Ph.D. prevails. Medical schools may offer research Ph.D. degrees in conjunction with their M.D. programs, although an M.D. by itself is all that is required to teach medicine.

==Criticism==
The Ph.D. is often the topic of scholarly debate and criticism, given its almost exclusive concern with [[research]] and publication to the alleged neglect of numerous other faculty responsibilities that include [[teaching]], collegial evaluation, collective and individual curricular planning, etc. Solutions have met with varying degrees of success. In the 1960s, the prestigious [[Carnegie Foundation]] helped promote and establish the [[Doctor of Arts]] degree as an alternative to the Ph.D. The D.A. degree, with its focus on content specialty, curriculum design, and [[pedagogy]], was designed to help prepare expert teachers in various fields. Its well-defined disciplinary focus makes it different from the [[Ed.D.]] (Doctor of Education) while still embracing the Ed.D.'s concern for issues in education. The D.A. continues to be offered in many universities across the United States and in other countries, though a few D.A. programs have since been converted to the Ph.D. model. Still, the D.A. has many steadfast supporters. Other solutions include a re-thinking of the Ph.D. in order to address its perceived shortcomings. [[William Henry Bragg]], the noted physicist, was famously known to have said, &quot;whatever you do, don't do a Ph.D.&quot;.

==Etymology==
There are many other doctoral degrees with different designations, e.g. [[Doctor of Arts|D.A.]] (Doctor of Arts), [[D.M.A.]] (Doctor of Musical Arts), [[Ed.D.]] (Doctor of Education), [[Th.D]]. (Doctor of Theology), etc. [[Johns Hopkins University]] was the first university in the [[United States]] to confer doctoral degrees. The first Ph.D. in Business was granted by the [[University of Chicago]]  in 1920s. 

In the United Kingdom and other universities in the British Commonwealth, Ph.D.s are distinguishable from the [[higher doctorate]]s that outrank them (such as D.Litt. ([[Doctor of Letters]]) or D.Sc. ([[Doctor of Science]]), which are issued by a committee on the basis of a long record of research and publication).  They are also distinct from ''professional'' doctorates such as those conferred in medicine, education, engineering and jurisprudence (M.D., Ed.D., Eng.D., D.Jur.).  In most universities, professional doctorates involve coursework or a much smaller research component, so the Ph.D. is therefore understood formally to outrank them. However at the ancient British Universities (i.e. [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]) the  M.D. is of a far more ancient origin (medieval) than that of the Ph.D (twentieth century). Hence the M.D. outranks the Ph.D. in the hierarchy of the University. This is regardless of the academic rigor of the comparative theses. 

In German speaking countries and most eastern European countries, the corresponding degree is simply called &quot;Doctor&quot; and is further distinguished by subject area with a Latin suffix (e.g. &quot;Dr.med.&quot; - doctor medicinæ - which is not equal to a Ph.D., &quot;Dr.rer.nat - doctor rerum naturalium (Doctor of Science), &quot;Dr.phil.&quot; - doctor philosophiæ. (For a full list of these titles, see the German entry for [[:de:Doktor|Doktor]]).

While the Ph.D. is the most common doctoral degree, and even often (mis)understood to be synonymous with the term &amp;ldquo;[[doctorate]],&amp;rdquo; the [[U.S. Department of Education]] and the [[U.S. National Science Foundation]] (NSF) recognize numerous doctoral degrees as equivalent, and do not discriminate between them.

Sometimes a university grants an [[honorary degree|honorary Ph.D. or D.A.]], or other doctoral degree, with the added designation of ''[[honoris causa]]'' ([[Latin]] for ''for the sake of honor''), or Dr.h.c.

'''Daniel Ortega Saavedra''' (born [[11 November]] [[1945]]) was the president of [[Nicaragua]] from [[1985]] to [[1990]]. For much of his life he has been an important leader in the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] (''Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional'' or ''FSLN'').

==Rise to power==

Ortega was born to a middle-class family in La Libertad, Nicaragua. His parents were active in opposition to the regime of [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]], and he was arrested for his own political activities as early as age 15. In 1963 he attended the [[University of Central America| University of Central America, Managua]] in [[Managua]] and quickly joined the then-underground FSLN. By 1967 he became a leader in the FSLN, in charge of the urban [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign, but shortly after that he was arrested. He remained in prison until 1974, when he was released in exchange for hostages held by the FSLN. He immediately visited [[Cuba]], a major source of aid for the Sandinistas, and returned to his role as guerrilla commander. 

When Somoza was overthrown by the FSLN in July 1979, Ortega became a member of the five-person [[Junta of National Reconstruction]], which also included Sandinista militant [[Moisés Hassan]], novelist [[Sergio Ramírez Mercado]], businessman [[Alfonso Robelo Callejas]], and journalist [[Violeta Barrios de Chamorro]] (associated with the newspaper [[La Prensa]]). The FSLN came to dominate the junta, Robelo and Chamorro resigned, and Ortega became the ''[[de facto]]'' ruler of the country.

In November 1984 Ortega called national elections and won the presidency with 63% of the vote, taking office on January 10, 1985. At the request of the [[United States]], some opposition parties [[boycott|boycotted]] the election, which was immediately denounced as a &quot;sham&quot; by the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration; however, many international observers declared the election to be fair. 

For more details on Ortega’s presidency, see [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]].

==Post-1990==

In Nicaragua's 1990 elections, Ortega lost to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, his former colleague in the Junta. Chamorro was supported by a 14-party anti-Sandinista alliance known as the [[National Opposition Union]] (Union Nacional Opositora, UNO). The various anti-Sandinista guerrilla movements collectively known as the [[Contras]], as well as the United States’ trade [[embargo]] against the country, greatly hurt Ortega’s popularity in this election.

Ortega stood for election again in October 1996 and November 2001, but lost on both occasions. In these elections, a key issue was the allegation of corruption. In Ortega’s last days as president, through a series of legislative acts known as “The [[Piñata]]”, estates that had been seized by the Sandinista government (some valued at millions and even billions US$) became the private property of various FSLN officials, including Ortega himself. It is also alleged that Ortega appropriated national bank funds for his personal account. In reference to these allegations, critics often call Ortega “El Piñatin”. 

In 2001, the allegations of corruption against Ortega were somewhat overshadowed by those against [[Arnoldo Aleman]], who defeated Ortega in 1996 and was still president in 2001. However, Ortega was then confronted with other scandals. His stepdaughter, [[Zoilamérica Narváez]], made public allegations that he sexually abused her. Entities in the United States, most notably [[Jeb Bush]], ran large ads in Nicaraguan newspapers associating Ortega with international [[terrorism]]. 

Ortega has long been accused of [[caudillo|caudillismo]] (anti-democratic politico-military populism) and excessively authoritarian leadership. Prominent Sandinistas including [[Sergio Ramirez]] and [[Herty Lewites]] have left the party or have been expelled for dissenting to Ortega’s power. Many such dissenters support a small splinter group, the [[Sandinista Renewal Movement]] (the Movimiento Renovador Sandinista or “MRS”), although this party eventually chose to support Ortega’s candidacy in the 2001 election. More recently, journalist [[Carlos Guadamuz]] was murdered for their reporting critical of Ortega. Others have received death threats, including the well-known political cartoonist [[Manuel Guillén]]. There is no clear evidence that Ortega was directly involved in any such incidents. [http://www.ifex.org/fr/content/view/full/67620/] 
 
Daniel Ortega was instrumental in creating the controversial strategic pact between the FSLN and the [[Constitutional Liberal Party]] (Partido Liberal Constitucionalista, PLC). This alliance of Nicaragua's two major parties has changed the structure of the government and minimized the participation of other parties. ''&quot;El Pacto,&quot;'' as it is known in Nicaragua, is said to have personally benefited former presidents Ortega and Aleman greatly, while constraining current president Bolaños.
 
Ortega continues to lead the Sandinista party, which holds 43 seats in the Nicaraguan Parliament, making it the country's second largest party.  Presidential elections are due in November 2006, and public opinion polls [[as of 2005]] suggest Ortega will be one of a few leading candidates. [[Herty Lewites]] &amp;mdash; also running for president &amp;mdash; has suggested that Ortega's pact with Aleman has given Ortega ''de facto'' control of the bodies responsible for administering the election, and thus that Ortega will be even more formidable than polls indicate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about the warship. For other meaning, see [[destroyer (disambiguation)]].''
[[Image:destroyer.arp.500pix.jpg|thumb|250px|[[USS Lassen (DDG-82)|USS ''Lassen'']], an [[Arleigh Burke class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke''-class]] destroyer]]
In [[navy|naval]] terminology, a '''destroyer''' is a fast and maneuverable yet long-endurance [[warship]] intended to escort larger vessels in a [[Naval fleet|fleet]] or [[battle group]] and defend them against smaller, short-range attackers (originally [[torpedo boat]]s, later [[submarine]]s and [[aircraft]]).  At the beginning of the [[21st century]], destroyers are the heaviest [[surface combatant]]s in general use, with only two nations (the [[United States]] and [[Russia]]) operating [[Cruiser (warship)|cruiser]]s and none operating [[battleship]]s.{{ref|1}}  Modern destroyers are equivalent in tonnage and drastically superior in firepower to cruisers of the [[World War II]] era, capable of carrying [[nuclear missile]]s able to destroy cities in a very small volley.

==Genesis of the destroyer==
The destroyer originated in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Japan]] in the last years of the [[1880s]], and became firmly established after the [[Chilean Civil War]] of [[1891]] and in the [[Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895)|Sino-Japanese War (1894&amp;ndash;1895)]]. In those conflicts, a new type of ship proved to be devastatingly effective&amp;mdash;the swift, small [[torpedo-boat]] invented by [[John Ericsson]]. These small boats had speed greater than that of the larger ships, and could dash in close to them, loose their [[torpedo]]es, and dash away.

While normally a small, short-range boat of this sort would be easily destroyed long before getting into range, they could be operated within a fleet with larger ships as long as the fleet was close to base. In this case the defending force had to choose which set of targets to attack: the larger ships which they were built to counter, or the smaller torpedo boats which were charging in to attack. Yet this one-two punch cost almost nothing to the attacker, as the small torpedo boats were very inexpensive.

The world's navies recognized the need for a counter weapon and developed the ''torpedo-boat destroyer''. The basic idea was to have a screen of ships that were as fast as the torpedo boats, but armed with guns instead of torpedoes. They would operate at a distance from the main fleet of [[capital ships]] to keep the torpedo-boats from ever getting into [[torpe; except in professional legal education (see below).

Far and away, the most commonly awarded research doctorate is the [[Doctor of Philosophy|Philosophiae Doctor or Doctor of Philosophy]], abbreviated Ph.D. or D.Phil. In the United States, the [[Doctor of Science]] (abbreviated Sc.D.) is similar to and on par with the Ph.D., but with focus on research in the scientific disciplines.  Most research doctorates are graduate degrees, open only to those who already posses an undergraduate degree or advanced degree such as a master's degree.  

Professional doctorates are many and varied, including the [[Doctor of Medicine|Medicis Doctor or Doctor of Medicine]], [[Juris Doctor|Juris Doctor or Doctor of Jurisprudence]], [[Doctor of Chiropractic]], [[Doctor of Education|Educationis Doctor or Doctor of Education]], [[Doctor of Business Administration]], [[Doctor of Pharmacy]], [[Doctor of Psychology]], [[Doctor of Veterinary Medicine]], [[Doctor of Musical Arts|Doctor of Musical Arts or Artes Musicalis Doctor]], [[Doctor of Fine Arts]], and so on.  Many professional doctorates have some research and other requirements similar to the Ph.D., however, those doctorates have limited academic standing in most American academic institutions (unless they are teaching the profession).  Other professional doctorates are purely &quot;taught doctorates.&quot;

==Use of &quot;Doctor&quot; as a Title of Address==

All persons who possess a doctoral degree are entitled to call themselves &quot;Doctor&quot;. (However, the use of &quot;doctor&quot; as a noun is almost exclusively limited to medical doctors.)

Physicians invariably use the title &quot;Doctor&quot; as a prefix. Dentists, podiatrists, chiropractors, osteopaths, optometrists and veterinarians are also called Doctor whether or not they possess a doctoral degree.  (In the United States, however, they invariably do.) 

In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and other areas whose culture was more recently linked to the [[United Kingdom]], within medical circles the title ''Doctor'' generally applies to medically qualified individuals (&quot;[[Registered medical practitioner|registered medical practitioners]]&quot;) even if their degree is not a doctorate. However, those who are Members or Fellows of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] for historic reasons prefer to be addressed as ''[[Mister|Mr]], [[Mrs.|Mrs]], [[Ms.|Ms]] or [[Miss]]'', even if they do hold a doctorate.

Psychologists or doctoral level psychotherapists use Dr. or their terminal degree after their last name. Terminal degrees include Ph.D., Ed.D., or Psy.D. 

In the United States when addressing formal correspondence those holding academic doctorates generally use the post-nominal, &quot;Ph.D.&quot;or the prefix &quot;Dr.&quot; The prefix &quot;Dr.&quot; is sometimes used, however, especially in the South.  In addition, within the biomedical science research arena, it is common to address Ph.D.s as &quot;Doctor&quot; even when such person holds a professorship in research/academic institutions.

In Britain and other Commonwealth countries, holders of non-medical doctorates also sometimes use Dr as a form of address outside of academic settings. In formal correspondence the prefix Dr is used without a post-nominal. (In Commonwealth usage, Ph.D. is not commonly used as a post-nominal except when listing all qualifications and honours.)  A large proportion do not bother with the prefix in daily life, though.

==Legal Doctors==

Academically, Law is only a doctoral subject in a some countries, the United States and all [[Europe|European]] countries among them.  Lawyers were called &quot;civil doctors,&quot; as distinct from the medical doctor and other types centuries ago, although that use has disappeared over the last several centuries.  

Worldwide within the legal profession, practising lawyers are typically called &quot;Mr.&quot; or &quot;Ms./Mrs./Ms./Miss,&quot; regardless of whether they possess a doctoral degree or not.  Exceptions include the [[Channel Islands]], where they bear the title of [[Advocate]]).  This is a convention of the courts, of litigation and of the legal profession generally.  The title Counselor is often used in courtrooms in the United States.  A Judge or Justice in the United States, is addressed as Judge followed by his or her surname, while in the court, he or she is addressed as Your Honor.  No practising lawyer is ever called &quot;Doctor.&quot;  The only exception is when a laywer with a doctoral degree is a witness in a case, in which case that person may be addressed &quot;Doctor&quot; in the witness box.

Historically, American legal education followed the British model.  Law was an undergraduate subject and a degree in law was an undergraduate degree, typically the Legum Baccalaureas (LL.B.) or Bachelor of Laws.  This was the basic qualifying degree.  People who wanted to teach in law school, or who wished to add to their knowledge after a few years of practice, would go on from the LL.B. to take the LL.M. or Master of Laws.  The terminal degree in the sequence was, of course, the LL.D. or Doctor of Laws.  This is the top law degree in The United Kingdom, Ireland, and throughout the Commonwealth.  In the United States however, a course of events led to the LL.D. becoming a merely honourary degree, while law became considered a graduate subject and it's degrees graduate-level degrees.

An undergraduate degree in the United States is considered a basic foundation in academia, not a professional education.  Education which requires an undergraduate degree as a prerequisite, such as a medical or legal training, is considered a graduate degree.  The LL.B. degree, as a Bachelor's degree, implies that it is an undergraduate degree equal to a [[Bachelor of Arts]] or a [[Bachelor of Science]].  The Juris Doctor degree became the standard legal degree, to reflect both the graduate nature of the training, and a professional standing equivalent to a Medical Doctor.

By World War I, students had to complete two years or 60 credits of undergraduate coursework before admission to law school, this is still the rule enshrined in law in the [[State Bar of California|State of California]], though ABA-accredited law schools in the state exceed this minimum standard.  All ABA-accredited law schools require completion of a bachelor's degree for admission to law school.

The J.D./D.Jur. is a doctoral degree in professional law.  By the year 2000, it had completely replaced the LL.B. in the American law school.  Except for California, you must have a bachelor's degree to be eligible for admission to a J.D. or D.Jur. programme.

Issuing nondoctoral graduate degrees in law degrees have begun at some schools for programs not meant to train lawyers.  Loyola University of Chicago, for example, offers a Juris Magister or Master of Jurisprudence degree in health law, for health law professionals who require a working knowledge of law (e.g., to communicate intelligently with attorneys) but do not need to become practising attorneys.  

The LL.M. Degree also exists as a special case in American legal tradition, as a conversion or adapatation of foreign legal training into qualifications to practice in the United States.  Many states, for example, will accept a foreign law degree as a qualification for admission to practice if it is supplemented by a LL.M. degree from an American law school.  A few American law schools already restrict enrolment in their LL.M. programmes to foreign-trained students.

A small number of law schools have created explicitly post-doctoral law programmes has begun with the creation of the Scientiae Juris Doctor or S.J.D. degree (Doctor of the Science of Law).  

In Germany, a Doctor of Law was accorded the same privileges as a baron, for example, being allowed to use the same [[falconry|hawk]] as a baron.

==Other uses of &quot;Doctor&quot;==

* In some regions such as the American South, &quot;Doctor&quot; is traditionally added to the first name of people (especially men) holding doctorates, where it is used in either direct or indirect familiar address, eg. &quot;Dr. Bill&quot; instead of &quot;Dr. Smith.&quot;  

* &quot;Doc&quot; is a common nickname or for someone with a doctorate, or for a physician, in real life and in fiction &amp;mdash; for example, the character &quot;Doc&quot; in [[Gunsmoke]].  Also, [[Doc Savage]], 'Man of Bronze', a series of young adult pulp fiction paperback books popular among US high school students during the [[1960s]] and [[1970s]].  Another example is [[Doc Brass]], a similar pulp fiction character.

* In [[Roman Catholicism]], a [[Doctor of the Church]] is an eminent [[theology|theologian]] (e.g. [[Thomas Aquinas]]) from whose teachings the whole [[Christian Church]] is held to have derived great advantage. This is not an academic title but reflects the most ancient sense of the word as &quot;teacher&quot;.

* &quot;[[Doctor (children's game)|Doctor]]&quot; is a game played by children.  Typically, one child pretends to be a physician while other children undress so that they can be examined by the &quot;doctor&quot;.  Conventional wisdom is that parents only need to worry about this game if their children are still &quot;playing doctor&quot; after they go through puberty, when the examinations are apt to get more &quot;thorough&quot; than they were before.

* A '''doctor blade''' is a [[knife]] blade pressed to a moving surface to smooth the surface or remove an unwanted substance from it.  Doctor blades are often used in industrial processes, such as [[offset printing]].

* ''Doctors'' is a UK daytime soap opera.

* ''The Flying Doctors'' was an Australian soap opera about physicians in the outback.

* The main character of the British television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' is  &quot;[[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]]&quot;.

* [[Doctor (Mozilla)|Doctor]] is a web-based interface to [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] allowing easy creation of [[Patch (computing)|patches]].

* [[Doctor (band)|Doctor]] is a Canadian rock band.

* In the United Kingdom, Ireland, and parts of the Commonwealth, some medical doctors are called &quot;Mister&quot;.  This exception only applies to surgeons, who drop the title of &quot;doctor&quot; once they pass their final examinations, an homage to their predecessors, the [[barber surgeons]].  Unlike apothecaries and alchemists &amp;mdash; precursors of modern physicians &amp;mdash; barber surgeons were not learned &quot;teachers&quot; but rather tradesmen.  When some medically-qualified people, who wish to train to become surgeons, pass the (notoriously difficult) examinations to enable them to become a member of one or more of the [[Royal Surgical Colleges of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Colleges of Surgeons]] and become &quot;[[MRCS]]&quot;, it is customary for them to drop the &quot;doctor&quot; prefix and take up &quot;mister&quot;.  This rule applies to any doctor of any grade who has passed the appropriate exams, and is not the exclusive province of consultant-level surgeons.  In recent times, other surgically-orientated specialists, such as [[gynaecologist|gynaecologists]], have also adopted the &quot;mister&quot; prefix.  [[Physician|Physicians]], on the other hand, when they pass their &quot;[[MRCP]]&quot; examinations, which enable them to become members of the [[Royal College of Physicians]], do not drop the &quot;doctor&quot; prefix and remain doctor, even when they are consultants. In the United Kingdom the status and rank of consultant surgeons with the MRCS, titled &quot;mister&quot;, and consultant physicians with the MRCP, titled &quot;doctor&quot;, is identical. Surgeons in the USA and elsewhere remain steadfastly &quot;doctor&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Donald I''' ('''Domnall mac Ailpín''') (c. [[812]]&amp;ndash;[[863]]) was [[King of Scots]] from [[858]] to [[862]].  He was the younger son of [[Alpin II of Dalriada]] and succeeded his brother, King [[Kenneth I of Scotland]], to the throne upon his death.

Described before as ''the wanton son of the foreign woman'', Donald I had a short term as King.  He established an ancient corpus of laws and rights (known as the [[laws of Aed]], or Aedh) that apparently included the custom of [[tanistry]].  According to this custom, the [[succession|successor]] of a King was elected during his lifetime from the eldest and worthiest of his kin, often a collateral (brother or cousin) in preference to a descendant.  During Donald I's reign, his nephew, [[Constantine I of Scotland]], was chosen to succeed him following his death.  The custom of tanistry lasted until the reign of [[Malcolm II of Scotland]] (1005&amp;ndash;34).

Uncertainty exists about the circumstances of his death in [[862]]. He either died at a battle in [[Scone, Perth and Kinross|Scone]] or peacefully in his palace at [[Kinn Belachoir]]. He died unmarried and childless. It is not known where he was buried.

[[Image:Holbein-death.png|right|framed|From The Dance of Death by Hans Holbein]]

'''''La Danse Macabre''''', also called ''Dance of death, La Danza Macabra,'' or ''Totentanz'', is a [[Middle Ages| late-medieval]] [[allegory]] on the universality of [[death]]: no matter one's station in life, the dance of death united all. ''La Danse Macabre'' consists of the [[personified death]] leading a row of dancing figures from all walks of life to the [[grave]]&amp;mdash;typically with an [[emperor]], [[monarch|king]], [[pope]], [[monk]], youngster, beautiful girl, all in [[skeleton]]-state. They were produced under the impact of the [[Black Death]], reminding people of how fragile their lives were and how vain the glories of [[personal life|earthly life]] were. Its origins are postulated from illustrated sermon texts, the earliest artistic examples are in a cemetery in Paris from 1424. 

==Paintings==

The earliest artistic example is from the [[fresco]]ed cemetery of the [[Church of the Holy Innocents]] in Paris (1424). There are also works by [[Konrad Witz]] in [[Basel]] (1440), [[Bernt Notke]] in [[Lübeck]] (1463) and woodcuts by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] (1538). 

[[Image:Thetriumphofdeath.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''The Triumph of Death'']] 

A famous ''[[The Triumph of Death]]'' painting (c.1562) in the [[Museo del Prado]], [[Madrid]], is by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] who was strongly influenced by the style of [[Hieronymus Bosch]].

==Musical Settings==

Musical examples include the [[Danse Macabre (Saint-Saëns)|Danse Macabre]] by [[Camille  Saint-Saëns]] (1874) and the [[Totentanz (Liszt)|Totentanz]] by [[Franz Liszt]] (1849), a set of variations based on the [[plainchant]] melody ''[[Dies Irae]]''.


==Films==
 
A particularly sarcastic ''Danse Macabre'' fashion show appears in [[Roma (Fellini)|Roma]] by [[Federico Fellini]].

The final shots of the film ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' by [[Ingmar Bergman]] depict a kind of ''Danse Macabre''.

      <comment>removed Jesuits category --he was not a Jesuit</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''David Abercromby''' was an obscure 17th-century [[Scotland|Scottish]] physician and writer.

His medical reputation was based on his ''Tuta ac efficax luis venereae saepe absque mercurio ac semper absque salivatione mercuriali curando methodus'' ([[1684]]) which was translated into [[French language|French]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[German language|German]].  Two other works by him were ''De Pulsus Variatione'' ([[1685]]), and ''Ars explorandi medicas facultates plantarum ex solo sapore'' ([[1688]]); His ''Opuscula'' were collected in [[1687]]. These professional writings gave him a place and memorial in A. von Haller's ''Bibliotheca Medicinae Pract.'' ([[1779]]).

He also wrote some books in [[theology]] and [[philosophy]], controversial in their time but little remembered today. Brought up at [[Douai]] as a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priests, he was converted to [[Protestantism]] in 1682 and came to abjure [[popery]], and published ''Protestancy proved Safer than Popery'' ([[1686]]).  But the most noticeable of his productions is ''A Discourse of Wit'' ([[1685]]), which contains some of the most characteristic metaphysical opinions of the Scottish philosophy of common sense.  It was followed by ''Academia Scientiarum'' ([[1687]]), and by ''A Moral Discourse of the Power of Interest'' ([[1690]]), dedicated to [[Robert Boyle]], Abercromby's patron in the 1680s.  He later wrote ''Reasons Why A Protestant Should not Turn Papist'' ([[1687]]), which has often wrongly been attributed to Boyle.  ''A Short Account of Scots Divines'', by him, was printed at [[Edinburgh]] in [[1833]], edited by James Maidment. The exact date of his death is unknown, but according to Haller he was alive early in the [[18th century]], possibly dying in 1702.

The term '''''deconstruction''''' was coined by French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] in the 1960s and is used in contemporary [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]] to denote a philosophy of meaning that deals with the ''ways'' that [[meaning]] is constructed and understood by writers, texts, and readers. One way of understanding the term is that it involves discovering, recognizing, and understanding the underlying — and unspoken and implicit — assumptions, ideas, and frameworks that form the basis for  thought and belief. It has various shades of meaning in different areas of study and discussion, and is, by its very nature, difficult to define without depending on &quot;un-deconstructed&quot; concepts.

{{Cleanup-rewrite}}

==The difficulty in defining deconstruction==

===The problems of definition===
The term ''deconstruction'' in the context of Western philosophy is highly resistant to formal definition. [[Martin Heidegger]] was perhaps the first to use the term (in contrast to [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] demolition), although the form we recognize in English is an element in a series of translations (from Heidegger's ''Abbau'' and ''Destruktion'' to [[Jacques Derrida|Jacques Derrida's]] ''déconstruction''), and it has been explored by others, including [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]], [[Paul de Man]], [[Jonathan Culler]], [[Barbara Johnson]], [[J. Hillis Miller]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]], and [[Geoffrey Bennington]].

These authors have resisted calls to define the word succinctly. When asked what deconstruction is, Derrida once stated, &quot;I have no simple and formalizable response to this question. All my essays are attempts to have it out with this formidable question.&quot; (Derrida 1985, at 4.) There is a great deal of confusion as to what kind of thing deconstruction is — whether it is a school of thought (it is certainly not so in the singular), a method of reading (it has often been reduced to this by various attempts to define it formally), or, as some call it, a &quot;textual event&quot; (a characterization implied by the Derrida quote just given) — and determining what authority to accord to a particular attempt at delimiting it.

Many pages have been devoted to attempts to define deconstruction or to demonstrate why attempts at delimitation are misconceived. Most of these attempts (including those signed by critics who are considered deconstructionist) are difficult reading and resistant to summary. On the other hand, there is a [[cottage industry]] of writers of variably explicit sympathy or antipathy to deconstruction (however they understand it) who attempt to explain it to those who are reluctant to read the original deconstructive texts.

Surveying the deconstructive texts and the secondary literature, one is confronted with a bafflingly heterogeneous range of arguments. These include claims that deconstruction can sort out the Western tradition in its entirety, by highlighting and discrediting unjustified privileges accorded to white males and other hegemonists. On the other hand, some critics claim that deconstruction is a dangerous form of [[nihilism]] that wishes the utter destruction of Western scientific and ethical values. As a rule, deconstruction is ridiculed by members of the political right of just about any stripe. Its reception on the left is far more varied, ranging from hostility to co-optation:
*While there is no doubtingance education 'inventory' it is technological appropriateness and connectivity, such as computer, or for that matter electrical connectivity that should be considered, when we think of the world as a whole, while fitting in technological applications to distance education.

==Delivery systems==
Older models of distance education utilized regular mail to send written material, [[video]]s, [[audiotape]]s, and [[CD-ROM]]s or other media storage format (e.g. [[SDRAM]] or [[CompactFlash]] cards) to the student and to turn in the exercises. Today's distance education course makes use of [[E-mail]], the [[World Wide Web|Web]], and [[video conferencing]] over [[broadband]] network connections for both wired physical locations and wireless mobile learning. In some countries, the material is supplemented by [[television]] and [[radio]] programming.  To compete with the conventional sector, course material must be of very high quality and completeness, and will use modern technologies such as  [[educational animation]]. 

Full time or part-time study is possible, but most students choose part-time study. Research study is possible as well. Distance education is offered at all levels, but is most frequently an option for university-level studies.  A form of educational program which is similar to this but which requires some amount of presence during the year is a [[low-residency program]].

Distance education programs are sometimes called '''correspondence courses''', an older term that originated in nineteenth-century [[vocational education]] programs that were conducted through postal mail. This term has been largely replaced by ''distance education'', and expanded to encompass more sophisticated technologies and delivery methods.  The first subject taught by correspondence was the [[Pitman Shorthand]], a tool of [[stenography]].  [[Primary education|Primary]] and [[secondary education]] programs were also widely available by correspondence, usually for children living in remote areas.

The '''Degree Confluence Project''' is a [[World Wide Web]]-based project which aims to have people visit each of the [[integer]] [[Degree (angle)|degree]] intersections of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] on [[Earth]], posting [[photograph]]s of each location online.

The precise location of each confluence is determined with [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers. For a ''successful visit'', the visitor must get within 100 [[metre]]s of the confluence point (using the [[WGS 84]] datum), and post a narrative and at least two photographs to the project website.
A visit, or attempted visit, which does not conform to these rules may still be recorded on the website as an ''incomplete visit''. The project allows visits to confluence points which have been visited previously, and many confluence points in [[North America]] and [[Europe]] have been visited several times.

The total number of confluence points is 64,442{{ref|numberofpoints}}, of which 21,541 are on land, 38,411 on water, and 4,490 on the [[Arctic]] ice cap. The project divides these points into ''primary'' and ''secondary'' confluences. A confluence is primary only if it is on land or within sight of land. In addition, at high [[latitude]]s only some points are designated primary, because confluences crowd together near the [[Geographic pole|poles]]. Both primary and secondary confluences may be visited and recorded.

One way to think of the Degree Confluence Project is as a way of [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] the surface of the [[Earth]].

== Notes == 
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 85%&quot;&gt;
#{{note|numberofpoints}} Latitude lines 89°N to 89°S (179), multiplied by 360° of longitude (360), plus the two poles (2) = 179 &amp;times; 360 + 2 = 64,442.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Dannykaye1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Kaye entertaining U.S. troops at [[U.S. Fleet Activities Sasebo|Sasebo, Japan]], 25 Oct 1945]]

'''Danny Kaye''' ([[January 18]], [[1913]] &amp;ndash; [[March 3]], [[1987]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[actor]], [[singer]] and [[comedian]].

Born to [[Jewish]] immigrants in [[Brooklyn]] as '''David Daniel Kaminsky''', red-haired Kaye became one of the world's best-known comedians.  In [[1941]] he appeared in the Broadway show, ''[[Lady in the Dark]]'' and performed the famous number &quot;[[Tchaikovsky (song)|Tchaikovsky]],&quot; by [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Ira Gershwin]], in which he sang the names of a whole string of [[Russia]]n composers at breakneck speed, seemingly without taking a breath. 

He was propelled to what today would be called superstardom in [[1948]] when he appeared at the [[London Palladium]] music hall. According to ''The New York Times'', he &quot;roused the Royal family to shrieks of laughter and was the first of many performers who have turned English variety into an American preserve.&quot; ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine described his reception as &quot;worshipful hysteria&quot; and noted that the royal family, for the first time in history, left the royal box to see the show from the front row of the orchestra. 

Kaye made his film debut in a [[1935]] comedy short subject  entitled ''Moon Over Manhattan'', although his feature film debut was ''[[Up in Arms]]'' ([[1944]]).  He starred in several movies with actress [[Virginia Mayo]] in the 1940's, and is well known for his roles in films such as ''[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]]'' ([[1947]]), ''[[The Inspector General]]'' ([[1949]]), ''[[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]]'' ([[1954]]), ''[[Knock on Wood]]'' ([[1954]]), ''[[The Court Jester]]'' ([[1956]]), and ''[[Merry Andrew (film)|Merry Andrew]]'' ([[1958]]). Kaye starred in two pictures based on biographies, ''[[Hans Christian Andersen (film)|Hans Christian Andersen]]'' ([[1952]])  about the [[Denmark|Danish]] story-teller, and ''[[The Five Pennies]]'' ([[1959]]) about [[jazz]] pioneer [[Red Nichols]]. Several of his films included the theme of doubles, two people who look identical (both played by Danny kaye) being mistaken for each other, to comic effect.

Kaye worked regularly in television in the [[1960s]] and beyond.  
He hosted his own variety hour on [[CBS]], ''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]'', from [[1963]] to [[1967]]. Kaye also did a stint as one of the [[What's My Line? Mystery Guests]] on the popular Sunday Night CBS-TV program. Later, Kaye also served as a guest panelist on that quiz show. Years later, Kaye also guest-starred in episodes of ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' and of the 1980's remake of  ''[[The Twilight Zone]]''. 

Kaye's influence was felt beyond the entertainment world in the world of professional sports as well.  Kaye was the original owner of the [[Seattle Mariners]] along with his partner Lester Smith, from 1977 - 81.

Kaye also acted in a [[pantomime]] production of ''[[Cinderella]]'', in [[Sydney]],[[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], during the [[1950]]'s, where he played the role of &quot;''[[Buttons (pantomime)|Buttons]]''&quot;, Cinderella's stepfather's servant, and also  Cinderella's friend.

In many of his movies, as well as on stage, Kaye proved to be an able actor, singer, dancer and comedian, often having his comedic talents showcased by special material written by his wife, [[Sylvia Fine]]. He showed quite a different and serious side as Ambassador for [[UNICEF]], and in one of his few dramatic roles in the memorable TV-movie ''[[Skokie]],'' in which he played a [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor. Before he died in [[1987]], Kaye also demonstrated his ability to conduct an orchestra during a comical, but technically sound, series of concerts organised for [[UNICEF]] fundraising.  Kaye received two [[Academy award]]s, an [[Academy Honorary Award|honorary award]] in [[1955]] and [[the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]] in [[1982]].

[[Joan Plowright]], widow of the actor [[Laurence Olivier]], claimed that Olivier had a long [[homosexuality|homosexual]] relationship with Kaye while Olivier was still married to his second wife, [[Vivien Leigh]]. Kaye's widow denied these rumors.

Kaye died in [[1987]] from a [[heart attack]], following a bout of [[hepatitis]]. He left a widow [[Sylvia Fine]] and a daughter Dena. He is interred in the [[Kensico Cemetery]] in [[Valhalla, New York]].

'''Daniel S. DeCarlo''' ([[12 December]], [[1919]], [[New Rochelle]], [[New York]] - [[19 December]], [[2001]], New Rochelle, New York) was an [[United States|American]] [[cartoonist]] best known as the [[artist]] who developed the look of [[Archie Comics]] in the late [[1950s]] and early [[1960s]], modernizing the characters to their contemporary appearance and establishing the publisher's house style. As well, he is the generally recognized creator of [[Sabrina the Teenage Witch]], [[Josie and the Pussycats]] (with the lead character named for his wife), and [[Cheryl Blossom]]. 

Previous to this he had a remarkable 10-year run on the humor title ''[[Millie the Model]]'' for [[Marvel Comics]]' 1950s predecessor, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], writing and drawing the [[slapstick]]y adventures of Millie Collins, her redheaded friendly nemesis Chili Storm and the rest of cast from #18-93 (June 1949 - Nov. 1959). DeCarlo also contributed the short-lived ''Sherry the Showgirl'' and ''Showgirls'' for Atlas.

DeCarlo attended New Rochelle High School and [[Manhattan]]'s [[Art Students League]] from [[1938]] to [[1941]], when he was drafted into the [[U.S. Army]]. Stationed in [[Great Britain]], he worked in the motor pool and as a draftsman, and painted company mascots on the noses of airplanes. He also drew a weekly [[military]] [[comic strip]]. He met his future wife, [[France|French]] citizen Josie Dumont, in [[Belgium]] after the [[Battle of the Bulge]].

In addition to his comic-book work, DeCarlo drew freelance pieces for the [[magazines]] ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' and ''[[Argosy Magazine|Argosy]]'', as well as publisher [[Martin_Goodman_(publisher)|Martin Goodman]]'s [[Humorama]] line of [[pin-up girl]] cartoon digests. Many of his Humorama illustrations were published in ''The Pin-up Art of Dan DeCarlo'' ([[Fantagraphics]], 2005; ISBN 1560976195) and the scheduled ''Innocence and Seduction: The Art of Dan DeCarlo'' (Fantagraphics, March 1, 2006; ISBN 1560977108).

In his later years he was involved in a bitter legal dispute with Archie Comics over ownership of Josie and the Pussycats characters, which were to be featured in the ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (movie)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' movie released in 2001 by [[MCA/Universal]]. In the midst of the dispute, the publisher terminated its 40-year relationship with him. Among his final works were a story for [[Paul Dini]]'s independent comics title ''[[Jingle Belle]]'', and stories for [[Bongo Comics]]' ''[[The Simpsons]]'' [[TV series|TV]] tie-in comic, ''[[Bart Simpson]]''.

DeCarlo, who lived near New Rochelle in [[Scarsdale, New York]], died of [[pneumonia]], according to his wife. Some press reports listed [[heart attack]]. He was predeceased by his twin sons, Dan Jr. and Jim, who assisted their father as [[inkers]].

His work over the years won him much recognition in the industry.  He won the [[National Cartoonists Society]] Award for Best Comic Book in 2000 for [[Betty &amp; Veronica]].  He was nominated for the Shazam Award for Best Penciller (Humor Division) in 1974.

==Quotes==
*Josie DeCarlo, on the inspiration for the fictional Josie [http://www.thecomicsource.com/news/news19.html]: &quot;We went on a [[Caribbean]] cruise, and I had a [cat] costume for the cruise, and that's the way it started.&quot;

*Paul Dini [http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=731]: &quot;&quot;It was tragic that when he was at an age when many cartoonists are revered as treasures by more beneficent publishers, Dan felt spurned and slighted by the owners of properties that prospered greatly from his contributions. Still, he was esteemed by fans and professionals the world over, and he often told me he was very grateful for the support he received from them over the past few years.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''DanceWriting''' is a form of [[dance notation]]. Developed in [[1972]] by [[Valerie Sutton]], it is part of a greater body of work called [[MovementWriting]] or the [[International Movement-Writing Alphabet]].

DanceWriting uses [[figurative]] and [[Abstract art|abstract]] [[symbols]] on a five-staff stave (the [[Western culture|Western]] [[music notation]] stave). It is similar in appearance to [[Benesh Movement Notation]].

There are many other forms of dance notation, such as [[Labanotation]] and [[Benesh Movement Notation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''debit card''' is an [[ISO 7810]] card which physically resembles a [[credit card]], and, like a credit card, is used as an alternative to [[cash]] when making purchases. However, when purchases are made with a debit card, the funds are withdrawn directly from the purchaser's current/[[checking account|checking]] or [[savings account|savings]] account at a [[bank]] or [[credit union]]. 

==Types of debit card==
[[Image:Smartcard.JPG|thumb|250px|A [[Finland|Finnish]] [[smart card]], combining both [[credit card]] and debit card properties. The 3 by 5 mm security chip embedded in the card is shown enlarged in the inset. The gold contact pads on the card enables electronic access to the chip.]]

Although many debit cards are of the [[Visa (credit card)|Visa]] or [[MasterCard]] brand, there are many other types of debit card, each accepted only within a particular country or region, for example [[Switch (debit card)|Switch]] in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Carte Bleue]] in [[France]], [[Laser (debit card)|Laser]] in [[Ireland]], and EC (formerly Eurocheque) in [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]]. The need for cross-border compatibility and the advent of the [[euro]] recently led to many of these card networks being rebranded with the internationally recognised [[Maestro (debit card)|Maestro]] logo, which is part of the [[MasterCard]] brand. Some debit cards are dual branded with the logo of the former national card as well as [[Maestro (debit card)|Maestro]].

Banks in [[France]] charge annual fees for debit cards (despite card payments being very cost efficient for the banks), yet they do not charge personal customers for chequebooks orion of [[language]], [[morality|moral understanding]], and [[identity (social science)|identity]] formation.

Developmental psychologists investigates key questions, such as whether children are qualitatively different from adults or simply lack the experience that adults draw upon. Other issues that they deal with is the question of whether development occurs through the gradual accumulation of knowledge or through shifts from one stage of thinking to another;  or if children are born with innate knowledge or figure things out through experience; and whether development driven by the [[social context]] or by something inside each child.

Developmental psychology informs several applied fields, including: [[educational psychology|educational psychology]], [[child psychopathology]] and [[developmental forensics]].  Developmental psychology complements several other basic research fields in [[psychology]] including [[social psychology]], [[cognitive psychology]], and [[comparative psychology]].

== Theory ==
Many theoretical perspectives attempt to explain development, among the most prominent are: [[Jean Piaget]]'s [[Theory of cognitive development|Stage Theory]], [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s [[Social Contextualism]] (and its heir, the Development in Context or Human Ecology theory of [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]]), and especially the [[information processing]] framework employed by cognitive psychology.

Historical theories continue to provide a basis for additional research, among them are [[Erik Erikson]]'s eight [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stages of psychosocial development]] and [[John B. Watson]]'s and [[B. F. Skinner]]'s [[Behaviorism]]. Many other theories are prominent for their contributions to particular aspects of development.  For example, [[Attachment theory]] describes kinds of interpersonal relationships and [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] describes [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stages in moral reasoning]].

=== Role of experience ===
[[Image:Baby thinking Sofia SERRES.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A baby thinking]]
A significant question in developmental psychology is the relation between innateness and environmental influence in regard to any particular aspect of development. This is often referred to as &quot;[[nature versus nurture]]&quot; or [[nativism]] versus [[empiricism]]. A nativist account of development would argue that the processes in question are innate, that is, they are specified by the organism's [[genes]]. An empiricist perspective would argue that those processes are acquired in interaction with the environment. Today developmental psychologists rarely take such extreme positions with regard to most aspects of development; rather they investigate, among many other things, the relationship between innate and environmental influences. One of the ways in which this relationship has been explored in recent years is through the emerging field of [[evolutionary developmental psychology]].

One area where this innateness debate has been prominently portrayed is in research on [[language acquisition]]. A major question in this area is whether or not certain properties of human language are specified genetically or can be acquired through [[learning]]. The nativist position argues that the input from language is too impoverished for infants and children to acquire the structure of language. Linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] asserts that, evidenced by the lack of sufficient information in the language input, there is a [[universal grammar]] that applies to all human languages and is pre-specified. This has led to the idea that there is a special cognitive [[modularity of mind|module]] suited for learning language, often called the [[language acquisition device]].

The empiricist position on the issue of language acqusition suggests that the language input does provide the necessary information required for learning the structure of language and that infants acquire language through a process of [[statistical learning]]. From this perspective, language can be acquired via general learning methods that also apply to other aspects of development, such as perceptual learning. There is a great deal of evidence for components of both the nativist and empiricist position, and this is a hotly debated research topic in developmental psychology.

On the other hand, Chomsky's critique of a specific nativist position on this issue, [[radical behaviorism|radical behaviorist]] [[Burrhus Frederic Skinner]]'s ''[[Verbal Behavior]]'' written in 1957, is widely considered among developmental psychologists to have sparked the decline in influence of behaviorism and signaled the beginning of the [[cognitive revolution]] in psychology.

=== Mechanisms of development ===
Developmental psychology is concerned not only with describing the characteristics of psychological change over time, but also seeks to explain the principles and internal workings underlying these changes. Understanding these factors is aided by the use of [[model (abstract)|models]]. Developmental models are often [[computer model|computational]], but they do not necessarily need to be. A model must simply account for the means by which a process takes place. This is sometimes done in reference to changes in the [[brain]] that may correspond to changes in behavior over the course of the development. Computational accounts of development often use either [[symbolic]], [[connectionism|connectionist]] ([[neural net|neural network]]), or [[dynamical system]]s models to explain the mechanisms of development.

== History of developmental psychology ==
The modern form of developmental psychology has its roots in the rich psychological tradition represented by [[Heraclitus]], [[Aristotle]] and [[Descartes]]. In the late [[nineteenth century]], psychologists familiar with the [[evolutionary theory]] of [[Darwin]] began seeking an evolutionary description of psychological development; prominent here was [[G. Stanley Hall]], who attempted to correlate ages of childhood with previous ages of mankind. A more scientific approach was initiated by [[James Mark Baldwin]], who wrote essays on topics that included ''Imitation: A Chapter in the Natural History of Consciousness'' and ''Mental Development in the Child and the Race: Methods and Processes''. By the early to mid-[[twentieth century]], the work of [[Vygotsky]] and [[Piaget]], mentioned above, had established a strong [[empirical]] tradition in the field.

Developmental psychology made an early appearance in a more literary form, however. [[William Shakespeare]] had his melancholy character ''Jacques'' (in [[As You Like It]]) articulate the [http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~stephan/webstuff/poetry/Shakespeare-TheSeven.html ''seven ages of man'']: these included three stages of childhood and four of adulthood. In the mid-[[eighteenth century]] [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] described three stages of childhood: infans (infancy), puer (childhood) and adolescence in ''[[Emile: Or, On Education]]''. Rousseau's ideas were taken up strongly by educators at the time. 

In the [[twentieth century]], [[Rudolf Steiner]] articulated stages of psychological development throughout human life. The first three of these stages, which correspond closely with [[Piaget]]'s later-described stages of childhood, were first presented in Steiner's [[1911]] essay ''The Education of the Child''; his descriptions have been taken up by educators (in the [[Waldorf Schools]]) and by psychologists (in [[biographical therapy]]; see the works of [[Bernard Lievegoed]]).

== Aspects of development ==
Developmental psychology is concerned with many different components of human psychology and how they change over time. These different aspects of development complement many other areas of psychology, including cognitive psychology and [[social psychology]].

=== Cognitive development ===
{{main|Cognitive psychology}}

Cognitive development is primarily concerned with the ways in which infants and children acquire cognitive abilities. Major topics in cognitive development are the study of language acquisiton and the development of perceptual and motor skills. [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] was one of the influential early psychologists to study the development of cognitive abilities. His [[theory of cognitive development|theory]] suggest that development proceeds through a set of stages from infancy to [[adulthood]]. Other accounts, however, have suggested that development does not progress through stages that are as clearly defined as those of Piaget's. Rather, from this viewpoint, developmental processes proceed more continuously, but often give rise to ''apparent'' stages of change in mental structures as Piaget described.

=== Social development === 
{{main|Social psychology}}

Social psychology is the study of the nature and causes of human [[social behavior]], with an emphasis on how people think towards each other and how they relate to each other. As the mind is the axis around which social behavior pivots, social psychologists tend to study the relationship between mind(s) and social behaviors. In early-modern social science theory, [[John Stuart Mill]], Comte, and others, laid the foundation for social psychology by asserting that human [[social cognition]] and behavior could and should be studied scientifically like any other [[natural science]].

== Research methods ==
Developmental psychology employs many of the [[psychological research methods|research methods]] used in other areas of psychology. However, infants and children cannot always be tested in the same ways as adults, so different methods are often used to study development.

[[Image:Baby.jpg|thumb|200px|Special methods are required to study infant behavior.]]
===Infant research methods=== 
When studying infants, the habituation methodology is an example of a method often used to assess their performance. This method allows researchers to obtain information about what types of [[stimuli]] an infant is able to discriminate. In this [[paradigm]], infants are habituated to a particular stimulus and are then tested using different stimuli to evaluate discrimination. The critical measure in habituation is the infants' level of interest. Typically, infants prefer stimuli that are novel relative to those they have encountered previously. Several methods are used to measure infants' preference. These include the high-amplitude sucking procedure, in which infants suck on a pacifier more or less depending on their level of interest, the conditioned foot-kick procedure, in which infants move their legs to indicate preference, and the head-turn preference procedure, in which infants level of interest is measured by the amount of time spent looking in a particular direction. A key feature of all these methods is that, in each situation, the infant controls the stimuli being presented. This gives researchers a means of measuring discrimination. If an infant is able to discriminate between the habituated stimulus and a novel stimulus, they will show a preference for the novel stimulus. If, however, the infant cannot discriminate between the two stimuli, they will not show a preference for one over the other.

===Child research methods===
When studying older children, especially adolescents, adult measurements of behavior can often be used, but they may need to be simplified to allow children to perform certain tasks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Dnareplication.png|frame|DNA replication.  In the first step, a portion of the double helix shown above in blue is unwound by a [[helicase]]. Next, a molecule of [[DNA polymerase]] shown in green binds to one strand of the DNA. It moves along the strand, using it as a template for assembling a [[leading strand]] shown above in red of [[nucleotide]]s and reforming a double helix. A second DNA polymerase molecule (also green) is used to bind to the other template strand as the double helix opens. This molecule must synthesize discontinuous segments of polynucleotides (called [[Okazaki fragment]]s). Another enzyme, [[DNA ligase]] shown in violet, then stitches these together into the lagging strand.]]

'''DNA replication''' or '''DNA synthesis''' is the process of copying a double-stranded [[DNA]] strand in a [[cell (biology)|cell]], prior to [[cell division]]. In [[eukaryote]]s, this is during the [[S phase]] of the [[cell cycle]], preceding [[mitosis]] and [[meiosis]]. The two resulting double strands are identical (if the replication went well), and each of them consists of one original and one newly synthesized strand. This is called ''[[semiconservative replication]]''. The process of replication consists of three steps, ''initiation'', ''replication'' and ''termination''. ''Artificial'' DNA replication is carried out through [[polymerase chain reaction]].

==Steps==
=== Initiation ===
In the initiation step, several key factors are recruited to an [[origin of replication]]. This origin of replication is unwound, and the partially unwound strands form a &quot;replication bubble&quot;, with one [[replication fork]] on either end. Each group of enzymes at the replication fork moves away from the origin, unwinding and replicating the original DNA strands as they proceed. [[Primer (molecular biology)|Primers]] mark the individual sequences and their start and end points, to be replicated.

The factors involved are collectively called the [[pre-replication complex]]. It consists of the following:
* A [[topoisomerase]], which introduces negative supercoils into the DNA in order to minimize tortional strain induced by the unwinding of the DNA by helicase. This prevents the DNA from knotting up.
* A [[helicase]], which unwinds and splits the DNA ahead of the fork. Thereafter, [[single-strand binding protein]]s (SSB) swiftly bind to the separated DNA, thus preventing the strands from reuniting.
* A [[primase]], which generates an [[RNA]] primer to be used in DNA replication.
* A [[DNA holoenzyme]], which in reality is a complex of enzymes that together perform the actual replication.

=== Elongation===
After the helicase unwinds the DNA, RNA primase is bound to the starting DNA site. 

At the beginning of replication, an enzyme called [[DNA polymerase]] binds to the RNA primase, which indicates the starting point for the replication. DNA polymerase can only synthesize new DNA from the [[Nucleic acid nomenclature|5&amp;rsquo;]] to [[Nucleic acid nomenclature|3&amp;rsquo;]] (of the new DNA). Because of this, the DNA polymerase can only travel on one side of the original strand without any interruption. This original strand, which goes from 3&amp;rsquo; to 5&amp;rsquo;, is called the [[leading strand]]. The complement of the leading strand, from 5&amp;rsquo; to 3&amp;rsquo;, is the [[lagging strand]]. 

Each time the helicase unwinds additional DNA, new DNA polymerase needs to be added to ensure there remains enough. As a result, the DNA of the lagging strand is replicated in a piecemeal fashion. Another enzyme, [[DNA ligase]], is used to connect the so-called [[Okazaki fragment]]s.

In prokaryotes, coupled leading strand and lagging strand synthesis is achieved by the action of the [[DNA polymerase III holoenzyme]].

In eukaryotes, there are a number of DNA polymerases with exonuclease and proof-reading abilities to carry out replication.

=== Termination ===

Termination occurs when DNA replication forks meet one another or run to the end of a linear DNA molecule. Also, termination may occur when a replication fork is deliberately stopped by a special protein, called a replication terminator protein, that binds to specific sites on a DNA molecule.

When the polymerase reaches the end of a length of DNA, there is a potential problem due to the antiparallel structure of DNA. Because an RNA primer must be regularly laid down on the lagging strand, the last section of the lagging-strand DNA cannot be replicated because there is no DNA template for the primer to be synthesized on. To solve this problem, the ends of most chromosomes consist of [[noncoding DNA]] that contains repeat sequences. The end of a linear chromosome is called the [[telomere]]. 

The repeat DNA in the telomere is not essential for survival, because it does not contain genes, so cells can endure the shortening of the chromosome at the telomere. Many cells use an enzyme called [[telomerase]] that adds the repeat units to the end of the chromosome so the ends to not become too short after multiple rounds of DNA replication. Many simple, single-celled organisms overcome the whole problem by having circular chromosomes.

Before the DNA replication is finally complete, enzymes are used to proofread the sequences to make sure the nucleotides are paired up correctly in a process called [[DNA repair]]. If mistake or damage occurs, enzymes such as a [[nuclease]] will remove the incorrect DNA. DNA polymerase will then fill in the gap.

===Equation===
A [[chemical equation]] can be written that represents the process:

&lt;blockquote&gt; (DNA)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + dNTP &amp;harr; (DNA)&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt; + PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Organization of multiple replication sites==
The human genome contains 6 billion nucleotide pairs (arrayed in 46 linear chromosomes) that are copied at about 50 [[base pair]]s per second by each replication fork.  Yet, in a typical cell the entire replication process takes only about 8 hours. This is because there are many [[replication origin site]]s on a eukaryotic chromosome. Therefore, replication can begin at some origins earlier than at others. As replication nears completion, &quot;bubbles&quot; of newly replicated DNA meet and fuse, forming two new molecules.

There must be some form of regulation and organisation of these multiple replication sites to prevent conflict. To date, two replication control mechanisms have been identified: one positive and one negative. For DNA to be replicated, each replication origin site must be bound by a set of proteins called the ''origin recognition complex''. These remain attached to the DNA throughout the replication process. Specific accessory proteins, called [[licensing factor]]s, must also be present for initiation of replication. Destruction of these proteins after initiation of replication prevents further replication cycles from occurring. This is because licensing factors are only produced when the [[nuclear membrane]] of a cell breaks down the during [[mitosis]].

==Measurement==

===Conditional mutants===
Measurement of DNA replication can be done using [[conditional mutant]]s.
Mutants that grow at 30°C but not at 42°C are collected. At this temperature these mutants should incorporate [[nucleotide]]s into DNA. Protein synthesis should not be affected. 

There are two outcomes for a graph of incorporation of labelled nucleotides into DNA vs time:
#Quick stop indicates the mutation is in a DNA synthesis factor.
#Slow stop indicates the mutation is possibly in an initiation factor such as dnaA. 

The assay can measure the incorporation of [[deoxyribonucleotide]]s into [[acid]] or [[ethanol]] insoluble forms. [[Gel filtration chromatography]] or [[ion exchange chromatography]] is used to get all protein fractions and is followed by assay for [[DNA polymerase]].

'''Education''' is a [[social science]] that [[List of education topics|encompasses]] [[teaching]] and [[learning]] specific [[knowledge]], [[belief]]s, and [[skill]]s. Licensed and practicing teachers in the field use a variety of methods and materials in order to impart a [[curriculum]]. There has been a plethora of journals, magazines, books, and digests in the field of education that addresses these areas. Such literature addresses the teaching practices, with subjects that include lectures, game playing, testing, scheduling, record keeping, bullying, seating arrangements, interests, motivation, and computer access. However, the  most important factors in any teacher's effectiveness is the interaction with students and personality of the teacher. The quality of their relationships provides the impetus for inspiration. The best teachers are able to translate good [[judgment]], experience, and [[wisdom]] into the art of communication that students find compelling. It is their ability to understand and overcome prejudices, generate passion, and recognize potential that enable teachers to invigorate students with higher expectations of themselves and society at large. The goal is aiding the growth of students so that they become productive members of a migratory society. An imparting of [[culture]] from generation to generation (see [[socialisation]]) promotes a greater awareness and responsiveness through social maturity to the needs of an increasingly diversified global society.

== Overview ==
It is widely accepted that the process of education begins at birth and continues throughout life. Some believe that education begins even earlier than this, as evidenced by some parents' playing music or reading to the baby in the womb in the hope it will influence the child's development.

''Education'' is often used to refer solely to formal education (see below). However, it covers a range of experiences, from formal learning to the building of understanding through day to day experiences. Ultimately, all that we experience serves as a form of education.

Individuals receive informal education from a variety of sources.  [[Family]] members and mass media have a strong influence on the informal education of the individual.

== Terminology ==
The word ''education'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''educare'' meaning &quot;to raise&quot;, &quot;to bring up&quot;, &quot;to train&quot;, &quot;to rear&quot;, via &quot;educatio/nis&quot;, bringing up, raising. In recent times the myth has arisen of its derivation from a different verb: ''educere'', meaning &quot;to lead out&quot; or &quot;to lead forth&quot;; however the English word from this verb is &quot;eduction&quot;: drawing out. This false etymology is used to bolster one of the theories behind the function of education—to develop innate abilities and expand horizons.

== The psychology of education ==
{{main|Educational psychology}}

[[Educational psychology]] is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the [[social psychology]] of  [[school]]s as [[organization]]s.  Although the terms &quot;educational psychology&quot; and &quot;school psychology&quot; are often used interchangeably, researchers and theorists are likely to be identified as [[:Category:Educational psychologists|educational psychologists]], whereas practitioners in schools or school-related settings are identified as [[School psychologist|school psychologists]].  Educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment among the general population and sub-populations such as [[gifted]] children and those subject to specific [[disabilities]].

Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by [[psychology]], bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between [[medicine]] and [[biology]]. Educational psychology in turn informs a wide range of specialities within educational studies, including [[instructional design]], [[educational technology]], curriculum development, [[organizational learning]], [[special education]] and [[classroom management]]. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to [[cognitive science]] and the [[learning sciences]]. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks (Lucas, Blazek, &amp; Raley, 2005).

== Formal education ==
Formal education occurs when society or a group or an individual sets up a [[curriculum]] to educate people, usually the young. Formal education can become systematic and thorough. Formal education systems can be used to promote doctrines or ideals as well as knowledge and this can sometimes lead to abuse of the system.

Life-long or [[adult education]] has become widespread in many countries. However, education is still seen by many as something aimed at children, and adult education is often branded as ''adult learning'' or ''lifelong learning''.

Adult education takes on many forms from formal class-based learning to self-directed learning.  Lending [[Library|libraries]] provide inexpensive informal access to books and other self-instructional materials. Many adults have also taken advantage of the rise in computer ownership and internet access to further their informal education.

== Technology ==
{{main|Educational technology}}

Inexpensive [[technology]] is an increasingly influential factor in education. [[Computers]] and mobile phones are being widely used in developed countries to both complement established education practices and develop new ways of learning such as [[online education]] (a type of distance education). This gives students discretion in what they are interested in learning. The proliferation of computers also means the increase of programming and blogging. Technology clearly offers powerful learning tools that can engage students.

== History ==
In 1994, [[Dieter Lenzen]], president of the [[Freie Universität Berlin]], said &quot;education began either millions of years ago or at the end of [[1770]]&quot;. This quote by Lenzen includes the idea that education as a science cannot be separated from the educational traditions that existed before. The first chair of [[pedagogy]] was founded at the end of the [[1770s]] at the [[University of Halle]], [[Germany]].

Education was the natural response of early civilizations to the struggle of surviving and thriving as a culture. Adults trained the young of their society in the knowledge and skills they would need to master and eventually pass on. The evolution of culture, and human beings as a species depended on this practice of transmitting knowledge. In pre-literate societies this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling continued from one generation to the next. Oral language developed into written symbols and letters. The depth and breadth of knowledge that could be preserved and passed soon increased exponentially.

When cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond the basic skills of communicating, trading, gathering food, religious practices, etc, formal education, and schooling, eventually followed. Schooling in this sense was already in place in Egypt between 3000 and 500BC.

[[Basic education]] today is considered those skills that are necessary to function in society.

=== Europe ===
In the West, the origins of education were heavily influenced by the specific organized religion: [[priest]]s and [[monk]]s realised the importance of promoting positive virtues in the young and founded, maintained, and staffed [[school]] systems. In [[Europe]], many of the first [[universities]] have [[Catholic]] roots. Following the [[Reformation]] in [[Scotland]] the newly established national [[Church of Scotland]] set out a programme for spiritual reform in January [[1561]] setting the principle of a schoolteacher for every parish church and free education for the poor. In 1633 an Act of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] introduced a tax to pay for this programme, and by the end of the [[17th century]] [[education in Scotland]] brought [[literacy]] to much of the population, with the system being used by all except the nobility. In the german language area there are two words for education: Bildung (which means cultivation, formation and creation) and Erziehung (which means breeding and instructing).

During and following the [[Age of Enlightenment]] people largely forgot the relationship between religion and education. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] fuelled an influential early-[[Romanticism]] reaction to formalised religion-based education at a time when the concept of [[childhood]] had started to become popular as a distinct aspect of [[child development|human development]].

The [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]'s [[Commission of National Education]] (Polish: ''Komisja Edukacji Narodowej'', Lithuanian: ''Nacionaline Edukacine Komisija'') formed in [[1773]] counts as the first [[Ministry of Education]] in the history of mankind.

Conventional social history narrates how by about the beginning of the [[19th century]] the [[industrial revolution]] a demand for masses of disciplined, inter-changeable [[worker]]s  possessing  minimal literacy became commonplace. In these circumstances, the [[state]] began to mandate and dictate attendance at standardised schools with a state-ordained curriculum. The general and [[vocational education]] paths of the [[20th century]] soon emerged. With increasing economic specialisation demanding increasingly specialised [[skill]]s from a population, children spent longer periods in formal education before entering or while engaged in the [[workforce]].

=== China ===
Education in China began with the Chinese classic texts, rather than organized religion. The early Chinese state depended upon literate, educated officials for operation of the empire, and an [[imperial examination|imperial examination system]] was established in the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC-220) for evaluating and selecting officials. This merit-based system gave rise to schools that taught the classics and continued in use for 2,000 years, until the end the [[Qing Dynasty]], and was abolished in [[1911]] in favour of Western education methods.

=== Japan ===
{{main|History of education in Japan}}
The origins of education in [[Japan]] are closely related to [[religion]]. Schooling was conducted at  [[Shaolin|temples]] for youngsters who wanted to study [[Buddhism]] to become [[priest]]s.  Later, children who were willing to study started to meet at places called, &quot;Tera-koya&quot; (literally meaning temple huts) and learned how to read and write [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

=== India ===
{{main|Education in India}}
India has a long history of organized education. The [[Gurukul]] system of education is one of the oldest on earth, and was dedicated to the highest ideals of all-round human development: physical, mental and spiritual. Gurukuls were traditional Hindu residential schools of learning; typically the teacher's house or a monastery. Education was free, but students from well-to-do families payed Gurudakshina, a voluntary contribution after the completion of their studies. At the Gurukuls, the teacher imparted knowledge of Religion, Scriptures, [[Hindu Philosophy|Philosophy]], [[Sanskrit Literature|Literature]], Warfare, Statecraft, [[Ayurveda|Medicine]] Astrology and History (the Sanskrit word &quot;[[Itihaas]]&quot; means History). The first millennium and the few centuries preceding it saw the flourishing of higher education at [[Nalanda]], [[Takshashila University]], [[Ujjain]], &amp; [[Vikramshila]] Universities. Art, Architecture, Painting, Logic, Grammar, Philosophy, Astronomy, Literature, [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Arthashastra]] (Economics &amp; Politics), Law, and Medicine were among the subjects taught and each university specialized in a particular field of study. Takshila specialized in the study of medicine, while Ujjain laid emphasis on astronomy. Nalanda, being the biggest centre, handled all branches of knowledge, and housed up to 10,000 students at its peak. [http://www.infinityfoundation.com/mandala/t_es/t_es_goyal_education.htm British records] show that education was widespread in the 18th century, with a school for every temple, mosque or village in most regions of the country. The subjects taught included Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Theology, Law, Astronomy, Metaphysics, Ethics, Medical Science and Religion. The schools were attended by students representative of all classes of society. The current system of education, with its western style and content, was introduced &amp; funded by the British in the 20th century, following recommendations by Macaulay. Traditional structures were not recognized by the British govt and have been on the decline since. [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] is said to have described the traditional educational system as a beautiful tree that was destroyed during the British rule.

=== Recent world-wide trends ===
Overall, [[illiteracy]] has greatly decreased in recent years.

Illiteracy and the percentage of populations without any schooling have decreased in the past several decades. For example, the percentage of population without any schooling decreased from 36% in 1960 to 25% in 2000.

Among developing countries, illiteracy and percentages without schooling in [[2000]] stood at about half the 1970 figures.  Among developed countries, illiteracy rates decreased from 6 % to 1 %, and percentages without schooling decreased from 5 to 2.

Illiteracy rates in less economically developed countries ([[LEDC]]s) surpassed those of more economically developed countries ([[MEDC]]s) by a factor of 10 in 1970, and by a factor of about 20 in 2000.  Illiteracy decreased greatly in LDCs, and virtually disappeared in MDCs.  Percentages without any schooling showed similar patterns.

Percentages of the population with no schooling varied greatly among LDCs in 2000, from less than 10 % to over 65 %.  MDCs had much less variation, ranging from less than 2 % to 17 %.

{{Education by country}}

== Challenges ==
:''&quot;I think the big mistake in schools is trying to teach children anything, and by using fear as the basic motivation. Fear of getting failing grades, fear of not staying with your class, etc. Interest can produce learning on a scale compared to fear as a nuclear explosion to a firecracker.&quot;'' &lt;br&gt;- [[Stanley Kubrick]]

The goal of education is the transference of [[ideas]] and skills from one to one, one to many, many to many and many to one with the possible high transfer rate and volume of knowledge under the possible shortest time duration at any place and circumstance.
Current education issues include which teaching method(s) are most effective, how to determine what knowledge should be taught, which knowledge is most relevant, and how well the pupil will retain incoming knowledge. Educators such as [[George Counts]] and [[Paulo Freire]] identified education as an inherently political process with inherently political outcomes. The challenge of identifying ''whose'' ideas are transferred and what goals they serve has always stood in the face of formal and informal education.

In addition to the &quot;Three R's&quot;, [[reading (activity)|reading]], [[writing]], and [[arithmetic]], Western primary and secondary schools attempt to teach the basic knowledge of [[history]], [[geography]], [[mathematics]] (usually including [[calculus]] and [[algebra]]), [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and sometimes [[politics]], in the hope that students will retain and use this knowledge as they age or that the skills acquired will be transferrable. The current education system measures competency with tests and assignments and then assigns each student a corresponding grade. The grades usually come in the form of either a letter grade or a percentage, which are intended to represent the amount of all material presented in class that the student understood. 

Educational progressives or advocates of [[unschooling]] often believe that grades do not necessarily reveal the strengths and weaknesses of a student, and that there is an unfortunate lack of [[youth voice]] in the educative process. Some feel the current grading system lowers students' [[self-confidence]], as students may receive poor marks due to factors outside their control. Such factors include poverty, [[child abuse]], and [[prejudice]]d or incompetent teachers.

By contrast, many advocates of a more traditional or &quot;back to basics&quot; approach believe that the direction of reform needs to be the opposite.  Students are not inspired or challenged to achieve success  because of the dumbing down of the curriculum and the replacement of the &quot;canon&quot; with inferior material.  Their view of self-confidence is that it arises not from removing hurdles such as grading, but by making them fair and encouraging students to gain pride from knowing they can jump over these hurdles.

On the one hand, [[Albert Einstein]], the most famous [[physicist]] of the twentieth century, credited with helping us understand the universe better, was not a model school student. He was uninterested in what was being taught, and he did not attend classes all the time. However, his gifts eventually shone through and added to the sum of human knowledge. On the other hand, for millennia those who have been challenged and well-educated in traditional schools have risen to great success and to a lifelong love of learning because their minds were made better and more powerful, as well as because of their mastery of a wide range of skills.

There are a number of highly controversial issues in education. Should some knowledge be forgotten? What should be taught, are we better off knowing how to build nuclear bombs, or is it best to let such knowledge be forgotten? There are also some philosphies, for example [[Transcendentalism]], that would probably reject conventional education in the belief that knowlegde should be gained through purely personal experience.

The cost of higher education in developed countries is increasingly becoming an issue.

=== Developing countries ===
In developing countries, the number and seriousness of the problems faced is naturally greater. People are sometimes unaware of the importance of education, and there is economic pressure from those parents who prioritize their children's making money in the short term over any long-term benefits of education. Recent studies on child labor and poverty have suggested, however, that when poor families reach a certain economic threshold where families are able to provide for their basic needs, parents return their children to school. This has been found to be true, once the threshold has been breached, even if the potential economic value of the children's work has increased since their return to school. Teachers are often paid less than other similar [[profession]]s.

A lack of good universities, and a low acceptance rate for good universities is evident in countries with a relatively high population density. In some countries there are uniform, overstructured, inflexible centralized programs from a central agency that regulates all aspects of education.

*Due to [[globalization]], increased pressure on students in curricular activities
*Removal of a certain percentage of students for improvisation of academics (usually practised in schools, after 10th grade)

India however is starting to develop technologies that will skip land based phone and internet lines. Instead, they have launched a special education satellite that can reach more of the country at a greatly reduced cost. There is also an initiative started by a group out of MIT and supported by several major corporations to develop a [[$100 laptop]].  The laptops should be available by late 2006 or 2007.  The laptops, sold at cost, will enable developing countries to give their children a digital education, and to close the digital divide across the world.

In Africa, [[NEPAD]] has launched an &quot;[[NEPAD e-school programme|e-school programme]]&quot; to provide all 600,000 primary and high schools with computer equipment, learning materials and internet access within 10 years.

Private groups, like [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], are working to give more individuals opportunities to receive education in developing countries through such programs as the [[Perpetual Education Fund]].

== Parental involvement ==
[[Parent|Parental]] involvement is a necessary thing when it comes to a child's educational [[development]]. Early and consistent parental involvement in the child's life is [[critical]] such as reading to children at an early age, teaching patterns, [[interpersonal communication]] skills, exposing them to diverse cultures and the [[community]] around them, educating them on a healthy [[lifestyle]], etc. The socialization and academic education of a child are aided by the involvement of the [[student]], [[parent|parent(s)]], [[teacher|teachers]], and others in the community and extended family.

Academic achievement and parental involvement are strongly linked in the research. Many schools are now beginning program of parental involvement in a more organized fashion, in part due to the [[No Child Left Behind]] legislation from the [[US Department of Education]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Brockhaus Lexikon.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Brockhaus Konversations-Lexikon, 1902]]
An '''encyclopedia''' (alternatively '''encyclopaedia''') is a written [[compendium]] of [[knowledge]]. The term comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Classical Greek]] {{polytonic|ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία}} (''enkuklios paideia''), literally &quot;a rounded education.&quot; Some encyclopedias are titled '''cyclopaedia''', a now somewhat archaic form of the word. For a list of notable encyclopedias in history, see ''[[list of encyclopedias]]''.
==General definition==
[[Image:Ad Encyclopaedia-Britannica 05-1913.jpg|thumb|300px|right|1913 advertisement for [[Encyclopædia Britannica]].]]
Four major elements define an encyclopedia: its subject matter, its scope, its method of organization, and its method of production.

*Encyclopedias can be general, containing articles on topics in many different fields (the [[English language|English-language]] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' and [[German language|German]] ''[[Brockhaus encyclopedia|Brockhaus]]'' are well-known examples), or they can specialize in a particular field (such as an encyclopedia of [[medicine]], [[philosophy]], or [[law]]). There are also encyclopedias that cover a wide variety of topics from a particular cultural, ethnic, or national perspective, such as the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' or ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]''.
*Works of encyclopedic scope aim to convey the important accumulated knowledge for their subject domain.  Such works have been envisioned and attempted throughout much of human history,  but the term ''encyclopedia'' was first used to refer to such works in the [[16th century]].  The first general encyclopedias that succeeded in being both authoritative as well as encyclopedic in scope appeared in the [[18th century]]. Every encyclopedic work is, of course, an abridged version of all knowledge, and works vary in the breadth of material and the depth of discussion.  The target audience may influence the scope; a children's encyclopedia will be narrower than one for adults.
*Some systematic method of organization is essential to making an encyclopedia usable as a work of reference. There have historically been two main methods of organizing printed encyclopedias: the [[alphabetical order|alphabetical]] method (consisting of a number of separate articles, organised in alphabetical order), or organization by [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] categories. The former method is today the most common by far, especially for general works. The fluidity of electronic media, however, allows new possibilities for multiple methods of organization of the same content. Further, electronic media offer previously unimaginable capabilities for search, indexing and cross reference. The epigraph from [[Horace]] on the title page of the 18th-century ''Encyclopédie'' suggests the importance of the structure of an encyclopedia: &quot;What grace may be added to commonplace matters by the power of order and connection.&quot;
*As modern multimedia and the information age has evolved, they have had an ever-increasing effect on the collection, verification, summation, and presention of information of all kinds. Projects such as [[h2g2]] and [[Wikipedia]] are examples of new forms of the encyclopedia as information retrieval becomes more simple.

The encyclopedia as we recognize it today developed from the [[dictionary]] in the 18th century. A dictionary is primarily focused on words and their definition, and typically provides limited information, analysis or background for the word defined. While it may offer a definition, it may leave the reader still lacking in understanding the meaning or import of a term, and how the term relates to a broader field of knowledge.

To address those needs, an encyclopedia seeks to discuss each subject in more depth and convey the most relevant accumulated knowledge on that subject, given the overall length of the particular work. An encyclopedia also often includes many maps and illustrations, as well as bibliography and statistics.

Some works titled &quot;dictionaries&quot; are actually more similar to encyclopedias, especially those concerned with a particular field (such as the ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', the ''[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]'', and ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]''). The ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]]'', [[Australia]]'s national dictionary, became an [[encyclopedic dictionary]] after its first edition in recognition of the use of proper nouns in common communication, and the words derived from such proper nouns.

==Early encyclopedic works==
The idea of collecting all of the world's knowledge into a single work was an elusive vision for centuries. Many writers of antiquity (such as [[Aristotle]]) attempted to write comprehensively about all human knowledge. One of the most significant of these early encyclopedists was [[Pliny the Elder]] (first century CE), who wrote the [[Naturalis Historia]] (Natural History), a 37-volume account of the natural world that was extremely popular in western Europe for much of the Middle Ages.

The first Christian encyclopedia was [[Cassiodorus]]' ''Institutiones'' (560 CE) which inspired St. [[Isidore of Seville]]'s ''[[Etymologiae]]'' (636) which became the most influential encyclopedia of the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The ''[[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Bibliotheca]]'' by the [[Patriarch]] [[Photius]] (9th century) was the earliest [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] work that could be called an encyclopedia. [[Bartholomeus de Glanvilla]]'s ''De proprietatibus rerum'' (1240) was the most widely read and quoted encyclopedia in the [[High Middle Ages]] while [[Vincent of Beauvais]]'s ''Speculum Majus'' (1260) was the most ambitious encyclopedia in the late-medieval period at over 3 million words.

The [[Early Muslim philosophy|early Muslim compilations of knowledge]] in the middle ages included many comprehensive works, and much development of what we now call [[scientific method]], [[historical method]], and [[citation]]. Notable works include [[Razi|Abu Bakr al-Razi]]'s encyclopedia of science, the [[Mutazilite]] [[Al-Kindi]]'s prolific output of 270 books, and [[Ibn Sina]]'s medical encyclopedia, which was a standard reference work for centuries. Also notable are works of universal history (or sociology) from [[Asharite]]s, [[al-Tabri]], [[Masudi|al-Masudi]], [[Ibn Rustah]], [[al-Athir]], and [[Ibn Khaldun]], whose [[The Muqadimmah|Muqadimmah]] contains cautions regarding trust in written records that remain wholly applicable today. These scholars had an incalculable influence on methods of research and editing, due in part to the Islamic practice of [[isnad]] which emphasized fidelity to written record, checking sources, and skeptical inquiry.

The [[Chinese emperor]] [[Cheng-Zu]] of the [[Ming Dynasty]] oversaw the compilation of the [[Yongle Encyclopedia]], one of the largest encyclopedias in history, which was completed in 1408 and comprised over 11,000 handwritten volumes, of which only about 400 now survive. In the succeeding dynasty, emperor [[Qianlong]] of the [[Qing Dynasty]] personally composed 40,000 poems as part of a 4.7 million page library in 4 divisions, including thousands of essays. It is instructive to compare his title for this knowledge, ''Watching the waves in a Sacred Sea'' to a Western-style title for all knowledge.  Encyclopedic works, both in imitation of Chinese encyclopedias and as independent works of their own origin, have been known to exist in Japan since the ninth century C.E.

These works were all hand copied and thus rarely available, beyond wealthy patrons or monastic men of learning: they were expensive, and usually written for those extending knowledge rather than those using it (with some exceptions in medicine).

==Encyclopedias from the 18th to early 20th century ==
The beginnings of the modern idea of the general-purpose, widely distributed printed encyclopedia precede the 18th-century [[encyclopedist]]s. However, Chambers' ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]],'' and the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' and the ''[[Brockhaus encyclopedia|Conversations-Lexikon]]'' were the first to realize the form we would recognize today, with a comprehensive scope of topics, discussed in depth and organized in an accessible, systematic method. 

The term encyclopaedia was coined by fifteenth century humanists who misread copies of their texts of Pliny and Quintilian, and combined the two Greek words ''enkuklios paideia'' into one word. 

The English physician and philosopher Sir [[Thomas Browne]] specifically employed the word ''encyclopaedia'' as early as 1646 in the preface to the reader to describe his  ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'' or ''Vulgar Errors'', a series of refutations of common errors of his age. Browne structured his encyclopaedia upon the time-honoured schemata of the Renaissance, the so-called 'scale of creation' which ascends a hierarchical ladder via the mineral, vegetable, animal, human, planetary and cosmological worlds. Browne's compendium went through no less than five editions, each revised and augmented, the last edition appearing in 1672. ''Pseudodoxia Epidemica''  found itself upon the bookshelves of many educated European readers for throughout the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries it was translated into the [[France|French]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[Germany|German]] languages as well as [[Latin]]. 

[[John Harris]] is often credited with introducing the now-familiar alphabetic format in 1704 with his English ''[[Lexicon technicum]].'' Organized alphabetically, it sought to not merely to explain the terms used in the arts and sciences, but the arts and sciences themselves. [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] contributed his only published work on chemistry to the second volume of 1710. Its emphasis was on science and, at about 1200 pages, its scope was more that of an encyclopedic dictionary than a true encyclopedia. Harris himself considered it a dictionary; the work is one of the first technical dictionaries in any language. 

[[Ephraim Chambers]] published his ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'' in 1728. In included a broad scope of subjects, used an alphabetic arrangement, relied on many different contributors and included the innovation of cross-referencing other sections within articles.  Chambers has been referred to as the father of the modern encyclopedia for this two-volume work.

A French translation of Chambers' work inspired the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', perhaps the most famous early encyclopedia, notable for its scope, the quality of some contributions, and its political and cultural impact in the years leading up to the [[French revolution]].  The ''Encyclopédie'' was edited by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] and [[Denis Diderot]] and published in 17 volumes of articles, issued from 1751 to 1765, and 11 volumes of illustrations, issued from 1762 to 1772.  Five volumes of supplementary material and a two volume index, supervised by other editors, were issued from 1776 to 1780 by [[Charles Joseph Panckoucke]].

The ''Encyclopédie'' in turn inspired the venerable ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]],'' which had a modest beginning in Scotland: the first edition, issued between 1768 and 1771, had just three hastily completed volumes - A-B, C-L, and M-Z - with a total of 2,391 pages. By 1797, when the third edition was completed, it had been expanded to 18 volumes addressing a full range of topics, with articles contributed by a range of authorities on their subjects.

The ''[[Brockhaus encyclopedia|Conversations-Lexikon]]'' was published in [[Leipzig]] from 1796 to 1808, in 6 volumes. Paralleling other 18th century encyclopedias, the scope was expanded beyond that of earlier publications, in an effort to become comprehensive. But the work was intended not for scientific use, but to give the results of research and discovery in a simple and popular form without extended details. This format, a contrast to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', was widely imitated by later 19th century encyclopedias in Britain, the United States, France, Spain, Italy and other countries. Of the influential late 18th century and early 19th century encyclopedias, the ''Conversations-Lexikon'' is perhaps most similar in form to today's encyclopedias.

The early years of the [[19th century]] saw a flowering of encyclopedia publishing in the United Kingdom, Europe and America. In England ''[[Rees's Cyclopaedia]]'' (1802–1819) contains an enormous amount in information about the industrial and scientific revolutions of the time. A feature of these publications is the high-quality illustrations made by engravers like [[Wilson Lowry]] of art work supplied by specialist draftsmen like [[John Farey, Jr.]] Encyclopaedias were published in [[Scotland]], as a result of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], for education there was of a higher standard than in the rest of the [[United Kingdom]].

The 17-volume ''[[Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle]]'' and its supplements were published in [[France]] from 1866 to 1890.

''Encyclopædia Britannica'' appeared in various editions throughout the century, and the growth of [[popular education]] and the [[Mechanics Institutes]], spearheaded by the [[Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge]] led to the production of the ''[[Penny Cyclopaedia]]'', as its title suggests issued in weekly numbers at a penny each like a [[newspaper]]. 

In the early 20th century, the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' reached its eleventh edition, and inexpensive encyclopedias such as ''[[Harmsworth's Encyclopaedia]]'' and ''[[Everyman's Encyclopaedia]]'' were common.

==Modern encyclopedias==
In the United States, the 1950s and 1960s saw the rise of several large populist encyclopedias, often sold on installment plans.  The best known of these were [[World Book]] and [[Funk and Wagnalls]].

The second half of the [[20th century]] also saw the publication of several encyclopedias that were notable for synthesizing important topics in specific fields, often though new works authored by significant researchers.  Such encyclopedias included '''''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy''''' (first published in 1967 and now in its second edition),  and '''''Elsevier's Handbooks In Economics'''''[http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/S04.cws_home/books] series.

By the late 20th century, encyclopedias were being published on [[CD-ROM|CD-ROMs]] for use with personal computers.  [[Microsoft]]'s ''[[Encarta]]'' was a landmark example, as it had no print version.  Articles were supplemented with video and audio files as well as numerous high-quality images.  Similar encyclopedias were also being published [[online]], and made available by subscription.

Traditional encyclopedias are written by a number of employed text [[writer|writers]], usually people with an [[academic degree]], but the interactive nature of the Internet allowed for the creation of projects such as [[Everything2]], [[Open Site]], and [[Wikipedia]] which allowed anyone to add, improve, or vandalize content. By late 2005, Wikipedia produced over two million articles in more than 80 languages with contents licensed under the [[copyleft]] [[GNU Free Documentation License]]. However Wikipedia's articles are not necessarily peer reviewed and many of those articles are of a trivial nature. Legitimate concerns have been raised as to the accuracy of information generated through open source projects generally.

Encyclopedias are essentially derivative from what has gone before, and particularly in the 19th century, [[copyright infringement]] was common among encyclopedia editors. However, modern encyclopedias are not merely larger compendia, including all that came before them. To make space for modern topics, valuable material of historic use regularly had to be discarded, at least before the advent of digital encyclopedias. Moreover, the opinions and worldviews of a particular generation can be observed in the encyclopedic writing of the time. For these reasons, old encyclopedias are a useful source of historical information, especially for a record of changes in science and technology.

== Encyclopedia manufacture ==

The encyclopedia's hierarchical structure and evolving nature is particularly adaptable to a [[disk storage|disk]]-based or on-line [[computer]] [[format]], and all major printed encyclopedias had moved to this method of delivery by the end of the 20th century. Disk-based (typically [[CD-ROM|CD-ROM]] format) publications have the advantage of being cheaply produced and extremely portable. Additionally, they can include [[media]] which is impossible in the printed format, such as [[animation]]s, [[sound recording|audio]], and [[video]]. [[Hyperlink]]ing between conceptually related items is also a significant benefit. On-line encyclopedias offer the additional advantage of being (potentially) dynamic: new information can be presented almost immediately, rather than waiting for the next release of a static format (as with a disk- or paper-based publication). Many printed encyclopedias traditionally published annual supplemental volumes or &quot;yearbooks&quot; to provide updates on recent events between new editions, as a partial solution to the problem of currency, but this of course requires the reader check both the main volumes and the supplemental volume or volumes. Some disk-based encyclopedias offer subscription-based access to online updates, which are then integrated with the content already on the user's hard disk in a manner not possible with a printed
encyclopedia.

Information in a printed encyclopedia necessarily needs some form of hierarchical structure. Traditionally, the method employed is to present the information ordered alphabetically by the article title. However with the advent of [[dynamic]] electronic formats the need to impose a pre-determined structure is unnecessary. Nonetheless, most electronic encyclopedias still offer a range of organisational strategies for the articles, such as by subject area or asing some societal ills, such as [[poverty]]-, [[gender]]-, or [[Social class|class]]-based inequities, or perceived ineffectiveness. Reforms are usually proposed by thinkers who aim to redress societal ills or institute societal changes, most often through a change in the education of the members of a class of people—the preparation of a ruling class to rule or a working class to work, the social hygiene of a lower or immigrant class, the preparation of citizens in a democracy or republic, etc. The idea that all children should be provided with a high level of education is a relatively recent idea, and has arisen largely in the context of Western [[democracy]] in the [[20th century]].

[[States]] have tried to use [[state school]]s to increase state power, especially to make better [[soldier]]s and workers. This strategy was first adopted to unify related linguistic groups in [[Europe]], such as [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]. Exact mechanisms are unclear, but it often fails in areas where populations are culturally segregated, as when the U.S. Indian school service failed to suppress [[Lakota]] and [[Navaho]], or when a culture has widely-respected autonomous cultural institutions, as when the [[Spanish]] failed to suppress [[Catalan]].

Many students of [[democracy]] have desired to improve education in order to improve the quality of governance in democratic societies; the necessity of good public education follows logically if one believes that:
# the quality of democratic governance depends on the ability of citizens to make informed, intelligent choices, and
# education can improve these abilities.

Politically-motivated educational reforms of the democratic type are recorded as far back as [[Plato]], whose book ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]'' was essentially a thought experiment on education reform. In the [[United States of America]], this lineage of democratic education reform was continued by [[Thomas Jefferson]], who advocated ambitious reforms partly along Platonic lines for [[public education|public schooling]] in [[Virginia]].

Another motivation for reform is the desire to address socio-economic problems, which many people see as having significant roots in lack of education. Starting in the twentieth century, people have attempted to argue that small improvements in education can have large returns in such areas as [[health]], [[wealth]] and [[well-being]]. For example, in [[Kerala]], India in the 1950s, increases in women's health were correlated with increases in female literacy rates. In [[Iran]], increased primary education was correlated with increased farming efficiencies and income. In both cases some researchers have concluded these correlations as representing an underlying causal relationship: education causes socio-economic benefits. In the case of Iran, researchers concluded that the improvements were due to farmers gaining reliable access to national crop prices and scientific farming information.

== School choice ==

[[Libertarian]] theorists such as [[Milton Friedman]] advocate [[School choice]] to eliminate any need for formal accountability. Public educational vouchers would permit guardians to select and pay any school, public or private, with public funds. The theory is that children's guardians will shop for the best schools.

=== Charter schools ===

[[Charter schools]] also attempt to free administrators from regulations and local political entanglements to improve their administration. The [http://www.edreform.com/_upload/charter_school_laws.pdf Center for Educational Reform] says that charter schools with &quot;weak laws&quot; have more problems, because more established legal requirements for public schools are applied to them.

== Alternatives to public education ==

[[Homeschooling|Home education]] is favored by some parents who directly take responsibility for their children's education, eliminating accountability by public officials. For more information, see [[Homeschooling|home education]].

[[Montessori]] Pre- and Primary school programs employ alternative methods of guided exploration, embracing children's natural curiosity rather than scolding it for falling out of rank.

== Notable reforms ==
Some of the methods and reforms have gained permanent advocates, and are widely utilized.
  
Many educators now believe that anything that more precisely meets the needs of the child will work better. This was initiated by M. Montessori and is still utilized in Montessori schools.
    
The teaching method must be teachable! This is a lesson from both Montessori and Dewey. This view now has very wide currency, and is used to select much of the curricula of teachers' colleges.
    
Conservative programs are often based on [[classical education]], which is seen by conservatives to reliably teach valuable skills in a developmentally appropriate order to the majority of [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator|Myers-Briggs]] temperaments, by teaching facts.  
    
Programs that test individual learning, and teach to mastery of a subject have been proven by the state of Kentucky to be far more effective than group instruction with compromise schedules, or even class-size reduction (see reference to KERA, below)
    
Schools with limited resources, such as most public schools and most third-world and missionary schools, use a grammar-school approach.  The evidence of Lancaster schools suggests using students as teachers. If the culture supports it, perhaps the economic discipline of the Lancaster school can reduce costs even further. However, much of the success of Lancaster's &quot;school economy&quot; was that the children were natives of an intensely mercantile culture.
    
In order to be effective, classroom instruction needs to change subjects at times near a typical student's attention span, which can be as frequently as every two minutes for young children. This is an important part of [[Marva Collins]]' method. 
    
The Myers-Briggs temperaments fall into four broad categories, each sufficiently different to justify completely different educational theories. Many developmental psychologists say that it might be socially profitable to test for and target temperaments with special curricula. 
    
Some of the Myers-Briggs temperaments are known to despise educational material that lacks theory. Therefore, effective curricula need to raise and answer &quot;which&quot; and &quot;why&quot; questions, to teach students with &quot;intuitive&quot; (Myers-Briggs) modalities.
    
Philosophers identify independent, [[logic|logical reasoning]] as a precondition to most western science, engineering, economic and political theory. Therefore, every educational program that desires to improve students' outcomes in political, health and economic behavior should include a Socratically-taught set of classes to teach logic and critical thinking. 

Substantial resources and time can be saved by permitting students to test out of classes. This also increases motivation, directs individual study, and reduces boredom and disciplinary problems.

To support inexpensive continuing adult education a community needs a free public library. It can start modestly as shelves in an attended shop or government building, with donated books. Attendants are essential to protect the books from vandalism. Adult education repays itself many times over by providing direct opportunity to adults. Free libraries are also powerful resources for schools and businesses.
    
New programs based on modern [[learning theory (education)|learning theories]] should be quantitatively investigated for effectiveness, as was done by KERA (see reference, below).

A notable reform of the education system of [http://www.libraryreference.org/edreform.html Massachusetts] occurred in 1997.  

The current '''[[student voice]]''' effort echoes past school reform initiatives focusing on [[parent involvement]], community involvement, and other forms of participation in schools. However, it is finding a significant amount of success in schools because of the inherent differences: [[student voice]] is central to the daily schooling experience because students spend all day there. Many educators today strive for meaningful student involvement in their classrooms, while school administrators, school board members, and elected officials each lurch to hear what students have to say.

== Internationally ==

=== Taiwan ===

In other parts of the world, educational reform has had a number of different meanings.  In [[Taiwan]] in the 1990s and 2000s a movement tried to prioritize reasoning over mere facts, reduce the emphasis on central control and standardized testing.  There was consensus on the problems.  Efforts were limited because there was little consensus on the goals of educational reforms, and therefore on how to fix the problems. By 2003, the push for education reform had declined.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ellensburg''' is a city located in [[Kittitas County, Washington]].  As of the [[2000]] census, the city had a total population of 15,414.  Ellensburg is located just east of the [[Cascade Range]] on [[Interstate 90|I-90]]. Ellensburg is the home of [[Central Washington University]] (CWU). The surrounding Kittitas Valley is internationally known for the [[Timothy-grass|timothy]] [[hay]] that it produces. There are several local hay brokering and processing operations that ship to Pacific Rim countries. The old part of the town is fairly historic, with old brick buildings from the late [[19th century]]. [[Eastern Washington]] has a much drier climate and some Seattle-area residents visit the area to spend a weekend without rain after the sometimes dreary winters on the rainy western side of the Cascade Range; many former Puget Sounds residents have moved to the city and commute over Snoqualmie Pass on I-90 to jobs located in the Puget Sound region.

Ellensburg is the [[county seat]] of [[Kittitas County, Washington|Kittitas County]]{{GR|6}}.

A college town, Ellensburg is home to [[Central Washington University]].  Ellensburg is also a stop on the PRCA professional [[rodeo]] circuit.

==History==
Ellensburg was officially incorporated on [[November 26]], [[1883]].

'''Eugene''' is the third  largest [[city]] [http://www.eugene-or.gov/portal/server.pt] and boasts the second largest [[metropolitan area|metropolitan population]] [http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=1119225167&amp;men=gcis&amp;lng=en&amp;gln=xx&amp;dat=32&amp;geo=-223&amp;srt=pnan&amp;col=aohdq&amp;pt=a&amp;va=x&amp;geo=-3793] in the state of [[Oregon]], and is also the [[county seat]] of [[Lane County, Oregon]], [[United States|USA]].  It is located at the south end of the [[Willamette Valley]], at the confluence of the [[McKenzie River]] and the [[Willamette River]], about 60 miles (97 km) east of the [[Oregon Coast]].

Eugene is home to the [[University of Oregon]].  The city is also noted for its natural beauty, activist political leanings, alternative lifestyles, recreation opportunities (especially [[bicycling]], [[rafting]], and [[kayaking]]), and arts focus. In fact, Eugene's motto is &quot;The World's Greatest City for the Arts and Outdoors&quot; and is also referred to as &quot;The Emerald City&quot; and &quot;The Track Capital of the World.&quot; The [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] corporation had its beginnings in Eugene.

==History==
Eugene is named after its founder, [[Eugene Franklin Skinner]].  In [[1846]], Skinner erected the first cabin in the area. It was used as a [[trading post]] and was dubbed as a [[post office]] in [[1850]]. Skinner founded Eugene in [[1862]] and later ran a ferry service across the Willamette River where the Ferry Street Bridge now stands.

Preceding the institution of the [[University of Oregon]] was Columbia College, which was also founded around the same area the UofO resides in today.  That institute, however, fell victim to two different major fires over four years, and after being rebuilt twice already, it was decided to not be rebuilt again.  Commonly even today, people refer to parts of Eugene's campus area as &quot;College Hill,&quot; and this name does not come from the adjacent location of the University of Oregon, but rather the former location of Columbia College.  Columbia College preceded the University of Oregon by a few years.

The town raised the initial funding to start a public University, which later became the [[University of Oregon]], with the hope of turning the small town into a cultural center of learning. In 1872 the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] passed a bill ratifying the University. Interestingly, the nearby town of Albany was Eugene's biggest competitor to provide a home for this institute. In 1873 community member J. H. D. Henderson donated the hilltop land for the campus, overlooking the city. The University first opened in 1876 with regents electing first faculty and naming John Wesley Johnson as president with the first students registering on [[16 October]] [[1876]]. It would not be until 1877, later known as  Deady Hall (for the first Board of Regents President and community leader Judge [[Matthew P. Deady]]) that the first building would be completed.  It is also to place specific emphasis on the fact that the University of Oregon has been a leader in diversity since its very beginning; the University of Oregon's first class included two Japanese students.

Eugene is the home of Oregon's largest publicly owned electric utility, the Eugene Water &amp; Electric Board, which got its start in the first decade of the last century after there was a typhoid epidemic traced to the groundwater supply. Eugene condemned the private utility and began treating river water (first the Willamette, but now the McKenzie) for domestic use. EWEB got into the electric business when power was needed for the water pumps and excess electricity was used for street lighting.

==Geography and Climate==
===Geography===
[[Image:ORMap-doton-Eugene.png|right|Location of Eugene, Oregon]]Eugene is located at 44&amp;deg;3'28&quot; North, 123&amp;deg;6'37&quot; West (44.057663, -123.110345) (see [[Geographic references]]) at an elevation of 426 feet.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 105.0 km&amp;sup2; (40.6 mi&amp;sup2;){{GR|1}}. 104.9 km&amp;sup2; (40.5 mi&amp;sup2;) of it is land and 0.1 km&amp;sup2; (0.04 mi&amp;sup2; or 0.10%) of it is water.

To the north of downtown is [[Skinner Butte]] park. Forested [[Hendricks Park]] is famous for its Rhododendron Garden. [[Alton Baker Park]], along the Willamette river, attracts visitors to jog its running paths, bike its endless bike paths and bike bridges, swim the wild Willamette, canoe the millrace, sit at the duck ponds, and visit the Owens Rose Garden. A climb up Spencer Butte, south of the city, offers a lovely look at Eugene and the headwaters of the Willamette. [[Mount Pisgah Arboretum]], to the east, is another large and special park, and host to the annual mushroom festival.

Eugene has a striking urban forest. The town is packed with trees, and its citizens are very proud and protective of them. The [[University of Oregon]] campus is itself a world-class arboretum, with over 500 species of trees, and its own tourbook. The city operates and maintains scenic hiking trails that pass through and across the ridges of a cluster of small mountains in the southern portion of the city, on the fringe of residential neighborhoods. Some trails allow biking and others are for hikers only.

The [[Willamette River|Willamette]] and [[McKenzie River|McKenzie]] rivers run through Eugene and its sister city [[Springfield, Oregon|Springfield]].

===Climate===
Eugene's [[mean]] annual temperature is 52.1 &amp;deg;F (11.2 &amp;deg;C) [http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/online/ccd/nrmavg.txt]; its annual rainfall is 50.9 inches (1293 mm) [http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/online/ccd/nrmpcp.txt].  Interestingly, Eugene is actually colder on average than Portland, despite being located more than 160km (approx. 100 miles) south and having only a marginally higher elevation.  Eugene's average July low temperature is 10.6 &amp;deg;C (51.1 &amp;deg;F) [http://www.worldclimate.com/cgi-bin/data.pl?ref=N45W122+1304+356751C], while Portland's average July low is 13.6 &amp;deg;C (56.5 &amp;deg;F).  [http://www.worldclimate.com/cgi-bin/data.pl?ref=N45W122+1304+356751C].  Average winter temperatures (and summer high temperatures) are similar for the two cities.  This disparity may be largely caused by a &quot;heat island effect&quot; in Portland, where the combination of black pavement and urban energy use can actually raise the temperature.  A lesser heat island may also exist in downtown Eugene.

==Demographics==
Eugene has a significant population of people in pursuit of alternative ideas, and a strong aging hippie population. Eugene's trainyard and welcoming valley climate used to be the center of this.
There is also a significant population of outdoor enthusiasts and young retirees from California and elsewhere.

As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of [[2000]], there are 137,893 people, 58,110 households, and 31,321 families residing in the city. As of [[July 1]] [[2003]] the US Census Bureau estimated the population of Eugene to be 142,185.  The city's population is expected to further grow to 228,400 within the next 10 years. The [[population density]] is 1,313.9/km&amp;sup2; (3,403.2/mi&amp;sup2;). There are 61,444 housing units at an average density of 585.5/km&amp;sup2; (1,516.4/mi&amp;sup2;). The racial makeup of the city is 88.15% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 3.57% [[Asian]], 1.25% [[African American (U.S. Census)|Black]] or [[Race (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.93% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.21% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 2.18% from [[Race (U.S. Census)|other races]], and 3.72% from two or more races. 4.96% of the population are [[Hispanic American|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race.

There are 58,110 households out of which 25.8% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 40.6% are [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 9.7% have a female householder with no husband present, and 46.1% are non-families. 31.7% of all households are made up of individuals ane accurately formulating the problem pointed out by some great book's reading.

Secular perennialists also advocate the use of original works, perhaps translated, rather than textbooks. Their basic argument is that the original work is the work of genius. Since we need not settle for less, why should we?

The standard argument for a modern text is to make the information relevant to modern society. Perennialists argue that the topics of the great books describe any society, at any time, and thus the great books already suit our society and our time.

They freely acknowledge that any selection of [http://thecommonreview.org/gbf/ great books] will disagree about many topics, but see this as an advantage.  They believe that the student must learn to recognize such disagreements, which often reflect real disagreements between persons. Then, hardest of all, the student must actually think about the disagreements and reach a reasoned, defensible conclusion. This is a major goal of the socratic discussions. They do not advocate teaching a settled scholarly interpretation of the great books, because this cheats the student of an opportunity to learn rational criticism and to know his own mind. Also, possibly it cheats humanity of brilliant insights brought by new minds.

==Religious perennialism==
Religious perennialism is the original form, developed first by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the 13th century in his work [http://www.atheneum.org/demagis.html De Magistro], (The Teacher). It is also focused on the personal development of the student, because Christian philosophy is concerned with love (not sex, but a perfected ideal of love).

Aquinas was a Christian philosopher and theologian. He argued that God loves us, and therefore wants us to be all we can be. In particular, &quot;You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.&quot; ([[Matthew 5:48]]), and &quot;Love the Lord...with all your mind...&quot; (Luke 10:27). Thus human development glorifies God, and is a worthy project.

He argued against two fallacies. First he argued that all learning could not come from within, because it always had to be provided as sensed signs that the student must perceive. He also argued that education is not mere manipulation of a mind from outside, but that rather some essential spark (from God) remade the knowledge in the student's mind.

He advocated a middle path, between these two extremes (in line with [[Aristotle]]'s [[Nicomachean Ethics]]). That is, the teacher could guide the student to the great truths. This would save the student much [[trial and error]], and permit greater development at a younger age.

Aquinas clearly considered Christian ethics, salvation and doctrine to be items of first importance, because they concerned human access to the universal God and eternal life. He considered reasoning and philosophy to be important, but of clearly secondary importance.

An interesting teaching was that he considered God to be the great, perhaps only Teacher, because only God could form ideas directly in men's minds from mere senses.

== Colleges exemplifying this philosophy ==
Some colleges in the United States use &quot;a [[Great Books]] curriculum&quot; and represent a fairly pure application of this educational philosophy:

*[[St. John's College, U. S.]] is a well-known secular liberal-arts college with an undergraduate program described as &quot;an all-required course of study based on the great books of the Western tradition.&quot;
*[http://www.thomasaquinas.edu Thomas Aquinas College] in [[Santa Paula, California]] is a Catholic Christian college with a Great Books curriculum.
*[http://mckenziestudycenter.org/guten/ Gutenberg College] in [[Eugene, Oregon]] provides &quot;a broad-based liberal arts education in a Protestant Christian environment&quot;, with a &quot;great books&quot; curriculum emphasizing &quot;the development of basic learning skills (reading, writing, mathematics, and critical thinking) and the application of these skills to profound writings of the past&quot;
*[[Shimer College]] in [[Waukegan, Illinois]] grants a Bachelor of Arts to students who complete a program composed of humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, integrative studies and a capstone senior thesis.
*[http://www.biola.edu/academics/torrey The Torrey Honors Institute] at [[Biola University]] is a Christian Great Books program.

'''MDMA''' ('''3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine'''), most commonly known today by the [[List of street names of drugs|street name]] '''ecstasy''', is a synthetic [[Empathogen-Entactogen|entactogen]] of the [[phenethylamine]] family whose primary effect is to stimulate the secretion of and inhibit the re-uptake of large amounts of [[serotonin]] as well as [[dopamine]] and [[noradrenaline]] in the [[brain]], causing a general sense of openness, empathy, energy, euphoria, and well-being.  Tactile sensations are enhanced for some users, making general physical contact with others more pleasurable; but, contrary to popular mythology it generally does not have [[aphrodisiac]] effects.  Its ability to facilitate self-examination with reduced fear has proven useful in some therapeutic settings, leading to its 2001 approval by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] for testing in patients with [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].

Acute [[dehydration]] is a risk among users who are highly physically active and forget to [[drinking|drink]] [[water]], as the drug may mask one's normal sense of exhaustion and thirst. Also the opposite, &quot;[[water intoxication]]&quot; resulting in acute [[hyponatremia]] has been reported. By far the biggest danger comes from the fact that other, more dangerous chemicals (such as [[PMA]], or [[methamphetamine]]) are either added to ecstasy tablets, or more often simply sold as ecstasy.  Long-term effects in humans are largely unknown and the subject of much controversy &amp;mdash;particularly with regard to the risks of severe long-term [[clinical depression|depression]] as a result of a reduction in the natural production of serotonin.

&lt;!--
PLEASE DO NOT ADD TO THIS SECTION without citing SOURCES and SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE that the term has been in use for a LONG TIME and is COMMON enough to be included in an encyclopedic article (Wikipedia is not a slang or idiom guide, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary):
--&gt;
MDMA is also known by many other street names, including ''Adam'', ''Beans'', ''Biscuits'',  ''Candy'', ''E'', ''Eccies'',  ''Eileen'', ''Googs'', ''Irene'' (in East Asia), ''Jack and Jills'', &quot;Kissing Potion&quot;, ''MaDMAn'', ''Mollies'', ''Pills'', ''Rolls'', ''Scoobies'', ''Smarties'', ''Tabs'', ''Thizz'', ''Vitamin E'', ''Vitamin X'', ''X'', ''XTC'', ''Yaotou'' (in East Asia), and ''Yokes''. 

== History ==
A patent for MDMA was originally filed on [[December 24|Christmas eve]] [[1912]] by the [[Germany|German]] pharmaceutical company [[Merck KGaA|Merck]], and granted two years later (to the day). At the time, MDMA was not known to be a drug in its own right; rather, it was patented as an intermediate chemical used in the synthesis of a [[styptic]] (a drug intended to control bleeding from wounds.) Over half a century would pass before the first known ingestion of MDMA by humans.

Contrary to many rumours, the drug was never used as an [[appetite suppressant]] or as a [[stimulant]] for armed forces during wartime. (This was in fact [[methamphetamine]].) The U.S. Army did, however, do [[lethal dose]] studies of it and several other compounds in the mid-1950's.  It was given the name EA-1475, with the EA standing for [[Edgewood Arsenal]].  The results of these studies were not declassified until 1969.  MDMA was first brought to public attention through Dr. [[Alexander Shulgin]] in the 1960s who recommended it for use in certain therapy sessions, naming the drug 'window' (he discovered it while searching for compounds that might have a similar psychoactive effect as other compounds contained in [[nutmeg]]).  It was widely used therapeutically by US psychotherapists because of its empathogenic effects until its criminalization in the late 1980s. The drug was hailed as a miracle by therapists and counselors who claimed couples could have six months worth
of progress in one use of the drug, and soldiers returning from the Vietnam war could overcome their [[PTSD]] sometimes more effectively than talk or group therapy. A small number of therapists continue to use it in their practices today.  (See below for 2001 FDA approval and DEA licensing for use in patients with [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].)

Until 1985, MDMA was legal in the [[United States]]. Recreationally, it first came into prominence in certain trendy [[yuppie]] bars in the [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] area, then in [[gay]] dance clubs. From there, use spread to [[rave]] clubs, and then to mainstream society. During the 1990s, along with the growing popularity of the rave [[subculture]], MDMA use became increasingly popular among young adults in [[university|universities]] and later in [[high school]]s.  It rapidly became one of the four most widely used illegal drugs in the US, along with [[cocaine]], [[heroin]] and [[marijuana]].
In the late 80's and early 90's ecstasy was widely used in the U.K., such as [[The Haçienda]] night club in Manchester, where bands like [[The Stone Roses]] and [[The Happy Mondays]] mixed classic 60's psychedelic pop with dance bass groove to create a unique indie-dance crossover sound.  It would be these gigs (and &quot;sound&quot;) at The Haçienda that would give birth to [[rave culture]] in which ecstasy is so widely associated.

== Chemistry ==
The chemical structure of MDMA is similar to those of [[Mescaline]] and [[methamphetamine]], but the phenyl ring is [[Substitution|substituted]] with a [[methylenedioxy]] [[functional group|group]] in position 3,4.
It is a member of the [[phenethylamine]] family, a group of substances typically having pronounced biological activity.
MDMA is synthesized from [[MDP2P]] through a chemical reaction known as [[reductive amination]]. MDMA has a [[chiral]] center at the alpha carbon (next to the methylamino group).

== Pharmacokinetics ==
MDMA has complex nonlinear pharmacokinetics, due MDMA's ability to inhibit [[CYP2D6]] and CYP2d8. It is metabolised via N-demethylation to several active metabolites including MDA, although the conversion rate in humans is low. The metabolism is primarily by the [[Cytochrome P450 oxidase|cytochrome P450]] enzymes CYP2D6 (in humans, but CYP2D1 in mice), and [[CYP3A4]] . Large increases in blood and brain concentrations are mostly due to autoinhibition of CYP2D6 metabolism--if the user takes consecutive doses of the drug, disproportionately high plasma concentrations can result. A significant quantity is excreted unchanged in the urine, especially when the drug is taken at higher doses.

== Recreational use ==

The primary effects of MDMA include feelings of openness, [[euphoria]], [[empathy]], [[love]], and heightened [[self-awareness]]. Its initial adoption by the dance club sub-culture is probably due to the enhancement of the overall social and musical experience. Taking MDMA or Ecstasy is commonly referred to as ''pinging'', ''rolling'', ''popping'', ''peaking'', ''rushing'', ''buzzing'', ''dropping'', ''pilling'', ''flipping'', ''getting off-tap'', ''eating skittles'', or ''dosing''.

Some users employ practices to enhance the effects of MDMA, often called ''&quot;Blowin' up&quot;''. Because of the euphoric sensitivity to touch it is common, while on ecstasy, to have someone around the individual rub his or her fingers sensually and/or massage through the hair and scalp. Often times someone around the individual will flash lights on and off, use [[Lightstick|glow sticks]]--moving them in front of the individual vigorously--or spin the individual around, asking him/her to concentrate on one source of light. Because of the extreme intensity to colors, lights and touch this causes a 'sensory overload' to the individual, inducing an extreme sensation of euphoria.

MDMA use has increased markedly since the late 1980s and spread beyond its original sub-cultures to mainstream use. Prices have also fallen since the 1980s, with the street price in the US varying between $5 and $40 per tablet, depending on the quantity purchased, and with higher prices paid when the drug is purchased in a club or at a rave. In countries in which distribution is more extensive, such as in the Netherlands, prices can sometimes be as low as $1 per tablet. In Britain, a usual price is around £2.50 for a pill (although media reports in September 2005 show the price dropping as low as 50p in many parts of the country), the standard price in a nightclub is three pills for £10, and £20 for a half gram of pure MDMA powder, although like any illegal substance the price varies wildly depending on how many hands it has passed through. In the U.S. the price varies anywhere from $10 a pill to $30. In countries where distribution is more difficult prices are accordingly higher; for example in New Zealand prices start at around $60 NZD ($40 US) and can get as high as NZ $80.

== Supply and administration ==
MDMA is usually ingested in pill form.  Pills come in a variety of &quot;brands&quot;, usually identified by the icons stamped on the pills. The brands never consistently designate the actual active compound within the pill, as anyone can make their own pills which copy the features of a well-known brand.

Pills sold illegally on the street don't always have MDMA as the only active ingredient. There is a widely believed myth that black market pills usually contain [[methamphetamine]] - analysis of police seisures show this not to be the case, Analogues such as [[MDEA]], [[3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]] and [[MBDB]] are often found, and rarely other unrelated psychoactive additives such as [[amphetamine]]s (''speed''), [[DXM]], [[ephedrine]], [[PMA]], [[caffeine]], [[ketamine]] (''Special K''), and others were sometimes detected. Other contaminants include: [[ketamine]], [[ephedrine]], [[DXM]], [[Pseudophedrine]], and other unidentified chemicals. There are anecdotal stories of pills containing [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], or [[mescaline]]; however, there have been no documented cases where these contaminants have been found. Mescaline is an especially unlikely contaminant, as a large amount is required for an effective dose.  There have been a few cases where an extremely potent synthetic opiate, Fenantyl, has been identified in pills. 
[[Image:Ecstacy monogram.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Ecstasy commonly appears in a tablet form, usually imprinted with a monogram.]]

Many legal pills such as [[aspirin]], [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen), or even [[dog|canine]] [[heartworm]] tablets have had the letter E scratched into them and been sold as ecstasy, for enormous profit. (This is a minor plot device in the movie [[Go (1999)|''Go'']].) Such false labeling can have deadly results, as a significant number of people are [[allergy|allergic]] to aspirin. Paracetamol is fairly [[hepatotoxicity|hepatotoxic]] and can cause significant [[liver]] damage or death if taken in large doses, as might happen to a person taking four or five tablets in quick succession, thinking the tablets to be ecstasy. While overdose from MDMA itself is rare, many more toxic substances are often sold as ecstasy, and overdose or other adverse reaction to adulterants is not uncommon. 

Although full and proper characterization of ecstasy pills requires advanced lab techniques such as [[Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry]], it is also possible to use a less accurate presumptive [[alkaloid]] test known as the [[Marquis reagent]]. [[DanceSafe]] sells testing kits, and includes an extensive database of photographs of different pills, along with the results of a laboratory analysis of their contents. EcstasyData.org [http://www.ecstasydata.org/] is a non-profit site that tests the purity of street pills and compiles results. Most blackmarket pills are made in basement labs with household chemicals (often containing other products) and are thus dangerous because of their impurity content.

==Effects==
=== Pharmacodynamics ===
[[Serotonin]] is a neurotransmitter believed to play a role in the regulation of mood and pleasure. MDMA's main action is believed to cause [[serotonin]] vescicles in the brain to release quantities of serotonin into the [[Synapse|synapses]]. MDMA also has slight agonist effects on [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]] levels and promotes the release of the hormone [[prolactin]]. These effects are primarily due to MDMA's action on the [[monoamine transporter]]s, SERT ([[serotonin transporter]]), DAT ([[dopamine transporter]]) and NET ([[norepinephrine transporter]]).

===Other short-term effects===
Apart from the dangers from impurities, the primary acute risks of taking MDMA are [[allergy|allergic reaction]], which is extremely rare, and [[dehydration]]. Like  amphetamine, MDMA can mask the body's normal thirst and exhaustion responses, particularly if a user is dancing or is otherwise physically active for long periods of time without hydration. MDMA can temporarily reduce the body's ability to regulate its core temperature, and in high-temperature surroundings (e.g. clubs) combined with physical exertion this may lead to [[hyperpyrexia]] if precautions are not taken to remain cool. While dehydration is undesirable, there also have been a very small number of users overly concerned about hydration drinking excessive water and suffering from [[water intoxication]] and associated [[hyponatremia]] (dilution of the blood that can cause [[Edema|swelling]] of the [[brain]]). This is what caused the death of British teen [[Leah Betts]], which may be the world's most widely publicised MDMA-related fatality. Some users also report decreased libido or impotence; however, studies have had conflicting results [http://www.idmu.co.uk/esex.htm].

=== Long-term effects ===
Long-term effects are still unknown and heavily debated among scientists. There are several reports of [[Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder|Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder]] being induced by MDMA. In some cases, the disorder appears to be permanent. The disorder seems to occur in only a small percentage of users, and its mechanism of causation is unknown.

Some experiments indicate that prolonged or excessive use at very high doses may lead to the [[synaptic terminal]]s of serotonin neurons being damaged. The precise mechanism of this action is unknown, but recent evidence (Jones 2004; Miller 1997; Monks et al. 2004) suggests that the [[Metabolism|metabolic]] breakdown of MDMA includes the formation of [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS), chemicals known to cause oxidative cell damage when taken up into the releasing synapse.

This effect has been experimentally verified in the brains of [[rat]]s, where the serotonin terminals of animals who are given extremely high doses of MDMA over a prolonged period of time (usually one to two orders of magnitude greater than a typical human dose) become withered and useless.  This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the administration of [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (&quot;SSRIs&quot;, which bind to the serotonin cell's reuptake transporters and thus block ROS from entering the serotonin cells) along with or immediately following MDMA seems to block neuron damage in rats given MDMA. Vitamin C in large doses has also been shown to prevent oxidative stress in vivo, and Vitamin C should be considered as a harm prevention adjunct to MDMA use. 

Some MDMA users administer an SSRI while, or shortly after taking MDMA, in an attempt to prevent possible [[neurotoxicity]].  These SSRIs are typically [[antidepressant]]s such as [[Prozac]] or [[Zoloft]].  It should be noted, however, that MDMA use in conjunction with a different class of antidepressants, namely [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s, is strondepartments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks (Lucas, Blazek, &amp; Raley, 2005).

==Social, moral and cognitive development==
[[Image:Kugleramme.jpg|right|thumb|250px| An [[abacus]] provides concrete experiences for learning abstract concepts.]]
To understand the characteristics of learners in [[child|childhood]], [[adolescence]], [[adulthood]], and [[old age]], educational psychology develops and applies theories of human [[developmental psychology|development]]. Often cast as stages through which people pass as they mature, developmental theories describe changes in mental abilities ([[cognition]]), social roles, moral reasoning, and beliefs about the nature of knowledge.

For example, educational psychologists have researched the instructional applicability of [[Cognitive Development|Jean Piaget's theory of development]], according to which children mature through four stages of cognitive capability. Piaget hypothesized that children are not capable of abstract logical thought until they are older than about 11 years, and therefore younger children need to be taught using concrete objects and examples. Researchers have found that transitions, such as from concrete to abstract logical thought, do not occur at the same time in all domains. A child may be able to think abstractly about mathematics, but remain limited to concrete thought when reasoning about human relationships. Perhaps Piaget's most enduring contribution is his insight that people actively construct their understanding through a self-regulatory process.

Piaget proposed a developmental theory of [[moral reasoning]] in which children progress from a naive understanding of [[morality]] based on behavior and outcomes to a more advanced understanding based on intentions. Piaget's views of moral development were elaborated by [[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg]] into a [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stage theory of moral development]]. There is evidence that the moral reasoning described in stage theories is not sufficient to account for moral behavior. For example, other factors such as modeling (as described by the [[social cognitive theory of morality]]) are required to explain [[bullying]].

Developmental theories are sometimes presented not as shifts between qualitatively different stages, but as gradual increments on separate dimensions. Development of epistemological beliefs (beliefs about knowledge) have been described in terms gradual changes in people's belief in: certainty and permanence of knowledge, fixedness of ability, and credibility of authorities such as teachers and experts. People develop more sophisticated beliefs about knowledge as they gain in education and maturity (Cano, 2005).

==Individual differences and disabilities==
[[Image:FiguralRelation.png|right|thumb|250px| An example of an item from a cognitive abilities test.]]

Each person has an individual profile of characteristics, abilities and challenges that result from learning and development. These manifest as individual differences in [[Intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], [[creativity]], [[cognitive style]], [[motivation]], and the capacity to process information, communicate, and relate to others. The most prevalent disabilities found among school age children are [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[learning disability]], [[dyslexia]], and [[speech disorder]]. Less common disabilities include [[mental retardation]], [[autism]], [[hearing impairment]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[epilepsy]], and [[blindness]].

Although theories of intelligence have been discussed by philosophers since [[Plato]], intelligence testing is an invention of educational psychology, and is coincident with the development of that discipline. Continuing debates about the nature of intelligence revolve on whether intelligence can be characterized by a single [[factor analysis|factor]] (Spearman's [[General intelligence factor|general intelligence)]], multiple factors (as in Sternberg's [[triarchic theory of intelligence]] and Gardner's [[theory of multiple intelligences]]), or whether it can be measured at all. In practice, standardized instruments such as the [[Stanford-Binet IQ test]] are widely used in economically developed countries to identify children in need of individualized educational treatment. Children classified as [[gifted]] are often provided with accelerated or enriched programs. Children identified with specific deficits may be provided with education in specific skills such as [[phonological awareness]].

== Learning and cognition ==
Two fundamental assumptions that underly formal education systems are that students (a) retain knowledge and skills they acquire in school, and (b) can apply them in situations outside the classroom. But are these assumptions accurate? Research has found that, even when students report not using the knowledge acquired in school, a considerable portion is retained for many years and long term retention is strongly dependent on the initial level of mastery (Semb &amp; Ellis, 1994).  When tested 10 years later, university students who took a child development course and attained high grades showed average retention scores of about 30%, whereas those who obtained moderate or lower grades showed average retention scores of about 20% (Ellis, Semb, &amp; Cole, 1998). There is much less consensus on the crucial question of how much knowledge acquired in school transfers to tasks encountered outside formal educational settings. Some psychologists claim that research evidence for this type of ''far transfer'' is scarce (Perkins &amp; Grotzer, 1997; Detterman, 1993), while others claim there is abundent evidence of far transfer in specific domains (e.g., Halpern, 1998). 

Several perspectives have been established within which the theories of learning used in educational psychology are formed and contested. These include [[Behaviorism]], [[Cognitivism (psychology)|Cognitivism]], [[Social Cognitivism]], and [[Constructivism (pedagogical)|Constructivism]]. This section summarizes how educational psychology has researched and applied theories within each of these perspectives.

===Behavioral perspective===
[[Applied Behavior Analysis|Applied behavior analysis]], a set of techniques based on the behavioral principles of [[operant conditioning]], is effective in a range of educational settings (Alberto &amp; Troutman, 2003). For example, teachers can improve student behavior by systematically rewarding students who follow classroom rules with praise, stars, or tokens exchangable for sundry items (McGoey &amp; DuPaul, 2003; Theodore, Bray, Kehle, &amp; Jensen, 2001). However, the use of rewards in education has been criticized by proponents of [[Self-Determination Theory|self-determination theory]], who claim that rewards undermine [[intrinsic motivation]]. There is evidence that tangible rewards decrease intrinsic motivation in specific situations, such as when the student already has a high level of intrinsic motivation to perform the goal behavior (Lepper, Greene, &amp; Nisbett, 1973). But the results showing detrimental effects are counterbalanced by evidence that, in other situations, such as when rewards are given for attaining a gradually increasing standard of performance, rewards enhance intrinsic motivation (Cameron, Pierce, Banko, &amp; Gear, 2005).  

===Cognitive perspective===
Among current educational psychologists, the cognitive perspective is more widely held than the behavioral perspective perhaps because it flexibly admits causally related mental constructs such as [[personality|traits]], [[beliefs]], [[memory|memories]], [[motivation|motivations]] and [[emotions]]. Cognitive theories posit memory structures that are thought to determine how information is [[perception|perceived]], [[information processing|processed]], stored, [[information retrieval|retrieved]] and [[forgetting|forgotten]]. Among the memory structures theorized by cognitive psychologists are separate but linked visual and verbal systems described by Paivio's [[dual coding theory]]. Educational psychologists have used dual coding theory and [[cognitive load]] theory to explain how people learn from [[multimedia]] presentations (Mayer, 2003).

[[Image:KrugDavisGlover1990.png|right|thumb|250px| Three experiments reported by Krug, Davis &amp; Glover (1990) demonstrated the advantage of delaying a 2nd reading of a text passage by one week (distributed) compared with no delay between readings (massed).]]
The spaced learning effect, a cognitive phenomenon strongly supported by psychological research, has broad applicability within education (Dempster, 1989). For example, students have been found to perform better on a test of knowledge about a text passage when a second reading of the passage is delayed rather than immediate (Krug, Davis &amp; Glover, 1990, see figure). Educational psychology research has confirmed the applicability to education of other findings from cognitive psychology, such as the benefits of using [[mnemonics]] for immediate and delayed retention of information (Carney &amp; Levin, 2000).

[[Problem solving]], regarded by many cognitive psychologists as fundamental to learning, is an important research topic in educational psychology. A student is thought to interpret a problem by assigning it to a problem [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] held as prior knowledge. When the problem is assigned to the wrong schema, the student's attention is subsequently directed away from features of the problem that are inconsistent with the assigned schema (Kalyuga, Chandler, Tuovnen &amp; Sweller, 2001). The critical step of finding a mapping between the problem and a pre-existing schema is often cited as supporting the centrality of [[analogy|analogical]] thinking to problem solving.

=== Social cognitive perspective ===
Social cognitive theory is a highly influential fusion of behavioral, cognitive and social elements that was initially developed by educational psychologist [[Albert Bandura]]. In its earlier, neo-behavioral incarnation called ''social learning theory'', Bandura emphasized the process of [[observational learning]] in which a learner's behavior changes as a result of observing others' behavior and its consequences. The theory identified several factors that determine whether observing a model will affect behavioral or cognitive change. These factors include the learner's developmental status, the perceived prestige and competence of the model, the consequences received by the model, the relevance of the model's behaviors and consequences to the learner's goals, and the learner's [[self-efficacy]]. The concept of self-efficacy, which played an important role in later developments of the theory, refers to the learner's belief in his or her ability to perform the modeled behavior.

An [[experiment]] by Schunk and Hanson (1985), studying grade 2 students who had previously experienced difficulty in learning [[subtraction]], illustrates the type of research stimulated by social learning theory. One group of students observed a subtraction demonstration by a teacher and then participated in an instructional program on subtraction. A second group observed other grade 2 students performing the same subtraction procedures and then partipated in the same instructional program. The students who observed peer models scored higher on a subtraction post-test and also reported greater confidence in their subtraction ability. The results were interpreted as supporting the [[hypothesis]] that perceived similarity of the model to the learner increases self-efficacy, leading to more effective learning of modeled behavior. It is supposed that peer modeling is particularly effective for students who have low self-efficacy.

Over the last decade, much research activity in educational psychology has focused on developing theories of [[self-regulated learning]] (SRL) and [[metacognition]]. These theories work from the central premise that effective learners are active agents who construct knowledge by setting goals, analysing tasks, planning strategies and monitoring their understanding.  Research has indicated that learners' who are better at goal setting and self-monitoring tend to have greater intrinsic task interest and [[self-efficacy]] (Zimmerman, 1998); and that teaching learning strategies can increase academic achievement (Hattie, Biggs &amp; Purdie, 1996).

===Constructivist perspective===
[[Constructivism (learning theory)|Constructivism]] refers to a category of learning theories in which emphasis is placed on the agency and prior knowledge of the learner, and often on the social and cultural determinants of the learning process. Educational psychologists distinguish individual (or psychological) constructivism, identified with Piaget's learning theory, from social constructivism. A dominant influence on the latter type is [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s work on sociocultural learning, describing how interactions with adults, more capable peers, and cognitive tools are internalized to form mental constructs. Elaborating on Vygotsky's theory, [[Jerome Bruner]] and other educational psychologists developed the important concept of [[instructional scaffolding]], in which the social or information environment offers supports for learning that are gradually withdrawn as they become internalized.

Vygotsky's version of [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] theory has led to the view that behavior, skills, attitudes and beliefs are inherently [[situated cognition|situated]], that is, bound to a specific sociocultural setting. According to this view, the learner is enculturated through social interactions within a [[community of practice]]. The social constructivist view of learning has spawned approaches to teaching and learning such as [[cognitive apprenticeship]], in which the tacit components of a complex skill are made explicit through conversational interactions occurring between expert and novice in the setting in which the skill is embedded (Collins, Brown &amp; Newman, 1989).

==Motivation==
[[Motivation]] is an internal state that arouses, guides and sustains behavior. Educational psychology research on motivation is concerned with the [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] or [[Will (philosophy)|will]] that students bring to a task, their level of interest and [[intrinsic motivation]], the personally held [[Goal setting|goals]] that guide their behavior, and their belief about the causes of their success or failure.

A form of [[attribution theory]] developed by [[Bernard Weiner]] describes how students' beliefs about the causes of academic success or failure affect their emotions and motivations (Weiner, 2000). For example, when students attribute failure to lack of ability, and ability is perceived as uncontrollable, they experience the emotions of [[shame]] and [[embarrassment]] and consequently decrease effort and show poorer performance. In contrast, when students attribute failure to lack of effort, and effort is perceived as controllable, they experience the emotion of [[guilt]] and consequently increase effort and show improved performance.  

Motivational theories also explain how [[Goal Theory|learners' goals]] affect the way that they engage with academic tasks (Elliot, 1999). Those who have ''mastery goals'' strive to increase their ability and knowledge. Those who have ''performance approach goals'' strive for high grades and seek opportunities to demonstrate their abilities. Those who have ''performance avoidance'' goals are driven by fear of failure and avoid situations where their abilities are exposed. Research has found that mastery goals are associated with many positive outcomes such as persistence in the face of failure, preference for challenging tasks, [[creativity]] and [[intrinsic motivation]]. Performance avoidance goals are associated with negative outcomes such as poor [[attention|concentration]] while studying, disorganized studying, less self-regulation, shallow information processing and [[anxiety#Test anxiety|test anxiety]]. Performance approach goals are associated with positive outcomes, and some negative outcomes such as an unwillingness to seek help and shallow information processing.

==Research methods==
The research methods used in educational psychology tend to be drawn from psychology and other social sciences. There is also a history of significant methodological innovation by educational psychologists, or psychologists investigating educational problems. Research methods address problems in both [[design of experiments|research design]] and [[data analysis]]. Research design informs the planning of experiments and observational studies to ensure that their results have [[internal validity|internal]], [[external validity|external]] and [[ecological validity|ecological]] validity. Data analysis encompasses methods for processing both quantitive (numerical) and qualitative (non-numerical) research data. Although, historically, the use of quantitative methods was often considered an essential mark of scholarship, modern educational psychology research uses both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research|qualitative]] methods. 
===Quantitative methods===
[[Image:Normal_distribution_and_scales.gif|right|thumb|250px|Test scores and other educational variables often approximate a [[normal distribution]].]]
Perhaps first among the important methodological innovations of educational psychology was the development and application of [[factor analysis]] by [[Charles Spearman]]. Factor analysis is mentioned here as one example of the many [[Multivariate statistics|multivariate statistical methods]] used by educational psychologists. Factor analysis is used to summarize relationships among a large set of variables or test questions, develop theories about mental constructs such as self-efficacy or anxiety, and assess the reliability and validity of test scores (Thompson, 2004). Over one hundred years after its introduction by Spearman, factor analysis has become a research staple figuring prominantly in educational psychology journals.

Because educational [[assessment]] is fundamental to most quantitative research in the field, educational psychologists have made significant contributions to the field of [[psychometrics]]. For example, [[Cronbach's alpha|alpha]], the widely used measure of test [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] was developed by educational psychologist [[Lee Cronbach]]. The reliability of assessments are routinely reported in quantitative educational research. Although, originally, educational measurement methods were built on [[classical test theory]], [[item response theory]] and [[Rasch model|Rasch models]] are now used extensively in educational measurement worldwide. These models afford advantages over classical test theory, including the capacity to produce standard errors of measurement for each score or pattern of scores on assessments and the capacity to handle missing responses.

[[Meta-analysis]], the combination of individual research results to produce a quantitative [[literature review]], is another methodological innovation with a close association to educational psychology. In a meta-analysis, [[effect size]]s that represent, for example, the differences between treatment groups in a set of similar experiments, are averaged to obtain a single aggregate value representing the best [[estimate]] of the effect of treatment (Lipsey &amp; Wilson, 2001). Several decades after [[Karl Pearson|Pearson]]'s work with early versions of meta-analysis, [[Gene V Glass|Glass]] (1976) published the first application of modern meta-analytic techniques and triggered their broad application across the social and biomedical sciences. Today, meta-analysis is among the most common types of literature review found in educational psychology research.

===Qualitative methods===
Qualitative methods are used in educational studies whose purpose is to describe events, processes and situations of theoretical significance. The qualitative methods used in educational psychology often derive from [[psycholinguistics]], [[anthropology]] or [[sociology]]. For example, the anthropological method of [[ethnography]] has been used to describe teaching and learning in classrooms. In studies of this type, the researcher may gather detailed field notes as a [[Participant observation|participant observer]] or passive observer. Later, the notes and other data may be categorized and interpreted by methods such as [[grounded theory]]. [[Triangulation (social science)|Triangulation]], the practice of cross-checking findings with multiple data sources, is highly valued in qualitative research.

[[Case study|Case studies]] are forms of qualitative research focusing on a single person, organization, event, or other entity. In one case study (Everall, Bostik &amp; Paulson, 2005), researchers conducted a 150-minute, semi-structured [[interview]] with a 20-year old woman who had a history of [[Teenage suicide|suicidal]] thinking between the ages of 14 to 18. They analyzed an audio-recording of the interview to understand the roles of cognitive development, identify formation and [[Attachment theory|social attachment]] in ending her suicidal thinking. 

Qualitative analysis is most often applied to verbal data from sources such as conversations, interviews, [[focus group]]s, and personal journals. Qualitative methods are thus, typically, approaches to gathering, processing and reporting verbal data. One of the most commonly used methods for qualitative research in educational psychology is [[protocol analysis]] (Ericsson &amp; Simon, 1993). In this method the research participant is asked to ''think aloud'' while performing a task, such as solving a math problem. In protocol analysis the verbal data is thought to indicate which information the subject is attending to, but is explicitly not interpreted as an explanation or justification for behavior. In contrast, the method of verbal analysis (Chi, 1997) does admit learners' explanations as a way to reveal their  [[mental model]] or [[misconception]]s (e.g., of the laws of motion). The most fundamental operations in both protocol and verbal analysis are segmenting (isolating) and categorizing sections of verbal data. [[Conversation analysis]] and [[discourse analysis]], psycholinguistic methods that focus more specifically on the structure of conversational interchange (e.g., between a teacher and student), have been used to assess the process of conceptual change in science learning (Pea, 1993). Qualitative methods are also used to analyse information in a variety of media, such as students' drawings and [[concept maps]], video-recorded interactions, and computer log records.

==Applications in instructional design and technology==
[[Image:BloomsCognitiveDomain.PNG|right|thumb|250px|[[Taxonomy of education objectives|Bloom's taxonomy]] of educational objectives: categories in the cognitive domain (Anderson &amp; Krathwohl, 2001)]]

[[Instructional design]], the systematic design of materials, activities and interactive environments for learning, is broadly informed by educational psychology theories and research. For example, in defining learning goals or objectives, instructional designers often use a [[Taxonomy of education objectives|taxonomy of educational objectives]] created by [[Benjamin Bloom]] and colleagues (Anderson &amp; Krathwohl, 2001). Bloom also researched [[mastery learning]], an instructional strategy in which learners only advance to a new learning objective after they have mastered its prerequisite objectives. Bloom (1984) discovered that a combination of mastery learning with one-to-one tutoring is highly effective, producing learning outcomes far exceeding those normally encountered in classroom instruction.

==Applications in teaching==
[[Image:FinnGerberBoydZaharias2005.png|right|thumb|250px|A class size experiment in the United States found that attending small classes for 3 or more years in the early grades increased high school graduation of students from low income families (Finn, Gerber, &amp; Boyd-Zaharias, 2005).]]
Research on [[classroom management]] and [[pedagogy]] is conducted to guide teaching practice and form a foundation for teacher education programs. The goals of classroom management are to create an environment conducive to learning and to develop students' self-management skills. More specifically, classroom management strives to create positive teacher-student and peer relationships, manage student groups to sustain on-task behavior, and use counselling and other psychological methods to aid students who present persistent psychosocial problems (Emmer &amp; Stough, 2001).

==History==
[[Image:Wm james.jpg|right|thumb|250px|William James]]
Educational psychology cannot claim priority in the systematic analysis of educational processes. [[philosophy of education|Philosophers of education]] such as [[Democritus]], [[Quintilian]], [[Vives]] and [[Comenius]], had examined, classified and judged the methods of education centuries before the [[History of psychology|beginnings of psychology]] in the late 1800s. Instead, aspirations of the new discipline rested on the application of the [[scientific methods]] of observation and experimentation to educational problems. Even in the earliest years of the discipline, educational psychologists recognized the limitations of this new approach. In his famous series of lectures ''Talks to Teachers on Psychology'', published in 1899 and now regarded as the first educational psychology textbook, the pioneering American psychologist [[William James]] commented that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Psychology is a science, and teaching is an art; and sciences never generate arts directly out of themselves. An intermediate inventive mind must make that application, by using its originality. (James, 1899/1983, p. 15)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* [[Charles Hubbard Judd]]

Thorndike, who developed the theory of [[instrumental conditioning]], presaged later work on programmed instruction, mastery learning and computer-based learning:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If, by a miracle of mechanical ingenuity, a book could be so arranged that only to him who had done what was directed on page one would page two become visible, and so on, much that now requires personal instruction could be managed by print. (Thorndike, 1912, p. 165)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Careers in educational psychology==
A person may be considered an educational psychologist if he or she has completed a graduate [[academic degree|degree]] in educational psychology or a closely related field.  Universities establish educational psychology graduate programs in either psychology departments or, more commonly, faculties of education. Psychologists who work in a k-12 school setting are usually trained at either the [[Professional Master's degree|masters]] or doctoral ([[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] or [[Doctor of Education|EdD]]) level.  In addition to conducting assessments, school psychologists provide services such as academic and behavioral intervention, counseling, teacher consultation, and crisis intervention.

In recent decades the participation of women as professional researchers in [[North American]] educational psychology has risen dramatically (Evans, Hsieh &amp; Robinson, 2005). The percentage of female authors of peer-reviewed journal articles doubled from 1976 (24%) to 1995 (51%), and has since remained constant. Female membership on educational psychology journal editorial boards increased from 17% in 1976 to 47% in 2004. Over the same period, the proportion of chief editor positions held by women increased from 22% to 70%.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''EFTPOS''' (Electronic Funds Transfer at Point of Sale) is a device by which sales transactions can be directly debited to the customer's bank account at the point of sale, through the use of a [[debit card]] (generally the same card used with [[Automatic Teller Machine]]s). Merchants using EFTPOS can also offer cashout facilities to customers, where a customer can withdraw cash along with their purchase. EFTPOS are sometime also called '''POS Terminal''' or '''Payment Terminal''' and must not be confused with traditional [[Point of sale]].

The customer's card is swiped through a card reader or inserted into chip reader and the merchant usually enters the amount of the transaction before the customer enters their account and [[Personal identification number|PIN]]. There is usually a short delay while the EFTPOS terminal contacts the server (over a phone line or mobile connection) before a message of Accepted or Declined is returned. Often, at peak shopping times (for example the last shopping day before Christmas), the system can become overloaded and the delay will become extended or even time out.



==Ubiquity in some countries==
EFTPOS could be seen a major driver of a cashless society in these countries. EFTPOS is so wide-spread and so commonly used that it is necessary to advertise &quot;cash only - no EFTPOS&quot; for events or locations where it is not available. Mobile EFTPOS is now used by certain taxi companies, pizza delivery outlets and stall holders at festivals, allowing EFTPOS transactions to be carried over the mobile network.

==EFTPOS in particular countries==

In some countries, banks tend to levy a small fee of around 25 to 50 cents per debit card transaction. Although bank accounts without these fees are becoming more common, these charges mean it is wise to limit EFTPOS usage. There are, however, many people in New Zealand and Australia who routinely use EFTPOS for all transactions, no matter how small. This has resulted in some retailers refusing to accept EFTPOS as payment for small transactions, where paying the transaction fee would absorb the [[profit margin]] on the sale, making the transaction uneconomic for the retailer.

===UK===
In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] integrated EFTPOS (usually referred to as [[debit card]]s) are an established part of the retail market.  Cards commonly in circulation include [[Maestro (debit card)|Maestro]] (previously [[Switch (debit card)|Switch]]), [[Solo (debit card)|Solo]], [[Visa (credit card)|Visa]] [[Visa Delta|Delta]] and Visa [[Visa Electron|Electron]]. Banks do not charge customers for EFTPOS transactions in the UK, but some retailers make small charges, particularly where the transaction amount in question is small. The UK is in the process of converting all [[debit card]]s in circulation to [[Chip and PIN]], based on the [[EMV]] standard, to increase transaction security.

===New Zealand===
The EFTPOS system is highly popular in [[New Zealand]]. Virtually all retail outlets have EFTPOS terminals, particularly supermarkets, dairies, service stations, and bars.  Increasingly Taxi operators and even businesses operating from stands at events have mobile EFTPOS terminals.

New Zealanders use EFTPOS for both small and large transactions. It would not be unusual for a New Zealander to use an EFTPOS card to pay for an amount as small as $1 [[New Zealand dollar|NZD]].  Because EFTPOS is such an integral part of spending in New Zealand, occasional network failures cause tremendous delays, inconvenience and lost income to businesses who must resort to swipe machines to process EFTPOS transactions until the network returns to service.

The [[Bank of New Zealand]] introduced EFTPOS to New Zealand in 1983 through a pilot scheme with petrol stations. New Zealand now has more EFTPOS terminals per head of population than any other country.

EFTPOS is operated through two primary networks. One owned by [[ANZ New Zealand]], and [[National Bank of New Zealand]], and a second operated by [[Electronic Transaction Services Limited]] which is owned by [[ASB Bank]], [[Westpac]] and the [[Bank of New Zealand]].

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], EFTPOS-enabled cards are accepted at almost all swipe terminals able to accept [[credit card]]s, regardless of the bank that issued the card, including [[Maestro (debit card)|Maestro]] cards issued by foreign banks, with most high turnover businesses accepting them, with 450,000 Point Of Sale terminals[http://www.maestrocard.com/cgi-bin/wheretouse.cgi?country=002&amp;Select+a+country.x=14&amp;Select+a+country.y=2&amp;region=01]. EFTPOS cards can also be used to deposit and withdraw cash over the counter at [[Australia Post]] outlets participating in giroPost, just as if the transaction was conducted at a bank branch, even if the bank branch is closed. Although EFTPOS terminals are now commonplace, many merchants still retain manual credit card terminals as their sole method of accepting cashless payment.

===Canada===
:''Main article: [[Interac]]''
[[Canada]] has a nation-wide EFTPOS system, called [[Interac|Interac Direct Payment]].  Since being introduced in 1994, IDP has become the most popular payment method in the country, surpassing even regular cash payments in [[2001]].

=== Germany ===
Over recent years, in [[Germany]] EFTPOS has gained tremendously in acceptance. Facilities already existed before EFTPOS became popular with the Eurocheque card (Eurocheque was originally a system of paper cheques. In addition to the actual cheques, customers were issued a card, which needed to be shown along side the cheque as security measure. Those cards could and can also be used on ATM Terminals and at EFTPOS, which is nowadays their only function, since the Eurocheque system (along with the name, but they're still referred to as Eurocheque cards by most people) was abandoned in 2002 during the transition from [[Deutsche Mark]] to the [[Euro]]). In 2005, one must actively search for a store or petrol station without EFTPOS facilities. Processing fees are deducted from businesses, and because of this, some business owners refuse EFTPOS-sales for totals below a certain amount, usually 5 or 10 Euros.

Around 2000, an alternative method for EFTPOS payment was introduced, dubbed &quot;Geldkarte&quot; (&quot;money card&quot;). It uses a smart card chip on the front of a standard issue Eurocheque card (which still had the magnetic stripe on the back). This chip can be loaded with up to 200 Euros, and is advertised as means for medium to very small payments, down to the low ety gets a fair amount of [[precipitation]], although major paralyzing [[snow]] and [[rain]] storms such as [[blizzard]]s and [[hurricane]]s are uncommon compared to more coastal cities like [[Moncton]] or [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] (but do happen on occasion).  On average, Fredericton receives approximately 1100 mm of precipitation per year.  Snowfall is common between late November and early April, and snow usually stays on the ground beginning in December.  [[Flood]]ing occurs during the [[Spring (season)|spring]] of most years on area rivers and affects the city's low lying neighbourhoods.

==Education and Research==
===Universities and Colleges===
[[Image:UNB.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Looking down the hill from UNB towards downtown and the Saint John River]]
Fredericton's status as an educational centre is evident in the city's two degree granting [[universities]]: the [[University of New Brunswick]] and [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)]].  

The [[University of New Brunswick]] - commonly abbreviated UNB - was founded in 1785 and - along with the University of Georgia - is the oldest public university in North America.  Built in 1826, UNB's [[Old Arts Building]] is the oldest university building still in use in Canada.  UNB also houses Renaissance College which is a leading elite leadership training institution in New Brunswick.  UNB houses a Faculty of Law which is one of two Anglophone common-law schools in Atlantic Canada.  

[[Saint Thomas University]] is the province's only Catholic university and has been located in Fredericton since 1964, when it moved from its [[Chatham, New Brunswick]] campus.  [[Saint Thomas University]] - commonly abbreviated as STU - is a leading liberal arts university that boasts programs in gerontology, criminology, journalism, social work, native studies, and education. 

Adding to Fredericton's cultural and artisitic life is the [[New Brunswick College of Craft and Design]] which houses the provinces leading programs in photography and visual arts.  The [[New Brunswick Community College]] maintains a campus in Fredericton providing two year degree programs oriented to quick entry into the job market.

Fredericton is also home to a small Pentecostal College, the Northeastern Christain College, located on the city's northside.  This college trains and certifies [[pentecostalism|pentecostal]] [[Minister (Christianity)|Ministers]].&lt;/p&gt;

===School System===
Fredericton is home to two public [[high school]]s.  [[Fredericton High School]], which was once the largest school in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] until the construction of [[Leo Hayes High School]] in 1999, primarily serves students on the south side.  It is also one of the oldest public highschools in Canada tracing its beginnings to 1785 - having celebrated its bicentennial in 1985.  Fredericton High School is home to several important sports teams - including basketball, hockey, soccer, and football - which dominated New Brunswick provincial highschool sports championships during much of the 1980s and 1990s.

[[Leo Hayes High School]], which opened in 1999, serves north side students.  In addition, there are four [[middle schools]], fourteen [[elementary schools]] and three [[private schools]] in the city.  A recent issue with middle schools in the city has been the location of George Street Junior High and Albert Street Junior High close to the city centre.  This fails to account for the city's changing demographic - which has seen the growth of suburban neighbourhoods.  Recent discussions have involved possibly closing down either George Street Junior High or Albert Street Junior to replace them with a suburban Junior High School - possibly to be located in Skyline Acres in the Eastern part of the City.

Fredericton is also serviced by the French language Ecole Sainte Anne which provides K-12 French language education.  Ecole Sainte Anne is administered by a school district system separate from that which governs the English language schools in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

===Research===
Fredericton hosts several major research centres - dealing with policy development, agriculture, forestry, and engineering.  These research institutions are either connected to the City's two universities as well as the provincial and federal government.

The Hugh John Flemming Forestry Centre (including Provincial and Federal Departments) is the leading forestry research centre in Atlantic Canada.  This Centre carries out major research endeavours in forestry management and scientific research.  The Centre closely collaberates with the Forestry Department at the [[University of New Brunswick]] which is one of the top Forestry Departments in Canada.  As well, research and development in agriculture and crop development is carried out at the Agricultural Research Station in Lincoln.

The [[University of New Brunswick]] is the site of several major research centres in social science, forestry, geomatics and biomedical engineering, and policy devlopment.  These include the Centre for Conflict Studies - which carries out Research on military and strategic issues and the Muriel McQueen Fergusson Centre for Family Violence Research carries out multi-disciplinary research on family violence issues.  Furthermore, the Institute of Biomedical Engineering has completed groundbreaking work on prosthetic limbs to aid war amputees in developing countries.  

As well, the city's growing IT sector has been the basis for new research on IT and computer programming development.

==Economy==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:King_Street.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A view of Downtown from King Street, 2004]] --&gt;
During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the lumber industry - with corresponding mills - were a primary sector of Fredericton's economy.  Over the course of the 20th century, these industries declined and gave way to the provincial government and the universities being the primary employers in the city.

The policies of centralizing provincial government functions during the 1960s under New Brunswick Premier [[Louis Robichaud]] -along with the expanded role of the public sector characteristic of the 1960s/70s - led to a sizeable expansion of the city's population.  It was during these decades that the Hill area on the city's Southside was largely developed and bedroom communities such as [[New Maryland, New Brunswick|New Maryland]] emerged.

The 1960s also saw an expansion of the [[University of New Brunswick]] - due to increased post-war university enrollments - as well as the construction of the Fredericton campus of [[Saint Thomas University]].  Also contributing to this expansion was the move of the Law School to the Fredericton area.  This expansion of the post-secondary sector also contributed to Fredericton's population growth during the 1960s and 1970s.  Since then, the city's population has continued to grow though at a slower rate due to slower growth of the government sector - along with hiring freezes and in some cases layoffs - during the [[Frank McKenna]] and [[Bernard Lord]] governments.

In recent years, increased student enrollments at the city's universities has led to greater demand for rental property.  This has led to the construction of new university residences and apartment buildings in the city and increased rates of rent - making them the highest rental rates in the province.

It is due to the predominance of the universities and government in the city, that Fredericton has not been subjected to the severe economic fluctuations faced by other Atlantic Canadian cities that have had to deal with mill shutdowns and the decline of the fishing industry in recent decades.  It is for this reason that Fredericton is one of the few Atlantic Canadian cities, along with [[Moncton]] and [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]] that has actually reported a population increase in recent years.  

In the 1990s several [[call centres]] opened up in the Fredericton area due to policies of the McKenna Liberal government.  Lately, the city has also tried to entice [[technology]] firms to mixed success.  Several local IT companies have specialized in e-Learning services making Fredericton an e-Learning hub of sorts in the spirit of [[Smartforce]] (a homegrown e-learning company which saw major downsizing after its heyday in the dot-com era, and later renamed [[SkillSoft]].) 

The city has been investing actively in IT infrastructure.  The City of Fredericton was recently the winner of the &quot;Judges Innovation Award&quot; at the 2004 C.I.P.A. (Canadian Information Productivity Awards) Awards  due to their &quot;Fred-eZone&quot; free municipality wide [[WiFi]] network initiative. This and other innovations by the city's [[utelco]], '''e-Novations''', lead world leading technology company [[Intel]] to do a case study on their successes.  Fred-eZone spans much of the city’s downtown, parts of surrounding residential areas as well as peripheral commercial areas such as Fredericton's Regent Mall.

Recently, the [[New Brunswick]] government has been seeking to attract more immigrants to the province (and consequently the Fredericton area) to increase the labour force and compensate for an aging population.

==Culture==
[[Image:Beaverbrook.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The Beaverbrook Art Gallery]]
Due to the presence of the two universities, Fredericton is more cosmopolitan than many cities its size.  This is reflected in cuisine offered by local ethnic restaurants (which include Mexican, Lebanese, Indian, Pakistani, Chinese, Caribbean, Italian, Brazilian, Japanese and Greek foods).  There are also several retail outlets that sell ethnic products and artifacts.

Fredericton is an important cultural centre of the region featuring art galleries, the [[New Brunswick College of Craft and Design]], museums and theatres which promote local artistic and literary talent.

Architecturally, Fredericton spans more than two centuries.  The city features an eclectic mix of buildings and residences ranging from classical Victorian style to modern office buildings and architecture.  Fredericton’s skyline is also distinguished by many historic churches.

===Arts===
The [[Beaverbrook Art Gallery]], a prestigious art gallery on the south bank of the Saint John River, is New Brunswick's provincial art gallery and maintains a collection of considerable quality.  The gallery was established and built in 1958 by British press baron [[Lord Beaverbrook]] as a gift to his native province where he was born and grew up. [[Gallery 78]], located across the street, features works by local artists.

The [[Fredericton Playhouse]] hosts plays and musicals throughout the year, and acts as the home base of [[Theatre New Brunswick]] (TNB) – the province’s largest stage troupe. The Playhouse also hosts visiting comedians and musical performances by Canadian and international artists. Officer's Square serves as a venue for outdoor concerts during the summer, featuring a variety of local and national talent.  During the winter, Officer's Square is transformed into an outdoor skating rink.

Every fall Fredericton hosts the [[Harvest Jazz and Blues Festival]] that transforms the mood of the city’s downtown by giving it a Jazz spark.  The week-long Harvest Jazz and Blues Festival draws artists from all over North America.

===Sports and Recreation===
There are no professional sports teams in Fredericton, although both universities have extensive athletic programs. The UNB Varsity Reds and St. Thomas Tommies are rivals in most sports, and their hockey games are called the &quot;Battle of the Hill&quot;. The [[American Hockey League]] was once represented in Fredericton, with the [[Fredericton Express]] playing between [[1981]] and [[1988]], and the [[Fredericton Canadiens]] between [[1991]] and [[1999]].

Fredericton has several parks, including [[Odell Park]] and [[Wilmot Park]]. [[Killarney Lake]] and nearby [[Mactaquac Provincial Park]] have small beaches which are popular in the summer. Skiing (and snowboarding in recent years) at nearby [[Crabbe Mountain]] is also a common winter activity among city residents.  There are also several cross-country skiing trails that cross the city. 

Fredericton is in the process of constructing two sports and leisure complexes which will have several hockey rinks as well as health club facilities and an indoor track.

==Government and Politics==
[[Image:NB_Legislature.jpg|thumb|right|300px|NB Legislative Building, seat of New Brunswick Government since 1882]]

===Administrative Structure===
Fredericton has a [[mayor-council]] and [[non-partisan]] form of government, with the mayor and council serving fixed four-year terms (three years until 2004), and elections held in May.  The last election was in 2004. The current mayor is [[Brad Woodside]], who first served from 1986 until 1999 but was re-elected in 2004 in a close race with city councillor Joel Richardson. 

The city is divided into twelve [[ward (politics)|wards]] (six on each side of the Saint John River), with each ward electing one councillor.  

The [[Boyce Farmer's Market]], open on Saturday mornings, is a place where municipal, provincial and federal politicians frequently visit to mingle with their electorate - something which has evolved into a political tradition. Local MP Andy Scott is a familiar fixture at the market on most Saturdays. 


===Municipal Politics in Fredericton===
The population of Fredericton largely consists of social conservatives - especially on issues regarding gay rights, same sex marriage, pornography/strip clubs/prostitution and abortion.  However, there is a large and active gay community in the city as well as two universities that introduce liberal/radical elements into the city's politics.  Political life in Fredericton is characterized by this cleavage between social conservatives and social liberals. Radical groups, based at the universities, sometimes hold demonstrations.

Woodside made a controversial decision in [[1997]] by refusing to proclaim [[Gay Pride Week]].  When ordered by the New Brunswick Human Rights Commission - upon complaint by gay rights activists led by Allison Brewer (now leader of the [[New Brunswick New Democratic Party]]) and Arlene Glencross - Woodside whispered the proclamation at a city council meeting.  He was then ordered again to proclaim gay pride week audibily which he did.  Woodside later quit as mayor to launch an unsuccessful bid as a [[Liberal Party of New Brunswick|Liberal]] candidate in [[Fredericton North]] in the [[New Brunswick general election, 1999|1999 provincial election]]. In [[New Brunswick municipal elections, 2004|2004]] he entered the mayoral race on the final day of nominations, and defeated incumbent Les Hull and councillor Joel Richardson.

Some notable councillors include long serving Tommy Jellinek of Ward 9 and former councillor Joel Richardson who narrowly missed winning the mayoral race in 2004.

===Fredericton and Provincial/Federal Politics===
Fredericton is divided into three provincial legislative districts: 
* [[Fredericton North]] - represented by Liberal Justice Critic [[T.J. Burke]] 
* [[Fredericton South]] - represented by Progressive Conservative [[Brad Green]] 
* [[Fredericton-Fort Nashwaak]] - represented by Liberal [[Kelly Lamrock]] 

Provincially, Fredericton elected progressive Conservatives from 1952 until electoral sweep of the Liberal Party in 1987 when they won every seat in New Brunswick under [[Frank McKenna]].  Since then there has been greater political alteration in the provincial electoral landscape in Fredericton.

In 1991, the anti-bilingual [[Confederation of Regions Party of New Brunswick|Confederation of Regions Party]] won the riding of Fredericton North (along with several other nearby ridings).  In 1999 Progressive Conservatives swept all three Fredericton area seats; however, in 2003, Fredericton-North and Fredericton-Fort Nashwaak returned to the Liberals.  [http://www.gnb.ca/elections/index-e.asp] 

Federally, the city forms most of the riding of [[Fredericton (electoral district)|Fredericton]].  This riding was formerly known as Fredericton-York-Sunbury but was redistributed prior to the 1997 general election.  From 1957 until 1993 Fredericton returned Progressive Conservatives.  However, since 1993, the riding has been represented by Liberal [[Andy Scott]].

The population of City of Fredericton is 47,560 (greater Fredericton 81,346, both per 2001 census), although unofficial reports more around 50,750 (greater Fredericton 84,523) due to the student population which is often not counted in official censuses.  Along with [[Moncton]] and [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], Fredericton is one of three Maritime cities to register a population growth in recent years.

===Ethnicity===
Fredericton's population is predominately white/caucasian.  However, a significant black minority has had a long presence in the city and live primarily in the Barker's Point borough.  As well, Willie O'Ree - first black player in the NHL - was from Fredericton.  The largest non-white ethnic group in Fredericton are Aboriginals who live primarily on the Saint Mary's Reserve located on the City's Northside.

The 1960s and 1970s began to see the influx of immigrants of Asian and Middle Eastern descent.  However, their numbers still remain small.  Since 2000, the city's universities - Saint Thomas University and the University of New Brunswick - have seen a growing number of students from overseas attending.  However, this population is not permanent and generally not counted in the census.

The ethnic breakdown of Fredericton is as follows:
*[[White]]: 75,555 or 97.4%
*[[mixed race]]: 640 or 0.8%
*[[overseas Chinese|Chinese]]: 440 or 0.5%
*[[Asian]]: 430 or 0.5%
*[[Black]]: 370 or 0.4%
* (single responses only)

===Religion===
Fredericton is a predominately Christian city with Protestants forming the largest denomination.  The city is notable for its many churches - a high number per capita in comparison to most other Canadian cities.  The small [[pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] Northeastern Christian college is located on the city's Northside.  While the Roman Catholic population is not as large, the city does boast the province's only Roman Catholic university - Saint Thomas University.  Recent issues at Saint Thomas University have concerned whether the university should adopt a more Catholic character.

Fredericton has a [[Judaism|Jewish]] synagogue, an [[Islam|Islamic]] mosque, and a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] temple as well.  The importance of these institutions has been growing in recent years warranting visits by prominent politicians in the area seeking election.  Fredericton is also distinguished by a sizeable and active [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] community. A [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] Fellowship has been serving Fredericton since 1960 as a place for people to find a liberal religious home.

The religious breakdown of Fredericton is as follows:
*52.0% [[Protestant]]
*29.6% [[Roman Catholic]]
*2.1% other [[Christian]]
*1.6% non-Christian
*17.4% non-religious

===Language===
While a predominately Anglophone city, the civil service has seen an increase in the City's francophone population.  This population is serviced by the Centre Communitaire de St. Anne (which include K-12 schooling, a radio station, a public library, and cultural centre).  As well, Fredericton is serviced by the francophone church located on Regent Street.

The linguistic breakdown of Fredericton is as follows:
*88.2% [[English language|English]]

In recent years, Fredericton has seen a growth in alternative and independent media newspapers.

==Transportation==
===Airport===
Air service is provided out of the [[Greater Fredericton Airport]], located approximately 15 [[kilometre]]s east of downtown in [[Lincoln, New Brunswick|Lincoln]].

      <comment>/* Laureates */ Removing false info. the 2006 Fields Medals will not be awarded until the summer!</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The ''' Fields Medal''' is a prize awarded to up to four [[mathematician]]s (not over forty years of age) at each [[International Congress of Mathematicians|International Congress]] of [[International Mathematical Union]] (therefore once every four years), since [[1936]] and regularly since [[1950]] at the initiative of the Canadian mathematician [[John Charles Fields]]. The purpose is to give recognition and support to young mathematical researchers having already made important contributions. 

The Fields Medal is often described as the &quot;[[Nobel Prize]] of mathematics&quot;. The comparison is not very accurate, in particular because the age limit is applied strictly. Fields Medals are awarded for a body of work, rather than for a particular result, though there is clearly consensus that some individual theorems can and should be recognised in this way. (That is not to say that some awards from the past have not been in some ways contentious or controversial&amp;mdash;they have.) 

Since the institution of the [[Wolf Prize]]s in [[1978]], there has been a high-profile &quot;lifetime achievement&quot; award in mathematics; this has to some extent redressed perceived imbalances in the weight given to different kinds of merit and the movements of intellectual fashion across mathematics as a whole. 

In 2003, the first [[Abel Prize]] was awarded - this award, established by the Norwegian government, is specifically intended as a &quot;mathematics Nobel&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:the_trial.jpg|thumb|200px|The Trial book cover]]
'''''The Trial''''' (German '''''Der Prozess''''') is a [[surrealism|surreal]] novel by [[Franz Kafka]] about a character named ''[[Joseph K.]]'', who awakens one morning and, for reasons never revealed, is arrested and subjected to the rigours of the judicial process for an unspecified crime.

Like Kafka's other novels, ''The Trial'' was left unfinished at his death, and was never intended to be published.  Its manuscript was rescued by his friend [[Max Brod]].  It was first published in [[German language|German]] in [[1925]] as ''Der Prozess''.

''[[The Trial (1962 film)|The Trial]]'' has been filmed by the director [[Orson Welles]], with [[Anthony Perkins]] (as Josef K.) and [[Romy Schneider]].  A more recent [[remake]] featured [[Kyle MacLachlan]] in the same role. In [[1999]] it was adapted for comics by the [[Italian people|Italian]] artist [[Guido Crepax]].

== Plot Synopsis by Chapter ==

{{spoiler}}

=== The Arrest - Conversation with Frau Grubach then Fräulein Bürstner ===
On the morning of his thirtieth birthday, a junior bank manager, Josef K., who lives in lodgings, is unexpectedly arrested by two unidentified agents for an unspecified crime.  The agents do not name the authority for which they are acting.  He is not taken away, but left at home to await instructions from the Interrogation Commission.  That evening K misses his regular visit to a prostitute, Elsa.

K's landlady, Frau Grubach tries to console Josef but unintentionally offends him by speculating that perhaps the arrest was related to an illicit relationship with Fräulein Bürstner, K's neighbor. Josef visits Fräulein to discuss his plight, but ends up kissing  her - belatedly fulfilling the landlady's speculation. This is an early indication that Josef is no longer in control of his fate.

=== First Interrogation ===
K is instructed to appear at a local court, but the time of the trial is not specified.  This causes him to waste his time waiting to be called.  When he is finally called, he is told, confusingly, that he is late.  As the interrogation begins, he is asked an ill-informed question, which he uses as the basis for his attack on the preceding events and the general competence of the court.  As he leaves, the Examining Magistrate tells K that &quot;...today you have flung away with your own hand all the advantages which an interrogation invariably confers on an accused man.&quot;

=== In the Empty Interrogation Chamber - The Student - The Offices ===
Josef K tries to visit the Examining Magistrate, but finds only the Law-Court Attendant's wife.  Looking at the Magistrate's books, he  finds that they are not law books, but pornography.  The woman tries to seduce him.  As Josef resolves to succumb to the woman as an act of defiance against the Court, a law student appears and, after an argument with Josef, carries the woman off in his arms.

Josef later spots the Attendant, who complains about his wife's wantonness and offers Josef a tour of the court offices.  There are many other defendants waiting hopelessly for information about their cases.  Josef struggles to cope with the &quot;dull and heavy...hardly breathable&quot; air, and almost faints.  To his shame, he has to be carried out of the court by two officials.

=== Fräulein Bürstner's Friend ===
Josef returns home to find Fräulein Montag, a lodger from another room, moving in with Fräulein Bürstner.  He suspects that this is to prevent him from pursuing his affair with the latter woman.  Yet another lodger, Captain Lanz, appears to be in league with Montag.
=== The Whipper ===
Later, in a store room at his own bank, Josef K discovers the two agents who arrested him being whipped by a superior.  This surreal event appears to have been staged for his viewing, either to simply frighten him, or to demonstrate the seriousness in which the court views incompetence and corruption. The next day he returns to the store room and is shocked to find everything as he left it, including the Whipper and the two agents.

=== K.'s Uncle - Leni ===
Josef K is visited by his influential uncle, who by coincidence is a friend of the Clerk of the Court.  The uncle is, or appears to be, distressed by Josef's predicament and is at first sympathetic, but becomes concerned that K is underestimating the seriousness of the case.  The uncle introduces Josef K to an Advocate, who is attended by Leni, a nurse.  K visits Leni, whilst his uncle is talking with the Advocate and the Chief Clerk of the Court, much to his uncle's anger, and to the detriment of his case.

=== Advocate - Manufacturer - Painter ===
K visits the advocate and finds him to be a capricious and unhelpful character.  K returns to his bank but finds that his colleagues are trying to undermine him.

Josef K is advised by one of his bank clients to visit Titorelli, a painter, for advice.  Titorelli has no official connections, yet seems to have a deep understanding of the process.  He explains: &quot;You see, everything belongs to the Court.&quot;  He sets out what K's options are, but the consequences of all of them are unpleasant.  The laborious requirements of these options, and the limited outlook that they offer, lead the reader to lose hope for Josef K.

=== The Commercial Traveller - Dismissal of the Advocate ===
Josef K decides to take control of his own destiny and visits his advocate with the intention of dismissing him.  At the advocate's office he meets a downtrodden individual, Block, a client who offers K some insight from a client's perspective.  Block's case has continued for five years, yet he appears to have been virtually enslaved by his dependence on the advocate's unpredictable advice. This experience further poisons K's opinion of his advocate, and K is bemused as to why his advocate would think that seeing such a client, in such a state, could change his mind.

=== In The Cathedral ===
K has to show an important client from Italy around the Cathedral.  The client doesn't show, but just as K is leaving the Cathedral, the priest calls out K's name, although K has never known the priest.  The priest works for the court, and tells K a fable, also published separately as Before the Law that is meant to explain his situation, but instead causes confusion, and implies that K's fate is hopeless.  The gravity of the priest's words prepares the reader for an unpleasant ending.

===The End===
On the last day of Josef K's thirtieth year, two men arrive to execute him. He offers little resistance, suggesting that he has realised this as being inevitable for some time.  They lead him to a quarry where he is expected to kill himself, but he cannot. The two men then execute him.  His last words describe his own death: &quot;Like a dog!&quot;.

==Evaluation==
''The Trial'' is a chilling story that maintains a constant, relentless atmosphere of unease, right up to the brutal ending. Superficially the subject matter is political; an illustration of a truly twisted brand of law enforcement.  However, one of the strengths of the novel is in its description of the effect of these circumstances on the life and mind of Josef K. It presents the absurdity of human nature, of drudging along without direction, and without result. It can also be considered allegorically in a number of  frameworks, for example, emotional. If it were published today, it might be described as a &quot;[[paranoid thriller]]&quot;, but it is unusually uncompromising and depressing by modern standards.
&lt;p&gt;When analyzing ''The Trial'', it is important to note that the end of the novel, the death scene, was the first part written by Kafka.  This is what in part gives Josef K.'s trial and ultimate conviction a sense of inevitability, greatly adding to the paranoia of the text.  Josef K. is never told what he is on trial for, and he maintains his innocence throughout.  What becomes clear to the reader is that Josef K. is on trial precisely for his innocence; for to be human is to be guilty.  By admitting his basic guilt as a human being, perhaps Josef K. could have freed himself from the proceedings.  Then again, the trial against K. was set up because he was incapable of admitting his guilt, and, by extension, his humanity.
&lt;p&gt;Another way to evaluate ''The Trial'' is to consider what [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] has to say about it in his book ''[[Anti-Semite and Jew]]: An Exploration of the Etiology of Hate''. As the title suggests, the book relates the way Jews receive a world marred with [[anti-Semitism]]. That Jewish life in such a world, Sartre argues, is similar to the way Joseph K experienced it, and the way Kafka may have experienced it as well. According to Sartre:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is perhaps one of the meanings of ''The Trial'' by the Jew, Kafka. Like the hero of that novel, the Jew is engaged in a long trial. He does not know his judges, scarcely even his lawyers; he does not know what he is charged with, yet he knows that he is considered guilty; judgment is continually put off -- for a week, two weeks -- he takes advantage of these delays to improve his position in a thousand ways, but every precaution taken at random pushes him a little deeper into guilt. His external situation may appear brilliant, but the interminable trial invisibly wastes him away, and it happens sometimes, as in the novel, that men seize him, carry him off on the pretense that he has lost his case, and murder him in some vague area of the suburbs.&quot; [88, Schocken Books].&lt;/p&gt;

==Comparisons with other works==
{{spoiler}}
The novel with the most obvious resemblance to ''The Trial'' is [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' ([[1949]]).  Both tales describe the struggle of an ordinary man against a faceless [[bureaucracy]]. Each tale also concludes with, in one way or another, the protagonist accepting (or simply feeling resigned to) his fate.

==Relations between ''The Trial'' and ''Crime and Punishment''==

In [[1983]] Guillermo Sánchez Trujillo, professor of UNAULA (&quot;Universidad Autónoma Latinoamericana&quot; of [[Medellín]], [[Colombia]]), decided to retake the project he had in his youth to find out &quot;where did Kafka get his stories&quot;. He dedicated twenty years of his life to the investigations, and finally in [[2002]] he published the final results in ''Crimen y castigo de Franz Kafka, anatomía de El proceso'' (&quot;Crime and Punishment by Franz Kafka, anatomy of The Trial&quot;), edited by UNAULA.

In his investigation, Sánchez discovered that Kafka had used ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' and other works by [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], as [[palimpsest]] to write his works, including ''The Trial''. By comparing word-to-word ''Crime and Punishment'' and ''The Trial'', Sanchez discovered that Kafka used the first three chapters of the second part of Crime and Punishment (in the order 3, 2, 1), to write and organize ''The Trial''. With this, Sánchez also discovered the order of the chapters of the novel, which has been a mystery due to the cryptic way in which Kafka stored the chapters. Kafka bequeathed his works to his friend [[Max Brod]]. After Kafka died, Brod started to organize and edit Kafka's works to publish them, but with ''The Trial'' Brod couldn't decipher Kafka's system, so he organized the chapters in an intuitive and arbitrary way.

The new order found in the study reestablishes the logic of the plot and fits on it the chapters that were relegated to the appendix by Brod and the editors. But the study also finds that the work ''[[A Dream]]'', published as an independent short story, was an essential chapter of the novel.

The investigation also confirmed the [[autobiography|autobiographic]] contents that Kafka put in the novel, and the identity of the real persons and the historical events that inspired some of the characters and events of the novel.

A critic edition of the novel with the new order was published in [[2005]] by UNAULA, containing an introduction detailing the most important points of the investigation and its results and also, side notes explaining the creative process of the author and the use of the palimpsest of Dostoevsky's works.

The following is the new order of the chapters:
# The Arrest
# Conversation with Frau Grubach then Fräulein Bürstner
# B.’s Friend
# Initial Inquiry
# In the Empty Courtroom - The Student - The Offices
# The Flogger
# To Elsa

# Lawyer- Manufacturer - Painter

'''''The Metamorphosis''''' (in [[German language|German]], '''''Die Verwandlung''''') is a [[novella]] by [[Franz Kafka]], first published in [[1915]], and arguably the most famous of his works along with the longer works ''[[The Trial]]'' and ''[[The Castle]]''. The story begins with a traveling salesman, [[Gregor Samsa]], waking to find himself transformed into a giant insect-like creature (see [[#Lost in translation|Lost in translation]], below).  It is widely regarded as a highly symbolic tale with various [[#Interpretations|interpretations]]. 

==The storyline==

{{spoiler}}

The story is sometimes comic &amp;ndash; for example, near the start, Gregor's main concern is that, despite what has happened, he must nevertheless get to work on time.

Gregor is unable to speak in his insect form, and never successfully communicates with his family at all after his physical appearance is revealed to them. However, he seems to retain his thinking faculties, which is unknown to his family. 

Curiously, his condition does not arouse a sense of surprise or incredulity in the eyes of his family, who merely despise it as an indication of impending burden.  However, most of the story revolves around his interactions with his family, with whom he lives, and their shock, denial, and repulsion whenever he reveals his physical condition.  Horrified by his appearance, they take to shutting Gregor into his room, but do try to care for him by providing him food and water. The sister takes charge of caring for Gregor, initially working hard to make him comfortable. Nevertheless, they seem to want as little to do with him as possible.  The sister and mother shrink back whenever he reveals himself, and Gregor's father pelts him with apples when he emerges from his room one day.  One of the apples becomes imbedded in his back, causing an infection.

Time passes as, confined to his room, Gregor's only activities are looking out of his window, and crawling up the walls and over the ceiling.  Financial hardship befalls the family, and the sister's caretaking deteriorates.  Devoid of human contact, one day Gregor emerges to the sound of his sister's violin in the hopes to get his much-loved sister to join him in his room and play her violin for him.  But her rejection of him is total, when she says to the family:

:''We must try to get rid of it. We've done everything humanly possible to take care of it and to put up with it, no one can blame us in the least.''

The sister then determines with finality that the insect is no longer Gregor, since Gregor would have left them out of love and taken their burden away.  Gregor returns to his room, lies down, and dies from neglect and infection caused by the festering apple his father threw at him months before.

The point of view shifts as, upon discovery of his corpse, the family feel an enormous burden has been lifted from them, and start planning for the future again. Fantastically, the family suddenly discovers that they aren't doing bad at all, both socially and financially, and the brief process of forgetting Gregor and shutting him from their lives is quickly accomplished.

==Interpretation==

As with all of Kafka's works, ''The Metamorphosis'' is open to a wide range of interpretations; in fact, [[Stanley Corngold]]'s book, ''The Commentator's Despair'', lists over 130 interpretations. Most obvious are themes relating to society's treatment of those who are different. Other themes include the loneliness of being cut off and the desperate and unrealistic hopes that such isolation brings.

Some also feel the book deals with the absurdity of human existence, leading some literary critics to associate it with [[existentialism]]. &lt;!-- weasel term?  feel free to remove preceding sentence moved down from intro. - AySz88, 01:53, 3 October 2005 (UTC) --&gt;  It is also possible to apply [[Freud]]ian and other forms of [[literary criticism]] to the book.

==Lost in translation==
The [[opening line]] of the book is famous in English:

:''As Gregor Samsa woke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a monstrous insect.''

However, [[Dagomba|Mossi-Dagomba]]-speaking tribes of the northern and upper regions. [[English language|English]], the official and commercial language, is taught in all the schools.

Primary and junior secondary school education is tuition-free and mandatory. The Government of Ghana support for basic education is unequivocal. Article 39 of the Constitution mandates the major tenets of the free, compulsory, universal basic education (FCUBE) initiative. Launched in 1996, it is one of the most ambitious pre-tertiary education programs in West Africa. Since 1987, the Government of Ghana has increased its education budget by 700%. Basic education's share has grown from 45% to 60% of that total.

Students begin their 6-year primary education at age six. Under educational reforms implemented in 1987, they pass into a junior secondary school system for 3 years of academic training combined with technical and vocational training. Those continuing move into the 3-year senior secondary school program. Entrance to one of the five Ghanaian universities is by examination following completion of senior secondary school. School enrollment totals almost 3 million.

      <text xml:space="preserve">By [[West Africa]]n standards, [[Ghana]] has a diverse and rich resource base. The country is mainly [[agricultur]]al, however, with a majority of its workers engaged in farming. Cash crops consist primarily of [[cocoa]] and cocoa products,which typically provide about two-thirds of export revenues, timber products, [[coconut]]s and other palm products, [[shea nut]]s, which produce an edible fat, and [[coffee]]. Ghana also has established a successful program of nontraditional agricultural products for export, including [[pineapple]]s, [[cashew]]s, and [[black pepper|pepper]]. [[Cassava]], [[yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[plantain]]s, [[maize]], [[rice]], [[peanut]]s, [[millet]], and [[sorghum]] are the basic foodstuffs. Fish, poultry, and meat also are important dietary staples.

Minerals -- principally [[gold]], [[diamond]]s, [[manganese]] ore, and [[bauxite]] -- are produced and exported. The only commercial oil well has been closed after producing 3.5 million barrels (560,000 m&amp;sup3;) over its seven-year life, but signs of [[natural gas]] are being studied for power generation, while exploration continues for other oil and gas resources.

Ghana's industrial base is relatively advanced compared to many other African countries. Import-substitution industries include textiles; [[steel]] (using scrap); tires; oil refining; flour milling; beverages; [[tobacco]]; simple consumer goods; and car, truck, and bus assembly.

Tourism has become one of Ghana's largest foreign income earners (ranking third in 1997), and the Ghanaian Government has placed great emphasis upon further tourism support and development.

==Independence==
At independence, Ghana had a substantial physical and [[social infrastructure]] and $481 million in foreign reserves. The [[Kwame Nkrumah|Nkrumah]] government further developed the infrastructure and made important public investments in the industrial sector. With assistance from the [[United States]], the [[World Bank]], and the [[United Kingdom]], construction of the [[Akosombo Dam]] was completed on the [[Volta River]] in 1966. Two U.S. companies built [[Valco]], Africa's largest [[aluminium]] smelter, to use power generated at the dam. Aluminium exports from Valco are a major source of foreign exchange for Ghana.

Many Nkrumah-era investments were monumental public works projects and poorly conceived, badly managed agricultural and industrial schemes. With cocoa prices falling and the country's foreign exchange reserves fast disappearing, the government resorted to supplier credits to finance many projects. By the mid-1960s, Ghana's reserves were gone, and the country could not meet repayment schedules. To rationalize, the National Liberation Council abandoned unprofitable projects, and some inefficient state-owned enterprises were sold to private investors. On three occasions, Ghana's creditors agreed to reschedule repayments due on Nkrumah-era supplier credits. Led by the United States, foreign donors provided import loans to enable the foreign exchange-strapped government to import essential commodities.

==Busia government==
Prime Minister Busia's government (1969-72) liberalized controls to attract foreign investment and to encourage domestic entrepreneurship. Investors were cautious, however, and cocoa prices began declining again while imports surged, precipitating a serious trade deficit. Despite considerable foreign assistance and some debt relief, the Busia regime also was unable to overcome the inherited restraints on growth posed by the debt burden, balance-of-payments imbalances, foreign exchange shortages, and mismanagement.

Although foreign aid helped prevent economic collapse and was responsible for subsequent improvements in many sectors, the economy stagnated in the 10-year period preceding the NRC takeover in 1972. Population growth offset the modest increase in gross domestic product, and real earnings declined for many Ghanaians.

==Acheampong government==
To restructure the economy, the NRC, under General Acheampong (1972-78), undertook an austerity program that emphasized self-reliance, particularly in food production. These plans were not realized, however, primarily because of post-1973 oil price increases and a drought in 1975-77 that particularly affected northern Ghana. The NRC, which had inherited foreign debts of almost $1 billion, abrogated existing rescheduling arrangements for some debts and rejected other repayments. After creditors objected to this unilateral action, a 1974 agreement rescheduled the medium-term debt on liberal terms. The NRC also imposed the Investment Policy Decree of 1975--effective on January 1977--that required 51% Ghanaian equity participation in most foreign firms, but the government took 40% in specified industries. Many shares were sold directly to the public.

==Akuffo government==
Continued mismanagement of the economy, record inflation (more than 100% in 1977), and increasing corruption, notably at the highest political levels, led to growing dissatisfaction. The post-July 1978 military regime led by General Akuffo attempted to deal with Ghana's economic problems by making small changes in the overvalued cedi and by restraining government spending and monetary growth. Under a one-year standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in January 1979, the government promised to undertake economic reforms, including a reduction of the budget deficit, in return for a $68 million IMF support program and $27 million in IMF Trust Fund loans. The agreement became inoperative, however, after the [[4 June]] coup that brought Flight Lieutenant Rawlings and the AFRC to power for 4 months.

==Limann government==
In September 1979, the civilian government of Hilla Limann inherited declining per capita income; stagnant industrial and agricultural production due to inadequate imported supplies; shortages of imported and locally produced goods; a sizable budget deficit (almost 40% of expenditures in 1979); high inflation, &quot;moderating&quot; to 54% in 1979; an increasingly overvalued cedi; flourishing smuggling and other black-market activities; unemployment and underemployment, particularly among urban youth; deterioration in the transport network; and continued foreign exchange constraints.

Limann's PNP government announced yet another (2-year) reconstruction program, emphasizing increased food production and productivity, exports, and transport improvements. Import austerity was imposed and external payments arrears cut. However, declining cocoa production combined with falling cocoa prices, while oil prices soared. No effective measures were taken to reduce rampant corruption and black marketing.

==Rawlings government==
When Rawlings again seized power at the end of 1981, cocoa output had fallen to half the 1970-71 level and its world price to one-third the 1975 level. By 1982, oil would constitute half of Ghana's imports, while overall trade contracted greatly. Internal transport had slowed to a crawl, and inflation remained high. During Rawlings' first year, the economy was stagnant. Industry ran at about 10% of capacity due to the chronic shortage of foreign exchange to cover the importation of required raw materials and replacement parts. Economic conditions deteriorated further in early 1983 when Nigeria expelled an estimated 1 million Ghanaians who had to be absorbed by Ghana.

In April 1983, in coordination with the IMF, the PNDC launched an economic recovery program, perhaps the most stringent and consistent of its day in Africa, aimed at reopening infrastructural bottlenecks and reviving moribund productive sectors--agriculture, mining, and timber. The largely distorted exchange rate and prices were realigned to encourage production and exports. Increased fiscal and monetary discipline was imposed to curb inflation and to focus on priorities. Through November 1987, the cedi was devalued by more than 6,300%, and widespread direct price controls were substantially reduced.

==Returning refugees==
The economy's response to these reforms was initially hampered by the absorption of one million returnees from Nigeria, the onset of the worst drought since independence, which brought on widespread bushfires and forced closure of the aluminium smelter and severe power cuts for industry and decline in foreign aid. In 1985, the country absorbed an additional 100,000 expellees from Nigeria. In 1987, cocoa prices began declining again; however, initial infrastructural repairs, improved weather, and producer incentives and support revived output in the early 1990s. During 1984-88 the economy experienced solid growth for the first time since 1978. Renewed exports, aid inflows, and a foreign exchange auction have eased hard currency constraints.

==IMF support==
Since an initial August 1983 IMF standby agreement, the economic recovery program has been supported by three IMF standbys and two other credits totaling $611 million, $1.1 billion from the World Bank, and hundreds of millions of dollars more from other donors. In November 1987, the IMF approved a $318-million, 3-year extended fund facility. The second phase (1987-90) of the recovery program concentrated on economic restructuring and revitalizing social services. The third phase, focused on financial transparency and macroeconomic stability is scheduled for March 1998.

Ghana intends to achieve its goals of accelerated economic growth, improved quality of life for all Ghanaians, and reduced poverty through macroeconomic stability, higher private investment, broad-based social and rural development, as well as direct poverty-alleviation efforts. These plans are fully supported by the international donor community and have been forcefully reiterated in the 1995 government report, Ghana: Vision 2020. Privatization of state-owned enterprises continues, with about two-thirds of 300 parastatal enterprises sold to private owners. Other reforms adopted under the government's structural adjustment program include the elimination of exchange rate controls and the lifting of virtually all restrictions on imports. The establishment of an interbank foreign exchange market has greatly expanded access to foreign exchange.

The medium-term macroeconomic forecast assumes political stability, successful economic stabilization, and the implementation of a policy agenda for private sector growth, and adequate public spending on social services and rural infrastructure. The ninth Consultative Group Meeting for Ghana ended [[5 November]] [[1997]] after deliberations in Paris. Twenty-four countries and donor entities were represented at this meeting called by the World Bank on behalf of the Ghanaian Government. The World Bank announced that, of the targeted disbursement level of $1.6 billion sought from the donor community for 1998-99, they foresaw only a $150 million shortfall in commitments, and that this shortfall would be easily realized should Ghana rapidly enact its macroeconomic program.

The government repealed a 17.% value-added tax (VAT) shortly after its introduction in 1995, which resulted in wide-spread public protests. The government reverted to several previously imposed taxes, including a sales tax. The government has set in motion a program to reintroduce a VAT bill, with implementation in 1998 after an extensive public education campaign.

'''George Mason University''', also referred to by locals and students as simply &quot;Mason&quot; or &quot;GMU,&quot; is an institution of [[university|higher learning]] in the [[Commonwealth]] of [[Virginia]], with campuses in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], [[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax]], and [[Prince William County, Virginia]], all in the [[suburb|suburbs]] of [[Washington, DC]]. In the fall of 2005 the university opened a site in [[Loudoun County, Virginia]] and announced several months later, the acquisition of 133 acres of land to build a fourth suburban campus that is scheduled to open in 2009. The university is named after [[United States|American]] [[American Revolution|revolutionary]], [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriot]] and [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding father]] [[George Mason]]. 

Its faculty boasts [[Nobel Prize]]-winning [[economics|economists]] [[James M. Buchanan]] (1986) and [[Vernon Smith]] (2002). Another economics professor, [[Walter Williams]], is well-known as a syndicated columnist and occasional guest host of the [[Rush Limbaugh]] radio show. The [[law school]] is ranked among the top 50 in the United States, and the [[Industrial/Organizational Psychology]] graduate program is consistently ranked in the top ten in the nation. 

The school is ranked by [[Princeton Review]] as the most diverse university in the nation. The school has students from more than 135 countries and recently opened a international campus in the [[Ras Al Khaimah]] emirate of the [[United Arab Emirates]].

While today, Mason is relatively young, it has grown rapidly, reaching an enrollment in 2005 of 29,728 students and has become the largest public university in the state of Virginia. The University's stated goal is to become the major public research university of the [[Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area|U.S. national capital area]].

The school's sports teams are called Patriots.  The university's men's and women's sports teams participate in the [[NCAA]]'s Division I, and are in the [[Colonial Athletic Association]]. The school's colors are green and gold. The university's student publication is [[Broadside (newspaper)]].

The George Mason University logo, originally designed in 1982, was updated in 2004 to reflect the changes the university has undergone since that time.


==History==
The university can trace its roots back to the [[1950s]] when the Virginia state legislature passed a resolution, in January of [[1956]], to establish a branch college of the [[University of Virginia]] in Northern Virginia.  In September of [[1957]] the new college opened its doors to seventeen students. All of whom enrolled as freshmen in a renovated elementary school building at [[Bailey's Crossroads]]. John Norville Gibson Finley, served as Director of the new branch, which was known as University College.

The [[City of Fairfax, Virginia]], then the Town of Fairfax, purchased and donated 150 acres of land to the University of Virginia for the college's new location, which was referred to as the Fairfax Campus.  The Board of Visitors of UVa selected a permanent name for the college: George Mason College of the [[University of Virginia]] in [[1959]]. The Fairfax campus construction planning that began in early 1960 showed visible results when the development of the first forty acres of Fairfax Campus began in 1962.  In the Fall of 1964 the new campus welcomed 356 students.  

Local jurisdictions of [[Fairfax County]], [[Arlington County]], and the cities of [[Alexandria]] and [[Falls Church]] agreed to appropriate $3 million to purchase land adjacent to GMC to provide for a 600 acre Fairfax Campus in [[1966]] with the intention that the institution would expand into a regional university of major proportions, including the granting of graduate degrees.

On April 7, [[1972]] the Virginia General Assembly enacted legislation which separated George Mason College from its parent institution, the [[University of Virginia]].  Renamed that day by the legislation, GMC became George Mason University.  

In [[1979]] Mason opened its law school in [[Arlington, VA]] and moved all of its athletic programs to [[NCAA]] Division I.  Enrollment that year passed 11,000.  The university opened its Arlington campus in 1982, two blocks from the Ballston Metro stop in [[Arlington, VA]]

In [[1986]] the university's governing body, the Board of Visitors, approved a new master plan for the year based on an enrollment of 20,000 full-time students with housing for 5,000 students by 1995.  That same year university housing opened to bring the total number of residential students to 700.

Through a bequest of Russian immigrant Shelley Krasnow the University established the Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study in [[1991]]. The Institute was created to further the understanding of the mind and intelligence by combining the fields of cognitive psychology, neurobiology, and artificial intelligence.

In [[1992]] GMU's new Prince William Institute begins classes in a temporary site [[Manassas, Virginia]]. The Institute moved to a permanent 124-acre site located on the Rt. 234 bypass, ten miles south of Manasss, by the year 1997, and is known as Prince William Campus.  The university graduates more than 5,000 students that following Spring.

In [[2002]] Mason celebrated its 30th anniversary of independence from the [[University of Virginia]] and launched its first capital campaign with a goal to raise $110 million.

By [[2005]] the George Mason University is [[Virginia]]'s largest institution of higher education with an enrollment of more than 29,000.  The capital campaign announces it raised more than $135 million.  New master plan released indicating university enrollment to reach 35,000 students by 2011 with more than 7000 residential students.

== Points of Interest ==
George Mason University has greatly expanded the scope of the university by hiring very well-known and influential professors to work at the University.  The University's [http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/ economics department] alone has two professors who have won the [[Nobel Prize]]: [[James M. Buchanan]] and [[Vernon Smith]]. The College of Liberal Arts and Human Science includes history professor, [[Roger Wilkins]], who shared the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for coverage of the [[Watergate scandal]] with [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] while he was working at the Washington Post and [[Frank Sesno]], the former CNN anchor, who is a professor of Communication.

The university has additional strength in the basic and applied sciences with critical mass in [[proteomics]], [[neuroscience]] and [[Computer science|computational sciences]]. Research support comes to Mason faculty from such agencies as the [[National Institutes of Health]], [[NASA]], the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]].

Mason is also known for its top tier graduate program in [[Industrial/Organizational Psychology]], which is currently ranked sixth by ''[[US News and World Report]]''.

Mason was awarded $25 million, in 2005, from the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] (NIAID), part of the [[National Institutes of Health]], for construction of a Regional Biocontainment Laboratory at the Prince William Campus in Manassas. 

Mason also operates the popular [[Ropes course|Ropes/Challenge Course]] in the United States (~20,000 participants per year) at its [http://www.Hemlockoverlook.org/ Hemlock Overlook Center for Outdoor Education]

==Campus Grounds==
George Mason University is spread across three locations, but its history began at the main Fairfax campus in the early 60's when it was a satellite location to the [[University of Virginia]]. Four buildings were constructed around a lawn which include the East Building, West Building, Krug and Finley Hall. The first four structures, today dubbed &quot;The Original Four,&quot; &quot;around a lawn&quot; were understood as a clear reference to the buildings around The Lawn of the [[University of Virginia]] in [[Charlottesville.]] In addition, in the words of the architects, the architecture of the buildings was meant to reflect Jeffersonian influence through the use of red brick with buff colored mortar, white vertical columns, and sloped shingled roofs. 
[[Image:Kerrystage.jpg|thumb|280px|right|2004:John Kerry giving a speech in the Johnson Center]]

Master plans were developed to incorporate further development which saw new additions such as Fenwick Library and Lecture Hall. By 1979. the masterplan was developed by the firm of Sasaki &amp; Associates which continued to work alongside the unversity in the years that followed. Student housing first became available in 1977. The 1980's saw the biggest expansion with new buildings being added on each year including the Patriot Center. George W. Johnson Learning Center was opened at the end of the academic year 1995/96 to coincide with the date of the retirement of the fourth president of George Mason University whose name the Center bears. It includes an extension of the university library, radio station, movie theater, art studio, bank, main food court and university offices spread across four floors.

Recent years have seen the most activity on campus. Innovation Hall, a new academic building began usage in 2003.
Housing units (Liberty Square, Potomac Heights) were opened in 2004 to accomodate an unprecedented amount of demand from students.  Fall 2005 saw the number of residential students surpass 4100. The Sandy Creek parking deck was recently opened, while a research building is scheduled to open in June 2006. Research I will be a four-story 100,000 s.f. facility that will include faculty offices and instructional and research laboratories. It will include a semi-detached tower that will house the Astronomy Department’s rooftop telescope. 

However, the university unveiled an ambitious plan last summer for the largest development to date on campus; the Northeast Sector. Work has begun and buildings are scheduled to open in phases, but all should be complete by 2008. Planned and executed as a design-build effort, the 450,000 SF mixed-use development consists of:
 
*Five multistory residence buildings, at 5 to 6 floors each, supporting a total of 1,030 beds. 
*Exhibition-style dining facility with a capacity to seat over 500 diners. 
*Fitness center with cardio, weight training, and indoor basketball and racquetball courts. 
*Retail operations that will include a coffee house/convenience store and wood-fired pizza and pasta restaurant. 
*Various recreation and office spaces.


==Athletics==
The Patriots began to move from NAIA and NCAA Division II status into the NCAA Division I ranks with men’s basketball in the 1978-79 season. Within a few years, all other sports also were elevated to Division I status. George Mason reached its current level of 22 varsity sports (11 for men, 11 for women) with the addition of women’s lacrosse (1993-94), women’s rowing (1997-98) and men’s and women’s swimming &amp; diving (1999-2000).  George Mason is a founding member of the [[Colonial Athletic Association]] and joined during the conference inception in [[1985]].

George Mason has been very successful at the NCAA Division I level, producing national champions in women’s soccer in 1985 (defeating perennial power [[University of North Carolina]]) and men’s indoor track &amp; field in 1996. 

The men’s volleyball team has reached the NCAA “Final Four” championship round on three occasions, and the men’s and women’s soccer, baseball and women’s volleyball teams have advanced to NCAA regional play on numerous occasions. 

In the [[Colonial Athletic Association]], George Mason has won a total of 42 championships in baseball (2), men’s basketball (3), women’s cross country (4), men’s soccer (4), women’s soccer (1), women’s swimming &amp; diving (4), men’s track &amp; field (3), women’s track &amp; field (9 straight from 1990-98), women’s volleyball (7, including 5 in a row from 1992-96) and wrestling (5).

Overall, a total of 23 George Mason student-athletes have claimed 35 individual national championships, 13 George Mason teams have made more than 117 NCAA postseason appearances, Patriot student-athletes have earned national All-America honors 300+ times and have captured 280 individual CAA championshipsto garner academic player of the year in baseball.

===Men's Basketball===
While many of the school's athletic programs have had historical seasons the men's basketball program remains the flagship sport at the university.  The men's basketball team has played at the [[Patriot Center]] since 1985 and played the prior years in the PE Building on the west side of the Fairfax Campus.  The men's basketball team has made the NCAA tournament three times (1989, 1999 and 2001) and the NIT tournament three times (1986, 2002 and 2004).  The programs largest rivals include conference foes [[UNC Wilmington]], [[Old Dominion University]], [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] and [[James Madison University]].  

The most well-known player in Patriot's history is George Evans, who played from 1997-01 and was a CAA player of year three consecutive seasons.  He shares the CAA record with [[NBA]] legend [[David Robinson]] for winning the award three straight times. Other Patriot greats include, Andre Gaddy, Carlos Yates, Kenny Sanders, Robert Dykes, Rob Rose, Jason Miskiri, Jai Lewis, and Tony Skinn. 

The head coach of the Patriots is [[Jim Larranaga]].  He has been the coach since the 1997-98 season and is the winningest coach in CAA history and school history.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about grammar from a linguistic perspective. For English grammar rules, see [[English grammar]] or [[Disputed English grammar]]''

{{linguistics}}
'''Grammar''' is the study of [[rule]]s governing the use of [[language]]. The set of rules governing a particular language is also called the '''grammar''' of the language; thus, each language can be said to have its own distinct grammar. Grammar is part of the general study of language called [[linguistics]].

The subfields of contemporary grammar are [[phonetics]], [[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and [[pragmatics]].  Traditional grammars include only [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]].

==Types of grammar==
* A [[prescription and description|prescriptive grammar]] presents authoritative norms for a particular language, and tends to deprecate non-standard constructions. Traditional grammars are typically prescriptive. Prescriptive grammars are usually based on the [[prestige dialect]]s of a [[speech community]], and often specifically condemn certain constructions which are common only among lower [[socioeconomic]] groups, such as the use of &quot;[[ain't]]&quot; and [[double negative]]s in [[English language|English]]. Though prescriptive grammars remain common in [[pedagogy]] and foreign [[language teaching]], they have fallen out of favor in modern academic [[linguistics]], as they describe only a subset of actual language usage. 
*A [[Prescription and description|descriptive grammar]] attempts to describe actual usage, avoiding prescriptive judgments. Descriptive grammars are bound to a particular [[speech community]], and attempt to provide rules for any [[utterance]] considered grammatically correct within that community. For example, in many dialects of English, the use of [[double negative]]s is very common, though ungrammatical from the point of view of a prescriptive English grammar. A descriptive grammar of a speech community where &quot;I didn't do nothing&quot; is acceptable will treat that sentence as grammatical, and provide rules that account for it. A descriptive grammar of formal English would rather provide rules for &quot;I didn't do anything.&quot;
* [[Traditional grammar]] is the collection of ideas about grammar that Western societies have received from Greek and Roman sources.  Prescriptive grammar is usually formulated in terms of the descriptive concepts inherited from traditional grammar.  Modern descriptive grammar aims to correct the errors of traditional grammar, and generalize them, so as to avoid shoehorning all languages to the model of Latin.  Nearly all materials used in teaching language, however, are still based on traditional grammar.
*A [[formal grammar]] is a precisely defined grammar, typically used for computer [[programming language]]s.
*A [[generative grammar]] is a [[formal grammar]] that can in some sense &quot;generate&quot; the well-formed expressions of a [[natural language]]. An entire branch of linguistic theory is based on generative grammars. Generative grammars were popularized by [[Noam Chomsky]]. Generative grammar may include [[Transformational grammar]], which is a broad term mostly describing natural language grammars which have been developed in a Chomskian tradition. Transformational grammar is usually synonymous with the slightly more specific transformational-generative grammar (TGG).

==Development of grammars==
Grammars evolve through usage and human population separations.  With the advent of written [[representation]]s, formal rules about language usage tend to appear also. Formal grammars are [[codification]]s of usage that are developed by [[observation]]. As the rules become established and developed, the prescriptive concept of grammatical correctness can arise. This often creates a gulf between contemporary usage and that which is accepted as correct. Linguists normally consider that prescriptive grammars do not have any justification beyond their authors' aesthetic tastes. However, prescriptions are considered in [[sociolinguistics]] as part of the explanation for why s;nowiki&gt;{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''NUMBEROFARTICLES''' is the number of pages in the main namespace which contain a link and are not a redirect, in other words number of articles, stubs containing a link, and disambiguation pages.

'''CURRENTMONTHNAMEGEN''' is the genitive (possessive) grammatical form of the month name, as used in some languages; '''CURRENTMONTHNAME''' is the nominative (subject) form, as usually seen in English.

In languages where it makes a difference, you can use constructs like &lt;nowiki&gt;{{grammar:case|word}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to convert a word from the nominative case to some other case.  For example, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{grammar:genitive|{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; means the same as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{CURRENTMONTHNAMEGEN}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. &lt;!-- Is there a reference for this, other than the source code (for example, phase3/languages/Lnaguage*.php) ? --&gt;

===Templates===
The [[Wikipedia:MediaWiki|MediaWiki]] software used by Wikipedia has support for templates. This means standardized text chunks (such as [[Wikipedia:Template messages|boilerplate]] text) can be inserted into articles. For example, typing {{tl|stub}} will appear as &quot;''This article is a [[Wikipedia:Stub|stub]]. You can help Wikipedia by [[Wikipedia:Stub|expanding it]].''&quot; when the page is saved. See [[Wikipedia:Template messages]] for the complete list. Other commonly used templates are: {{tl|disambig}} for disambiguation pages, {{tl|spoiler}} for spoiler warnings and {{tl|sectstub}} like an article stub but for a section. There are many subject-specific stubs for example: {{tl|Geo-stub}}, {{tl|Hist-stub}}, and {{tl|Linux-stub}}. For a complete list of stubs see [[WP:WSS/ST]].

===Hiding the edit links===
Insert '''&lt;nowiki&gt;__NOEDITSECTION__&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' into the document to suppress the edit links that appear next to every section header.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{History of Germany}}

This article gives an overview of the '''History of Germany'''. It begins with the birth of the nation from [[Roman Empire|Ancient Roman]] times to the 8th century, and then continues into the [[Holy Roman Empire]] dating from the 9th century until [[1806]]. At its largest extent, the territory of this empire included what today is [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Slovenia]], the [[Czech Republic]], western [[Poland]], the [[Low Countries]], eastern [[France]], [[Switzerland]] and all of northern [[Italy]]. After the mid 15th century, it was known as the &quot;Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation&quot;. 

This was followed by the [[German Confederation]] of [[1806]] - [[1870]], the [[German Empire]] of [[1871]] - [[1918]] and the [[Weimar Republic]] of [[1919]] - [[1933]], then by [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany]] (or &quot;[[Third Reich]]&quot;, his proclaimed successor of the large medieval Empire or &quot;Reich&quot;) of 1933 - 1945 and the devastations of [[World War II]]. The article concludes with the history of the [[Effects of World War II|post-war]] [[Federal Republic of Germany]] and the history of the [[GDR]] from 1945 to 1990.

[[Image:Gaius Cornelius Tacitus.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus]], author of ''Germania'', a descriptive work about the Germanic tribes at the Roman frontier on the Rhine]]

Between [[800 BC|800]] and [[70 BC]] the Germanic tribes in the north migrated into [[Celts|Celtic]] territory, advancing to the [[Oder]] and the [[Rhine]] and into southern Germany.

Around [[58 BC]], in a succession of military campaigns the Romans made the [[Rhine]] the north-eastern frontier of the [[Roman Empire]], leading to the Romanisation of the left bank of the Rhine and the incorporation of the central European Celtic societies into their Empire. Roman forts were built at [[Cologne]], [[Trier]], [[Koblenz]], [[Mainz]] and elsewhere to secure the Rhine frontier, where Romans and Germanic people now faced each other directly. In [[AD 9]] a Roman army led by [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] was defeated by the [[Cheruscan]] leader [[Arminius]] (Hermann) in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]].  Germany as far as the Rhine and the [[Danube]] remained outside the [[Roman Empire]].

From [[90 AD]] onwards, the Romans built the [[Germanic Limes|Limes]], a 550-km (340-mile) defensive line from the Rhine to the Danube designed to check Germanic advances over the frontier, as well as numerous forts (e.g. at [[Wiesbaden]], [[Augsburg]], [[Regensburg]], [[Passau]]).  The 3rd century saw the emergence of a number of large West Germanic tribes &amp;mdash; [[Alamanni]], [[Franks]], [[Chatti]], [[Saxons]], [[Frisians]], [[Thuringians]].  Around 260, the Germans finally broke through the Limes and the Danube frontier.

In the 4th century, the advance of the [[Huns]] into Europe gave the start to the period of the [[Migration Period|Great Migrations]], which changed the whole map of Europe. By unifying the Franks and conquering [[Gaul]], the [[Merovingians|Merovingian]] [[Clovis I|king Chlodwig]] became the founder of the [[Franks|Frankish kingdom]]. In 496 the Franks defeated the Alemanni, accepted the Catholic faith and so gained the support of the Church.

The Roman provinces north of the Alps had been Christianised since the 4th century and Christian centres such as at [[Augsburg]] were maintained after the end of the Roman empire. However, from around 600 there was a renewed Christian mission of the barbarian tribes. Irish-Scottish monks founded monasteries at [[Würzburg]], [[Regensburg]], [[Reichenau]], and other places.  The missionary activity in the Merovingian kingdom was continued by the Anglo-Saxon monk [[Saint Boniface|Boniface]], who established the first monastery east of the Rhine at [[Fritzlar]]. Bishoprics under Papal authority were established to spread the Christian faith in the German lands.

In 751 [[Pippin III]], mayor (controller) of the palace under the Merovingian king, himself assumed the title of king and was anointed by the Church.  The Frankish kings now set up as protectors of the [[Pope]], and the [[Carolingian]] [[Charlemagne|successors]] of Pippin launched a decades-long military camapign against their [[Heathen]] rivals, the [[Saxons]].  The Saxons were eventually overwhelmed and forcibly converted, and their lands were annexed by the Frankish empire.

==Holy Roman Empire==
''Main article: [[Holy Roman Empire]].''

===Middle Ages===

[[Image:Electoral princes.png|thumb|250px|right|The [[prince-elector]]s of the Holy Roman Empire. From ''Bildatlas der Deutschen Geschichte'' by Dr Paul Knötel (1895)]]
From 772 to 814 king [[Charlemagne]] extended the Carolingian empire into northern Italy and the territories of all west Germanic peoples, including the Saxons and the Bajuwari (Bavarians). In 800 Charlemagne's authority in Western Europe was confirmed by his coronation as emperor in [[Rome]]. The [[Holy Roman Empire]] was established. The Frankish empire was divided into counties, and its frontiers were protected by border Marches. Imperial strongholds (''Kaiserpfalzen'') became economic and cultural centres ([[Aachen]] being the most famous).

Between 843 and 880, after fighting between Charlemagne's grandchildren, the Carolingian empire was partitioned into several parts in the [[Treaty of Verdun]]. The German empire developed out of the East Frankish kingdom, [[East Francia]]. From 919 to 936 the Germanic peoples ([[Franks]], [[Saxons]], [[Swabia]]ns and [[Bavarians]]) were united under [[Henry the Fowler|Duke Henry of Saxony]], who took the title of king. For the first time, the term Kingdom (Empire) of the Germans (&quot;Regnum Teutonicorum&quot;) was applied to the Frankish kingdom.

In 936 [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I the Great]] was crowned at [[Aachen]]. He strengthened the royal authority by appointing bishops and abbots as princes of the Empire (''Reichsfürsten''), thereby establishing a national church (''Reichskirche''). In 951 Otto the Great married the widowed queen [[Adelaide of Italy|Adelheid]], thereby winning the Langobardic (Lombard) crown. Outside threats to the kingdom were contained when in 955 the [[Hungary|Hungarians]] were decisively defeated near [[Augsburg]] at the [[Battle of Lechfeld]] and the Slavs between the [[Elbe]] and the [[Oder]] were subdued. In 962 Otto I was crowned emperor in Rome, taking the succession of Charlemagne and establishing a strong German influence over the Papacy.

In 1033 the kingdom of [[Burgundy]] was incorporated into the German empire during the reign of [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]], the first emperor of the [[Salian]] dynasty.

During the reign of his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] Germany supported the [[Cluny|Cluniac]] reform of the Church - the [[Peace and Truce of God|Peace of God]], the prohibition of simony (the purchase of clerical offices) and the celibacy of priests. Imperial authority over the Pope reached its peak. An imperial stronghold (''Pfalz'') was built at [[Goslar]], as the Empire continued its expansion to the East.

In the [[Investiture Controversy|Investiture Dispute]] which began between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Pope Gregory VII]] over appointments to ecclesiastical offices, the emperor was compelled to submit to the Pope at [[Canossa]] in 1077, after having been excommunicated. In 1122 a temporary reconciliation was reached between [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] and the Pope with the [[Concordat of Worms]]. The consequences of the investiture dispute were a weakening of the [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ottonian]] ''Reichskirche'' and a strengthening of the German secular princes.

[[Image:Zamek krzyzacki w Malborku.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Castle of the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]] in [[Malbork]] ([[German language|German]]: Marienburg)]]
The time between 1096 and 1291 was the age of the [[Crusade|crusades]]. Knightly religious orders were established, including the [[Knights Templar (military order)|Templars]], the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of St John]] and the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]]. 

From 1100, new towns were founded around imperial strongholds, castles, bishops' palaces and monasteries. The towns began to establish municipal rights and liberties, while the rural population remained in a state of serfdom. In particular, several cities became [[Imperial Free City|Imperial Free Cities]], which did not depend on princes or bishops, but were immediately subject to the Emperor. The towns were ruled by patricians (merchants carrying on long-distance trade). The craftsmen formed guilds, governed by strict rules, which sought to obtain control of the towns. Trade with the East and North intensified, as the major trading towns came together in the [[Hanseatic League]], under the leadership of [[Lübeck]].

The Germanic expansion into the east began ([[''Drang nach Osten'']]: German settlers, including peasants, towns-people and the Teutonic Order, moved into Slav populated territories east of the Oder ([[Bohemia]], [[Silesia]], [[Pomerania]], [[Poland]], [[Courland]]), settling into towns and villages. (''See'' [[Ostsiedlung]]).

Between 1152 and 1190, during the reign of [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]] (Barbarossa), of the [[Hohenstaufen]] dynasty, an accommodation was reached with the rival [[Welf|Guelph]] party by the grant of the duchy of [[Bavaria]] to [[Henry the Lion]], duke of [[Saxony]]. [[Austria]] became a separate duchy by virtue of the [[Privilegium Minus]] in 1156. Barbarossa tried to reassertain his control over Italy. In 1177 a final reconciliation was reached between the emperor and the Pope in [[Venice]].

In 1180 Henry the Lion was outlawed and Bavaria was given to [[Otto I Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria|Otto of Wittelsbach]] (founder of the [[Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach dynasty]] which was to rule Bavaria until 1918), while Saxony was divided.

From 1184 to 1186 the Hohenstaufen empire under Barbarossa reached its peak in the ''Reichsfest'' (imperial celebrations) held at [[Mainz]] and the marriage of his son [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] in [[Milan]] to the Norman princess [[Constance of Sicily]]. The power of the feudal lords was undermined by the appointment of &quot;ministerials&quot; (unfree servants of the Emperor) as officials. Chivalry and the court life flowered, leading to a development of German culture and literature (see [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]).

Between 1212 and 1250 [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] established a modern, professionally administered state in [[Sicily]]. He resumed the conquest of Italy, leading to further conflict with the Papacy. In the Empire, extensive sovereign powers were granted to ecclesiastical and secular princes, leading to the rise of independent territorial states. The struggle with the Pope sapped the Empire's strength, as Frederick II was excommunicated three times. After his death, the Hohenstaufen dynasty fell, followed by an interregnum during which there was no Emperor.

In 1226 parts of [[Prussia]] were conquered, christianized and its population slaughtered by the Teutonic Order invited to [[Poland]] by [[Konrad of Masovia]], a Polish duke who ruled in the [[Masovia]]. But from 1300, the Empire started to lose territory on all its frontiers.

The failure of negotiations between [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Louis IV]] with the papacy led 1338 to the declaration at Rhense by six electors to the effect that election by all or the majority of the electors automatically conferred the royal title and rule over the empire, without papal confirmation.

Between 1346 and 1378 [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles IV]] of [[Luxembourg]], king of [[Bohemia]], sought to restore the imperial authority.

[[Image:Holbein-death.png|thumb|200px|right|Around the middle of the 14th century, the [[Black Death]] ravaged Germany and Europe. From the Dance of Death by [[Hans Holbein]] (1491)]]
Around 1350 Germany and almost the whole of Europe were ravaged by the [[Black Death]]. [[Jew]]s were persecuted on religious and economic grounds; many fled to [[Poland]].

The [[Golden Bull]] of 1356 stipulated that in future the emperor was to be chosen by seven electors - the Archbishops of Mainz, Trier and Cologne, the King of Bohemia, the Count Palatine of the Rhine, the Duke of Saxony and the Margrave of Brandenburg.

After the disasters of the fourteenth century, early-modern European society gradually came into being as a result of economic, religious and political changes. A money economy arose which provoked social discontent among knights and peasants. Gradually, a proto-capitalistic system evolved out of feudalism. The [[Fugger]] family gained prominence through commercial and financial activities and became financiers to both ecclesiastical and secular rulers.

The knightly classes found their monopoly on arms and military skill undermined by the introduction of mercenary armies and foot soldiers. Predatory activity by &quot;robber knights&quot; became common. From 1438 the [[Habsburg]]s, who controlled most of the southeast of the Empire (more or less modern-day [[Austria]] and [[Slovenia]], and, from 1526 onwards - after the death of the last of the [[Jagiellonian|Jagiellonians]] Ludwig, [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]]), maintained a constant grip on the position of the Holy Roman Emperor until 1806 (with the exception of the years between 1742 and 1745). This situation, however, gave rise to increased disunity among Germany's territorial rulers and prevented all sections of the nation from coming together in the manner of [[France]] and [[England]]. 

During his reign from 1493 to 1519, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] tried to reform the Empire: an Imperial Supreme Court (''Reichskammergericht'') was established, imperial taxes were levied, the power of the Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'') was increased. The reforms were, however, frustrated by the continued territorial fragmentation of the Empire.

===Reformation and Thirty Years War===

[[Image:Luther46c.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Martin Luther]], German reformer and reformer of Germany, 1529]]
Around the beginning of the 16th century there was much discontent in Germany with abuses in the Catholic Church and a desire for reform. 

In 1517 the [[Reformation]] began: [[Martin Luther|Luther]] nailed his [[95 Theses|95 &quot;theses&quot;]] against the abuse of indulgences to the church door in [[Wittenberg]].

In 1521 Luther was outlawed at the [[Diet of Worms]]. But the Reformation spread rapidly, helped by the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]]'s  wars with [[France]] and the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. Hiding in the [[Wartburg Castle]], Luther translated the Bible, establishing the basis of modern German. 

In 1524 the [[Peasants' War]] broke out in [[Swabia]], [[Franconia]] and [[Thuringia]] against ruling princes and lords, following the preachings of Reformist priests. But the revolts, which were assisted by war-experienced noblemen like [[Götz von Berlichingen]] and [[Florian Geyer]] (in Franconia), and by the theologian [[Thomas Münzer]] (in Thuringia), were soon repressed by the territorial princes. 

From 1545 the [[Catholic Reformation|Counter-Reformation]] began in Germany. The main force was provided by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit order]], founded by the Spaniard [[Ignatius of Loyola]]. Central and north-eastern Germany were by this time almost wholly Protestant, whereas western and southern Germany remained predominantly Catholic. In the War of the [[Schmalkaldic League]] in 1546/1547, the Emperor Charles V defeated the Protestant rulers. 

The [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555 brought recognition of the Lutheran faith. But the treaty also stipulated that the religion of a state was to be that of its ruler ([[Cuius regio, eius religio]]). 

In 1556 Charles V abdicated. The Habsburg Empire was divided, as Spain was separated from the German possessions. 

In 1608/1609 the [[Protestant Union]] and the [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]] were formed.

[[Image:The Ratification of the Treaty of Münster (Gerard Terborch 1648).jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Peace of Westphalia]] marked the end of the Thirty Years' War]]
From 1618 to 1648 the [[Thirty Years' War]] ravaged Germany. The causes were the conflicts between Catholics and Protestants, the efforts by the various states within the Empire to increase their power and the Emperor's attempt to achieve the religious and political unity oedia:Administrators|admin]] in doing that.

&lt;!-- Apparently this is too complex for some people to follow. Let's try it this way, then. --&gt;
{{Wikipedia:Redirect/DeletionReasons}}

== What needs to be done on pages that are targets of redirects? ==
We follow the &quot;[[Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles#Principle of least astonishment|principle of least astonishment]]&quot; &amp;mdash; after following a redirect, the readers's first question is likely to be: &quot;hang on ... I wanted to read about ''this''. Why has the link taken me to ''that''?&quot;. Make it clear to the reader that they ''have'' arrived in the right place.

Normally, we try to make sure that all &quot;inbound redirects&quot; are mentioned in the first couple of paragraphs of the article. For example:

* '''Longships''' were boats used by the Vikings... 
** [[longship]], redirect from [[viking ship]]
* '''Edvard Munch''' ([[1863]]&amp;ndash;[[1944]]) was ... The broadest collection of his works is at on display at the Munch Museum at...
** [[Edvard Munch]], redirect from [[Munch Museum]]

Don't cause a [[Wikipedia:Double redirects|secondary redirect]].  They don't work like a primary redirect; same with tertiary redirects.

== Self-links, duplicate links ==
Avoid [[Wikipedia:Self link|self-links]], including self-links through redirects (&quot;loop links&quot;). Also, avoid having two links that go to the same place. These can confuse readers, and cause them to unnecessarily load the same page twice.

== Don't fix redirects that aren't broken ==
Some editors are tempted, upon finding links using a legitimate redirect target, to edit the page to &quot;fix&quot; the redirect so that it points &quot;straight&quot; at the &quot;correct&quot; page.  Unless the link ''displays'' incorrectly—for instance, if the link is to a misspelling or if the hint that appears when you hover over the link is misleading—there is no need to edit the link.  Most especially, there should ''never'' be a need to replace &lt;nowiki&gt;[[redirect]] with [[direct|redirect]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

Some editors are under the mistaken impression that fixing such links improves the capacity of the Wikipedia servers.  But because editing a page is ''thousands'' of times more expensive for the servers than following a redirect, the opposite is actually true.

[[Nupedia]] was a low activity [[open content]], international, peer reviewed [[encyclopedia]] project formerly run by [[Larry Sanger]]; Larry also started [[Wikipedia]] when he got the idea of supplementing Nupedia with a less formal &quot;wiki&quot; encyclopedia project. So there is a historical connection between the projects. Both [[Nupedia]] and [[Wikipedia]] are originated by [[Bomis]], a WebPortal company, so a wider management connection exists.

There is no editorial connection between the projects, however. The participants in Nupedia do not necessarily condone the contents or methods of [[Wikipedia]]--and vice-versa!

==Adding Nupedia articles to Wikipedia==

To add a Nupedia article to Wikipedia, all you have to do is find the article, copy the contents, and paste it into the appropriate location (whatever you think is appropriate). Nupedia content is released under the [[GNU Free Documentation Licence]] (GFDL). You should note that Nupedia is the source of the article and provide a link to the original. For example:

:''&lt;nowiki&gt;An [http://www.nupedia.com/article/133/ earlier version] of the above article was posted on [[8 August]] [[2000]] on [[Nupedia]]; reviewed and approved by the Classics group; editor, Robert Dyer ; lead reviewer, James Allan Evans ; lead copyeditors, Charles Peyser and Jeri Bates.&lt;/nowiki&gt;''

You may ''not'' add articles from the Nupedia chalkboard to Wikipedia, unless you have permission from the original author. Content on the Nupedia chalkboard is not covered by the GFDL.

However, content in the Nupedia ''articles-in-progress'' (see http://www.nupedia.com/aip.phtml ) do appear to qualify under the GFDL (see [[Wikipedia talk:Nupedia and Wikipedia|talk]] and [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2003-August/thread.html#11582]) so they ''can'' be ported to Wikipedia.

:''Hurd redirects here. For other uses of this term, see [[Hurd (disambiguation)]]''

'''The GNU Hurd''' is a [[computer]] program. It is a set of [[server]]s (or [[daemon (computer software)|daemons]], in [[Unix]]-speak) that work on top of either the [[GNU Mach]] microkernel or the [[L4 microkernel family|L4 microkernel]]; together, they form the [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] of the [[GNU]] [[operating system]].  It has been under development since [[1990]] by the [[GNU]] Project and is distributed as [[free software]] under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]].  The Hurd aims to surpass [[Unix]] kernels in functionality, security, and stability, while remaining largely compatible with them. This is done by having the Hurd track the [[POSIX]] specification, while avoiding arbitrary restrictions on the user.

&quot;HURD&quot; is an indirectly [[recursive acronym]], standing for &quot;HIRD of [[Unix]]-Replacing [[Daemon (computer software)|Daemons]]&quot;, where &quot;HIRD&quot; stands for &quot;HURD of Interfaces Representing Depth&quot;.

==Development history==
Development on the Hurd began in [[1990]]. By the early 1990s, it was the only major part of the GNU OS that was incomplete.  

The GNU [[userland]] tools which make up the applications and framework with which users and programmers interact are the well known part of the GNU operating system. These tools are most popularly used with [[Linux kernel|Linux]], until the remaining work on GNU/Hurd is completed.

Despite an optimistic announcement by [[Richard Stallman]] in [[2002]] [http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,88464,00.asp] predicting a release of GNU/Hurd, further development and design are still required.  No official release of the Hurd has yet been made, and the system is currently unstable.

OSKit-Mach began as a branch of the Gnu Mach 1.2 kernel, but since the release of GNU Mach 1.3, OSKit-Mach has been merged as the new Gnu Mach 2.x mainline.  Development of the Hurd has also shifted significantly for some developers towards the [[L4 microkernel family]].

In [[2005]], Hurd developer [[Neal Walfield]] finished the initial memory management framework for the [http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd-l4.html L4/Hurd port], and [[Marcus Brinkmann]] ported essential parts of [[glibc]]; namely, getting the process startup code working, allowing programs to run, thus allowing the first user programs (trivial ones such as the [[hello world program]] in C) to run.

The [[Debian]] project, among others, have contributed funding to speed up development.

==Architecture==
Unlike [[Unix-like]] kernels, the Hurd builds on top of a [[microkernel]] which is responsible for providing the most basic kernel services &amp;ndash; coordinating access to the [[Computer hardware|hardware]]: the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] (through [[multiprocessing]]), [[Random access memory|RAM]] (via [[memory management]]), and other various devices for sound, graphics, mass storage, etc. [[GNU Mach]] is used as the microkernel, but efforts are underway to port the Hurd to the more modern [[L4 microkernel family|L4 microkernel]].  Currently, it is being discussed whether or not L4 is actually suitable at all, there may be a switch or port to yet another microkernel.  There is speculation about [[Coyotos]] ([[Extremely Reliable Operating System|EROS]] successor) and [[l4.sec]] (not yet complete).

Other Unix-like systems running on top of the [[Mach kernel|Mach microkernel]] include [[Mac OS X]], [[OSF/1]], [[NEXTSTEP]], [[Lites]], and [[MkLinux]]. These share one detail in common, in that they are implemented as a single so-called ''server''. In effect they replace the [[monolithic kernel]] from a traditional Unix system with two parts, the microkernel and Unix server.

The Hurd instead consists of multiple servers working together. Instead of a single large code base which includes everything from handling the clock to handling the [[computer network|networking]], in Hurd each of these are handled by a separate server. This makes developing the Hurd much easier (at least in theory) as making changes to one is less likely to have [[Side-effect (computer science)|side-effect]]s in others.

In the original [[Mach kernel|Mach]] efforts, this sort of &quot;set of servers&quot; was considered to be one of the main goals of the design, but the Hurd appears to be the first Mach-based system to actually be implemented in this fashion (whereas [[QNX]] is similar but based on its own microkernel). It's not entirely clear why this happened, but it appears that groups working on Mach were too busy working on Mach to work on the operating system as a whole. Hurd also aims to be microkernel-independent.

===Unix extensions===
A number of traditional Unix concepts are replaced or extended in the Hurd:
Under Unix every program running has an associated [[user id]], which normally corresponds to the user that started the [[Process (computing)|process]]. This id largely dictates the actions permitted to the program. No outside process can change the user id of a running program. A Hurd process, on the other hand, runs under a ''set'' of user ids, which can contain multiple ids, one, or none. A sufficiently privileged process can add and remove ids to another process. For example there is a password server that will hand out ids in return for a correct login password.

Regarding the [[file system]], a suitable program can be designated as a ''translator'' for a single file or a whole directory hierarchy. Every access to the translated file, or files below a hierarchy in the second case, is in fact handled by the program. For example a file translator may simply redirect read and write operations to another file, not unlike a Unix [[symbolic link]]. What ''[[Mount|mounting]]'' is to Unix, the Hurd achieves by setting up a filesystem translator (using the &quot;settrans&quot; command).  Translators can also be used to provide services to the user.  For example, the [[ftpfs]] translator allows a user to encapsulate remote FTP sites within a directory.  Then, standard tools such as [[ls]], [[cp (Unix)|cp]], and [[rm (Unix)|rm]] can be used to manipulate files on the remote system.  Even more powerful translators are ones such as [[UnionFS]], which allows a user to unify multiple directories into one; so that listing the unified directory reveals the contents of all the unified directories (a feature that is missing in many Unixes, although available in [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]] and [[DragonFly BSD]]).

Perhaps the most empowering aspect of the Hurd is the ability for any user to start their own system services.  Any user can attach any translator to the filesystem for their own personal use.  A user could even replace system servers, such as the auth server, with other servers of their own choosing. All this can be done without affecting other users, due to well defined scopes.  Indeed, it is even possible for a user to run the Hurd within itself, which is known as a sub-Hurd.

The Hurd requires a [[Multiboot Specification|multiboot]]-compliant [[boot loader]], such as [[GRUB]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the classic era of [[Hollywood]] [[film|cinema]] ([[1930]] – [[1945]]) the &quot;cycles&quot; or genres matured.  They were called cycles, which was a short term for stories that were similar.  While we would recognize many of the genres as [[Western (genre)|Westerns]], [[Gangster film|gangsters]], [[Musical film|musicals]], etc., often the cycles were significantly more specific.  Instead of &quot;romantic comedy&quot; it might be &quot;Boy-meets-girl-boy-loses-girl-boy-gets-girl&quot; cycle.

'''Hillary Rodham Clinton''' (born '''Hillary Diane Rodham''' on [[October 26]], [[1947]]) is the junior [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[New York]], serving her freshman term since [[January 3]], [[2001]]. She is married to &lt;!--do not add &quot;former&quot; here, as former Presidents are still referred to as President--&gt; [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]], and was [[First Lady of the United States]] from [[1993]] to [[2001]]. Before that she was a prominent [[lawyer]] and First Lady of [[Arkansas]]. She is a member of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]].  

==Early life and education==	
 
[[Image:Rodham family portrait.jpg|thumb|Rodham family portrait]]	 
Hillary Rodham was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and was raised in a [[Methodist]] family in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]], [[Illinois]]. Her father, [[Hugh Rodham| Hugh Ellsworth Rodham]], a [[American conservatism|conservative]], worked in the textile industry, and her mother, [[Dorothy Emma Howell Rodham]], was a [[homemaker]]. 

===Grade School===
As a child, Hillary was interested in sports, her church, and her school, a public school in Park Ridge.  Prior to graduating from [[Maine South High School]], she attended [[Maine East High School]], where she served as class president, a member of the student council, a member of the debating team, and as a member of the [[National Honor Society]].  During her final year of high school (Maine South High School), she received the school's first [[social science]] award. Throughout her youth, Rodham was fond of sports, including [[tennis]], [[ice skating|skating]], [[ballet]], [[swimming]], [[volleyball]], and [[softball]]. She earned many awards as a Brownie and [[Girl Scouts of the USA| Girl Scout]] [http://www.hillary-rodham-clinton.org/education.html]. Hillary entered the world of politics in [[1964]], at the age of 16, by supporting the presidential bid of [[Arizona]] [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] [[Senator]] [[Barry Goldwater]]. Her parents encouraged her to pursue the career of her choice [http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/firstladies/hc42.html] [http://www.hillary-rodham-clinton.org/].	

===College===
====Wellesley====
After completing high school in [[1965]], Rodham enrolled at [[Wellesley College]] in [[Massachusetts]] where she became active in politics, serving, for a time, as President of the Wellesley College Chapter of the [[College Republicans]]. During her junior year at Wellesley in [[1968]], Rodham was affected by the death of the [[civil rights]] leader [[Martin Luther King Jr.| Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]], whom she had met in person in [[1962]] [http://www.hillary-rodham-clinton.org/education.html]. After attending the Wellesley in Washington program at the urging of Professor [[Alan Schechter]], her political views became more [[Liberalism|liberal]] and she joined the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Having been named [[valedictorian]] of her graduating class at Wellesley, Rodham graduated, in [[1969]], with departmental honors in [[Political Science]]. She became the first student in the history of Wellesley College to deliver a [ensus|U.S. Census]] survey, the parents of 33% of homeschooled children cited religion as a factor in their choice, 30% felt the regular school had a poor learning environment, 14% objected to what the school teaches, 11% felt their children weren't being challenged at school, and 9% cited morality [http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0053.html]. In 2003, the reasons most frequently reported by parents for homeschooling were: concerns about the school environment (85%); a desire to provide religious or moral instruction (72%); and dissatisfaction with academic instruction (68%)[http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=91].

Options which make home education attractive to some families also include:
*Allowing a longer exploratory play-oriented childhood, encouraging the development of rich imagination and pre-academic skills which can foster later academic success
*Allowing each student to work at their own pace, enjoy family vacations, and integrate outside activities or current events into subjects they are studying
*Incorporating religion, [[ethics]], and character topics not included in most school curricula
*Including non-traditional curricula and unusual subjects such as [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]
*Giving extra weight to subjects of particular family interest such as [[art]], [[music]], or [[business]]
*Adapting educational practices for children with learning disabilities or illnesses
*Providing a legal option for families who wish to abstain from mandatory [[immunization]]s.
*Providing consistency in education for families that travel or move frequently.

== Methods ==

[[Image:Braeden hacking.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Internet]] has made information more accessible than ever.]]
There is a wide variety of home education methods and materials. Many home education families base their work on a particular educational philosophy such as: 
*[[Classical education]] (including [[Trivium]], [[Quadrivium]])
*[[Waldorf Education]]
*[[Charlotte Mason]] education
*[[Theory of multiple intelligences]]
*[[Montessori method]]
Others use a broad combination of ideas or allow the child to develop their own motivation, through what is known as [[#Unschooling|Unschooling]].  

Because home education laws vary widely according to individual government statutes, official curriculum requirements vary. [http://www.hslda.org/hs/state/default.asp]

=== Unit studies ===

Unit studies teach most subjects in the context of a central theme. For example, a unit study of [[Native Americans (Americas)|Native Americans]] could combine age-appropriate lessons in: [[social studies]], like how different tribes lived; [[art]], such as making Native American clothing; [[history]] of [[Native Americans in the U.S.]]); [[Reading (activity)|reading]] from a special reading list; and the [[science]] of plants used by Native Americans. The following unit-study subject could change to some other broad topic of study. 

Supporters say unit studies make excellent use of student time by combining several fields into one study time, and permit students to follow personal interests. Unit studies also permit children of different ages to study together. For example, in a Native American unit, a 10th-grade student might make a deer-skin coat for an art project, while a 1st-grade student might make construction-paper [[tipi]]s.

Home educators often purchase unit-study guides that suggest materials, projects and shopping lists, and supplement them with specialized curricula for math, and sometimes reading and writing.

=== Special materials ===

Special materials focus on skill-building. Individual subject materials usually consist of workbooks, sometimes with textbooks, and an instructional guide. Many specialized subjects are only available in this form. Special materials are frequently used for math and  [[Primary education|primary reading]].

Critics say that some parents over-focus on skills while excluding [[social studies]], [[science]], [[art]], [[history]] and other fields that help children learn their place in the world.

=== All-in-one curricula === &lt;!-- if section is renamed/removed, change reference above --&gt;

&quot;All-in-one&quot; curricula, sometimes called &quot;school in a box&quot;, are comprehensive packages covering many subjects, usually an entire year's worth. They contain all needed books and materials, including pencils and writing paper. Most such curricula were developed for isolated families who lack access to public schools, libraries and shops, or are overseas.

These materials typically recreate the school environment in the home, and are typically based on the same subject-area expectations as publicly-run schools, allowing an easy transition into school if desired. They are among the most expensive options for the home-educated, but are easy to use and require minimal preparation. The instructional guides are usually extensive, with step-by-step instructions. These programs may include [[standardized test]]s, and remote examinations to yield an accredited privately-run school diploma.

=== Student-paced learning ===

Similar to All-in-one curricula are learner paced curriculum packages. Often times called paces, these workbooks allow the student to progress at an individualized speed. They allow the student to master concepts before moving on to the next subject, instead of being held back by the speed of the teacher and other students or rushing forward for the same reasons. Prices vary widely depending upon the publisher.

=== Community resources ===

Home educators take advantage of educational programs at [[museum]]s, [[community center]]s, athletic clubs, after-school programs, [[church]]es, science preserves, [[park]]s, and other community resources. Secondary school level students often take classes at [[community college]]s, which typically have open admission policies.

=== Eclectic curricula ===

The majority of today's home-educated use an eclectic mix of materials. For instance, they might use a pre-designed program for language, arts or mathematics, and fill in history with reading and field trips, art with classes at a community center, science through a homeschool science club, [[physical education]] with membership in local sports teams, and so on.

=== Unschooling === &lt;!-- if section is renamed/removed, change reference above --&gt;

[[Unschooling]] is an area within home education in which students are not directly instructed but encouraged to learn through exploring their interests. Also known as interest-led or child-led learning, unschooling attempts to provide opportunities with games and real life problems where a child will learn without coercion. An unschooled child may choose to use texts or classroom instruction, but it is never considered central to education. 

Advocates for unschooling claim that children learn best by learning from doing. A child may learn reading and math skills from playing card games, better [[spelling]] and other writing skills because he's inspired to write a [[science fiction]] story for publication, or local history by following a [[zoning]] or historical-status dispute.

== Social development ==

A common concern voiced about home-educated children is they lack the social interaction with [[peer]]s that a school environment provides. Many home-education families address these concerns by joining numerous organizations, including home-education [[cooperative]]s, [[independent study]] programs and specialized enrichment groups for physical education, art, [[Music education|music]], and [[debate]]. Most are also active in community groups. Home-educated children generally socialize with other children the same way that school children do: outside of school, via personal visits and through sports teams, clubs, and religious groups.

Some home education proponents have argued that their alternative actually enhances the student's social development. They argue that the school years are the only time in a person's life that he or she will be artificially segregated into chronologically-determined groups. These advocates assert that home-educated children have a more normal interaction with persons across the age spectrum. This, in turn, results in more influence on the child from adults, and less from other children, leading to more mature young citizens.

=== Social concerns ===

Opponents of home education offer criticisms concerning socialization, pointing out that not all home-education families participate sufficiently in community activities. Some of the concerns offered include:
*Interaction with peers and different social groups is essential to learning to live in society; the main criticism is that home-schoolers' only &quot;interaction&quot; is with other home-schooled children from like-minded families, and not with those from differing backgrounds. {{citeneeded}}
*Schools are a unique environment that provide students with necessary social networking skills that help them succeed in the workplace and in the politics of business. Real life includes school as well.
*Home-educated children tend to live in an insulated world where they aren't exposed to a variety of ideas, which can impede personal growth and independence later in life. 
*If children are insulated from unpleasant social situations, then they will be left unprepared when they are inevitably left to make their own way in the world. Children should be allowed to live and learn from their mistakes rather than sheltered from reality.

Some people oppose home education because they fear that children will be exposed to an extremely narrow set of view-points and will lack the broad range of experiences gained through interaction in a larger group setting.

== Cost ==

Home education may have a financial impact on families. In addition to having to purchase school supplies and curriculum materials, parents often cut back or refrain from employment outside the home in order to supervise the child's education. This may have long-term career consequences as well. However, many such parents say that one unique benefit is the additional time they get to spend with their children.  Further, in most jurisdictions the family still must pay property taxes to the local district (even if school vouchers are offered they are often not available to homeschooling families).

Conversely, families may see a financial benefit. Families may save unspent money on the costs of tuition outside the home, such as: school fees; levies; uniforms; compulsory books and extra curricula activities, such as school sports teams or clubs.

Of course home education can be expensive if a full curriculum is purchased and many costly activities attended. It can also be very inexpensive by using free resources, taking advantage of free facilities, such as public libraries, art galleries, parks, and gardens, and resources available on the Internet.

== Public opinion ==

Opposition to home education comes from varied sources, including organizations of teachers and school districts. One example is the [[National Education Association]], a teachers' union, which is the largest [[labor union]] in the United States. They are on record as opposing homeschooling outright though, in recent years they have not been as outspoken in this opposition. Opponents state concerns falling into several broad categories, including: academic quality and completeness; reduced government money for the publicly-run schools; socialization of children with peers of different ethnic and religious backgrounds; and fear of religious or social [[extremism]]. [[Gallup poll]]s of American voters have shown a significant change in attitude in the last twenty years, from 73% opposed to home education in 1985 to 54% opposed in 2001 [http://eric.uoregon.edu/trends_issues/choice/home_schooling.html].

Opponents view home-educating parents as sheltering their children and denying them opportunities that are their children's right, reducing the amount of government funds publicly-run schools would receive if more children were attending the publicly-run school, and providing an unfair advantage to home-educated children over students whose parents lack the time or money for home education.

Two recent studies by the [[Home School Legal Defense Association]], a home education advocacy group in the United States, dispute the claim that the academic quality of home education programs is substandard.[http://www.hslda.org/docs/study/comp2001/default.asp][http://www.hslda.org/research/ray2003/]

== Legality ==

Home education exists legally in many parts of the world. Countries with the most prevalent home education movements include the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Australia]]. Some countries have highly regulated home education programs which are actually an extension of the compulsory school system, while others have outlawed it entirely. In many other countries, while not restricted by law, home education is not socially acceptable and, therefore, virtually non-existent. 

In many countries where home education does not exist legally, [[underground]] [[movement]]s flourish where children are kept out of the compulsory school system and educated at, sometimes, considerable risk. Still, in other countries, while the practice is illegal, the governments do not have the resources to police and prosecute offenders and, as such, it takes place largely in the open.

Home education in the [[United States]] is governed by each individual state and therefore regulations vary greatly from one state to another.

== Results ==

=== Academic findings ===

The academic effectiveness of home education is largely a settled issue. Numerous studies have confirmed the academic integrity of home education programs, demonstrating that average home-educated student outperform their publicly-run school peer by 30 to 37 percentile points across all subjects. Moreover, the performance gaps between minorities and gender that plague publicly-run schools are virtually non-existent amongst home-educated students.[http://www.hslda.org/docs/study/comp2001/default.asp] 

Some critics argue that while home-educated students generally do extremely well on standardized tests[http://www.hslda.org/docs/nche/000010/200410250.asp], such students are a self-selected group whose parents care strongly about their education and would also do well in a conventional school environment. 

Some opponents argue that parents with little training in education are less effective in teaching. However, some studies do indicate that parental income and education level affect home-educated student performance on standardized tests very little.

Home-educated student curricula often include many subjects not included in traditional curricula. Some colleges find this an advantage in creating a more academically diverse [[student body]], and proponents argue this creates a more well-rounded and self-sufficient adult. Increasingly, colleges are recruiting home-educated students; many colleges accept [[GED|equivalency diplomas]] as well as parent statements and portfolios of student work as admission criteria; others also require [[SAT]]s or other [[standardized test]]s. Opponents argue that home education curricula often excludes critical subjects and isolates the student from the rest of society, or presents them with [[ideological]] world views, especially religious ones.

The results of home education with [[gifted]] and [[Learning disability|learning-disabled]] children have not been as thoroughly studied.

=== Social findings ===

In 2003, the [[National Home Education Research Institute]] (NHERI) conducted a survey of over 7,300 U.S. adults who had been home-educated (over 5,000 for more than seven years). Their findings included:

:*Home-educated graduates are active and involved in their communities. 71% participate in an ongoing community service activity, like coaching a sports team, [[volunteering]] at a school, or working with a church or neighborhood association, compared with 37% of U.S. adults of similar ages from a traditional education background.

:*Home-educated graduates are more involved in civic affairs and [[vote]] in much higher percentages than their peers. For example, 76% of surveyed between the ages of 18 and 24 voted within the last five years, compared with only 29% of the relevant U.S. population. The numbers of home-educated graduates who vote are even greater in older age groups, with voting levels not falling below 95%, compared with a high of 53% for the corresponding U.S. populace.

:*Of those adults who were home-educated, 58.9% report that they are &quot;very happy&quot; with life (compared with 27.6% for the general U.S. population). Moreover, 73.2% of homeschooled adults find life &quot;exciting&quot;, compared with 47.3% of the general population.[http://www.hslda.org/research/ray2003/]

The [[Education Resources Information Center]] (ERIC), a U.S. government agengy, has published multiple articles on home education. Here are excerpts from one which examined several studies on home-educated children socialization:

:According to the findings, children who were educated at home &quot;gained the necessary skills, knowledge, and attitudes needed to function in society...at a rate similar to that of conventionally schooled children. 

and;

:The researcher found no difference in the [[self concept]] of children in the two groups, and maintains that &quot;insofar as self concept is a reflector of socialization, it would appear that few home-schooled children are socially deprived, and that there may be sufficient evidence to indicate that some home-schooled children have a higher self concept than conventionally schooled children.&quot;  [http://www.ericdigests.org/1995-1/home.htm]

Proponents argue further that the social environment of traditional schools:
*strongly inhibits individuality and creativity, 
*follows the standards set by the slowest students,
*involves [[bullying]], [[recreational drug use]], early [[sexuality]], defiance, criminality, [[materialism]], and [[eating disorder]]s. 
and that socialization in the wider community:
*leads them to see adults, rather than peers, as [[role model]]s,
*better prepares them for real life,
*encourages them to be more involved in youth, church, and sports organizations,
*helps them develop an independent understanding of themselves and their role in the world, with the freedom to reject or approve conventional values without the risk of ridicule, 
*teaches children to deal with a variety of situations and people,
*still provides for interaction with conventionally-educated children after school hours in their neighbourhood and in other after-school activities.

[[Image:Hortus Deliciarum - Hell.jpg|thumb|360px|Medieval illustration of Hell in the [[Hortus deliciarum]] manuscript of [[Herrad of Landsberg]] (about 1180)]]
'''Hell''' is, according to many religious beliefs, a place or a state of painful suffering.  The [[English language|English]] word 'hell' comes from the [[Germanic languages|Teutonic]] '[[Hel (realm)|Hel]]', which originally meant &quot;to cover&quot; and later referred to the goddess of the Norse underworld, [[Hel (realm)|Hel]]. Compare [[Anglo-Saxon]] ''helan'', Greek ''kalyptein'' and Latin ''celare'' = &quot;to hide, to cover&quot; (all from [[Proto-Indo-European language|IE]] ''[[*kel]]'').

In many religions, after death, evildoers either [[Damnation#Religious|suffer eternally]] or until they have paid for their bad deeds before [[reincarnation]] or [[redemption]]. In [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religions, hell is often ruled by [[demon]]s which torment the ''damned'' or is simply defined by an utter absence of ''God'' or ''redemptive force''. Many monotheists believe in different layers of hell, and that some are sent to [[purgatory]], or otherwise sent to suffer in hell until they repent and seek atonement. Some believe that all sent to hell can accept redemption if they repent and seek atonement, but believe that there will be those who never truly repent in spirit, and even those who reject redemption and ''curse God'' for all eternity in spite of this.

In [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religions, the politics of hell can be as complicated as human politics. Many ''Hellenistic'' [[Neopaganism|Neopagans]] believe in [[Tartarus]], which may also be considered a version of Hell.

==Origins==
[[Image:Dore woodcut Divine Comedy 01.jpg|thumb|A vision of hell from [[Dante]]’s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''. Illustration by [[Gustave Doré]].]]
Hell, as it exists in the [[Western countries|Western]] popular imagination, has its origins in [[Hellenic|Hellenized]] [[Christianity]], particularly taken from adaptation of the Hellenistic afterlife known as [[Tartarus]]. [[Judaism]], at least initially, believed in [[Sheol]], a shadowy existence to which all were sent indiscriminately. Sheol may have been little more than a poetic metaphor for death, not really an [[afterlife]] at all: see for example [[Sirach]]. However, by the third to second century [[Anno Domini|B.C.]] the idea had grown to encompass a far more complex concept.

The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''Sheol'' was translated in the [[Septuagint]] as '[[Hades]]', the name for the underworld in [[Greek mythology]] and is still considered to be distinct from &quot;Hell&quot; by [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Christians. The ''Lake of Fire'' and realm of ''Eternal Punishment'' in Hellenistic mythology was in fact [[Tartarus]]. [[Hades]] was not ''Hell'' in Hellenistic mythology, but was rather a form of [[limbo]] where the dead went to be judged. The [[New Testament]] uses this word, but it also uses the word '[[Gehenna]]', from the [[valley of Ge-Hinnom|valley of Hinnom]], a valley near [[Jerusalem]] originally used as a location in which human sacrifices were offered to an idol called &quot;Molech&quot; (or [[Moloch]]).

[[2 Kings 23.10]] (on King [[Josiah]]'s reform):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    And he defiled the Tophet, which is in the valley of Ben-hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter pass through the fire lmlk.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 32.35:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    And they built the high places of the Ba‘al, which are in the valley of Ben-hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire lmlk; which I did not command them, nor did it come into my mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was later used as a [[landfill]] in order to emphasize the disgusting nature of its original use. Hebrew landfills were very unsanitary and unpleasant when compared to modern landfills; these places were filled with rotting garbage and the Hebrews would periodically burn them down. However, by that point they were generally so large that they would burn for weeks or even months. In other words they were fiery mountains of garbage. The early Christian teaching was that the damned would be burnt in the valley just as the garbage was. (It is ironic to note that the valley of Hinnom is today, far from being a garbage dump, a public park.) It is argued by theologians opposed to hell but desirous to defend the Bible as a source, that a reference to a place on Earth where rubbish was burnt can not refer to any conscious after-death state.

Punishment for the damned and reward for the saved is a constant theme of early Christianity.

==Religious accounts==
Hell appears in several [[mythology|mythologies]] and [[religion]]s in different guises, and is commonly inhabited by [[demon]]s and the [[soul]]s of dead people.

Some accounts of Hell describe it as a series of numbered layers or levels. What the layers consist of differ from religion to religion, but the descriptions of certain numbered layers often coincide even between different religions. Examples of these coincidences include a layer of intense flames numbered 54 in several religions or a layer where the world looks like earth but is inhabited by demons; the soul experiencing it is never sure enough that it is in Hell to reveal their suspicion for fear of appearing insane, and is numbered 78 in at least 3 distinct religions.

===Rabbinic Judaism===
[[Gehenna]] is fairly well defined in [[rabbi|rabbinic]] literature. It is sometimes translated as &quot;Hell&quot;, but this doesn't effectively convey its meaning. In [[Judaism]], Gehenna is not hell, but rather a sort of [[Purgatory]] where one is judged based on their life's deeds. The [[Kabbalah]] describes it as a &quot;waiting room&quot; (commonly translated as an &quot;entry way&quot;) for all souls (not just the wicked).  The overwhelming majority of rabbinic thought maintains that people are not in [[Gehenna]] forever; the longest that one can be there is said to be 12 months. Some consider it a spiritual forge where the soul is purified for its eventual ascent to [[Jewish eschatology#The afterlife and olam haba (the world to come)|Olam Habah]] (''heb.'' עולם הבא; ''lit.'' &quot;The world to come&quot;, often viewed as analogous to [[Heaven]]). This is also mentioned in the [[Kabbalah]], where the soul is described as breaking, like the flame of a candle lighting another: the part of the soul that ascends being pure, and the &quot;unfinished&quot; piece being reborn.

===Ancient Greek religion===
Another source for the modern idea of 'Hell' is the Greek [[Tartarus]], a place in which conquered gods and other spirits were punished. Tartarus formed part of [[Hades]] in [[Greek mythology]], but [[Hades]] also included [[Elysium]], a place for the reward for those who lead virtuous lives, whilst others spent their afterlife in the [[asphodel]]s fields. Like most ancient (pre-Christian) religions, the underworld was not viewed as negatively as it is in [[Christianity]].

===Christianity ===
====General history and description====
The Christian idea of Hell is different from the [[Sheol]] of [[Judaism]]. The nature of Hell is described in the [[New Testament]] on several occasions. For example, in [[Matthew 3:10]]-[[Matthew 3:12|12]], [[Matthew 5:22|5:22]] and [[Matthew 5:29|29]]-[[Matthew 5:30|30]], 7:29, 8:12, 22:13 and 33, 25:30 and 41-46, [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 3:9, 12:5, 13:28, 16:19-28, and the [[Book of Revelation]] 12:9, 14:9-11, 19:20, 20:10 and 14-15, 21:8; in the [[Book of Revelation]] Hell is also mentioned as the &quot;[[abyss]]&quot; and &quot;the [[Earth]]&quot;.

The Biblical descriptions of Hell tell about a place of [[darkness]], fire, sulphur, an oven of fire, and lakes of fire and sulphur, where weeping, tears, gnashing of teeth and torment are eternal for those [[soul]]s that will be condemned to live there. Hell is referred to as a place apart from [[Heaven]], and implies that after the end of the world the Earth (or what it becomes) will be Hell, too (as well as all that is not Heaven). 

The population of Hell comprises of the souls of those who died without accepting [[Christ]] as their saviour, [[God]]'s grace, in [[sin]] and without repentance, although beliefs on these categories differs among Christian denominations. Some consider the fate of righteous people who lived before the time of Christ (thus being non-Christian through no fault of their own) a complication, especially for the many righteous Jews of the [[Old Testament]].  In some traditions, these people went straight to Heaven despite not being Christians because [[Christ]] had not come and gone yet.  In other traditions, they had to wait in [[Limbo]] until the [[Harrowing of Hell]] during the three days between the Crucifixion and the Resurrection.  

According to Western Christian beliefs, [[the Devil]] and his [[angel]]s ([[demon]]s), who are receiving punishment, reside in hell along with the souls of the damned. This doctrine is not part of Eastern Orthodox teachings. Yet, Matthew 25:41 mentions the ''[[eternal]]'' fire prepared for the Devil and his angels. According to the [[Book of Revelation]], after the [[Day Of the Lord]] soul and [[body]] will be united again, and so those who were condemned to Hell will remain there physically, tormented by eternal fire that will never consume them nor be extinguished.

According to Luke 16:19-28 ([[Lazarus and Dives]]) nobody can pass from Hell to Heaven or vice versa, and fire is not the only tormentor, thirst being another, and more that are not described; in this biblical passage it is also mentioned that the souls that are in Hell can see those that are in Heaven and vice versa, but nothing is said of the sight of God; those that are in Hell can see the happiness reigning in Heaven, and those in Heaven do not feel compassion for the others in Hell.  It should be noted, however, that Jesus tells this story as a parable, and its meaning may not literally define the existence in the afterlife, but instead serve as a lesson about the dangers of wealth and the unwillingness to listen to God.

As [[light]] and brightness were associated with God and Heaven, it is not strange that darkness was associated with Hell. Concerning the fire, some [[scholar]]s speculated that the idea came from the fire consecrated to some [[Paganism|Pagan]] deities like [[Adramelech]], [[Moloch]], etc., to whom children were sacrificed by throwing them into the flames; but other scholars, more recently, speculated that, since Hell is considered an underground place, fire was associated with volcanic eruptions; the idea that [[volcano]]es could be [[gateway]]s to Hell was present in the mind of the ancient [[Roman religion|Romans]], and later of [[Iceland]]ers and other [[Europe]]an peoples. Some claim that the conditions thought to prevail in Hell are influenced by the generally hot, dry [[climate]]s found in the cradlelands of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] alike; these observers point to the fact that the equivalent of Hell in [[Norse mythology]], known as [[Niflheim]], is pictured as a cold, foggy place (the name itself meaning &quot;home of the fog&quot;).

Medieval imagination added [[cauldron]]s inside which people will be &quot;cooked&quot; forever by demons and [[Christian demonology]] acquired a &quot;terrifying&quot; aspect concerning imagery of Hell. Medieval theologians were keen to portray all manner of hideous [[torture]]s, designed to inflict horrific pain upon the eternally-damned inhabitants of Hell.

More recently and to ''some'' theologians, the idea of an underground Hell gave place to the conception of an abstract spiritual status in an also intangible plane of existence, which is sometimes associated to a site in an unknown point of the universe or also abstract, but [[tradition]] continues referring to Hell as &quot;down&quot;, meanwhile [[religion]] refers to it as the place of eternal [[punishment]] and torment, far from God's presence ([[2 Thessalonians]] 1:9).

Jeff Priddy, writing in [http://www.godstruthfortoday.org/Library/priddy/ibi_4_2.htm The ''Idle Babbler Illustrated'' (Volume 4, Issue 2)], expresses the problem:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The religious and secular man's nightmarish ideas of HELL (that is, of a Christ-managed hothouse where sinners get burned forever) come to them compliments of ... careless translating ... the practice of ignoring separate Greek words.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2 Pet. 2:4, God chose the Greek word &quot;Tartaros&quot; (&amp;#964;&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#964;&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#959;&amp;#969;; English transliteration, &quot;[[Tartarus]]&quot;) to identify the temporary abode of sinning angels. Tartarus holds spirit beings, not humans, and there is not a flame on the premises. The KJV and NIV translators (neither of whose versions have any influence in the expression of Eastern Orthodox doctrine) gave this specific Greek word the English equivalent, &quot;hell&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In [[Matthew 5:22]] (and in several other places), God chose a different Greek word, &quot;[[Geenna]],&quot; (English transliteration: &quot;[[Gehenna]]&quot;) to name a valley on the southwest corner of Jerusalem where the corpses of criminals will be disposed of during the thousand-year kingdom. There are flames here, yes, but the flames cremate the dead (Is. 66:24), they don't torture the living. Most of humanity is not even alive to see Gehenna (Rev. 20:5), let alone be tormented there. The KJV and NIV translators gave this specific Greek word the English equivalent, &quot;hell&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Luke 16:23 (and in other places), God chose the Greek word, &quot;hades&quot;, to describe the state of invisibility; in Greek, the word means &quot;unseen&quot;. God uses this word often to describe a person's nonexistence in death: unless spoken of figuratively, a dead person doesn't see anything, hear anything, feel anything, know anything, do anything: hades. Flames, screams, pointy tails and pitchforks are conspicuously absent. All the dead &quot;go&quot; here, not just the wicked. The KJV and NIV translators gave this specific Greek word the English equivalent, &quot;hell&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Priddy goes on to point out that if a (Western) Christian says that someone is in &quot;Hell&quot;, that &quot;is a terrible lack of information&quot;, because many versions of the Bible indiscriminately use the word &quot;Hell&quot; to describe three different places. If you press the point, and the Christian says that person is in Gehenna, then you could take a plane to Jerusalem and look for the person there. If the claim is that the person is in Tartarus, you can point out that they were never a stubborn, sinning angel who surrendered their sovereignty during the days of Noah (1 Pet. 3:19-20. 2 Pet. 2:4, Jude 6). And if in Hades, you could rejoice that, like Christ (Acts 2:3 l), David (Ps. 16: 10), and Jacob (Gn. 37:35) before him, the person has ceased from their troubles and sufferings (Jb. 3:11-19), and now rests, as if asleep (Jn. 11:11,14). However, given the perfectly natural evolution of concepts over a long period of time, examples such as [[Sheol]], provide us with a good example of how ideas can begin with a simple meaning  - &quot;the grave&quot; - and morph into a far larger concept - a place of eternal torment.

====Words in the Bible translated as &quot;hell&quot;====
The Greek words &quot;[[Hades]]&quot; and &quot;[[Gehenna]]&quot; are sometimes translated into the word &quot;hell&quot;, though the concepts are dissimilar.
Martin Luther, for example, translated the word &quot;[[Hades]]&quot; five times as the German word for &quot;hell&quot; (Hölle) (for example Matthew 16,18), and twice as &quot;the dead&quot;, twice as the &quot;world of the dead&quot;, and once as &quot;his kingdom&quot; (all in German). &quot;[[Gehenna]]&quot; was translated by Martin Luther eight times as &quot;hell&quot; (for example: Matthew 5,22,29,30; 18,9; Mark 9,43,45; and so on) and four times as &quot;hellish&quot;. In [[Norse mythology]] the underworld was a cold, monotonous place, which was commanded by the goddess [[Hel (being)|Hel]]. The place was called [[Hel (realm)|Hel]], too.

Newer translations of the Bible translate &quot;Hades&quot; or &quot;[[Sheol]]&quot; into the words &quot;world of dead&quot;, &quot;underworld&quot;, &quot;grave&quot;, &quot;crypt&quot; or similar, but still translate the word &quot;Gehenna&quot; into the word &quot;hell&quot;.

The word &quot;Hades&quot; of the [[New Testament]] is the Greek translation of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word &quot;Sheol&quot; of the [[Old Testament]] (Ap. 2,27, Psalm 16,10). What happens in Hades, or rather Sheol, ''[[Ecclesiastes]]'' tells us: &quot;for in the Sheol, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.&quot; (Ecclesiastes 9,10) and &quot;For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no further reward, and even the memory of them is forgotten. &quot; (''Ecclesiastes'' 9,5; see also Psalm 89,49; 139,8; Numbers 16,30). &quot;The Lord brings death and makes alive; he brings down to the [[Sheol]] and raises up. &quot; (1. Samuel 2,6). The souls of all human beings are going to Hades, whether they believe or not (Joh. 5,28-29; Job 3,11-19, 14,13; Ez 32,18-32; Ps. 31,17; Dan. 12,2).

Geenna (or [[Gehenna]]) is the name of a real place. It comes from Hebrew and means &quot;Gorge of Hinnom (Ge-Hinnom)&quot;. This gorge can still be visited today near Jerusalem. In the time of the [[Old Testament]]  it was a place where children were sacrificed to the Ammonite god [[Molech]] (2 Kings 23,10). That cultic practice was, according to the Old Testament, imitated by King Solomon in the 10th Century B.C.E. and under the leadership of king Manasseh in the 7th Century B.C.E. and in times of crisis until the time of exile of the Jews in Babylon (6th Century B.C.E.). The prophet Jeremiah, who condemned that cult strictly, called the valley the &quot;gorge of killing&quot; (Jeremiah 7,31-32; 19,5-9). [[Gehenna]] became later a central garbage dump, to stop the practice of child sacrifice. At the turn of the 1st Century C.E. the gorge was used also to burn the dead bodies of criminals after their execution. The imagination of burning dead bodies probably inspired Jewish, and later Christian theologians to translate that place into the word &quot;hell&quot;.

The sea of fire after the last tribunal in  ''Revelation'' 20,14 isn't translated into the word &quot;hell&quot;, but sometimes gets the connotations of &quot;hell&quot;. In that sea of fire are thrown the beast, the devil, the false prophet, and Hell (Hades) itself, along with evil-doers, according to Revelation 20,12-15. &quot;And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for aeons of aeons.&quot; (Revelation 20,10)  Many people mistakenly assume &quot;Ages of Ages&quot; to mean forever, but Aeon is definitely a fixed length.  See [http://www.kingdomlife.com/kingdom/timeand1.htm]

The Old Testament makes a somewhat contradictory statement; in ''Lamentations'' 3:31-32 (NIV), we read:
:31 For men '''are not''' cast off, by the Lord '''forever'''.
:32 Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, so great is his unfailing love.

[[Image:Hieronymus Bosch - The Garden of Earthly Delights - Hell.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Hell as depicted in the [[triptych]] [[The Garden of Earthly Delights]].]]
In Protestant [[Christianity]], Hell is a place desig are located in a residential neigborhood half a mile northwest of the Yard called the [[Quadrangle (Harvard)|Quadrangle]].

===Residential Houses===
[[Image:Tower_in_spring_fade_167.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The blue dome of [[Lowell House]]]]Nearly all students at Harvard College live on campus. First-year students live in the [[List of Harvard dormitories|freshman dormitories]] in or near [[Harvard Yard]]. Upperclass students live mainly in a system of twelve residential &quot;Houses&quot;, which serve as administrative units of the College as well as dormitories. Each House is presided over by a &quot;Master&quot;&amp;mdash;a senior faculty member who is responsible for guiding the social life and community of the House&amp;mdash;and a &quot;[[Allston Burr Senior Tutor|Senior Tutor]]&quot;, who acts as [[dean (education)|dean]] of the students in the House in its administrative role. 

The House system was instituted by [[President of Harvard University|Harvard president]] [[Abbott Lawrence Lowell]] in the 1930s, although the number of Houses, their demographics, and the methods by which students are assigned to particular Houses have all changed drastically since the founding of the system. Funds for the Houses were donated by Edward Harkness, a Yale graduate, who had previously failed to persuade Yale of its merits (but which later adopted a very similar &quot;college&quot; system).  Lowell modeled it on the system of constituent [[college]]s of [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and the Houses borrow terminology from Oxford and Cambridge such as [[Junior Common Room]] (the set of undergraduates affiliated with a House) and [[Senior Common Room]] (the Master, Senior Tutor, and other faculty members, advisors, and graduate students associated with the House). Non-faculty members of the Senior Common Room of a House are given the title &quot;Tutor&quot;.

Nine of the Houses are situated south of Harvard Yard, near the busy commercial district of [[Harvard Square]], along or close to the northern banks of the [[Charles River]], and so are known colloquially as the River Houses. These are:
*[[Adams House (Harvard University)|Adams House]], named for several alumni of that name, including U. S. President [[John Adams]];
*[[Dunster House]], named for Harvard's first President, [[Henry Dunster]];
*[[Eliot House]], named for Harvard President [[Charles William Eliot]];
*[[Kirkland House]], named for Harvard President [[John Thornton Kirkland]];
*[[Leverett House]], named for Harvard President [[John Leverett]];
*[[Lowell House]], said to be named for the Harvard-affiliated [[Lowell family]] in general (but the most obvious reference is to Abbott Lawrence Lowell);
*[[Mather House]], named for Harvard President [[Increase Mather]];
*[[Quincy House]], named for Harvard President (and sometime mayor of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]) [[Josiah Quincy III]];

[[Image:Pforzheimerhouse.jpeg|right|thumb|300px|The [[Quadrangle (Harvard)|Quad]], looking north toward [[Pforzheimer House]]]]
The remainder of the residential Houses are located around [[Quadrangle (Harvard)|Harvard's Quadrangle]] (or &quot;the Quad&quot;, formerly the &quot;Radcliffe Quadrangle&quot;), in a more [[suburb]]an residential neighborhood half a mile (800 m) northwest of Harvard Yard. These housed [[Radcliffe College]] students until Radcliffe merged its residential system with Harvard. They are:

*[[Cabot House]], previously called ''South House'', renamed in 1983 for Harvard donors [[Thomas Dudley Cabot]] and Virginia Cabot;
*[[Currier House]], named for Radcliffe alumna Audrey Bruce Currier;
*[[Pforzheimer House]], often called ''PfoHo'' for short, previously called ''North House'', renamed in 1995 for Harvard donors Carl and Carol Pforzheimer

There is a thirteenth House, [[Dudley House]] [http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~dudley/], which is nonresidential but fulfills, for some graduate students and off-campus undergraduates (including members of the [http://hcs.harvard.edu/~dudcoop/ Dudley Co-op]) the same administrative and social functions as the residential Houses do for undergraduates who live on campus. It is named after [[Thomas Dudley]], who signed the charter of Harvard College when he was [[Governors of the Massachusetts Bay Colony|Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony]].

[[Radcliffe Yard]], the center of the campus of the former Radcliffe College (and now Radcliffe Institute), is west of Harvard Yard, adjacent to the Graduate School of Education.

===Major campus expansion===
Throughout the past several years, Harvard has purchased large tracts of land in [[Allston]], a short walk across the Charles River from Cambridge, with the intent of [http://www.allston.harvard.edu/ major expansion southward]. The university now owns approximately fifty percent more land in Allston than in Cambridge. Various proposals to connect the traditional Cambridge campus with the new Allston campus include new and enlarged bridges, a shuttle service and/or a [[tram]].

One of the foremost driving forces for Harvard's pending expansion is its goal of substantially increasing the scope and strength of its science and technology programs. The university plans to construct two 500,000 square foot (50,000 m&amp;sup2;) research complexes in Allston, which would be home to several interdisciplinary programs, including the [[Harvard Stem Cell Institute]] and an enlarged [[Engineering]] department.

In addition, Harvard intends to relocate the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]] and the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] to Allston. The university also plans to construct several new undergraduate and graduate student housing centers in Allston, and it is considering large-scale museums and performing arts complexes as well.

==History==
[[Image:Harvard 1740 by William Burgis.jpg|thumb|300px|&quot;A prospect of the colledges in Cambridge in New England&quot;. Engraving by [[William Burgis]] from 1740.]]
Harvard's foundation in 1636 came in the form of an act of the colony's [[Massachusetts General Court | Great and General Court]]. By all accounts the chief impetus was to allow the training of home-grown clergy so the [[Puritan]] colony would not need to rely on immigrating graduates of England's [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] universities for well-educated pastors, &quot;dreading,&quot; as a 1643 brochure put it, &quot;to leave an illiterate Ministry to the Churches.&quot;  In its first year, seven of the original nine students left to fight in the [[English Civil War]].

Harvard was also founded as a school to educate American Indians in order to train them as ministers among their tribes.  Harvard's Charter of 1650 calls for &quot;the education of the English and Indian youth of this Country in knowledge and godliness&quot;.  Indeed, Harvard and missionaries to the local tribes were intricately connected.  The first Bible to be printed in the entire North American continent was printed at Harvard in an Indian language, Massachusett.  Termed the Eliot Bible since it was translated by John Eliot, this book was used to facilitate conversion of Indians, ideally by Harvard-educated Indians themselves.  Harvard's first American Indian graduate, Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck from the Wampanoag tribe, was a member of the class of 1665.  Caleb and other students-- English and American Indian alike-- lived and studied in a dormitory known as the Indian College, which was founded in 1655 under then-President Charles Chauncy. In 1698 it was torn down owing to neglect. The bricks of the former Indian College were later used to build the first Stoughton Hall.  Today a plaque on the SE side of Matthews Hall in Harvard Yard, the approximate site of the Indian College, commemorates the first American Indian students who lived and studied at Harvard University.  

[[Image:Rhinoceros Sculpture, Biological Sciences Building, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Rhinoceros sculpture, Biological Sciences Building.]]
The connection to the Puritans can be seen in the fact that, for its first few centuries of existence, the [[Harvard Board of Overseers]] included, along with certain commonwealth officials, the ministers of six local congregations (Boston, Cambridge, Charlestown, Dorchester, Roxbury and Watertown), who today, although no longer so empowered, are still by custom allowed seats on the dais at [[commencement]] exercises.

Despite the Puritan atmosphere, from the beginning the intent was to provide a full [[liberal arts|liberal education]] such as that offered at European universities, including the rudiments of mathematics and science ('natural philosophy') as well as [[the classics | classical]] literature and philosophy. 

During the Revolutionary War, [[George Washington|General Washington]] and the Continental Army quartered in Harvard buildings and organized military exercises in Cambridge Common.

Between 1800 and 1870 a transformation of Harvard occurred which E. Digby Baltzell{{ref|baltzell}} calls &quot;privatization.&quot; Harvard had prosperred while [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] controlled state government, but &quot;in 1824 the federalist party was finally defeated forever in Massachusetts; the triumphant [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Jeffersonian-Republicans]] cut off all state funds.&quot; By 1870, the &quot;magistrates and ministers&quot; on the Board of Overseers had been completely &quot;replaced by Harvard alumni drawn primarily from the ranks of Boston's upper-class business and professional community&quot; and funded by private endowment.

During this period, Harvard experienced unparalleled growth that put it into a different category from other colleges. Ronald Story{{ref|story2}} notes in 1850, Harvard's total assets were &quot;five times that of Amherst and Williams combined, and three times that of Yale.... By 1850, it was a genuine university, 'unequalled in facilities,' as a budding scholar put it by any other institution in America&amp;mdash;the 'greatest University,' said another, 'in all creation.'&quot;

Story{{ref|story3}} also notes that &quot;all the evidence... points to the four decades from 1815 to 1855 as the era when parents, in Henry Adams's words, began 'sending their children to Harvard College for the sake of its social advantages.'&quot;

Steinberg{{ref|steinberg}} notes that &quot;a climate of intolerance prevailed in many eastern colleges long before discriminatory quotas were contemplated&quot; and noted that &quot;Jews tended to avoid such campuses as Yale and Princeton, which had reputations for bigotry.... Under President Eliot's administration, Harvard earned a reputation as the most liberal and democratic of the Big Three, and therefore Jews did not feel that the avenue to a prestigious college was altogether closed.&quot; This was to change sharply under Eliot's successor, A. Lawrence Lowell. 

Harvard became the bastion of a distinctly Protestant elite--the so-called [[Boston Brahmin]] class--well into the 20th century. Its discriminatory policies against immigrants, Catholics and Jews were partly responsible for the founding of [[Boston College]] in the 19th century and [[Brandeis University]] in 1948. The social milieu at Harvard is depicted in [[Owen Wister]]'s ''Philosophy 4,'' set in the 1870s, which contrasts the character and demeanor of two undergraduates who &quot;had colonial names (Rogers, I think, and Schuyler)&quot; with that of their tutor, one Oscar Maironi, whose &quot;parents had come over in the steerage.&quot; [[Myron Kaufman]]'s 1957 novel ''Remember Me to God'' follows the life of a Jewish undergraduate in 1940s Harvard, navigating the shoals of casual antisemitism as he desperately seeks to become a gentleman, be accepted into The Pudding, and marry the Yankee protestant Wimsy Talbot. 

In 2002, it was revealed by ''The Crimson'' that in 1920 &quot;Harvard University maliciously persecuted and harassed&quot; those it believed to be gay via a &quot;Secret Court&quot; led by Harvard President A. Lawrence Lowell. The inquistions and expulsions carried out by this tribunal, in conjunction with the &quot;vindictive tenacity of the university in ensuring that the stigmatization of the expelled students would persist throughout their productive lives&quot; led to several suicides. Wright placed the origins of the purge in an astounding ignorance of the day's most advanced thinking about sexual inversion, an excessive idealization of the idea of the &quot;Harvard man&quot;, and an anxiety to dissociate the university from a reputation as a haven for homosexuals. Current President Lawrence Summers characterized the episode as &quot;Part of a past that we have rightly left behind&quot;, and &quot;abhorrent and an affront to the values of our university&quot;.{{ref|secretcourt}}

===Recent developments===
[[Image:Harvard college - annenberg hall.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Destroyed by fire in the 1950s, Memorial Hall's ornate tower was rebuilt in 1999]]
On February 21, 2006, president [[Lawrence Summers]] announced his intention to resign the presidency, effective June 30, 2006. His resignation came just one week before a second planned vote of no confidence by the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Former president [[Derek Bok]] will serve as interim president starting July 1. Members of Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which instructs graduate students in GSAS and undergraduates in Harvard College, had passed an earlier motion of &quot;lack of confidence&quot; in Summers' leadership on March 15, 2005 by a 218-185 vote, with 18 abstentions.  The motion was prompted by his public comments in a talk about the place of women in academia.  In response, Summers convened two committees to study this issue: the Task Force on Women Faculty and the Task Force on Women in Science and Engineering. Summers had also pledged $50 million to support their recommendations and other proposed reforms. 

In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], Harvard, along with numerous other institutions of higher education across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], offered to take in students who were unable to attend universities and colleges that were closed for the fall semester.  Twenty-five students were admitted to the College, and the [[Harvard Law School| Law School]] made similar arrangements.  Tuition was not charged and housing was provided.

Controversy ensued, however, when the Administrative Board ruled that those students visiting from [[Tulane University]] would have to return to their home college for spring semester, and would not be able to apply for inter-year transfer, a policy consistent with other comparable universities like [[Yale University|Yale]]'s. The Undergraduate Council advocated for the students to stay or be allowed inter-year transfer rights, whereas the Crimson posted occasional op-ed pieces about the necessity of the students leaving to maintain integrity of contracts.

==Notable student organizations==
&lt;!-- all but the most notable and historically significant student organizations should be placed in their respective school articles (College, KSG, HLS, etc...--&gt;
* The [[Harvard Crimson]] is United States' second oldest daily college newspaper and is doordropped to student rooms.
* The [[Harvard Lampoon]], an undergraduate humor organization and publication founded in 1876 and rival to the Harvard Crimson. The erratically-produced magazine was originally modelled on the former British satirical periodical Punch, and has outlived it to become the world's second-oldest humor magazine (after the Yale Record). [[Conan O'Brien]] was president of the Lampoon. The [[National Lampoon]] was founded as an offshoot in 1970 from the [[Harvard Lampoon]].
* Radio station [[WHRB]] (95.3FM Cambridge), is run exclusively by Harvard students, and is given space on the Harvard campus in the basement of Pennypacker Hall, a freshman dorm. Known throughout the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] metropolitan area for its classical, jazz, underground rock and blues programming, WHRB uses the radio &quot;Orgy&quot; format, where the entire catalog of a certain band, record, or artist is played in sequence.
[[Image:Lampoon.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The Harvard Lampoon &quot;castle&quot; with its characteristic rooftop ibis and its purple and yellow door]]
* The [http://www.iop.harvard.edu Institute of Politics], housed in Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and features keynotes daily, student study groups with political activists and leaders, and a center of nonpartisan political community at Harvard.
* [http://www.uchoir.harvard.edu/  Harvard University Choir], the oldest university choir in the nation, formally established in 1834 but in existence since the eighteenth century, performs the oldest Christmas Carol Services in continuous existence in North America.
* [[Harvard Glee Club]], the oldest college chorus in America, founded in 1858.
* [[Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra]], founded in 1808.

==Views of Harvard==

In 1893, Baedeker's guidebook called Harvard &quot;the oldest, richest, and most famous of American seats of learning.&quot; The first two facts remain true today; the third is also arguably true. As of 2005, Harvard was ranked first among world universities by [[Times Higher Education Supplement]] and the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]][http://ed.sjtu.edu.cn/rank/2005/ARWU2005_Top100.htm] and shared the first spot with [[Princeton_University|Princeton]] in [[US News and World Report]] rankings.

Perhaps because of this prominence, Harvard is the target of a number of criticisms, some of them leveled at other research-based American universities.  It has been accused of  [[grade inflation]], as have other Ivy League institutions and [[Stanford University]].{{ref|princetongrades}}.  The [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', and some students have criticized Harvard for its reliance on [[teaching assistant|teaching fellows]] in undergraduate education, as many in the faculty are engaged in research (assistant teaching is not taken into account by the major [[college and university rankings]]); they consider this to be detrimental to the quality of education.{{ref|nytimestfteach}}{{ref|carnegietfteach}} The New York Times article also detailed that the problem was prevalent in other Ivy League schools.

The Boston Globe reported obtaining a 21-page Harvard internal memorandum that expressed concern about undergraduate student satisfaction based on the Consortium on Financing Higher Education (COFHE) survey of 31 top universities.  [http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2005/03/29/student_life_at_harvard_lags_peer_schools_poll_finds/]    The Harvard internal memorandum noted that: &quot;Harvard students are less satisfied with their undergraduate educations than the students at almost all of the other COFHE schools.  Harvard student satisfaction compares even less favorably to satisfaction at our closest peer institutions.&quot;  While the actual survey results as reported by the Globe are open to interpretation, the Harvard Crimson editorial board opined that &quot;we believe the implications of this survey are significant, and  the administration ought to make satisfying undergraduates a top priority for the near future.&quot; [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=506807] The Globe quoted Lawrence Buell, former Harvard Dean of Undergraduate Education, as saying &quot;I think we have to concede that we are letting our students down.&quot;

The Globe presented COFHE survey results and quotes from Harvard students that suggest problems with faculty availability, quality of instruction, quality of advising, social life on campus, and sense of community dating back to at least 1994.  The magazine section of the Harvard Crimson echoed similar academic and social criticisms. [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=350153] [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=350154]  The Harvard Crimson quoted Harvard College Dean Benedict Gross as being aware of and committed to improving the issues raised by the COFHE survey.  [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=506758]  However, in the same article, Harvard Professor Harvey C. Mansfield expressed skepticism at the willingness of faculty to improve the undergraduate experience: &quot;I think the administration has a commitment to improving Harvard, but I don't think the majority of the faculty does.  They are the ones who are complacent and deserve most of the criticism.&quot; 

The undergraduate admissions office's [[legacy preferences|preference for children of alumni]]{{ref|legacy}} has been the subject of much scrutiny and debate. Under new financial aid guidelines, parents in families with incomes of less than $40,000 will no longer be expected to contribute any money at all to the cost of attending Harvard for their children, including room and board. Families in the $40,000 to $60,000 contribute an amount of only a few thousand dollars a year.

Harvard and Harvard students have also frequently been criticized for self-promotion in various forms, although it is somewhat unclear how this differentiates Harvard from the school pride of any other university.  In ''&quot;A Flood of Crimson Ink&quot;'' ([[Wall Street Journal]], April, 2005) [http://www.opinionjournal.com/forms/printThis.html?id=110006623], the author asserts that one reason Harvard receives much attention from the press is because &quot;Harvard graduates are disproportionately represented in the upper echelons of American journalism.&quot; Critics of Harvard self-marketing charge that the school is filled with students &quot;specifically selected for their skills at self-promotion&quot; [http://maroon.uchicago.edu/viewpoints/articles/2005/05/09/its_no_surprise_that.php].  This undoubtedly applies to other top schools in view of what is necessary to gain acceptance to highly competitve universities in the U.S. today.

'''Harry Connick, Jr.''' (born [[September 11]], [[1967]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[Popular Music/Performers|singer]], [[pianist]], [[actor]], and [[humanitarian]].  
His music encompasses [[jazz]], some of it very much in the style of the [[crooner]]s of the [[1940s]] and early [[1950s|'50s]], [[funk]] and [[blues]]. He married model [[Jill Goodacre]] in [[1994]].  They have three daughters: Georgia Tatom (April 17, 1996), Sarah Kate (September 12, 1997), and Charlotte (June 26, 2002).  He is a prime organizer and captain of the [[Krewe of Orpheus]], a music-based krewe, taking its name from [[Orpheus]] of Classical mythology. The Krewe of Orpheus parades on St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street on Lundi Gras (Fat Monday) &amp;mdash; the day before [[Mardi Gras]] (Fat Tuesday).

==Early history==

Harry Connick, Jr., was born '''Joseph Harry Fowler Connick''' in New Orleans, [[Louisiana]], on September 11, 1967. His father, [[Harry Connick, Sr.]], was of [[Irish Catholic]] descent and the [[district attorney]] of [[New Orleans]] for 27 years; his [[New York]]-born [[Jewish]] mother was a [[Lousiana]] [[Supreme Court Justice]]. His parents also owned a record store. Connick's musical talents soon came to the fore when he learned the keyboards at the age of three, played publicly at six and recorded with a local jazz band at 10. His musical talents were developed at the [[New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts]] and under the tutelage of [[Ellis Marsalis, Jr.|Ellis Marsalis]] and [[James Booker]].

Connick attended [[Jesuit High School, New Orleans|Jesuit High School]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].  He moved to [[New York City]] to study at [[Hunter College]] and the [[Manhattan School of Music]], where a [[Columbia Records]] executive persuaded him to sign with that label. His first record, ''[[Harry Connick Jr. (album)|Harry Connick Jr.]]'', was a mainly instrumental album of standards. He soon acquired a reputation in jazz due to extended stays at high-profile New York venues. His second album, ''[[20 (album)|20]]'', featured his vocals and added to this reputation.

== ''When Harry Met Sally...''&amp;mdash;chart and movie success ==
With Connick's growing reputation, director [[Rob Reiner]] asked him to provide a soundtrack for his [[1989]] [[romantic comedy]] ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'', starring [[Meg Ryan]] and [[Billy Crystal]]. The soundtrack consisted of several standards, including &quot;[[It Had to Be You (song)|It Had to Be You]]&quot;, &quot;Let's Call the Whole Thing Off&quot; and &quot;Don't Get Around Much Anymore&quot;, and achieved double-platinum status in the United States. He won his first [[Grammy]] for Best Jazz Male Vocal Performance for his work on the soundtrack.

Connick made his screen debut in ''[[Memphis Belle (film)|Memphis Belle]]'' ([[1990]]), about a [[B-17]] bomber crew in World War II. In that year, he began a two-year world tour. Not content with that, he released two albums in July 1990: the jazz trio album ''[[Lofty's Roach Souffle]]'' and another album of standards titled ''[[We Are in Love]]'', which also went double platinum. ''We Are in Love'' earned him his second consecutive Grammy for Best Jazz Male Vocal.

&quot;[[Promise Me You'll Remember]]&quot;, his contribution to the [[The Godfather Part III (soundtrack)|Godfather III soundtrack]], was nominated for both an [[Academy Award]] and a [[Golden Globe]] in [[1991]]. In a year of recognition, he was also nominated for an [[Emmy]] for Best Performance in a Variety Special for his [[PBS]] special ''[[Swingin' Out Live]]'', which was also released as a video. In October 1991, he released his third consecutive multi-platinum album, ''[[Blue Light, Red Light]]'', on which he wrote and arranged the songs. In October 1991, he starred in ''[[Little Man Tate]]'', directed by [[Jodie Foster]], playing the friend of a child prodigy who goes to college.

Harry Connick, Jr., was arrested in [[1992]] and charged with having a 9mm pistol in his possession at [[JFK International Airport]]. After spending a day in jail, he agreed to make a public-service television commercial warning against breaking gun laws. The court agreed to drop all charges if Connick stayed out of trouble for six months.

In November 1992, Connick released ''[[25 (album)|25]]'', a solo piano collection of standards that again went platinum. He also re-released the album ''[[11 (Harry Connick Jr. album)|Eleven]]''. Harry Connick, Jr., contributed &quot;A Wink and a Smile&quot; to the ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'' soundtrack, released in [[1993]]. His multi-platinum album of holiday songs, ''[[When My Heart Finds Christmas]]'', was the best-selling Christmas album in 1993.

==Flirtation with funk in the mid-[[1990s]]==

In [[1994]], Harry Connick, Jr., decided to branch out, releasing ''[[She (album)|She]]'', an album of New Orleans [[funk]] that also went platinum. In addition, he released a song called &quot;(I Could Only) Whisper Your Name&quot; for the soundtrack of ''[[The Mask]]'', starring [[Jim Carrey]], which is his most successful single in the United States to date. He took his funk music on a tour of the United Kingdom in 1994, an effort that did not please all of his fans, who were expecting a jazz crooner. One fan who walked out said, &quot;We expected Frank Sinatra but we got [[Motörhead]] instead.&quot; The music was actually more reminiscent of [[the Meters]] rather than Motörhead. Connick also took his funk music to the [[People's Republic of China]] in [[1995]], playing at the [[Shanghai Center Theatre]]. The performance was televised live in China for what became known as the [[Shanghai]] [[Gumbo]] special.

Connick played a homicidal killer in his third film, ''[[Copycat (movie)|Copycat]]'' (1995), which starred [[Holly Hunter]] and [[Sigourney Weaver]]. The next year, he released his second funk album, ''[[Star Turtle]]'', which did not sell as well as previous albums, although it did reach No. 38 on the charts. However, he appeared in the most successful movie of that year, ''[[Independence Day (movie)]]'', with [[Will Smith]] and [[Jeff Goldblum]].

==Back to basics: return to jazz, 1999&amp;mdash;current==

For his [[1997]] release ''[[To See You]]'', Connick recorded original love songs, touring the United States and Europe with a full symphony orchestra backing him and his piano in each city. As part of his tour, he played at the [[Nobel Peace Prize Concert]] in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], with his final concert of that tour in [[Paris]] being recorded for a [[St. Valentine's Day]] special on PBS in [[1998]]. He also starred in ''[[Excess Baggage]]'' opposite [[Alicia Silverstone]] and [[Benicio del Toro]] in 1997. 

In May 1998, he had his first leading role in a movie in ''[[Hope Floats]]'', with [[Sandra Bullock]] as his female lead. He released ''[[Come By Me]]'', his first album of [[big band]] music in eight years in [[1999]], and embarked on a world tour visiting the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia. In addition, he provided the voice of Dean McCoppin in the animated film ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' in that year.

Connick was involved in writing the soundtrack for [[Susan Stroman]]'s [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theater|musical]] ''[[Thou Shalt Not (musical)|Thou Shalt Not]]'', based on [[Émile Zola]]'s novel ''[[Thérèse Raquin]]'', in [[2000]]; it premiered in [[2001]]. It was nominated for a [[Tony Award]]. He was also the narrator of the film ''[[My Dog Skip]]'', released in that year. 

In March 2001, Connick starred in a television production of ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' with [[Glenn Close]], televised on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network. He also starred in his twelfth movie, ''[[Mickey (2004 movie)|Mickey]]'', featuring a screenplay by [[John Grisham]] that same year. In October 2001, he again released two albums: ''[[Songs I Heard]]'', featuring big band reworkings of children's show themes, and ''[[30 (album)|30]]'', featuring Connick on piano with guest appearances by several other musical artists. ''Songs I Heard'' won Connick another Grammy for best traditional pop album and he toured performing songs from the album, holding matinees at which each parent had to be accompanied by a child.

Connick appeared as Grace Adler's boyfriend (and later husband) [[Leo Markus]] on the [[NBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'' from [[2002]] to [[2004]]. In July 2003, Connick released his first instrumental album in fifteen years, ''[[Other Hours Connick on Piano Volume 1]]''. It was released on [[Branford Marsalis]]'s new label [[Marsalis Music]] and led to a short tour of nightclubs and small theaters.

Connick appeared in the film ''[[Basic (movie)|Basic]]'' with [[John Travolta]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. In October 2003, he released his second Christmas album, ''[[Harry for the Holidays]]'', which went  gold and reached No. 12 on the [[Billboard 200]] album chart. He also had a television special on [[NBC]] featuring [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Nathan Lane]], [[Marc Anthony]] and [[Kim Burrell]]. ''[[Only You (Harry Connick Jr)|Only You]]'', his seventeenth album for Columbia Records, was released in February [[2004]]. A collection of [[1950s]] and [[1960s]] ballads, ''Only You'', went Top Ten on both sides of the Atlantic and was certified gold in the United States in March 2004. The ''Only You'' tour with big band went on in America, Australia and a short trip to Asia. ''Harry for the Holidays'' was certified platinum in November 2004. A music DVD ''Harry Connick Jr. - &quot;Only You&quot; in Concert'' was released in March 2004, after it had first aired as a ''Great Performances'' special on [[PBS]]. The special won him an [[Emmy]] for Outstanding Music Direction. The DVD received a Gold &amp; Platinum Music Video - Long Form awards from the RIAA in November 2005.  

An animated holiday special, ''[[The Happy Elf]]'', aired on NBC in December 2005, and had Connick as the composer, the narrator, and one of the executive producers. Shortly after, it was released on DVD. The holiday special was based on his original song ''The Happy Elf'', from his 2003 album ''[[Harry for the Holidays]]''. Another album from [[Marsalis Music]] was recorded in 2005, ''[[Occasion : Connick on Piano, Volume 2]]'', a duo album with Harry Connick, Jr on piano together with [[Branford Marsalis]] on saxophone. A music dvd, ''[[A Duo Occasion]]'', was filmed at the [[Ottawa International Jazz Festival]] 2005 in Canada, and released in November 2005. 
He appeared in another episode of NBC sitcom ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'' in November 2005, and will appear in additional 3 episodes in 2006. ''[[Bug (2006 movie)|Bug]]'', a film directed by [[William Friedkin]], is a psychological thriller filmed in 2005, starring Connick, [[Ashley Judd]], and Michael Shannon. The film will be released in 2006. He is currently starring in the Broadway revival of ''[[The Pajama Game]]'', produced by the Roundabout Theater Company, along with [[Michael McKean]] and [[Kelli O'Hara]], at the ''American Airlines Theatre''.  It opened [[February 23]] [[2006]], and is scheduled to run until [[June 18]] [[2006]].

==Involvement for Hurricane Katrina Victims==

===NBC-sponsored [[benefit concert]]===
On September 2, 2005, Harry Connick, Jr. helped to organize, and appeared in, the [[NBC]]-sponsored live telethon concert, ''[[A Concert for Hurricane Relief]]'', for relief in the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. As a native son of New Orleans, he spent several days touring the city, attempting to draw attention to the plight of citizens stranded at the [[New Orleans Convention Center]] and other places. At the concert he paired with host [[Matt Lauer]] ([[Today Show]]), and entertainers including [[Tim McGraw]], [[Faith Hill]], [[Kanye West]], [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]], and [[John Goodman]]. 

===Habitat For Humanity===
6 September 2005, New Orleans native Harry Connick Jr. is made honorary chair of [[Habitat for Humanity]]’s “[[Habitat for Humanity|Operation Home Delivery]],” a long-term rebuilding plan for families victimized by Hurricane Katrina in the [[Big Easy]] and along the [[Gulf Coast]]. 

====Musicians' Village====
Harry Connick Jr. and [[Branford Marsalis]] came up with an initiative to help restore [[New Orleans]]'s musical [[Cultural heritage|heritage]]. Habitat for Humanity and New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity, working with Harry Connick Jr. and Branford Marsalis announced December 6, 2005, plans for a Musicians' Village in New Orleans. The Musicians' Village will include Habitat-constructed homes, with a ''Ellis Marsalis Center for Music'', as the area's centerpiece. The Habitat-built homes will provide [[musicians]] of modest means the opportunity to buy decent, affordable housing.

Finally, students may choose an off-campus major offered by any of the other [[Claremont Colleges]], provided they also complete a minor in one of the technical fields that Mudd offers majors.

Because of its [[mission statement]], Harvey Mudd places an unusually strong emphasis on general science education outside one's major, with a full one-third of courses in this area, known as the &quot;common core.&quot; Students are required to take another one-third of their courses in the humanities, keeping with the school's tradition of science with a conscience. The final one-third is composed of courses in the student's major. The integration of research and education is an important component of the educational experience at Harvey Mudd; by the time they graduate, every student has had some kind of research experience, in the form of a senior thesis or a Clinic Program experience. The undergraduate focus of HMC means that, unlike many other science and engineering institutions, undergraduates at HMC get unique access to research positions over the summer and during the school year.

A unique aspect of an HMC education is the Clinic Program, in which teams of students work for a year on a project supplied by a company, make regular reports to the company, and, at the end of the year, deliver a product. There are Clinic projects in engineering, computer science, mathematics, physics, and other majors. This kind of real-world experience gives students a first-hand look at a particular industry, and gives the company an inexpensive team of four students, many of whom they recruit after graduation.

===Reputation===
The college is one of the most selective in the nation; the median entering SAT score is about 770 (out of 800) in mathematics, and 1470 (out of 1600) overall [http://www.hmc.edu/admin/admission/numbers.html]. A third of the student body are [[National Merit Scholar]]s, and about 40 percent of graduates go on earn a [[Ph.D.]]—the highest rate of any college or university in the nation [http://www.amatecon.com/etext/cac/cac-ch03.html][http://www.math.hmc.edu/program/dept-intro.html].

==Student life==
===Harvey Mudd College dormitories===
The official names for the dormitories are Mildred E. Mudd Hall (&quot;East&quot;), West Hall (&quot;West&quot;), North Hall (&quot;North&quot;), Marks Residence Hall (&quot;South&quot;), J. L. Atwood Residence Hall (&quot;Atwood&quot;), Case Residence Hall (&quot;Case&quot;),  Ronald and Maxine Linde Residence Hall (&quot;Linde&quot;), and Frederick and Susan Sontag Residence Hall (&quot;Sontag&quot;). Atwood and Case were occasionally referred to as New Dorm and New Dorm II up until the addition of Linde and Sontag; Mildred E. Mudd Hall and Marks Hall are almost invariably referred to as East and South.

When Case was being built some students decided as a [[prank]] to move all of the survey stakes exactly six inches to the north. They did such a precise job that the construction crew didn't notice until after they had laid the foundation, but California earthquake law forced them to reinspect the new location at some significant expense. Furthermore, the plumbing has never worked quite right. Case is also very occasionally known as Seventh dorm (despite being the sixth dorm built) or as the Pink Dorm due to the fact that the cinder blocks used in its construction are rather shrimp-colored.

It is notable that South Dorm is in the northwest corner of the quad. &quot;East&quot; was the first dorm, but it wasn't until West was built to the west of it that it was actually referred to as East. Then North was built, north of East. When the fourth dorm (Marks) was built, there was one corner of the quad available (the northwest) and one directional name (South) left. It got both, and to this day South is more 'north' on the compass than North dorm is.

The fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth dorms are Atwood, Case, Linde, and Sontag, respectively. They were collectively referred to as &quot;the Colonies&quot; by some students, a reference to the fact that they are newer and are at the far end of the campus, a full two blocks away from the academic buildings; these dorms are now more commonly referred to as &quot;the Outer Dorms.&quot; The college purchased an apartment building adjacent to the newer dorms to house additional students, but it was demolished to make room for the newest dorm, Sontag.

Due to the fact that students from all four classes can live in each of the dormitories, several of the dorms have accumulated long-standing traditions and even 'personalities.' Two examples of these traditions are the parties Long Tall Glasses (a formal affair thrown by North) and TQ Nite (a tequila-centered party thrown by West). However, the personalities of the dorms morph over time as Mudd alumni are apt to find out upon visiting their [[alma mater]] years after they've graduated.

===Athletics===
Athletics teams from [[Claremont McKenna College]], Harvey Mudd College, and [[Scripps College]] compete as one team. Male athletic teams are called the Stags, and women's teams are called the Athenas. The teams participate in the [[NCAA]]'s Division III and in the [[Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference]].

==Architecture==
The original buildings of campus were designed by [[Edward Durell Stone]]. Most are covered with thousands of square [[concrete]] features, called &quot;warts&quot; by the students, which would be perfectly suited to [[buildering]] except that, while some are set into the wall, others are simply glued  on. In addition, these warts have the unusual usefulness of being great 'shelves' for unicycles and skateboards. One can walk towards Galileo Hall and see the warts (especially those on the inside of the buildings) being used to stack unicycles and skateboards. Interestingly enough, the unofficial mascot of Harvey Mudd (featured on many college handbooks and other publications) is one of these concrete blocks with a smile, arms, and legs, named &quot;Wally the Wart.&quot; 

Most of the computer labs and many classrooms are located in the basements (called the Libra Complex) of the concrete-block buildings.

==Transportation on campus==
In the early [[1970s]] the first [[unicycle]]s appeared on campus. By 1972 there were four of them. The notion caught on, and for a time there were dozens on campus. For many students it was a &quot;rite of passage&quot; to learn to ride. The unicycling club, known as Gonzo Unicycle Madness, was formed and to this day organizes an annual eight mile plus ride (each way) known as &quot;The Foster's Run,&quot; to &quot;The Donut Man&quot; donut shop in [[Glendora, California|Glendora]] (originally known as &quot;Foster's Donuts&quot; hence the name of the event) for strawberry donuts. Upon return to the campus, the ritual of the &quot;shakedown&quot; takes place (dismounting and then repeatedly jumping up and down in the dormitory courtyard); a necessary procedure after a unicycle ride of nearly twenty miles, especially for those riders of the masculine gender. At irregular intervals club members also meet to play [[unicycle hockey]]. In the early [[1990s]] though the ridership of unicycles waned at the college. Currently there is a very small number of Mudders who continue to ride unicycles. However, despite this drop in popularity, unicycling continues to be an integral part of the Mudd mythos.

Other than walking, the leading form of transportation among Mudders is skateboarding. Because the paths of Mudd are smooth and the route to the academic building on one side of campus from the dorms is so straightforward, skateboarding to class is very popular&amp;mdash;and Mudders as a whole skate more than the students of any of the nearby Claremont Colleges.

==Rivalry with Caltech==
There is a long-standing rivalry between Harvey Mudd and the nearby [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]; except this rivalry is basically unacknowledged by Caltech.  For example, in one prank, students from Mudd [http://people.bu.edu/fmri/somers/cannon.html stole a memorial cannon from Fleming House at Caltech] (originally from the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]]) by dressing as maintenance people and carting it off on a flatbed truck for &quot;cleaning;&quot; Though thought a coup by the Mudd students, most Caltech students were in fact happy to see the cannon gone, as Fleming House is considered unpopular and obnoxious by most of the campus.  Fleming students got it back by having their school President threaten legal action. In another prank, Mudd students made a slight modification to a freeway sign that read as follows:

&lt;center&gt;''California Institute of Technology ''

''Pasadena City College''

''Next Exit''  &lt;/center&gt;

Their prank was quite subtle; they put parentheses around &quot;[[Pasadena City College]],&quot; so it read:

&lt;center&gt;''California Institute of Technology''

''(Pasadena City College)''

''Next Exit''&lt;/center&gt;

The modified sign therefore implied that Caltech was in fact the same as Pasadena City College, a much less prestigious institution.

==Pranks==
Pranks at Harvey Mudd are known for being clever, amusing, technically precise, and reversible (by policy, pranksters must leave contact information, and reverse the prank within 24 hours if told to do so). 

* One student returned from a long weekend away to discover his room filled from floor to ceiling with inflated plastic garbage bags. The pranksters had used high-powered fans to inflate them. 
* Once the Dean of Faculty discovered that some Mudders had moved everything in his office to the other side of campus placing it on the grass in front of the newly opened Linde Dorm. Everything in his office was perfectly organized and functional &amp;mdash; even his telephone and Internet connection worked. It was a pleasant day, so he spent the day outside. (This prank was also featured in the film [[Toy Soldiers (1991)|Toy Soldiers]].)
* Another prank involved removing everything from a student's room, lining the walls with plastic, filling it two feet deep with water, and adding about 200 goldfish.
*In the opening of the fall semester in 2002, Harvey Mudd Seniors removed all of the furniture from all of the Freshmen's rooms, and proceeded to set up a giant chess board on the campus grounds.

==The HMC honor code==
HMC students developed, live by and self-enforce an [[honor code|Honor Code]]. The Honor Code states:

:''&quot;Each member of ASHMC [Associated Students of Harvey Mudd College] is responsible for maintaining his or her integrity and the integrity of the college community in all academic matters and in all affairs concerning the community.&quot;''

The Honor Code is so well followed that the college entrusts the students to 24-hour per day access to all buildings including labs and timed take-home closed-book exams. (See external links below for more information.)

[[Image:Michangello-lastJudgment-B.jpg|thumb|right|Michelangelo's interpretation of Heaven]]
'''Heaven''' is an [[afterlife]] concept found in many [[religion]]s or [[spirituality|spiritual]] [[philosophy|philosophies]].

Those who believe in heaven generally hold that it (or [[Hell]]) is the final [[afterlife]] destination of many or all humans.  In unusual instances, humans have had, according to many testimonies and traditions, personal knowledge of Heaven. They presume this is for the purpose of teaching the rest of humanity about life, Heaven, and [[God]]. 

==Conceptions==
[[Image:Dore-empyrean.jpg|thumb|[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] gaze upon the highest Heaven; from [[Gustave Doré]]'s illustrations to the ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.]]
While there are abundant and varied sources for conceptions of Heaven, the typical believer's view appears to depend largely on his particular religious tradition.  Various religions have described Heaven as being populated by [[angel]]s, [[demon]]s, [[deity|gods and goddesses]], and/or [[hero]]es (especially in [[Greek mythology]]). Heaven is generally construed as a place of [[eternity|eternal]] [[happiness]]. The relationship between this concept and the [[celestial sphere]] is generally believed to have been first proposed by the [[ancient history|ancient]] [[astronomer]]-[[priest]]s (see also: [[astrologer]]). 

The belief in heaven appears to have supplanted the earlier concept of [[Sheol]] (mentioned in Isaiah 38:18, Psalms 6:5 and Job 7:7-10).

Jewish converts to this concept of heaven and hell included the group known as the [[Pharisees]]. The larger, dogmatically conservative [[Sadducees]] maintained their belief in Sheol. While it was the Sadducees that represented the Jewish religious majority it was the Pharisees who best weathered Roman occupation, and their belief in Zoroaster's heaven and hell was passed on to both Christianity and Islam (in which heaven is referred to as [[Jannah]]).

In [[Christianity]], heaven is a return to the pre-fallen state of humanity, a second and new [[Garden of Eden]], in which humanity is reunited with God in a perfect and natural state of eternal existence. Christians believe this reunion is accomplished through the redemptive work of Jesus Christ in having died for the sins of humanity on the cross.

In Eastern religions (and some Western traditions), with their emphasis on [[reincarnation]] and [[moksha]] or [[nirvana]] (ultimate salvation), the concept of Heaven is not as prominent, but it still is present. In [[Hinduism]] or [[Buddhism]], for example, there are several heavens, and those who accumulate good [[karma]] will go to a heaven; however their stay in the heaven is not eternal &amp;mdash; eventually they will use up their good [[karma]] and be reincarnated in another realm, as [[human]], [[animal]], or other beings. While heaven is temporary, the permanent state that members of these religions aspire to are [[Moksha]] or [[Nirvana]]. In the native [[China|Chinese]] [[Taoist]] traditions Heaven is an important concept, where the ancestors reside and from which emperors drew their mandate to rule in their dynastic propaganda, for example.
In [[Hindu]] belief, likewise, heaven&amp;mdash;called [[Swarga loka]]&amp;mdash;is seen as transitory place for souls who did good deeds but whose actions are not enough for [[moksha]] or absolute bliss with God.

The popular belief of most faiths (especially in the West) is that one enters heaven at the moment of death. This, however, is ''not'' part of the doctrine of most of Christianity (see [[Swedenborgianism]] for a Christian religion that ''does'' have this doctrine). It along with other major religions maintains that entry into Heaven awaits such time as, &quot;When the form of this world has passed away.&quot; 

Two related and often confused concepts of heaven in Christianity are better described as the &quot;resurrection of the body&quot;, which is exclusively of Biblical origin, as contrasted with &quot;the immortality of the soul&quot;, which is also evident in the Greek tradition. In the first concept, the soul does not enter heaven until the last judgement or the &quot;end of time&quot; when it (along with the body) is resurrected and judged. In the second concept, the soul goes to a heaven on another plane immediately after death. These two concepts are generally combined in the doctrine of the double judgement where the soul is judged once at death and goes to a temporary heaven, while awaiting a second and final physical judgement at the end of the world. (*[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_21071999_en.html&quot;   JPII], also see [[eschatology]], [[afterlife]])

==Location==
The idea of Heaven as a physical place has existed since the dawn of religion and human civilization. In some early religions (such as the [[Egyptian mythology|Ancient Egyptian faith]]), Heaven was a physical place far above the Earth in a &quot;dark area&quot; of space where there were no stars, basically beyond the Universe. Departed souls would undergo a literal journey to reach Heaven, along the way to which there could exist hazards and other entities attempting to deny the reaching of Heaven.

One popular medieval view of Heaven was that it existed as a physical place above the clouds and that God and the Angels were physically above, watching over man. With the dawn of the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]], science began to challenge this notion; however Heaven as a physical place survived in the concept that it was located far out into space, and that the stars were &quot;lights shining through from heaven&quot;.  

In [[science fiction]], several films and literature sources have suggested that, through advanced technology, Heaven can be reached by the living through conventional means.  Such was the case in the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] film ''[[The Black Hole]]'', in which a manned spacecraft found both Heaven and Hell located at the bottom of a [[Black Hole]].

In the modern age of science and space flight, it is widely assumed that Heaven is not a physical place in this universe. Religious views, however, still hold Heaven as having a dual status as a concept of mind or heart, but also possibly still a physical place existing on another &quot;plane of existence&quot;, or perhaps at a future time.  Obviously, there is no scientific evidence for the existence of such a dimension, an area of the universe, or alternate reality where Heaven physically exists; however in these belief systems, the failure of science to prove or find evidence for its existence is generally of little or no relevance.

==Getting into Heaven==
Religions that teach about heaven differ on how (and if) one gets into it.  In most, entrance to Heaven is conditional on having lived a &quot;good life&quot; (within the terms of the spiritual system).  A notable exception to this is the 'sola fide' belief of mainstream Protestantism, which takes emphasis off having lived a &quot;good life&quot; and teaches that entrance to heaven is conditional on faith in Jesus Christ alone, and not on any other good or bad 'works' one has participated in.
Many religions state that those who do not go to heaven go to a place of punishment, [[Hell]], which may or may not be eternal (see [[Annihilationism]]). A very few (the followers of [[universalism]]) believe that everyone will go to Heaven eventually, no matter what they have done or believed on earth.

==Heaven in Roman Catholicism==
In [[Roman Catholicism]] Heaven is the Physical Realm of God,the Archangels, the Angels, and the Saints.  The present [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] teaching regarding Heaven is found in the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'': &quot;Those who die in God's grace and friendship and are perfectly purified live forever... This perfect life with [God]....is called heaven.  [It] is the ultimate end and fulfilment of the deepest human longings, the state of supreme, definitive happiness.&quot;  

Upon dying, the soul goes to what is called &quot;the particular judgement&quot; where their afterlife is decided (e.g. Heaven (after going through Purgatory) or [[Hell]].) This is different from &quot;the general judgement&quot; also k for encouraging fruitful exchanges among visitors and provoking a new and deeper insight into their ideas.

The IHÉS runs a highly regarded mathematical journal, [[Publications Mathématiques de l'IHÉS]].

The Directors of the IHÉS in chronological order: Léon Motchane (1958&amp;ndash;71), [[Nicolaas Kuiper]] (1971&amp;ndash;85), [[Marcel Berger]] (1985&amp;ndash;94), [[Jean-Pierre Bourguignon]] (1994&amp;ndash;now).

Some of the top mathematicians who were or are now permanent professors at the IHÉS include [[Alexandre Grothendieck]], [[Jean Bourgain]], [[Alain Connes]], [[Pierre Deligne]], [[René Thom]], [[Pierre Cartier]], [[Mikhail Gromov]] and [[Maxim Kontsevich]].

'''Iceland''', officially the '''Republic of Iceland''' ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: ''Ísland'' or ''Lýðveldið Ísland'') is a [[borderless country]], a volcanic island in the northern [[Atlantic Ocean]] between [[Greenland]], [[Norway]], [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Faroe Islands|The Faroe Islands]].

== History ==
{{main|History of Iceland}}

Iceland was one of the last large islands uninhabited by humans until it was discovered and settled by immigrants from [[Scandinavia]] and from [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]] during the 9th and 10th centuries. [[Íslendingabók]] (''Libellus Islandorum''), written in 1122-1133 claims that the Norwegian Ingólfur Arnarson was the first man to settle in Iceland ([[Reykjavík]]) in 870. The families were accompanied by servants and slaves, some of whom were [[Celt]]s or [[Picts]] from Scotland and Ireland (known as ''Westmen'' to the [[Norse]]). Some literary evidence suggests that [[Papar|Irish monks]] may have been living in Iceland before the arrival of Norse settlers, but no archaeological evidence has been found.

[[Erik the Red]], or Eirikr Þorvaldson, was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter in 980, and set sail for the west, to explore the lands to the west. He established the first settlements in [[Greenland]] around this time, naming the land, according to legend, to attract settlers. 
Eirikr's son, [[Leif Ericson|Leifr Eiriksson]], finally set foot in the Americas around the year 1000. While some say he was blown off course, it is most likely that he was deliberately seeking the land spotted by [[Bjarni Herjólfsson]] several years earlier. He is believed to have established a colony at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] in [[Newfoundland]], which lasted only a year. Two further attempts at colonization by his brother ended in failure.

The [[Althing|Alþingi]] (general assembly) was founded in 930, marking the beginning of the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]]. It was the predecessor to the modern Icelandic legislature. The Althing is the oldest, still-standing, parliament in the world that has written documents to prove its age. 

Iceland was a free state, without a king, until the end of the [[Sturlungaöld]] civil war in 1262, when it joined the Norwegian kingdom as a Norwegian [[colony]].  From 1387 Iceland was in practice ruled by Denmark, following the union of the two kingdoms. When that union was dissolved in 1814, through the [[Treaty of Kiel]], which saw Norway entering a union with Sweden, Iceland became a Danish colony. Home rule was granted by the Danish government in 1904, and independence followed in 1918. From 1918 Iceland was in a [[personal union]] with Denmark, with foreign relations being carried out by the Danes, as instructed by the Icelandic government until the [[World War II]] military occupation of Denmark by Germany in 1940. Subsequently, Iceland was occupied by the [[Allies]]. The Danish king remained the ''de jure'' sovereign of the nation until 1944, when the current [[republic]] was founded after the 1918 treaty had lapsed.

The new republic became a charter member of [[NATO]] in 1949 and signed a treaty with the [[United States]] in 1951 to take responsibility for the defense of Iceland. Today the US continues to operate a military base in [[Keflavík]] based on this agreement, while Iceland has no armed forces of its own. The economy of Iceland remained dependent on fisheries in the post-war decades and the country has had several clashes with its neighbours over this vital resource, most notably the [[Cod Wars]] with the [[United Kingdom|British]]. The economy has become more diverse recently owing to large investments in heavy industry such as [[aluminium]] smelting and deregulation and privatization in the financial sector. Iceland is a member of the [[Common market]] of the [[European Union|European Union]] through the [[European Economic Area|EEA agreement]] but has never applied for membership of the EU itself.

== Politics ==
{{main|Politics of Iceland}}
[[Image:ogrimsson.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson]], President of Iceland]]
[[Image:HalldórÁsgrímsson.jpg|thumb|left|[[Halldór Ásgrímsson]], Prime Minister of Iceland]]

The modern parliament, called &quot;[[Althing]]&quot; or &quot;Alþingi&quot;, was founded in 1845 as an advisory body to the Danish king. It was widely seen as a reestablishment of the assembly founded in 930 in the [[Icelandic Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] period and suspended in 1799. It currently has 63 members, each of whom is elected by the population every four years. The [[president of Iceland]] is a largely ceremonial office that serves as a diplomat, figurehead and [[head of state]]. The [[head of government]] is the prime minister, who, together with the cabinet, takes care of the executive part of government. The cabinet is appointed by the president after general elections to Althing; however, this process is usually conducted by the leaders of the political parties, who decide among themselves after discussions which parties can form the cabinet and how its seats are to be distributed (under the condition that it has a majority support in Althing). Only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves in reasonable time does the president exercise this power and appoint the cabinet himself. This has never happened since the republic was founded in 1944, but in 1942 the regent of the country ([[Sveinn Björnsson]], who had been installed in that position by the Althing in 1941) did appoint a non-parliamentary government. The regent had, for all practical purposes, the position of a president, and Björnsson in fact became the country's first president in 1944. The governments of Iceland have almost always been coalitions with two or more parties involved, due to the fact that no single political party has received a majority of seats in Althing in the republic period. The extent of the political powers possessed by the office of the president are disputed by legal scholars in Iceland; several provisions of the constitution appear to give the president some important powers but other provisions and traditions suggest differently.

The president is elected every four years (last 2004), the cabinet is elected every four years (last 2003) and town council elections are held every four years (last 2002).

== Subdivisions ==
{{main|Subdivisions of Iceland}}
[[Image:Municipalities of Iceland.png|right|thumb|100px|The municipalities of Iceland]]

=== Municipalities ===
{{main|Municipalities of Iceland}}

There are 98 municipalities in Iceland which govern most local matters like schools, transportation and zoning.

=== Counties ===
{{main|Counties of Iceland}}
[[Image:Counties of Iceland with county seats.PNG|right|thumb|100px|The administrative counties of Iceland]]
Iceland's 23 counties are for the most part historical divisions. Currently, Iceland is split up between 26 magistrates that represent government in various capacities. Among their duties are local police (except in Reykjavík, where there is a special office of police commissioner) tax collection, declaring bankruptcy and marrying people outside of the church.

=== Regions ===
{{main|Regions of Iceland}}
[[Image:Regions of Iceland english.png|right|thumb|100px|The regions of Iceland]]
There are eight regions which are primarily used for statistical purposes; the district court jurisdictions also use an older version of this division.

=== Constituencies ===
{{main|Constituencies of Iceland}}
Until 2003, the constituencies for the parliament elections were the same as the regions, but by an amendment to the constitution they were changed to the current six constituencies. The change was made in order to balance the weight of different districts of the country since a vote cast in the sparsely populated areas around the country would count much more than a vote cast in the Reykjavík city area. The imbalance between districts has been reduced by the new system, but still exists.

== Geography ==
[[Image:Ic-map.png|frame|thumb|right|200px|Map of Iceland]] 
:''Main articles: [[Geography of Iceland]] and [[List of settlements in Iceland]].''

Iceland is located in the North Atlantic Ocean just south of the [[Arctic Circle]], which passes through the small island of [[Grimsey]] off Iceland's northern coast, but not through mainland Iceland. Unlike neighbouring [[Greenland]], Iceland is considered to be a part of [[Europe]], not a part of [[The Americas|North America]]. The island is the [[List of islands by size|world's 18th largest island]].

Approximately 10 percent of the island is glaciated. Many [[fjord]]s punctuate its 4,970 km long coastline, which is also where most towns are situated because the island's interior, the [[Highlands of Iceland]], is a cold and uninhabitable desert. The major towns are the capital [[Reykjavík]], [[Keflavík]], where the national airport is situated, and [[Akureyri]]. The island of [[Grímsey]] on the [[Arctic Circle]] contains the northernmost habitation of Iceland. 

Iceland has four national parks: [[Jökulsárgljúfur National Park]], [[Skaftafell National Park]], [[Snæfellsnes National Park]], and [[Þingvellir]] 

===Geological and volcanic activity===
Iceland is located on both a geological [[Hotspot (geology)|hot spot]], thought to be caused by a [[mantle plume]], and the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]]. This combined location means that the island is extremely geologically active, having many [[volcano]]es, notably [[Hekla]], and [[geyser]]s (itself an Icelandic word). With this widespread availability of [[geothermal power]], and also because of the numerous rivers and waterfalls that are harnessed for hydropower, residents of most towns have hot water and home heat for a low price. The island itself is composed primarily of cooled basalt lava.

== Military ==
{{main|Military of Iceland}}

The Republic of Iceland has no regular armed forces. Defense is provided by a predominantly US-manned [[NATO]] base in [[Miðnesheiði]] near [[Keflavík]]. Iceland has a [[Icelandic Coast Guard| Coast Guard]] (''Landhelgisgæslan'') and an [[anti-terrorism]] team (similar to [[SWAT team]]s) named ''Sérsveit Ríkislögreglustjóra'' (English: &quot;The [[Special Operations]] Task Force of the National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police&quot;), commonly referred to as ''Víkingasveitin'' (The Viking Team or Viking squad). 

===Landhelgisgæslan===
The [[Icelandic Coast Guard]] originates back to the 1920s. Its main tasks from its initiation have been to protect Iceland's most valuable natural resource—its fishing areas—as well as provide security, search, and rescue services to Iceland's fishing fleet. In 1952, 1958, 1972, and 1975, the government expanded Iceland's exclusive economic zone to 4, 12, 50 and 200 nautical miles respectively. This led to Iceland's conflict with the United Kingdom, known as the &quot;[[Cod War]]s&quot;.  The Icelandic Coast Guard and the Royal Navy confronted each other on several occasions during these years. Although few rounds were fired, there were many intense moments between the two nations. The Captains of the Icelandic Coast Guard ships were regarded as heroes and earned their names in the history of Iceland as Iceland's bravest men. This attitude of heroism towards the Coast Guard persists in Iceland.

The Special Operations Unit of the National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police, [[Víkingasveitin]], is similar to Germany's [[GSG 9]] and Britain's [[Special Air Service|SAS]], a small and well trained group of operatives. The unit handles security of the state, anti/counter-terrorism projects, security of foreign dignitaries, as well supporting the police forces in the country when needed. The Viking team has five main squadrons: Bomb Squadron that specializes in explosives; Boat Squadron that specializes in operations on sea and water, diving and underwater warfare, and boat operations; Sniper Squadron that specializes in sniper warfare, entries, and close target reconnaissance; Intelligence Squadron that specializes in anti-terrorism intelligence, surveillance, and infiltration; and Airborne Squadron that specializes in airplane hijacking operations, skydiving and surprise assault operations, and port security. Members of the Viking team were deployed in the Balkans as a part of operations lead by NATO, and some members have been deployed to Afghanistan. The Special Operations Unit used to be under the command of the Reykjavík Chief of Police; however, in 2004, a new law was passed that put the Viking Team directly under the National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Iceland}}

Iceland is one of the ten richest countries in the world based on [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP per capita]] at [[purchasing power parity]]. The [[economics|economy]] historically depended heavily on the [[fishing]] industry, which still provides almost 40% of export earnings and employs 8% of the work force. In the absence of other [[natural resources]] (except for abundant [[hydroelectricity|hydro-electric]] and [[geothermal]] power), Iceland's economy is vulnerable to changing world [[fish]] prices. The economy remains sensitive to declining fish stocks as well as to drops in world prices for its main material exports: fish and fish products, [[aluminium]], and [[ferrosilicon]]. Although the Icelandic economy still relies heavily on fishing it is constantly becoming less important as the travel industry and other service industries, the technology industry, energy intensive industries and various other industries grow.

The centre-right government plans to continue its policies of reducing the budget and current account deficits, limiting foreign borrowing, containing inflation, revising agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying the economy, and privatising state-owned industries. The government remains opposed to [[EU]] membership, primarily because of Icelanders' concern about losing control over their fishing resources.

Iceland's economy has been diversifying into manufacturing and service industries in the last decade, and new developments in [[software]] production, [[biotechnology]], and financial services are taking place. The [[tourism]] sector is also expanding, with the recent trends in [[ecotourism]] and [[whale]]-watching. Growth slowed between 2000 and 2002, but the economy expanded by 4.3% in 2003 and grew by 6.2% in 2004. The unemployment rate of 1.8% (3rd quarter of 2005) is among the lowest in the [[European Economic Area]].

Over 99% of the country's electricity is produced from [[hydropower]] and [[geothermal energy]].

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Iceland}}

The original population of Iceland was of Nordic and Celtic origin. This is evident by literal evidence from the settlement period as well as from later scientific studies such as [[blood type]] and [[genetics]] analysis. One such genetics study has indicated that the majority of the male settlers were of Nordic origin while the majority of the women were of Celtic origin (Am. J. Hum. Genet, 2001). The modern population of Iceland is often described as a  &quot;homogeneous mixture of descendants of Norse and Celts&quot; (The CIA World Factbook) but several history scholars reject the alleged homogeneity as a myth that fails to take into account the fact that Iceland was never isolated from the rest of Europe and actually has had a lot of contact with traders and fishermen from many nations through the ages.

Iceland has extensive medical and genealogical records about its population dating back to the age of settlement. Although the accuracy of these records is debated, biopharmaceutical companies such as [[deCODE Genetics]] see them as a valuable tool for conducting research on genetic diseases.

The population of the island is believed to have varied from 40,000 to 60,000 in the period from initial settlement until the mid-19th century. During that time, cold winters, ashfall from volcanic eruptions, and plagues adversely affected the population several times. The first census was carried out in 1703 and revealed that the population of the island was then 50,358. Improving living conditions triggered a rapid increase in population from the mid-19th century to the present day - from about 60,000nt's, Vice-president's, &amp; Treasurer's offices moved from [[ISU notables#Office Building|Office Building]] to [[ISU notables#Beardshear Hall|Beardshear Hall]]

The '''International Astronomical Union''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Union astronomique internationale'') unites national [[astronomy|astronomical]] societies from around the world. It is a member of the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU). It is internationally recognized as the authority responsible for naming stars, planets, asteroids, and other celestial bodies and phenomena in the scientific community.

Working groups include the Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN), which maintains the [[astronomical naming conventions]] and [[planetary nomenclature]] for planetary bodies.  The IAU is also responsible for the system of [[Astronomical Telegrams]] which are produced and distributed on its behalf by the [[Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams]].  The [[Minor Planet Center]] (MPC), a clearinghouse for all non-planetary or non-moon bodies in the [[solar system]], also operates under the IAU.  

The IAU was founded in [[1919]], as a merger of various international projects including the ''[[Carte du Ciel]]'', the [[Solar Union]] and the [[International Time Bureau]] (''Bureau International de l'Heure''). The first president was [[Benjamin Baillaud]].  [[Pieter Johannes van Rhijn]] served as president from [[1932]] to [[1958]].

The IAU currently has 9040 individual members - i.e., professional astronomers - (mainly) at the [[PhD]] level; and 63 national members, i.e., countries that are affiliated with the IAU. 87 percent of all members are male; 13 percent are female. The current president is [[Ronald D. Ekers]].

The '''[http://www.astronomy2006.com XXVIth General Assembly]''' of the International Astronomical Union (August 2006) will be held in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]].

==Pop culture==
* In the song &quot;[[Planet X]]&quot; by [[Christine Lavin]], there are lyrics referring to both the IAU and WGPSN.  
* In the movie ''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]'', the actual scientific group to which the amateur would report the finding of a new asteroid would be the [[Minor Planet Center|MPC]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:International Criminal Court logo.gif|thumb|Official logo of the ICC.]]

The '''International Criminal Court''' ('''ICC''') was established in 2002 as a permanent tribunal to prosecute individuals for [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], and [[war crime]]s, as defined by several international agreements, most prominently the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]]. The ICC is designed to complement existing national judicial systems,
however, the Court can exercise its jurisdiction if national courts are unwilling or unable to investigate or prosecute such crimes, thus being a &quot;court of last resort,&quot; leaving the primary responsibility to exercise jurisdiction over alleged criminals to individual states.

Note that &quot;International Criminal Court&quot; is sometimes initialized as ICCt to distinguish it from &quot;[[International Chamber of Commerce]].&quot;  Also, the ICC is separate from the ''[[International Court of Justice]]'', which is a body to settle disputes between nations, and the [[War Crimes Law (Belgium)]].  

== Cases before the court ==
Three states parties (countries that have ratified the Court's [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]]) have referred situations to the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the ICC:
* The [[Uganda|Republic of Uganda]] on [[January 29]], [[2004]]; 
* The [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] on [[April 19]], [[2004]]; 
* The [[Central African Republic]] on [[January 6]], [[2005]]. 
* In March 2005, the OTP received its first [[United Nations Security Council]] referral for [[Darfur]], [[Sudan]].  

After rigorous analysis in accordance with the Rome Statute and the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, the Chief Prosecutor decided to open investigations into three situations: in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the Republic of Uganda, and in Darfur, Sudan [http://www.monuc.org/news.aspx?newsID=5480]. On [[October 6]], [[2005]] the ICC issued its first arrest warrants for the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] leader [[Joseph Kony]], his deputy [[Vincent Otti]], and LRA commanders [[Raska Lukwiya]], [[Okot Odiambo]] and [[Dominic Ongwen]].

===Potential cases===
====Alleged war crimes in connection with Invasion of Iraq in March 2003====
In March 2003, the [[United States]] and its allies, the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and [[Poland]] [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invaded]] [[Iraq]]. The UK, Australia and Poland are all  parties to the ICC Statute and therefore their nationals are liable to prosecution by the court for any relevant crimes. As the United States is not a party, American citizens can only be prosecuted by the court if the crime takes place in the territory of a state party (e.g. Jordan), or if the situation is referred to it by the Security Council.

The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court reported in February 2006, that it had received 240 communications in connection with the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 which alleged that various war crimes had been committed. Many of these complaints concerned the British participation in the the invasion, as well as the alleged responsibility for torture deaths whilst in detention in British-controlled areas. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/print/0,3858,5187283-111289,00.html].

On [[2006-02-09]], Luis Moreno-Ocampo, Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, published a letter [http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/organs/otp/OTP_letter_to_senders_re_Iraq_9_February_2006.pdf] that he had sent to all those who had communicated with him concerning the above, which set out his conclusions on these matters, following a preliminary investigation of the complaints. He explained in his decision letter, that essentially two sets of complaints were involved.

#Complaints concerning the legality of the invasion itself;
#Complaints concerning the conduct of hostilities between March and May 2003, which included allegations in respect of 
##the targeting of civilians or clearly excessive attacks;
##wilful killing or inhuman treatment of civilians.

The Prosecutor's conclusions were as follows:

#He did not have authority to consider the complaint about the legality of the invasion. Although the ICC Statute includes the crime of &quot;aggression&quot;, it indicates that the Court may not exercise jurisdiction over the crime until a provision has been adopted which defines the crime and sets out the conditions under which the Court may exercise jurisdiction with respect to it.
#The available information did not provide sufficient evidence for proceeding with an investigation of the complaints in connection with targeting of civilians or clearly excessive attacks.
#The available information did provide a reasonable basis for believing that there had been an estimated 4 to 12 victims of wilful killing and a limited number of victims of inhuman treatment, totaling in all less than 20 persons. However this on its own was not sufficient for the initiation of an investigation by the ICC because the Statute requires consideration of admissibility before the Court, in light of the gravity of the crimes. Bearing in mind that a key consideration in this regard is the number of victims of particularly serious crimes, he concluded that the situation did not appear to meet the &quot;gravity&quot; threshold.

See further [[The International Criminal Court and the 2003 invasion of Iraq]]

== Development of the ICC ==
The development of the ICC followed the creation of several [[ad hoc]] tribunals to try war crimes in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda ([[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] in 1993, [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] in 1994). Subsequently, it was desired to create a permanent tribunal, so that an ''ad hoc'' tribunal would not have to be created after each occurrence of these crimes. 

The General Assembly called the &quot;United Nations Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court&quot;, in Italy, where the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] was adopted on [[July 17]], [[1998]]. Almost all states participating voted in favor of the Statute; only the [[United States]], [[Israel]], [[People's Republic of China]], [[Iraq]], [[Qatar]], [[Libya]] and [[Yemen]] voted against. [[Israel]] went on to sign the Statute just before the statute was closed for signatures but later nullified its signature.  The [[United States]] under [[Bill Clinton]] signed the treaty, but never submitted it for ratification.  When [[George W. Bush]] took office shortly afterwards, he nullified the signature amid bipartisan consensus on the matter.

The Statute became a binding treaty after it received its 60th ratification, which was deposited at a ceremony at United Nations Headquarters on [[11 April]] [[2002]]. Ten countries ([[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Cambodia]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Ireland]], [[Jordan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Niger]], [[Romania]] and [[Slovakia]]) submitted their ratifications at this time, bringing the total to 66, so that no one nation would hold the honor of depositing the 60th ratification. As of October 2005, 100 States are Parties to the Statute. The ICC legally came into existence on [[1 July]] [[2002]], and can only prosecute crimes that occurred after this date. 

The official seat of the ICC is in [[The Hague]] (Netherlands); but its Statute permits it to hold its proceedings anywhere. The court became operational when the signatory nations met in the Assembly of State Parties to appoint a [[prosecutor]] and 18 [[judge]]s. It opened on [[March 11]], [[2003]]. The Judge-President is [[Philippe Kirsch]] from [[Canada]], and the Vice-Presidents are [[Akua Kuenyenia]] from [[Ghana]] and [[Elizabeth Odio Benito]] from [[Costa Rica]]. Its Chief Prosecutor is [[Luis Moreno Ocampo]] of [[Argentina]].

== Structure and powers ==
The International Criminal Court is composed of the Court itself, divided into a number of chambers (Pre-Trial, Trial and Appellate), the Registry, the Office of the Prosecutor and the Assembly of State Parties. 

The initial impetus for its establishment came from within the United Nations. Although it is legally a separate entity established by a separate treaty between states, and not the Security Council acting under the United Nations Charter, the UN has a clearly defined role towards the court. The court's relationship with the United Nations is governed by a Relationship Agreement between the Court and the United Nations, which mainly provides for Security Council referrals under the Rome Statute, and for United Nations assistance in payment for any prosecutions made under such a referral.

Countries ratifying the treaty that created the ICC grant it authority to try their citizens for [[war crime]]s, [[crimes against humanity]] and [[genocide]]. It provides for ICC jurisdiction over-state party or on the territory of a non-state party where that non-state party has entered into an agreement with the court providing for it to have such jurisdiction in a particular case (consent). 

Many states wanted to add &quot;aggression,&quot; &quot;[[terrorism]]&quot; and drug trafficking to the list of crimes covered by the Rome Statute; however other states opposed this, on the grounds that these crimes were difficult to define, and that dealing with less serious crimes such as terrorism and drug trafficking would distract from the seriousness of the crimes the ICC was established to deal with. As a compromise, the treaty merely brands &quot;aggression&quot; as a crime without providing a definition, pending adoption of an amendment to the Statute. It may also be amended to include other crimes. However, no amendments can be made to the Rome Statute until seven years after the Statute became legally binding.

=== How cases reach the ICC ===
Cases may be referred to the ICC by one of four methods:

#A country member of the Assembly of States Parties (ratified the Court's Statute) sends the case;
#A country that has chosen to accept the ICC's jurisdiction sends the case;
#The Security Council sends the case (subject to veto from the permanent five members); or
#The three-judge panel authorizes a case initiated by the ICC Prosecutor.

Even though the Court has jurisdiction over the [[crime against peace|crime of international aggression]], it will not exercise such jurisdiction until the crime has been further defined.  The statute that established the ICC mandates that the state parties attempt to define aggression in 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[learning]], '''implicit repetition''' is unintentional repetition. For example, an [[explicit repetition]] is when we review the material before an exam. An implicit repetition is when we suddenly recall some fact on the way to school. We remember our name or events from childhood via implicit repetition. This means we do not need to explicitly sit down to a textbook and review those events to be sure they do not get forgotten. Unfortunately, implicit repetition cannot be used to ensure we do not forget things we learn at school. This is why explicit review of material is needed.

The '''Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur''' ('''IIT Kanpur''') is one of the [[Indian Institutes of Technology]], set up in the then-industrial city of [[Kanpur]] in [[1960]]. Today, IIT Kanpur has grown into one of the top technological institutes in India, primarily focused on research in engineering and science, and the teaching of undergraduates.

== History ==

IIT Kanpur was established by an act of [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] in [[1959]]. The institute was started in December 1959 in a room borrowed in the Canteen Building of the [[Harcourt Butler Technological Institute]] at Agricultural Gardens in Kanpur. In [[1963]], the Institute moved to its present location, on the historic [[Grand Trunk Road]] near the village of Kalyanpur in Kanpur district. During the first ten years of its existence, IIT Kanpur benefited from the Kanpur Indo-American Programme, where a consortium of 9 US universities helped set up the research laboratories and academic programmes. The first Director of the Institute was [[Dr. P. K. Kelkar]] (after whom the Central Library was renamed in 2003).

Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur was the among the first Institute in India to start Computer Science education. The earliest computer courses were started at IIT Kanpur in August 1963 on an IBM 1620 system, a novelty then even in many North American and European universities. Gradually, the Institute drew upon some of the brightest young Indians in Computer Science to serve on its faculty and initiated an independent academic program in 1971, leading to Ph.D. and M. Tech. degrees.

== Laboratories and other facilities ==

The Institute has a number of facilities, including the National Wind Tunnel Facility.Spread in a sprawling campus of 1200 acres, IIT Kanpur has one of the best computational facilities in India. Apart from a large number of engineering laboratories, IIT Kanpur also has its own airfield, for flight testing and gliding activities. Other large research centres include the Advanced Centre for Material Science, one of the country's best Bio-technology centre, the Advanced Centre for Electronic Systems, and the Samtel Centre for Display Technology. The P.K. Kelkar library has one of the most exhaustive collections of academic textbooks, peer-reviewed journals and other research material in the country, and boasts of an excellent reference section (where course material is reserved for students). In addition, the various departments have their own smaller libraries. The Computer-Centre (referred to by the campus residents as &quot;C-C&quot;) is quite an impressive facility in comparison to other academic institutions in the country. It has about 100-150 Linux terminals, about 50 Windows-NT terminals, and is continuously available to the students for academic work and recreation. Disk storage is provided using a networked file server system. Internet access is provided by the means of two proxy servers, one for students and another for faculty (the computer science department in IIT Kanpur has its own independent network). In addition, it hosts about 50 SUN workstations that are considered powerful workhorses for heavy computational tasks. It is a major intellectual, social and cultural hub for the technokrati on campus. The IIT's (and especially IIT Kanpur) are among the first large academic institutions in India to be extensively networked, with an institute-wide LAN and Ethernet access to every student room in the residence halls.

== Students ==

The undergraduate students at IIT Kanpur are selected through the [[Joint Entrance Examination]] of the IITs. The graduate students (Masters) are mainly selected through the [[Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering]] (GATE). Presently, the institute has around 3800 students, with an equal distribution of graduate and undergraduate students.

Students at IIT Kanpur reside in the hostels, or 'halls of residence', most of which have their own unique history and lore. There are seven hostels for boys and two for girls called GH and hall 6.

The annual [[culfest|cultural festival]] is called ''[[Antaragni]]''. It is held around the end of October every year. The annual science and technology festival, ''[[Techkriti]]'', is held at the end of February each year. The annual sports festival, ''[[Udghosh/Galaxy]]'', is held around the end of November each year and the annual film festival, ''[[Umang]]''. All four are amongst the most popular college events in North [[India]].

Another highlight of the student community is the self governance achieved in the form of the Students' Gymkhana, which is a democratically elected body.

[[image:Insulin_structure.JPG|right|thumbnail|400px|The primary structure of insulin &lt;br&gt;i.e. amino acid sequence]]

'''Insulin''' (from [[Latin]] ''insula'', &quot;island&quot;, as it is produced in the [[Islets of Langerhans]] in the [[pancreas]]) is a [[polypeptide]] [[Peptide hormone|hormone]] that regulates [[carbohydrate metabolism]]. Apart from being the primary effector in [[carbohydrate]] [[homeostasis]], it also has a substantial effect on small vessel muscle tone, controls storage and release of [[lipid|fat]] ([[triglyceride]]s) and cellular uptake of both amino acids and some electrolytes. In this last sense, it has [[Anabolism|anabolic]] properties. Its concentration (more or less, presence or absence) has extremely widespread  effects throughout the body.

Insulin is used medically in some forms of [[diabetes mellitus]]. Patients with [[Diabetes_mellitus#Type_1|type 1 diabetes mellitus]] depend on exogenous insulin (injected subcutaneously) for their survival because of an absolute deficiency of the hormone; patients with [[Diabetes_mellitus#Type_2|type 2 diabetes mellitus]] have either relatively low insulin production or [[insulin resistance]] or both, and a non-trivial fraction of type 2 diabetics eventually require insulin administration when other medications become inadequate in controlling blood glucose levels.

Insulin has the empirical formula [[carbon|C]]&lt;sub&gt;257&lt;/sub&gt;[[hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;383&lt;/sub&gt;[[nitrogen|N]]&lt;sub&gt;65&lt;/sub&gt;[[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;77&lt;/sub&gt;[[sulfur|S]]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. 

Insulin structure varies slightly between [[species]] of animal. Its [[carbohydrate metabolism]] regulatory function strength in humans also varies. [[Pig]] insulin is particularly close to the [[human]] one.

==Discovery and characterization ==
In 1869 [[Paul Langerhans]], a medical student in [[Berlin]], was studying the structure of the pancreas under a [[microscope]] when he noticed some previously-unidentified cells scattered in the exocrine tissue. The function of the &quot;little heaps of cells,&quot; later [[eponym|known as]] the ''Islets of Langerhans'', was unknown, but [[Edouard Laguesse]] later argued that they may produce a secretion that plays a regulatory role in digestion.

[[Image:Insulincrystals.jpg|left|300px|frame|Insulin [[crystal|crystals]]]]

In 1889, the [[Germany|Polish-German]] physician [[Oscar Minkowski]] in collaboration with Joseph von Mehring removed the [[pancreas]] from a healthy dog to demonstrate this assumed role in digestion. Several days after the dog's pancreas was removed, Minkowski's animal keeper noticed a swarm of flies feeding on the dog's urine. On testing the urine they found that there was sugar in the dog's urine, demonstrating for the first time the relationship between the pancreas and diabetes. In 1901, another major step was taken by [[Eugene Opie]], when he clearly established the link between the Islets of Langerhans and diabetes: ''Diabetes mellitus.... is caused by destruction of the islets of Langerhans and occurs only when these bodies are in part or wholly destroyed.'' Before this demonstration, the link between the pancreas and diabetes was clear, but not the specific role of the islets.

Over the next two decades, several attempts were made to isolate the secretion of the islets as a potential treatment. In 1906 [[Georg Ludwig Zuelzer]] was partially successful treating dogs with pancreatic extract, but unable to continue his work. Between 1911 and 1912, [[E.L. Scott]] at the [[University of Chicago]] used aqueous pancreatic extracts and noted ''a slight diminution of glycosuria'', but was unable to convince his director and the research was shut down. [[Israel Kleiner]] demonstrated similar effects at [[Rockefeller University]] in 1919, but his work was interrupted by [[World War I]] and he was unable to return to it. [[Nicolae Paulescu]], a professor of physiology at the [[Romanian School of Medicine]], published similar work in 1921 that was carried out in [[France]] and patented in [[Romania]], and it has been argued ever since by Romanians that he is the rightful discoverer.

However, the Nobel prizes committee in 1923 credited the practical extraction of insulin to a team at the [[University of Toronto]]. In October 1920, [[Frederick Banting]] was reading one of Minkowski's papers and concluded that it is the very digestive secretions that Minkowski had originally studied that were breaking down the secretion, thereby making it impossible to extract successfully. He jotted a note to himself ''Ligate pancreatic ducts of the dog. Keep dogs alive till acini degenerate leaving islets. Try to isolate internal secretion of these and relieve glycosurea.''

He travelled to Toronto to meet with [[John James Richard Macleod|J.J.R. Macleod]], who was not entirely impressed with his idea. Nevertheless, he supplied Banting with a lab at the University, an assistant, medical student [[Charles Best]], and ten dogs, while he left on vacation during the summer of 1921. Their method was tying a ligature (string) around the pancreatic duct, and, when examined several weeks later, the pancreatic digestive cells had died and been absorbed by the immune system, leaving thousands of islets. They then isolated the protein from these islets to produce what they called ''isletin''. Banting and Best were then able to keep a pancreatectomized dog alive all summer.

Macleod saw the value of the research on his return from Europe, but demanded a re-run to prove the method actually worked. Several weeks later it was clear the second run was also a success, and he helped publish their results privately in Toronto that November. However, they needed six weeks to extract the isletin, dramatically slowing testing. Banting suggested that they try to use fetal calf pancreas, which had not yet developed digestive glands; he was relieved to find that this method worked well. With the supply problem solved, the next major effort was to purify the protein. In December 1921, Macleod invited the [[biochemist]] [[James Collip]]&lt;!--&quot;James Collip&quot; is NOT a descriptive phrase and therefore should NOT be enclosed in commas; it is a qualifier--&gt; to help with this task, and, within a month, he felt ready to test.

On [[January 11]], [[1922]], [[Leonard Thompson]], a fourteen-year-old diabetic, was given the first injection of insulin. However, the extract was so impure that he suffered a severe [[anaphylaxis|allergic reaction]], and further injections were canceled. Over the next 12 days, Collip worked day and night to improve the extract, and a second dose injected on the 23rd. This was completely successful, not only in not having obvious side-effects, but in completely eliminating the symptoms of diabetes. However, Banting and Best never worked well with Collip, regarding him as something of an interloper, and Collip left soon after.

Over the spring of 1922, Best managed to improve his techniques to the point where large quantities of insulin could be extracted on demand, but the extract remained impure. However, they had been approached by [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] with an offer of help shortly after their first publications in 1921, and they took Lilly up on the offer in April. In November, Lilly made a major breakthrough, and were able to produce large quantities of&lt;!--&quot;very pure&quot; is nonsensical--&gt; pure insulin. Insulin was offered for sale shortly thereafter.

For this landmark discovery, Macleod and Banting were awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Physiology]] or [[Medicine]] in [[1923]]. Banting, insulted that Best was not mentioned, shared his prize with Best, and MacLeod immediately shared his with Collip. The patent for insulin was sold to the [[University of Toronto]] for one dollar.

The exact sequence of [[amino acid]]s comprising the insulin molecule, the so-called [[primary structure]], was determined by British molecular biologist [[Frederick Sanger]]. It was the first protein to have its structure be completely determined.  For this he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1958. In 1967, after decades of work, [[Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin]] determined the spatial conformation of the molecule, by means of [[X-ray diffraction]] studies. She also was awarded a Nobel Prize.

Spontaneous folding&lt;BR&gt;3. A and B chains linked by sulphide bonds&lt;BR&gt;4. Leader and C chain are cut off&lt;BR&gt;5. Insulin molecule remains]]

==Structure and production==
Insulin is synthesized in humans and other mammals within the [[beta cell]]s (B-cells) of the [[islets of Langerhans]] in the pancreas. One to three million islets of Langerhans (pancreatic islets) form the [[endocrine]] part of the [[pancreas]], which is primarily an [[exocrine]] [[gland]]. The endocrine part accounts for only 2% of the total mass of the pancreas. Within the islets of Langerhans, beta cells constitute 60&amp;ndash;80% of all the cells.

Insulin is synthesized from the proinsulin precursor molecule by the action of proteolytic enzymes known as prohormone convertases (PC1 and PC2). Active insulin has 51 amino acids and is one of the smallest proteins known. Beef insulin differs from human insulin in three [[amino acid]] residues, and pork insulin in one residue. Fish insulin is also close enough to human insulin to be effective in humans. In humans, insulin has a [[molecular weight]] of 5808. Insulin is structured as 2 polypeptide chains linked by 2 [[sulfur bridges]] (see figure shown above), with one additional sulfur bond in the A chain (not shown). Chain A consists of 21, and chain B of 30 amino acids. Insulin is produced as a [[prohormone]] molecule &amp;ndash; [[proinsulin]] &amp;ndash; that is later transformed by [[proteolysis|proteolytic]] action into the active hormone.

The remaining part of the proinsulin molecule is called [[C-peptide]]. This polypeptide is released into the blood in equal amounts to the insulin protein. Since exogenous insulins contain no C-peptide component, serum levels of C-peptide  are good indicators of endogenous insulin production. C-peptide has recently been discovered to have itself biological activity; the activity is apparently confined to an effect on the muscular layer of the [[artery|arteries]].

==Actions on cellular and metabolic level==
The actions of insulin on the global human metabolism level include:
* Control of cellular intake of certain substances, most prominently [[glucose]] in muscle and adipose tissue (about 2/3 of body cells).
* Increase of [[DNA replication]] and [[protein synthesis]] via control of amino acid uptake.
* Modification of the activity of numerous [[enzymes]] ([[allostery|allosteric effect]]).

The actions of insulin on cells include:
* Increased [[glycogen]] synthesis &amp;ndash; insulin forces storage of glucose in liver (and muscle) cells in the form of glycogen; lowered levels of insulin cause liver cells to convert glycogen to glucose and excrete it into the blood. This is the clinical action of insulin which is useful in reducing high blood glucose levels as in diabetes.
* Increased [[fatty acid]] synthesis &amp;ndash; insulin forces fat cells to take in glucose which is converted to [[triglycerides]]; lack of insulin causes the reverse.
* Increased esterification of fatty acids &amp;ndash; forces [[adipose tissue]] to make fats (ie, triglycerides) from fatty acid esters; lack of insulin causes the reverse.
* Decreased [[proteinolysis]] &amp;ndash; forces reduction of protein degradation; lack of insulin increases protein degradation. 
* Decreased [[lipolysis]] &amp;ndash; forces reduction in conversion of fat cell lipid stores into blood fatty acids; lack of insulin causes the reverse.
* Decreased [[gluconeogenesis]] &amp;ndash; decreases production of glucose from various substrates in liver; lack of insulin causes glucose production from assorted substrates in the liver and elsewhere.
* Increased amino acid uptake &amp;ndash; forces cells to absorb circulating amino acids; lack of insulin inhibits absorption.
* Increased potassium uptake &amp;ndash; forces cells to absorb serum potassium; lack of insulin inhibits absorption.
* Arterial muscle tone &amp;ndash; forces arterial wall muscle to relax, increasing blood flow, especially in micro arteries; lack of insulin reduces flow by allowing these muscles to contract.

==Regulatory action on blood glucose==
Despite long intervals between meals or the occasional consumption of meals with a substantial [[carbohydrate]] load (e.g., half a [[birthday cake]] or a bag of [[potato chip]]s), human [[blood glucose]] levels normally remain within a narrow range. In most humans this varies from about 70 mg/dl to perhaps 110 mg/dl (3.9 to 6.1 [[mmol]]/litre) except shortly after eating when the blood glucose level rises temporarily. In a healthy adult male of 75 [[kilogram|kg]] with a [[blood]] volume of 5 [[litre]], a blood glucose level of 100 mg/dl or 5.5 mmol/l corresponds to about 5 g (1/5 ounce) of glucose in the blood and approximately 45 g (1 1/2 ounces) in the total [[body water]] (which obviously includes more than merely blood and will be usually about 60% of the total [[body weight]] in men). This [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] effect is the result of many factors, of which hormone regulation is the most important.

There are two groups of mutually antagonistic metabolic hormones affecting blood glucose levels:
* catabolic hormones (such as [[glucagon]], [[growth hormone]], and [[catecholamines]]), which increase blood glucose
* and one anabolic hormone (insulin), which decreases blood glucose

Mechanisms which restore satisfactory blood glucose levels after [[hypoglycemia]] must bcellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; style=&quot;margin:0.5em;&quot;

The '''Ivy League''' [[athletic conference]], founded in 1954, consists of eight private [[university|institutions of higher education]] located in the eastern [[United States]]. The term, with its connotations of academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and a certain amount of [[academic elitism]], dates back to at least 1935{{ref|early_usage}}.

On [[December 3]], [[1937]], the first major effort to formally organize the league was made by editors of seven student-run dailies at universities in the Eastern United States.  They made a concerted effort for &quot;the formation of an Ivy League&quot; by simultaneously running an editorial, entitled &quot;Now Is the Time&quot;, after having held one-month-long discussions about the proposal{{ref|student_effort_to_organize}}.

All of the Ivy League institutions share some general characteristics: They are among the most prestigious and selective schools in the [[United States|U.S.]], they consistently place close to the top of [[college and university rankings]]; they rank within the top one percent of the world's academic institutions in terms of financial endowment; they attract top-tier students and faculty; and they have relatively small undergraduate populations, ranging between 4,078 for [[Dartmouth College]] and 13,700 for [[Cornell University]] and modestly sized graduate  student populations, ranging between 1,666 for Dartmouth and 14,692 for [[Columbia University|Columbia]]. Seven of the eight schools ([[Cornell University]] being the exception) were founded during America's colonial period. Ivy League institutions, therefore, account for seven of the [[Colonial colleges|nine colleges]] chartered before the American Revolution. The Ivies also are all located in the [[U.S. Northeast|Northeast]] region of the [[United States]].  Notably, the Ivies also prohibit the offering of athletic scholarships to students in most cases; this ban differentiates Ivy teams from those of schools that permit students to receive scholarships to attend or to join a team.

The Ivy League institutions are [[private school|privately]] owned and controlled.  Although many of them receive funding from the federal or state governments to pursue research, only [[Cornell University|Cornell]] has state-supported academic units, termed [[statutory college]]s, that are an integral part of the institution. Several other prestigous American instituitons are considered to be of Ivy League caliber including [[Stanford University]], [[Duke University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Caltech]], and [[Rice University]], among others.

== Terminology ==
Named after the [[ivy]] plants that traditionally cover their historic buildings, the term Ivy League was first coined informally to refer to these institutions of [[higher education]] which compete in both [[scholastics]] and [[sport]]s. Formally, it also refers to the association of these schools in [[NCAA]] [[Division I]] [[College Athletic Conference|athletic]] competition. The Ivy League universities are often simply called the '''Ivies''' or, affectionately, the '''Ancient Eight'''.

Some attribute the name to the Roman numerals for four (IV), asserting that there was such a sports league originally with four members. The ''Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins'' helped to perpetuate this belief.  The supposed &quot;IV League&quot; was formed over a century ago and consisted of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and a 4th school that varies depending on who is telling the story.  [http://www.chipublib.org/008subject/005genref/faqiv.html]

[http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/2002/101702/askbenny.html]

The term &quot;Ivy League&quot; refers strictly to the original eight universities. However, the prestige associated with the Ivy League has given rise to associative terms meant to imply perceived preeminence within other various realms of American higher education: &quot;[[Jesuit Ivy]]&quot;, &quot;[[Little Ivies]]&quot;, &quot;[[Public Ivies]]&quot;, etc. These terms are strictly [[colloquial]] and have no relation to the original eight schools.

==History==    
The Ivies and their founders share a common heritage.   In England, dissident scholars from the [[University of Oxford]] founded the [[University of Cambridge]].  A University of Cambridge alumnus, [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]],  bequeathed in his will a large donation to New College, which became Harvard University.  Ten alumni of Harvard founded Yale, and other Harvard alumni, such as minister [[Increase Mather]] and his son [[Cotton Mather]],  nurtured its development.  Alumni of Yale founded (or co-founded) other future Ivy League institutions:  Princeton University by [[Jonathan Dickinson (of New Jersey)|Jonathan Dickinson]] ,  Dartmouth College by [[Eleazar Wheelock]], and Cornell University by [[Andrew Dickson White]].  [[James Manning]], an alumnus from Princeton, co-founded Brown University. Clergymen of an [[Episcopal]]ian church in New York City became alarmed by the [[Presbyterian]] founding of Princeton University (then known as the ''College of New Jersey'') [http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/kingsv1/biosketches.htm].  They established their own &quot;rival&quot; institution, ''King's College'' (Columbia University), and elected as its first president a Yale alumnus named [[Samuel Johnson (1696-1772)|Samuel Johnson]], who also served as the sole faculty member in the college's early days.  When ''King's College'' was renamed to ''Columbia College'' in [[1784]], Johnson's son  [[William Samuel Johnson]], also a  Yale alumnus,  became its president.   After the University of Pennsylvania opened, its founder  [[Benjamin Franklin]] received [[honorary degree]]s from Harvard and Yale in [[1753]] and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford in [[1762]] [http://www.gophila.com/Go/PressRoom/pressreleases/ben300/Resume_Ben_Franklin_Fact_Sheet.aspx].  

The Ivies have been competing in sports as long as intercollegiate sports have existed in the United States.  Boat clubs from Harvard and Yale met in the first sporting event held between students of two U.S. colleges on [[Lake Winnipesaukee]], [[New Hampshire]], in [[1852]].  As an informal [[American football|football]] league, the Ivy League dates from [[1900]] when [[Yale University|Yale]] took the conference championship with a 5-0 record. For many years Army (the [[United States Military Academy]]), Navy (the [[United States Naval Academy]]), and to a lesser extent [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] were considered members, but dropped out shortly before formal organization. For instance, Army traditionally had a rivalry with Yale, and Rutgers had rivalries with Princeton and Columbia, which continue today in sports other than [[football]].

Before the formal formation of the Ivy League, there was an &quot;unwritten and unspoken agreement among certain Eastern colleges on athletic relations&quot;.  In [[1935]], [[The Associated Press]] reported on an example of collaboration between the schools:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''the athletic authorities of the so-called &quot;Ivy League&quot; are considering drastic measures to curb the increasing tendency toward riotous attacks on goal posts and other encroachments by spectators on playing fields.{{ref|early_cooperation}}''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite such collaboration, the universities did not seem to consider the formation of the league as imminent.  [[Romeyn Berry]], Cornell's director of intercollegiate relations, reported the situation in January [[1936]] as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''I can say with certainty that in the last five years — and markedly in the last three months — there has been a strong drift among the eight or ten universities of the East which see a good deal of one another in sport toward a closer bond of confidence and cooperation and toward the formation of a common front against the threat of a breakdown in the ideals of amateur sport in the interests of supposed expediency.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Please do not regard that statement as implying the organization of an Eastern conference or even a poetic &quot;Ivy League.&quot;  That sort of thing does not seem to be in the cards at the moment.''{{ref|unspoken_agreement}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within a year of this statement, on [[December 3]], [[1936]], the idea of an Ivy League gained enough traction among the undergraduate bodies of the universities that the ''[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]'', ''[[The Cornell Daily Sun]]'', ''[[The Dartmouth]]'', ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', ''[[The Daily Pennsylvanian]]'', ''[[The Daily Princetonian]]'' and the ''[[Yale Daily News]]'' would simultaneously run an editorial encouraging the seven universities to form the league in an effort to preserve the ideals of athletics.  Part of the editorial read as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The Ivy League exists already in the minds of a good many of those connected with football, and we fail to see why the seven schools concerned should be satisfied to let it exist as a purely nebulous entity where there are so many practical benefits which would be possible under definite organized association.  The seven colleges involved fall naturally together by reason of their common interests and similar general standards and by dint of their established national reputation they are in a particularly advantageous position to assume leadership for the preservation of the ideals of intercollegiate athletics.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The proposal did not succeed — on [[January 11]], [[1937]], the athletic authorities at the schools rejected the &quot;possibility of a heptagonal league in football such as these institutions maintain in basketball, baseball and track&quot;. However, they noted that the league &quot;has such promising possibilities that it may not be dismissed and must be the subject of further consideration&quot;.{{ref|ivy_proposal_rejected}}

In [[1945]] the presidents of the eight schools signed the first '''Ivy Group Agreement''', which set academic, financial, and athletic standards for the [[American football|football]] teams. The principles established reiterated those put forward in the Harvard-Yale-Princeton Presidents' Agreement of [[1916]].

In [[1954]], the date generally accepted as the birth of the Ivy League, the presidents extended the Ivy Group Agreement to all intercollegiate sports. Competition began with the [[1956]] season.

As late as the [[1960s]] many of the Ivy League universities' undergraduate programs remained open only to men, with Cornell the only one to have been coeducational from its founding (1865) and Columbia being the last (1983) to become [[coeducation]]al.  Before they became coeducational, many of the Ivy schools maintained extensive social ties with nearby [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] [[women's college]]s, including weekend visits, dances and parties inviting Ivy and Seven Sisters students to mingle.  This was the case not only at [[Barnard College]] and [[Radcliffe College]], which were situated very near to Columbia and Harvard, but at more distant institutions as well.  The movie ''[[Animal House]]'' includes a satiric version of the formerly common visits by Dartmouth men to Massachusetts to meet [[Smith College|Smith]] and [[Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke]] women, a drive of more than two hours.  Some sources suggest that the Seven Sisters group was so named as a parallel to the Ivy League. [http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/PLLI/webreprt.html]

==Reputation==
All Ivy League schools are known for their highly selective undergraduate programs, and acceptance rates now range from 9.1% for Harvard to 26.1% for Cornell. 

In most [[college and university rankings]], all or almost all of the Ivy League schools rank in the top tier.  The ranking of the schools is greatly dependent on what each survey places the most weight, such as average class size, volume of research, and faculty accolades.

==Endowments==
===Total Endowment Wealth===
The Ivy League schools are among the wealthiest private universities in the U.S., a status commensurate with their ages and long-standing relationships with the highest echelons of American society. All of the Ivy League schools have [[financial endowment]]s over $1 billion.[http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/business/personal_finance/7774843.htm] Harvard, with a $25.5 billion endowment (as of [[2005]]), is the wealthiest university in the world.[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=503347] Yale, with an endowment size of $15.2 billion (2005 value), is the second-wealthiest, and Princeton, with $11.2 billion, is fifth. Next within the Ivy League comes Columbia with $5.2 billion, Penn with $4.4 billion, Cornell with $3.8 billion, Dartmouth with $2.7 billion, and Brown with $2.0 billion. 

For comparison purposes, other elite private American universities' endowments are: Stanford ($12.4 billion), MIT ($6.7 billion), Emory ($4.4 billion) and University of Chicago ($4.1 billion).  Internationally, most other elite schools are publicly owned and financed institutions (University of Tokyo, the French [[Grandes écoles]]). In Britain, Oxford and Cambridge universities have endowments of approximately $6.0 billion and $4.0 billion respectively.

===Per Capita Endowment===
Princeton, the wealthiest institution in the country on a per capita basis, has a per-student endowment of $1.64 million, followed by Yale with $1.34 million, Harvard with $1.29 million, Dartmouth with $470,000, Brown with $263,000, Columbia with $218,000, Penn with $189,000, and Cornell with $187,000.

==Land ownership==
''(In alphabetical order)''

*Brown owns 143 acres (0.6 km&amp;sup2;) in urban Providence and the 375 acre (1.5 km&amp;sup2;) Mount Hope Grant in Bristol.
*Columbia owns over 82 acres (0.33 km&amp;sup2;) in Manhattan, which consists of the 36 acre (0.14 km&amp;sup2;) campus in Morningside Heights, the 26 acre (0.1 km&amp;sup2;) Baker Field athletic complex, and a 20 acre (0.09 km&amp;sup2;) health sciences campus, as well as numerous individual buildings and properties.  It is notably among the largest private landowners in New York City, third after the city itself and the [[Catholic Church]]. Columbia also operates the 157 acre (0.64 km&amp;sup2;) [[Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory]] in the [[New York Palisades]], and the 500 acre [[Harriman Estate]] (&quot;Arden House&quot;) in a northern suburb of New York City, [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]]. 
*Cornell has the largest campus in the Ivy League with 745 acres (3 km&amp;sup2;) of property in [[Upstate New York]]. 
*Dartmouth, the largest Ivy landowner overall, owns 265 acres (1.1 km&amp;sup2;) on its main campus in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], and over 31,000 acres (109&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2;)[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~doc/secondcollegegrant/] in the rest of New Hampshire, making it the largest private New Hampshire landowner as well.
*Harvard owns nearly 571 acres (2.3 km&amp;sup2;) in an urban setting (220 in Cambridge[http://thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=254361] and 352 directly across the river in Boston[http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/daily/2005/10/24-allstonfaq.html]) as well as holding a 1000-year lease (ending in 2882) on the 265 acres of the [[Arnold Arboretum]] also in Boston[http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/aboutus/history.html]. 
*Princeton owns 600 acres (2.4 km&amp;sup2;) in a suburban environment. 
*The University of Pennsylvania has a core campus of 269 acres (1.1 km&amp;sup2;), a 92 acre arboretum in northwestern Philadelphia and a 690 acre veterinary research complex in suburban Philadelphia. 
*Yale has a core campus of 260 acres (1.1 km&amp;sup2;) in an urban setting, 515 acres in a nature preserve and golf course, 100 acres in athletic fields, and 30 acres in off-campus residential land

==Cooperation==
Seven of the eight schools (Harvard excluded) participate in the Borrow Direct [[interlibrary loan]] program, making a total of 40 million items available to participants with a waiting period of four working days.  This ILL program is not affiliated with the formal Ivy arrangement.

==Athletics &amp; competition==
Ivy champions are crowned in 33 men's and women's sports. In some sports, Ivy teams actually compete as members of another league, the Ivy championship being decided by isolating the members' records in play against each other. (For example, the six league members who participate in [[ice hockey]] do so as members of the [[ECAC Hockey League]]; but an Ivy champion is extrapolated each year.)  Unlike all other Division I [[basketball]] conferences, the Ivy League has no tournament for the league title; the school with the best conference record represents the conference in the Division I NCAA Basketball Tournament (with a playoff in the case of a tie).

On average, each Ivy school has more than 35 varsity teams. All eight are in the top 20 for number of sports offered for both men and women among Division I schools. In some sports, notably baseball and tennis, the Ivy League teams also frequently compete against [[United States Military Academy|Army]] and [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]].

Harvard and Yale are celebrated [[American football|football]] and [[sport rowing|crew]] rivals.  Penn and Cornell are football rivals.  Columbia and Princeton have a rivalry that goes back to the fourth college football game ever played.  Princeton and Penn are mainly basketball rivals.  Cornell and Harvard are hockey rivals.  Unlike most Division I athletic conferences, the Ivy League prohibits the granting of athletic scholarships; all scholarships awarded are need-based ([[financial aid]]) [http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/whatisivy/index.asp]. Since there is no outright athletic scholarship program, the schools are typically less competitive in football and basketball, even when compared to universities with comparably rigorous academic standards.

In the time before recruiting for college sports became dominated by those offering athletic scholarships, the Ivy League was successful in many sports relative to other universities in the country. In particular, Princeton won 24 recognized national championships in [[college football]], and Yale won 19. Both of these totals are considerably higher than those of other historically strong programs such as [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], which has won 12, and [[University of Southern California|USC]], which has won 10. Of course, Ivy League schools never win national championships anymore.Yale, who holds the record for most national football championships, hasn't won a national championship in decades.  Yale, whose coach [[Walter Camp]] was the &quot;Father of American Football,&quot; held on to its place as the all-time wins leader in college football throughout the entire [[20th century]], but was finally passed by [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] on [[November 10]], [[2001]].

Although no longer as successful nationally as they once were in many of the more popular college sports, the Ivy League is still competitive in others. One such example is [[college rowing (United States)|rowing]]. All of the Ivies have historically been among the top crews in the nation, and most continue to be so today.  (Other historical top crews include [[University of California, Berkeley|Cal]], [[University of Washington|Washington]],[[University of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]] and [[Naval Academy|Navy]]). Most recently, on the men's side, Harvard won the [[Intercollegiate Rowing Association]] Championships the last three years in a row (2003, 2004, 2005), and on the women's side, Harvard and Brown won the 2003 and 2004 [[NCAA Rowing Championships]], respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{mergeto|Differential psychology}}
'''Individual differences psychology''' studies the ways in which individual people differ in their behavior. This is distinguished from other aspects of [[psychology]] in that although psychology is ostensibly a study of individuals, modern psychologists invariably study [[groups]]. For example, in evaluating the effectiveness of a new therapy, the mean performance of the therapy in one [[treatment group|group]] might be compared to the mean effectiveness of a [[placebo]] (or a well-known therapy) in a second, [[control group]]. In this context, differences between individuals in their reaction to the experimental and control manipulations are actually treated as errors rather than as interesting phenomena to study. This is because [[psychology|psychological]] research depends upon statistical controls that are only defined upon groups of people. Individual difference psychologists usually express their interest in individuals while studying groups by seeking dimensions shared by all individuals but upon which individuals differ.  Individual differences typically includes the study of [[intelligence (trait)]] and [[IQ]] and the study of [[personality]].

Individual differences of the [[Emotion|emotional]] type were described by [[Knight Dunlap]], in ''Habits: Their Making and Unmaking'' (1932), pp 233-234:

* The timid person has emotions of embarrassment, dismay, apprehension or fear in situations where normal persons show little emotional effect, or where quite different emotions would be more appropriate.
* An irritable person may &quot;boil over&quot; in an offensive way or express himself snappishly under stimulation which should be only mildly annoying. On the other hand, he may, for politic reasons, somewhat restrain his outward expressions, but still feel the irritation he does not flagrantly display. The bad-tempered person, however, seldom restrains his expressions of irritation completely.
* Another type of emotionally maladjusted individual is popularly described as &quot;soft.&quot; His sympathy is too easily aroused, and he is an easy prey for clever swindlers. He pities not merely the unfortunate person, but also the deliberate miscreant, and so is an impediment to the maintenance of social order and justice. At the other extreme is the &quot;hard-boiled&quot; man, who is callous to the suffering and misfortune of others and who spares the feelings of no one.
* Self-pity, unlike the emotional defects above described, is not an exaggeration of a normal habit, but is a trait which is undesirable throughout.... However deserving a man may be of pity from others, he cannot afford to pity himself. The neurotic, from whatever complex of disadvantageous traits he may suffer, is especially prone to self-pity, which confirms and strengthens his neurosis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Industrial and organizational psychology''' (or '''I/O psychology''') is also known as '''occupational psychology''' (in the [[United Kingdom]]) and '''work psychology''' (from the German, ''Arbeitpsychologie'').

Industrial and organizational psychology is the study of the behavior of people in the workplace.  Industrial and organizational psychology attempts to apply psychological results and methods to aid workers and organizations.

Industrial and organizational psychologists use [[psychological testing]] to measure the knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics of people for a variety of employment-related purposes, such as selection for hiring or promotion, training and development, or measuring employee satisfaction.  Historically, the [[job analysis]] has been the traditional means by which the essential characteristics associated with any particular position are identified. A thorough job analysis takes time, resources and money but its benefits tend to out weigh the costs, especially when the position is of great importance, such as an executive position in a major corporation.

It is a fairly diverse field incorporating aspects of fields such as [[clinical psychology]], social psychology, and psychometrics as well as broader social studies such as [[organizational theory]], [[law]], and gender issues.  

Many industrial and organizational psychologists specialize in aspects (e.g., psychometrics; time and motion studies; labor law; personnel selection; training) aspects (e.g., leadership selection, coaching and development; organizational design and change).  Some I/O psychologists are academic (working in both business and psychology departments) or non-academic researchers, while many others are engaged in practice, holding positions such as: 

* executive coach
* diversity consultant
* legislative compliance officer
* labor relations specialist
* human resources specialist
* process improvement consultant
* manager of selection and training.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''International Council of Unitarians and Universalists''' (ICUU) is a world council bringing together [[Unitarian]]s, [[Universalist]]s and [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalists]]. The original initiative for its establishment was contained in a resolution of the [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches]] of the [[United Kingdom]] in 1987. This led to the establishment of the &quot;Advocates for the Establishment of an International Organization of Unitarians&quot; (AEIOU), which worked towards the establishment of the council. Rev. [[David Usher (minister)|David Usher]], a British Unitarian minister of Australian origin, proposed the 1987 resolution. However, the General Assembly resolution provided no funding.

The [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] (UUA) became particularly interested in the establishment of a council when it had to deal with an increasing number of applications for membership from congregations outside [[North America]]. It had already granted membership to congregations in [[Adelaide]], [[Auckland, New Zealand|Auckland]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Pakistan]], and congregations in [[Sydney]], [[Russia]] and [[Spain]] had applied for membership. Rather than admit congregations from all over the world, the UUA hoped that they would join a world council instead. The UUA thus became willing to provide funding for the council's establishment.

As a result, the council was finally established at a meeting in [[Essex, Massachusetts]] on [[March 23|March 23-26]], [[1995]]. Rev. David Usher became the ICUU's first President.

The size of the member organizations varies widely. Some member groups have only a few hundred members; while the largest, the Unitarian Universalist Association, has over 200,000 members and is larger than all the other member groups put together.

In [[computing]], the '''Itanium''' is an [[IA-64]] [[microprocessor]] developed jointly by [[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[Intel]].

==Merced==

[[Image:Itanium.png|thumb|The Intel Itanium processor.]]
HP and Intel first collaborated on chip for servers and workstations in 1989. HP needed a next generation replacement for its successful [[PA-RISC]] line of servers and workstations, and wanted to tap Intel's volume and expertise in chip design and manufacturing.

It would use [[Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing]] where the compiler would line up  instructions for parallel execution. Features were added to ensure compatibility with ''both'' Intel [[X86|x86]] and HP applications. It was expected to dominate servers, workstations, and perhaps even desktops, bumping the ubiquitous x86 architecture. Importantly, it was not expected [[AMD]] would be able to clone it.

==Software support==

[[Image:Itanium_arch.png|thumb|The Intel Itanium architecture.]]
Microsoft has ported [[Windows XP]], [[Windows 2000]], and [[Windows Server 2003]] to Itanium. 
Microsoft server applications include [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server]], Operations Manager, CRM Server, [[Internet Information Services|IIS]], [[Microsoft Visual Studio|Visual Studio]], and the [[.NET Framework]]. The decision was made in recent years to not include support for client applications or client operating systems (such as Windows XP) for the Itanium, because the market demand is too small to justify the porting and support costs.

Microsoft has announced support for Itanium on its upcoming [[Windows Server &quot;Longhorn&quot;|Longhorn Server]] operating system. It is being positioned as the top end processor for the most demanding workloads such as [[database]] servers, [[operations management]], and [[customer relationship management]].

In June 2003 [[OpenVMS]] was added to the line up of operating systems able to run on these processors.

The HP [[Tandem Computers|NonStop]] operating system also runs on Itanium. NonStop is used in many of the world's trading and financial markets.

The [[Linux kernel]] and multiple [[Linux distributions|GNU/Linux distributions]] run on Itanium, such as [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]], [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server]], [[Debian]], and the version [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] offers on their [[Altix]] machines. In Jan 2002, [http://www.gelato.org Gelato.org], a community for the propagation of Linux on Itanium was created.

[[FreeBSD]] also runs on Itanium systems.

[[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] was developing a port of [[Solaris Operating Environment|Solaris]] to the Itanium processor, but that port was never released.

==Market trends==

The following companies announced a new &quot;Itanium Alliance&quot; in September 2005 to promote hardware and software development for the chip:
Hewlett-Packard, Hitachi, Fujitsu, NEC, Unisys, Bull, Silicon Graphics, Microsoft, Oracle, Red Hat, Novell, BEA Systems, SAP, SAS, and Intel. 
[http://news.com.com/Itanium+alliance+backed+by+major+tech+companies/2100-1006_3-5882978.html]

[[Dell]] and [[IBM]] have dropped the chip from their product lines.[http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1859669,00.asp][http://news.com.com/IBM+server+design+drops+Itanium+support/2100-1006_3-5589603.html]  

Total revenue tripled for the Itanium from 2003-2004 and reached $1.4 billion in 2004.[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/02/28/itanium_04_sales/]

[[Intel]] has delayed the dual-core Montecito version of Itanium for 3 months.[http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/10/24/HNintelalters_1.html?PROCESSORS]

Customer spending on Itanium servers hit $2.4 billion in 2005.[http://news.com.com/Analyst+firm+offers+rosy+view+of+Itanium/2100-1006_3-6038932.html]

==Technical criticism==

The first version, code named '''Merced''', shipped in June [[2001]].  Manufactured in a 180 [[nanometre|nm]] process, it was offered at speeds of 733 and 800 [[megahertz|MHz]], with a choice of 2 [[megabyte|MB]] or 4 MB off-die L3 [[CPU cache|cache]].  Prices ranged from US$1200 to over US$4000.  

However, performance was disappointing. In IA-64 mode, it performed only slightly better than an equivalently clocked x86 design, and when running legacy x86 code, performance was extremely poor, about 1/8th that of a similarly clocked x86 processor. Software emulation would have been faster.

The main (though by no means only) structural design flaw with the Itanium was the high latency of its level three cache. Intel's engineers had evidently been hoping that the amount of bandwidth available would offset this, but the latency was so high that it actually slowed the cache, to the point where it was not significantly faster than the main memory interface. With the faster first and second-level caches set relatively small (32KB and 96KB respectively), this further increased the load on the main system bus. 

Compounding the performance impact of the lack of available cache bandwidth was the fact IA-64 code has a larger footprint than x86 code. So the amount of instructions that could be contained in the cache was in fact even smaller than the sizes alone would suggest, all of which might have been mitigated had Itanium been designed around a fast processor bus. However, at a mere 266MHz it was only equal to consumer [[Athlon]]s of the period, and a full 33% slower than first generation [[Pentium 4]]s. Again, this was worse than it would appear, due to the fact that Itaniums were designed to be used in systems with several processors. Itanium clock speeds were also disappointing, relative to the [[gigahertz|GHz]] speeds being delivered by the Athlon architecture of the period. 

Overall, it is generally believed that the technical specifications indicate an original [[1998]]&amp;ndash;[[1999|99]] target launch date. But the repeated and lengthy project delays, effectively meant the processor was out of date before it had even begun shipping. Hence, the Itanium was not a competitive product when launched, although it would have been two years earlier.

It was succeeded by the [[Itanium 2]].

==Itanic nickname==

'''Itanic''' is a derisive nickname promulgated by the often-satiric technology publication [[The Register]]. It is a reference to the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']], a famous [[ocean liner]] which sank in [[1912]]. The IA-64 architecture is considered by some to be a [[white elephant]], which cost Intel and partner [[Hewlett-Packard]] many billions of dollars while failing to achieve expected sales in the originally projected timeframe.

==Competition==

Sales of IA-64 processors have most recently been hampered by competition from [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]]'s [[AMD64]] architecture on the low end, leading to Intel releasing the largely compatible [[EM64T]] architecture. [[International Business Machines|IBM]]'s [[IBM POWER|POWER]] architecture competes to a lesser extent at the high end. Some early IA-64 vendors, such as [[Dell Computer|Dell]] and IBM have dropped or drastically scaled back support for the architecture, Dell choosing AMD64-compatible processors in line with their high-volume business model, while IBM continues to develop servers built on its own POWER architecture.

Microsoft has decided not to make further releases of its consumer operating systems for Itanium, concentrating only on x86-64 (AMD64, EM64T).

'''Infinity''' refers to several distinct concepts which arise in [[theology]], [[philosophy]], [[mathematics]] and everyday life. Popular or colloquial usage of the term often does not accord with its more technical meanings. The word '''infinity''' comes from the [[Latin]] ''infinitas'', &quot;unboundedness&quot;.

In [[theology]], for example in the work of [[List of
